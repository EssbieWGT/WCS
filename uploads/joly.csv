That same day, The Leader posted a story on their Facebook about Senedd (The Welsh Parliament) politicians getting a £12,000 pay increase. This received a meagre 84 comments of outrage in comparison.

How strange?

'Who are the real scroungers?'

My 40-year-old friend, whom I won't name, has been on Universal Credit for three months. Whilst still actively looking for work, he has been struggling financially.

He lives near Chester Zoo, is a Flintshire local, and described the reaction as 'mental'.

""I'm not sure what the problem is?"" he said.

""If they're online complaining about less fortunate kids going to the zoo, they've got too much time on their hands. Access to places like Chester Zoo isn’t just leisure; it’s educational, cultural, and supports children’s development.

""UC often leaves families with very little disposable income after rent and bills. A day out at the zoo could be impossible without support.""

Of his own experiences on Universal Credit, he told me: ""The main thing is, as a person living on my bill, I get just under £720 a month, and my rent is £625. I have to go to regular meetings and demonstrate that I'm applying for jobs.

""With papers like The Daily Mail avoiding millions of tax a year and not paying their share, it's very rich how they attack people. Who are the real scroungers?

""Private schools enjoy tax‑funded privileges far greater than any UC claimant. Why are they paying less tax than public schools?""

Universal Credit myths

Many of the comments on the Facebook post seemed to convey the same general sentiment here and there.

Let's take a closer look at them.

“People on benefits are unemployed"" No, over 40% of Universal Credit claimants are in work.

""People choose to be on benefits"" No, as my friend demonstrated, Universal Credit is well below the poverty line; who'd want to be on that?

""Claiming benefits is easy"" No, the PIP or ESA process is an extremely lengthy one. A lot of people who should have a right to the benefit are often rejected.

""People need to budget better"" No, despite what 50p Lee (Anderson) claims, the cost of living has shot up by 22% in the last four years. Making it extremely hard for people in general to get by, let alone people on benefits.

The bean soup theory truly is a depressing reality. ""We're letting kids in for £1, ""BUT WHAT ABOUT ME I'M 78!""

Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.64 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for U.S. Bancorp has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.

Comparing U.S. Bancorp's Short Interest Against Its Peers

Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro, U.S. Bancorp's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 0.80%, which means the company has more short interest than most of its peers.

With a broad footprint in clinical and translational labs, Thermo Fisher is well-positioned to support the move toward integrated DNA–RNA–protein analysis, in which SMRT sequencing provides high-fidelity, long-read genomes. At the same time, Thermo’s tools handle complementary assays and routine diagnostics.

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (US) contributes to the SMRT sequencing market primarily as an upstream and QC partner, offering high-precision LC, GC, electrophoresis, and Bioanalyzer/Fragment Analyzer platforms widely used for SMRT library quality control and sizing. Its target-enrichment kits, automation solutions, and analytical instruments help researchers optimize sample quality and focus on difficult genomic regions before running long-read SMRT experiments. By focusing on robust front-end prep, method development, and data validation, Agilent enables smoother adoption of SMRT workflows in research and clinical labs that require reliable, audit-ready results.

Market Ranking

The single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing market is characterized by significant consolidation.

Apps are not simple plugins; they bring context and action into conversations, enabling tasks like creating playlists, ordering groceries or browsing real-estate listings without switching platforms.

This launch comes after a broader rollout of the ChatGPT Apps SDK earlier in 2025, which invited developers to build and test “chat-native” applications that respond to natural language and engage users within the conversational flow, extending ChatGPT’s role from answering queries to facilitating workflows, as reported by PYMNTS.

Developer Details

At the heart of the app store is the OpenAI Apps SDK, a developer toolkit that builds on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and allows external service providers to embed structured logic and interfaces into ChatGPT itself. Developers can now design applications that react contextually to user prompts, display interactive elements, and operate within a unified AI experience instead of siloed environments.

Verified developers can submit apps for review through the OpenAI Developer Platform. Submitted applications undergo a quality and safety review process; those that meet the guidelines can be published in the App Directory and become discoverable to the global ChatGPT user base.

OpenAI has also published detailed app submission guidelines, example apps and an open-sourced UI library to assist developers in building experiences that are intuitive within chat.

Apps can be triggered during conversations when users call them by name or select them through the tools interface. OpenAI is experimenting with ways to surface contextually relevant apps based on conversational signals like intent, usage patterns and user preferences.

While developers can currently link out from apps to complete transactions on external sites or native mobile applications, OpenAI is exploring new monetization methods over time, including the sale of digital goods and in-app commerce features, though specifics remain under development.

User Experience and Strategic Implications

For users, the ChatGPT app store means access to specialized tools and services without downloading standalone software. Instead of switching between native mobile apps or browser tabs, users can perform tasks like listening to curated playlists, ordering food or planning travel, all within the same chat interface.

This “AI-centric” user experience reduces friction and reimagines digital task flow around conversational intent. According to PYMNTS Intelligence data, nearly one-third of surveyed consumers say they would allow an AI agent to help with everyday planning and organization.

According to the report, a model said Zara asked for approval before using AI to digitally show them wearing different outfits.
As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder.","Zara is now using AI to digitally alter model images, showcasing new outfits without costly reshoots. This move, mirrored by H&M and Zalando, aims for faster visual production. While brands assure AI complements human roles and respects model consent and pay, concerns linger about potential job displacement for creatives.

Zara has quietly joined the growing list of fashion brands experimenting with artificial intelligence, and it’s already stirring conversation. The fast-fashion giant is now using AI to tweak images of real models, showing them in different outfits without having to reshoot everything again and again. The goal is pretty straightforward: faster visuals, fewer shoots, and quicker rollouts. But it also signals a bigger change in how fashion imagery is being made. Zara isn’t alone in this. Earlier this year, H&M revealed it had created AI-generated versions of models for its marketing work, and Zalando has been using similar tools to speed up campaign production. Together, these moves show how fashion brands are turning to tech to keep up with the industry’s relentless pace. Zara’s parent company, Inditex, has been quick to clarify that AI isn’t here to replace humans. “We are using artificial intelligence only to complement our existing processes,” a company spokesperson said. They added that models are kept in the loop, their consent is taken before any AI edits are made, and payments follow industry standards. The details first came out through a report by London-based outlet CityAM. According to the report, a model said Zara asked for approval before using AI to digitally show them wearing different outfits. The model also shared that they were paid the same amount they would have earned if they had travelled for another shoot, which suggests brands are trying to tread carefully, at least for now. H&M and Zalando have made similar statements, saying AI is meant to support creative teams, not replace them. Photographers, stylists, makeup artists, and production crews are still part of the process, even if technology helps brands work faster and cut costs behind the scenes. What makes Zara’s move especially interesting is that Inditex chair Marta Ortega is known to be a big supporter of fashion photography. The daughter of Zara founder Amancio Ortega has often spoken about her love for the art form. Since 2021, her MOP Foundation gallery in A Coruña, the Spanish city where Zara began, has hosted exhibitions celebrating legendary photographers. Right now, the gallery is showing Annie Leibovitz’s work, and previous exhibitions have highlighted names like Steven Meisel, a long-time Zara collaborator, and Helmut Newton. At the same time, Ortega has been pushing Zara towards a more premium feel, shutting down smaller stores and focusing on larger, more polished flagship spaces. Still, not everyone is convinced this AI shift is harmless. Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, has warned that wider use of AI could reduce how often photographers, models, and production teams are hired. Her concern is that this won’t just affect big names in the industry, but also young creatives trying to get their first break. As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder. And for now, the industry is still figuring out where exactly the line should be drawn.

Coty stated it sees “strong potential” for additional cash proceeds, based on Wella’s “strong recent and expected performance”, as well as current market valuations.

The French beauty giant’s final 25.8% stake in the professional hair care brand has been divested to KKR’s managed capital accounts and investment affiliates.

Under the terms of the transaction, Coty will receive an upfront cash consideration of US$750m.

This also includes 45% of any proceeds from a further sale or an initial public offering (IPO) of the business, after KKR’s preferred return has been met.

Coty stated it sees “strong potential” for additional cash proceeds, based on Wella’s “strong recent and expected performance”, as well as current market valuations.

The stake divestment rounds off Coty’s optimisation programme, initiated in 2020 to simplify its portfolio and operations, while also realising the full value of its Wella business.

“This transaction marks a pivotal milestone for Coty – both in our transformation and in our long running deleveraging commitment,” said Laurent Mercier, Coty’s CFO.

“Our strategic partnership with KKR has proven highly value accretive.

“We have benefited from Wella’s strong growth by progressively monetising our stake, allowing us to strengthen Coty’s financial foundations year after year.”

Coty intends to use the majority of the Wella upfront cash proceeds related to this transaction to pay down its short-term and long-term debt.

American multinational investment bank Citi is serving as financial advisor to Coty.

Mercier added: “Completing this transaction exactly in line with our original target to fully divest Wella by the end of CY25 underscores our focus on delivering on our financial commitments and crystallising value from non-core assets, all while sharpening our strategic focus.”

OpenAI entered ""code red"" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3.
Since OpenAI entered ""code red,"" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.
The state of ""code red"" has also been a precedent for other tech companies.
In 2022, Google declared an internal ""code red"" after ChatGPT's debut.","""Code red"" isn't a one-off at OpenAI.

CEO Sam Altman said on an episode of the ""Big Technology Podcast"" published Thursday that the company has entered emergency mode multiple times in response to competitive threats — and expects to continue doing so as rivals close in.

""It's good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges,"" Altman said.

""My guess is we'll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that's part of really just making sure that we win in our space,"" he added.

Altman said that OpenAI had gone ""code red"" earlier this year when China's DeepSeek emerged. DeepSeek shocked the tech industry in January when it said its AI model matches top competitors like ChatGPT's o1 at a fraction of the cost.

OpenAI entered ""code red"" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3. The model drew widespread praise after its release in November, with Google touting it as its most advanced model to date. Altman reportedly told staff in an internal Slack memo that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.

Altman said in the podcast episode that Google's Gemini 3 did not have ""the impact we were worried it might.""

""But it did — in the same way that Deepseek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,"" he added.

Since OpenAI entered ""code red,"" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.

Last week, it rolled out a more advanced AI model aimed at improving ChatGPT's performance across professional work, coding, and scientific tasks. OpenAI also unveiled a new image-generation model earlier this week.

Altman said the company will not be in code red ""that much longer.""

""Historically, these have been kind of like six- or eight-week things for us,"" he added.

The state of ""code red"" has also been a precedent for other tech companies. In 2022, Google declared an internal ""code red"" after ChatGPT's debut.

The view that emerging markets are high-risk destinations for investment has long shaped the global marketplace, keeping a disproportionate share of capital in wealthier countries.

This mismatch is increasingly untenable. Where public and private investment is scarce, jobs will not flourish — with profound implications for prosperity and security, as hundreds of millions of young workers enter the labour force over the next decade across developing countries.

Greater clarity around emerging market risks is needed not simply to change well-worn beliefs but to have a tangible impact on where capital is deployed.

There are some positive signs. Recently announced changes to the S&P Global Ratings methodology for rating multilateral lending institutions and other supranational institutions — those owned or established by the governments of two or more countries — are one of the latest signs of that trend.

The rating agency recently reviewed how it evaluates international development institutions — like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank — that lend to governments. After five months of consultations with stakeholders, it updated its methodology, resulting in improved credit ratings for these institutions. The changes specifically adjusted how S&P weighs the risks when these multilateral lenders provide loans to sovereign governments.

According to the agency, the revised methodology could unlock between $600bn and $800bn in sovereign lending by multilateral development banks to emerging markets and developing economies. This would support better infrastructure, more food security, reliable electricity and job creation at a time when it is needed most.

This decision is underpinned by data from GEMs: the Global Emerging Markets Risk Database. Developed by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation, it is the largest credit risk database of its kind.

By pooling credit risk data from multilateral development banks, GEMs offers unprecedented transparency on emerging market credit risks. In doing so, it is separating fact from perception and demonstrating that emerging markets are not nearly as risky as previously thought, especially when investing alongside MDBs.

The most recent GEMs statistics, published in October 2025, highlight that direct lending by MDBs to 167 sovereign emerging market and developing economies have shown strong loan performance over the past four decades.

Between 1984 and 2024, the annual default rate averaged less than 1 per cent, significantly lower than that observed by international credit rating agencies for sovereign lending from non-MDB lenders. And on the flipside, recovery rates on loans to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed entities averaged more than 95 per cent. The data from GEMs is also compelling when looking at MDB lending for private and public sector entities in emerging markets.

These statistics speak for themselves. The data demonstrates that evidence-based investing in emerging markets and developing economies, particularly alongside MDBs, could be win-win for everyone. And the change to S&P’s rating methodology shows the support for, and confidence in, the multilateral institutions’ ability to scale public and private finance investments in emerging markets.

Most importantly, it sets the stage for a broader shift in investment strategies that allows other key rating agencies and investors to take evidence-based reviews of their risk methodologies in favour of increased lending and potential new capital where it is needed most.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/19997689-1cb0-4d1b-90b1-61276bca4f80.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 08:01:51.484050

Booking Holdings, Expedia and Airbnb are accused of allowing money to be made from bookings on seized Palestinian land.

""We are now specifying Motorola Solutions as an excluded investment from the funds.","ASB has dropped Motorola Solutions from its investment funds, including KiwiSaver, after pressure from pro-Palestine groups.

Motorola provides telecommunications, surveillance and military technology to the Israeli military and illegal Israeli settlements.

But ethical investment platform Mindful Money says the big banks are still investing in companies that are exposed to human rights violations in Palestine.

Founder Barry Coates said it was welcome that ASB had divested from Motorola.

""At last ASB has agreed to sell their investments in Motorola Solutions, over two years after the information was disclosed on Mindful Money's website and after campaigning by Justice for Palestine, Amnesty International Aotearoa and others.

""This is welcome news.

""However, each of the big four bank-branded KiwiSaver funds still invest in companies that contribute to violations of human rights in Palestine, despite Kiwis saying they want to avoid those investments. The banks are not listening to the thousands of Kiwis who have invested in their funds.""

He said, before the divestment, ASB had 0.87 percent of its KiwiSaver growth fund in companies Mindful Money identified as problematic in the conflict with Israel including IBM, Palantir, Motorola, Booking Holdings, Airbnb and Cemex.

ANZ had 0.54 percent of its growth fund in Booking Holdings, Airbnb, Motorola, Volvo and IBM.

BNZ had 0.79 percent in Palantir, IBM, Booking Holdings, Glencore, Airbnb, Rheinmetall AG, Holcim, Volvo, Expedia, Heildelberge Materials, Cemex and Maersk.

Westpac had 0.57 percent in Booking Holdings, Caterpillar, Palantir Technologies, IBM, Holcim, and Heidelberg Materials.

Booking Holdings, Expedia and Airbnb are accused of allowing money to be made from bookings on seized Palestinian land.

""The ongoing crises in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem are affecting the lives of millions of Palestinian people. Our KiwiSaver funds should not be invested in companies that are supporting violations of their rights,"" Coates said.

Result of unbiased, ongoing review - ASB

ASB said it had spent ""significant time"" completing a review of Motorola Solutions.

""Previously, we have been able to meet with Motorola and they had engaged openly with us to answer any questions we've had,"" it said in a statement.

""In October this year, as part of our latest review, we reached out to Motorola again to discuss their inclusion on the updated UN OHCHR database, and request that they meet with us to provide an update.

""Motorola has failed to respond to this request, despite multiple follow ups. This lack of engagement and our inability to receive an update is a concern to us and one of the factors underpinning our decision to divest.

""We are now specifying Motorola Solutions as an excluded investment from the funds. This decision is the result of our unbiased and ongoing review as part of our own due diligence, and not a result of external pressure from any group or organisation, which is not new with regards to this issue.

""We condemn all violence, and as we have said previously, our position on this particular holding doesn't represent support, or otherwise, for any group or people, of any identity.""

Westpac, ANZ and BNZ have been approached for comment.

'Huge win'

""ASB's divestment from Motorola is a huge win for the fight in Aotearoa New Zealand for Palestinians to have equal human rights in their homeland,"" Justice for Palestine spokesperson Kate Stone said.

""Israel is only able to maintain its apartheid regime of systemic discrimination against Palestinians and expand its illegal settlements because of the material support of the international community. This includes investments of financial institutions like ASB and other New Zealand banks and KiwiSaver fund managers.

""Over 8500 people signed the petition calling on ASB to divest, and hundreds of customers moved their KiwiSavers, mortgages and banking services away from ASB because they support Palestinians having the same rights to freedom, justice and equality as the rest of humanity,"" Stone said.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--RhMzSKeW--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1668055945/4LIJ0NT_ASB_2_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-12-19 04:03:09.205735

Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha said it appears the BLS ""put in zero inflation in multiple categories"" when calculating housing inflation in some cities.

Ideally, by the time the press gets their hands on a new product or service, all the kinks have already been worked out.

Not so for “Claudius,” an AI-operated vending machine that Anthropic lent to The Wall Street Journal for testing in November.

The end results were hilariously disastrous. Claudius was supposed to order inventory, set prices and respond to customer requests. Instead it bought a Playstation 5 and a live betta fish, gave away items in what it referred to as an “Ultra-Capitalist Free-For-All” and spent more than twice its allotted budget.

Anthropic, for its part, considers the experiment a success, or so its reps told the Journal. These kinds of stress tests, after all, give them insight into what needs fixing.

But the question remains: Why test it with journalists, of all people?

Sure, highlighting the WSJ’s red team efforts would’ve been fun a few years ago, back when the internet was still giggling over DALL-E memes. But now that so many companies are actively trying to capitalize on this technology – and encountering similar, albeit less absurd performance issues – all publicity might not be good publicity anymore.

Put more simply, if AI agents can’t reliably buy snacks yet, then what hope do marketers have in making them work right now?

Ads vs. AIs

Personalized advertising allows tons of content to be free and accessible while enriching companies up and down the supply chain. The downside is that everybody hates it.

For example, Meta is correct to keep its focus relentlessly on improvements to its digital advertising flywheel, writes Eric Seufert at Mobile Dev Memo. His hot take is in response to a New York Times story about tensions between Meta’s AI lab team and Facebook-era leaders.

The flip side of the coin is OpenAI, which, as The Information reports, has an awkward “ChatGPT problem.” Its cutting-edge AI research team is frustrated, too, because new stakeholders within OpenAI are pushing for more monetization. The latest updates to OpenAI’s core models prioritize capability gains over monetization metrics like user retention and subscriptions.

Seufert writes that this imbalance favors Meta and Google. Their large ad businesses grow as the companies add users and improve the proficiency of their ad systems. OpenAI’s API revenues go up when its models improve – but not nearly enough to meet its revenue projections.

That shortfall must be made up by advertising revenue at some point.

All Fun And Games

Will in-game advertising ever really happen? The idea remains tantalizing yet illusive.

No online platform has a better shot at it, though, than Roblox, as Digiday reports.

The rationale for in-game ads is pretty straightforward. Engagement is through the roof. Roblox has 151 million daily active users who spend close to three hours per day on average in the app.

And Roblox wouldn’t have to saturate players with ads to see a healthy return. Snapchat’s average revenue per user, for instance, is in the $12 to $15 per year range. Less than half of that would mean an instant multibillion-dollar business line for Roblox.

On the other hand, Roblox’s user base is young – like tweens and younger. This complicates the picture, because there are extra rules governing how data can be used for targeting, which shrinks the pool of possible advertisers.

So while the potential is massive, Roblox’s path to ad billions still feels more like a pipe dream than a pay day.

However, the increased demand during this festive time often leads to longer wait times at coffee shops and drive-thrus. Despite the delays, many customers feel that the indulgence is worth their time.

On a less festive note, the coffee industry has faced significant challenges throughout the year, particularly for major players like Starbucks and Peet’s. In September, Starbucks announced plans to close hundreds of stores as part of a restructuring effort expected to cost the company $1 billion. The coffee giant revealed it would reduce its North American store count by about 1%, decreasing from 18,734 to 18,300 locations by the end of fiscal year 2025. The decision came after a thorough review of its North American portfolio, targeting underperforming stores or those that cannot meet new design standards.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol emphasized the necessity of this decision, stating that some locations did not meet the physical standards expected by customers and employees, or lacked a clear path to financial viability. In addition to store closures, the company will invest in remodeling a thousand locations at a cost of $150,000 each by 2026.

Peet’s Coffee, which operates over 250 locations in the U.S., has also experienced closures, including recent shut-downs in several California cities. However, optimism surrounds Peet’s as its parent company, JDE Peet’s, is set to be acquired by Keurig Dr Pepper in an $18 billion deal expected to finalize in the first half of 2026.

In contrast, Compass Coffee is facing dire circumstances, having recently closed its Washington, D.C. roastery amid financial distress. The coffee company has indicated potential plans to file for bankruptcy protection by the end of the year. Following a court ruling, Compass Coffee has been mandated to pay approximately $744,000 in back rent to its landlord and has not been able to cover rent since January 2025. If the company cannot negotiate a rent reduction, it may have to vacate its premises altogether.

Despite these challenges, Compass Coffee continues to operate 25 locations across Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland, although the current financial situation casts uncertainty over its future.

Born in Attica, Indiana, to the late Lee Robert and Helen Johnson, Thomas was hardworking and forever young-at-heart; with a passion for toys, coins, and automobiles. He served in the U.S. Army from 1964 to 1967, stationed overseas and reaching the rank of E-6. In Kankakee, Thomas was a longtime member and supporter of St. Patrick Church, and owner-operator of AC Forms Inc. for 35 years.

Thomas is survived by his loving wife of 56 years, Patricia (Newman) Johnson. They were married in May 1969 and built a life filled with love and laughs.

His legacy lives on through his children and their partners: Kimberly Zaccone and her partner Tom Castro, Danette Johnson and her husband Mark Switzer, Darren Johnson, Jeffery and his wife Erica (Simmons) Johnson, Samantha and her husband Kyle Johnson. The sparkle in his eyes was always brightest when he was with his grandchildren: Alyssa, Nick, Brooke, and Max Zaccone; Kylie, Jax, and Lilliann Johnson; and his great-grandchildren, Paxton and Alexander Zaccone.

Thomas devoted his life to providing for his family, offering steady support, strength, love, and humor.

As kids go, Monica Santamaria was always on the move.

“She absolutely loved swimming, volleyball, decorating and painting,” said her father, Roberto. “Her passion was contagious. She wore us out in a good way. We never saw any hints of physical problems. She was perfectly healthy.”

That all changed when Monica turned 6.

Her parents noticed her body curved to the left when she walked, and a similar curve began forming in her back. Doctors in Monica’s hometown of Managua, Nicaragua did a variety of tests and eventually diagnosed her with scoliosis, a severe and painful curvature of the spine that sometimes afflicts children, generally girls, during growth spurts.

“We had never heard of scoliosis and so the news was devastating,” Roberto remembers. “The more we learned, the more frightened we became.”

Monica experienced many symptoms: back pain, pain in her lower limbs, cramps, fatigue, headaches, and trouble sleeping. Suddenly the girl with so much energy and love for sports couldn’t participate in gym class or play games that might hurt her back.

“I felt sad because I had so much fun doing those things but then I couldn’t,” Monica said. “Sometimes I had to play by myself because the teachers didn’t want my classmates to hurt me accidentally.”

From desperation to hope

Scoliosis can often be treated through spine surgery, but such care is not available in Nicaragua. The Santamarias learned through their spine specialist about the medical missions of SpineHope, a U.S. based nonprofit that brings together surgeons, donated medical and surgical equipment, and teams of volunteers to take scoliosis treatment to various countries, including Nicaragua.

“It’s the most altruistic thing I’ve ever seen,” said Toby Hernandez, a sales rep in the Medtronic Cranial and Spinal Technologies Operating Unit who volunteers with SpineHope. “These children, these families, have no other options. They’re desperate. When they learn their child is going to get help, it’s a very emotional moment. Everybody in the room is crying, including us.”

The volunteer teams typically take two to four mission trips every year. Three missions are planned for 2025. Each trip involves prepping, packing, shipping and setting up an entire, functioning operating room in another country — roughly 30 bins of precision medical equipment and spine implants.

“It’s hard work, but it’s life-changing work and it’s all for these families and these children,” said Whitney Scurlock-Wood, a Medtronic spinal sales representative who has volunteered with SpineHope for the last four years. “Seeing the difference we make in people’s lives is just amazing. I take away something from every mission trip I go on.”

The team often performs several procedures on each mission. Occasionally, SpineHope’s case assessment concludes the patient should be brought to the U.S. for surgery, and that’s what happened with Monica.

“It didn’t hurt anymore”

For a month before surgery, Monica wore a halo-gravity traction device, which is a way of gently stretching the spine before surgery. Doctors attached a metal ring to Monica’s head and slowly added weights to a pulley system to apply traction to her spine. Eventually the system weighed 35 pounds, almost half of Monica’s body weight. But the process reduced her spine curvature by almost 50 percent, from 127 degrees to 73 degrees, and prepared her for the surgery.

Then, volunteer surgeons used donated Medtronic spine products in the procedure to straighten her curved spine.

Several Medtronic volunteers participated in the eight-hour operation.

Monica’s recovery started almost immediately. “The medical assistants helped her stand up the day after surgery and she took her first steps,” Roberto said. “It was incredible. Amazing.”

Seven days later, Monica left the hospital, no longer in pain and walking on her own. “It didn’t hurt anymore and I could do the things I liked to do again,” she said.

Today, Monica is back to swimming, playing volleyball, skating, and painting — activities she always loved but had to limit due to her condition. Her mood changed drastically; her smile is back and she’s happily looking forward to a life full of new possibilities.

“I’m grateful to everyone on my care team for everything they’ve done for me,” Monica said. “They gave me my life back.”

Medtronic has partnered with SpineHope ever since its formation in 2008—helping change the lives of more than 200 young patients.

“Medtronic is so committed to doing the right thing for the right people, Hernandez said. “It’s amazing and inspiring to be a part of it.”

IBM on Friday announced a major skill development push in India, saying it will train 5 million learners in advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity and quantum computing by 2030.

The initiative will be delivered through IBM SkillsBuild and is aimed at creating a future-ready workforce by improving access to digital and job-oriented skills for students and adult learners across the country.

IBM said the programme will focus on making advanced technology education more inclusive and accessible.

As part of this commitment, IBM will expand AI and emerging technology education across schools, universities and vocational training ecosystems.

The company will also work closely with institutions such as the All India Council for Technical Education to promote hands-on learning through AI-focused courses, faculty training programmes, curriculum integration, hackathons and internship opportunities.

IBM Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said India has the talent and ambition to become a global leader in AI and quantum technologies.

""India possesses the talent and ambition to lead the world in AI & Quantum. Fluency in frontier technologies will define economic competitiveness, scientific progress and societal transformation,"" Krishna said.

""By democratising access to advanced skills, we are enabling the youth and students to build, innovate and accelerate India's growth,"" he mentioned.

IBM is also strengthening AI education at the school level. The company is co-developing an AI curriculum for senior secondary students and providing teaching resources such as an AI Project Cookbook, a teacher handbook and explainer modules.

These efforts aim to introduce computational thinking and responsible AI concepts at an early stage and help teachers deliver AI education effectively.

At the centre of this effort is IBM SkillsBuild, one of the world's largest and most accessible digital learning platforms.

It offers more than 1,000 courses covering AI, cybersecurity, quantum computing, cloud, data, sustainability and workplace skills.

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-15 of this pricing supplement.

SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS

The Notes are not appropriate for all investors. The Notes may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

●You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons and Unpaid Coupon Amounts, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Reference Asset.

●You are willing and able to accept the risks associated with receiving shares of the Reference Asset at maturity.

●You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below the Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date.

●You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure.

●You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value.

●You understand and accept the risk that you will not receive any Unpaid Coupon Amounts unless a Contingent Coupon becomes payable on a subsequent Observation Date.

●You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Reference Asset.

●You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Asset.

●You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield.

●You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset.

●You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed.

●You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

●You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

●You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of the Reference Asset rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons and Unpaid Coupon Amounts, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Barrier Value.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with receiving shares of the Reference Asset at maturity.

●You anticipate that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Barrier Value.

●You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Asset.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of the Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons (and thus, Unpaid Coupon Amounts) and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity.

●You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL

The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption:

■For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below.

Example 1: The Notes are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date.

The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes.

The total return on investment of the Notes is 5.375%.

Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on the third Call Valuation Date.

** Any Unpaid Coupon Amount has been paid on a previous Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date.

The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes.

The total return on investment of the Notes is 10.75%.

Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date.

** Assumes NO Contingent Coupons have been previously paid. Accordingly, this amount includes the Contingent Coupon that is payable on this Contingent Coupon Payment Date plus the Unpaid Coupon Amounts that have accrued.

Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date.

The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes.

The total return on investment of the Notes is 18.8125%.

Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call Settlement Date.

Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on your Notes will be limited to the Contingent Coupons and any Unpaid Coupon Amounts that may be payable on the Notes. Each of these examples also demonstrate that, if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If a Contingent Coupon does not become payable with respect to an Observation Date (and instead becomes an Unpaid Coupon Amount), you will receive payment of such amount only if a Contingent Coupon becomes payable with respect to a future Observation Date. If a Contingent Coupon fails to become payable with respect to an Observation Date, and if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each subsequent Observation Date, you will never receive payment of the Unpaid Coupon Amount(s). If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any coupon payments during the term of the Notes.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY

The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT redeemed prior to scheduled maturity.

** per $1,000 principal amount Note, excluding the final Contingent Coupon that may be payable on the Maturity Date, and assumes we do not elect to exercise our physical settlement option. For an example demonstrating the amount of shares and cash that you would receive if (a) the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value and (b) we elect to exercise our physical settlement option, please see the final example below.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated:

Example 1: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $210.00.

Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus (i) the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date and (ii) any Unpaid Coupon Amounts that have not previously been paid).

Example 2: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $90.00.

Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus (i) the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date and (ii) any Unpaid Coupon Amounts that have not previously been paid).

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Asset or its components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Reference Asset from the Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with our Physical Settlement Option — As described on the cover of this pricing supplement, you may under certain circumstances receive shares of the Reference Asset at maturity. If we exercise our physical settlement option, the market value of the shares that you receive may be less than the amount of the cash payment that you would have received had we not exercised such option because of fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset between the Final Valuation Date and the Maturity Date.

●Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of The Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes (whether paid as Contingent Coupons on the Contingent Coupon Payment Date following an Observation Date or as Unpaid Coupon Amounts on a subsequent Contingent Coupon Payment Date). You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value.

●You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date and you will only receive the related Unpaid Coupon Amount if a Contingent Coupon becomes payable on a future Observation Date. If a Contingent Coupon fails to become payable on an Observation Date (and instead becomes an Unpaid Coupon Amount), and no Contingent Coupon becomes payable on any future Observation Date, you will never receive payment of the Unpaid Coupon Amount(s). If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

●The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Asset. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Asset been lower. As volatility of the Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than the Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of the Reference Asset will be less than the Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

●Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months.

The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Asset on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Asset on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Asset determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of the Reference Asset has increased from the Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning a Reference Asset or Any Securities to which a Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure may have.

●Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Reference Asset

●Historical Performance of the Reference Asset Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Asset Over the Term of the Notes — The value of the Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of the Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of the Reference Asset.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs — Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or a Reference Asset or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Single Equity Risk — The value of the Reference Asset can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Reference Asset, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the Reference Asset. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the Reference Asset or of any other publicly available information regarding the Reference Asset.

●Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments — The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the Reference Asset. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the Reference Asset. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Reorganization Or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated — Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of the Reference Asset, the Calculation Agent may replace the Reference Asset with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of the Reference Asset upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent or may make other changes to the terms of the Notes to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the Calculation Agent to replace the Reference Asset, to accelerate the Notes or to otherwise adjust the terms of the Notes could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the Notes than if the Calculation Agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Asset or its components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Asset and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Asset, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and this pricing supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

●The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

●Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Asset or the components of the Reference Asset, if any;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” This discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of the Reference Asset that you may receive at maturity. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential U.S. federal tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Reference Asset.

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, and except as described below, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption for cash upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

If you receive shares of the Reference Asset upon the maturity of your Notes, you should be deemed to have applied the purchase price of your Notes toward the purchase of the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. You should not recognize gain or loss with respect to the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. Instead, assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position described above, your basis in the shares (including any fractional share) should equal the price you paid to acquire your Notes, and that basis should be allocated proportionately among the shares. Your holding period for the Reference Asset should begin on the day after receipt. With respect to any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of the Reference Asset, you should recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the cash received and the tax basis allocable to the fractional share.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that these regulations should not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.

SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

We have agreed to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent has agreed to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The Agent commits to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.

VALIDITY OF THE NOTES

In the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special United States products counsel to Barclays Bank PLC, when the Notes offered by this pricing supplement have been issued by Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the indenture, the trustee has made, in accordance with instructions from Barclays Bank PLC, appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master global note that represents such Notes (the “master note”), and such Notes have been delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such Notes will be valid and binding obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith) and possible judicial or regulatory actions or application giving effect to governmental actions or foreign laws affecting creditors’ rights, provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to (i) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above or (ii) the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of the stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Notes to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York. Insofar as this opinion involves matters governed by English law, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP has relied, with Barclays Bank PLC’s permission, on the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP, dated as of May 15, 2025, filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form F-3ASR by Barclays Bank PLC on May 15, 2025, and this opinion is subject to the same assumptions, qualifications and limitations as set forth in such opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee’s authorization, execution and delivery of the indenture and its authentication of the master note and the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the indenture with respect to the trustee, all as stated in the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, dated May 15, 2025, which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement referred to above.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2025-12-19 04:03:04.553089

Over the past 12 months, Dell, Lenovo, and HP Inc collectively accounted for 75% of global commercial PC shipments.
Despite strong brand loyalty among commercial customers and lower elasticity of demand in this segment compared to the consumer market, PC manufacturers will continue to optimize configurations to sustain demand and maximize sales.","This week, Bloomberg technology industry analyst Woo Jin Ho issued a research report stating that Dell, Lenovo, and HP Inc have the capability to withstand the impact of the PC DRAM market.

The view suggests that leading PC manufacturers such as Lenovo, Dell, HP Inc, Apple, and Acer, with healthy inventory levels, advantages in procurement scale due to superior market share, and the ability to pass costs onto customers, are well-positioned to mitigate the effects of DRAM price increases in the second half of 2026.

With procurement volume and economies of scale, the five major PC manufacturers—Lenovo, HP Inc, Dell, Apple, and Acer—are expected to gain a slight increase in market share. Additionally, given their leadership positions in the server, smartphone, and enterprise storage markets, these companies are anticipated to enhance their purchasing power and secure priority access to memory supplies.

Other manufacturers, accounting for approximately 25% of the market share or around 65 to 70 million PCs, may face higher premiums for memory procurement, making it difficult to implement competitive pricing strategies. This presents an opportunity for leading vendors to further expand their market share in the mid-to-low price segments.

The report forecasts that AI-powered PCs are expected to account for 54% of total shipments in 2026, up from 34% in 2025; among these, AI PCs with computational power below 40 TOPS will represent 32% of total shipments and 62% of AI PC demand.

Beyond AI, the Windows 11 upgrade is expected to remain a key catalyst for shipments by Dell, Lenovo, and HP Inc in 2026. The current progress of the Windows 11 upgrade has lagged behind previous cycles. At present, approximately 35%-40% of Windows PCs still operate on older operating systems. This upgrade should help support shipments amid rising PC prices, particularly benefiting these three companies that hold leading positions in the commercial PC sector.

Over the past 12 months, Dell, Lenovo, and HP Inc collectively accounted for 75% of global commercial PC shipments. Despite strong brand loyalty among commercial customers and lower elasticity of demand in this segment compared to the consumer market, PC manufacturers will continue to optimize configurations to sustain demand and maximize sales.",https://pubimg.futunn.com/2022050900000233719bee4b9bc.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 03:00:46.269166

Ralph Lauren Investment Narrative Recap

To own Ralph Lauren, you need to believe in its ability to pair a resilient premium brand with disciplined execution, even as macro and pricing risks linger. The latest dividend declaration reinforces the appeal for income-focused holders, but does not materially change the near term balance between strong earnings momentum as a key catalyst and demand sensitivity to higher prices as a central risk.

Among recent developments, the stronger than expected Q2 2026 results stand out in the context of this dividend news, with revenue up 17% and adjusted EPS rising 49% year over year. Management’s upgraded full year outlook for 5% to 7% constant currency revenue growth and operating margin expansion frames the dividend as one part of a broader capital return story supported by current operating performance.

Yet despite this strength, investors should also be aware of how rising tariffs and consumer price sensitivity could...

Exploring Other Perspectives

Seven fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$106 to US$369 per share, showing just how far apart individual views can be.

Interest in burning hydrogen in traditional engines has increased this year, with companies including South Korean automaker KGM and Mahle Powertrain seeing the technology as a fast way to expand hydrogen infrastructure ahead of the rollout of hydrogen fuel-cell powertrains.

Please let us know if you have feedback.

Johnson Matthey has opened its first hydrogen internal combustion engine (H₂ICE) facility in what appears to be a healthy bet ahead of the European Union’s delay of zero-tailpipe vehicle sales previously slated for 2035.

A Dec. 16 statement published by Europe’s trade body, the European Commission, said lawmakers have agreed to allow “plug-in hybrids (PHEV), range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal combustion engine vehicles to still play a role beyond 2035.”

The move is the culmination of growing warnings by both automotive industry leaders and politicians, such as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, that an ICE ban could decimate Europe’s legacy brands.

So, Johnson Matthey’s Dec. 11 announcement that it has opened a new center of H₂ICE excellence in Gothenburg, Sweden, to strengthen its world-class heavy-duty vehicle testing capabilities places the company ahead of the curve.

Interest in burning hydrogen in traditional engines has increased this year, with companies including South Korean automaker KGM and Mahle Powertrain seeing the technology as a fast way to expand hydrogen infrastructure ahead of the rollout of hydrogen fuel-cell powertrains.

Johnson Matthey said in its release that the tried-and-tested engine technology, presents “a viable path for decarbonizing medium and heavy-duty transport, such as trucks and buses.”

The center has been completed on time and on budget, representing a £2.5 million ($3.35 million) investment over three years.

The facility, already a test site for medium and heavy-duty diesel engines, supports H₂ICE engines up to 600 kW (800 hp).

It will now test the performance of catalysts within the wider engine after-treatment and control systems, providing key insights into the development of hydrogen mobility solutions, said the company.

“For more than two centuries, JM has helped tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges,” said Tauseef Salma, Johnson Matthey’s chief technology officer for clean air, in a statement. “We continue to do so today because it’s in our DNA,” she added.

For a profitable bank like UniCredit, the price to earnings, or PE, ratio is a practical way to gauge whether the share price makes sense relative to the earnings it is generating today. In general, higher growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or greater uncertainty usually warrant a lower multiple.

UniCredit currently trades on a PE of about 10.55x, which is slightly below both the Banks industry average of roughly 10.84x and the broader peer group at around 12.34x. On the surface, that suggests the market is applying a small discount to UniCredit compared to similar companies.

Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what PE UniCredit should trade on, based on its earnings growth outlook, profitability, risk profile, size and banking industry dynamics, rather than relying only on blunt peer comparisons. For UniCredit, this Fair Ratio is 11.57x, modestly above the current 10.55x. That gap indicates the shares still look undervalued on a PE basis, even after their strong run.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your UniCredit Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, an easy tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you turn your view of UniCredit’s story into specific assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins. You can then link those to a financial forecast and Fair Value, and compare that Fair Value to today’s share price to decide whether to buy or sell. Each Narrative updates automatically when new news or earnings arrive. One investor might build a bullish UniCredit Narrative that assumes digitalisation, wealth management growth and successful deals with Alpha Bank and Commerzbank justify a Fair Value near the top of current analyst targets around €77. A more cautious investor, worried about demographics, geopolitics and margin pressure, could reasonably land closer to the lower end near €57. Both perspectives are clearly captured, quantified and comparable in one place.

Air T now owns 100% of Rex and looks forward to beginning a new chapter for Rex and the regional communities it serves across Australia.

The transaction includes a comprehensive financing structure designed to support Rex's operations and future growth:

Air T is providing a $50 million AUD credit facility that is funded by one of our investor partners. We anticipate that Rex will use this facility to bring its fleet fully back into service, from approximately 31 flyers currently to 45 flyers within the next two years.

The Commonwealth of Australia will continue to be a secured creditor of Rex.

Rex will have access to an additional undrawn $60 million AUD loan from the Commonwealth of Australia to support the overhaul of its current fleet of Saab 340s and general operations.

It is the outcome of disciplined planning, principled decision-making and an unwavering commitment to the regional communities we exist for. With renewed strength and clarity, we move forward, not defined by the turbulence behind us, but by the possibilities ahead.

As we move forward, we will remain true to our core. We are an airline with a responsibility to connect Australians, and we will approach this next chapter with the same pragmatism, care and resolve that guided us through the challenges behind us. This partnership does not redefine Rex. It strengthens our capacity to honour the purpose that has always defined us; to serve the regions that built us, with our heart firmly in the country.""

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) addressed a maximum-severity security vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-37164 (CVSS score of 10.0), in OneView Software. An attacker can exploit the flaw to achieve remote code execution.

HPE OneView is an integrated IT management and automation platform by Hewlett Packard Enterprise used to manage, monitor, and automate HPE data center infrastructure.

It provides a single, software-defined interface to control servers, storage, and networking, mainly in HPE environments (e.g., ProLiant servers and Synergy systems).

“A potential security vulnerability has been identified in Hewlett Packard Enterprise OneView Software. This vulnerability could be exploited, allowing a remote unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution.” reads the advisory published by the company.

The flaw impacts all versions through v10.20.

It is unclear if the threat actors have already exploited the vulnerability in attacks in the wild.

In June, HPE released security patches for eight vulnerabilities in its StoreOnce backup solution. These issues could allow remote code execution, authentication bypass, data leaks, and more.

“Potential security vulnerabilities have been identified in HPE StoreOnce Software.” reads the advisory. “These vulnerabilities could be remotely exploited to allow remote code execution, disclosure of information, server-side request forgery, authentication bypass, arbitrary file deletion, and directory traversal information disclosure vulnerabilities.”

The most severe vulnerability is an Authentication Bypass issue tracked as CVE-2025-37093 (CVSS score of 9,8). Earlier this June, the company also released updates to fix eight vulnerabilities in its StoreOnce data backup and deduplication solution that could result in an authentication bypass and remote code execution. It also shipped OneView version 10.00 to remediate a number of known flaws in third-party components, such as Apache Tomcat and Apache HTTP Server.

“They show a net financial benefit to DTE’s other customers,” said Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission. He added that the agreements require upfront collateral from the tech companies. “The contract doesn’t assume the customer will stay financially solvent,” he said.

The rapid build-out of data centers in the US has transformed the energy industry, with growing controversy over facilities that can suck up as much electricity as entire cities. The conflict at the hearing Thursday underscores an increasingly hostile environment for data centers in some parts of the US.

The agreement between DTE and Oracle would have the tech firm paying the costs of the more the project. That would also include minimum monthly charges and a termination fee, according to a DTE filing. The developers are helping to finance the project with a roughly $14 billion debt deal, people familiar with the matter previously told Bloomberg News.

DTE and Oracle shares rose slightly and both ended up just under 1% on the day.

Citigroup Inc. noted the regulatory process was controversial and that the hyperscaler would be the first to lose power during a system emergency. “This should help avoid the potential scenario where the lights are on for Oracle’s data center while the public has a blackout,” analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

OpenAI has said the Stargate campus in Saline Township is part of its 8 gigawatts of planned capacity in the US and more than $450 billion in investment over the next three years that it’s previously announced with its broader set of Stargate partners. One gigawatt is equivalent to a traditional nuclear reactor.

Reuters reported that the FTC sent Instacart a civil investigative demand, citing people familiar with the matter. The agency declined to confirm the probe but said it was troubled by media reports describing Instacart's alleged pricing methods.

The scrutiny follows a recent study showing that prices for identical items at the same supermarkets can differ by about 7 percent when ordered through Instacart, potentially adding more than $1,000 a year to a customer's grocery bill. Instacart has said retailers, not the platform, ultimately set prices shown in the app.

Questions around pricing intensified after Instacart's 2022 acquisition of Eversight, an AI-based pricing and promotions firm. At the time, Instacart said the deal was intended to help retailers offer real-time savings opportunities.

Instacart declined to comment directly on the reported investigation, but said its pricing system has been misunderstood. The company said retail partners control pricing decisions and that any testing conducted is not dynamic or surveillance-based pricing. It said prices do not change in real time, are not tied to supply and demand, and are not based on personal or behavioral data, describing the process instead as randomized A/B testing similar to methods long used by retailers.

The issue has also drawn political attention. Earlier Wednesday, U.S. Representative Robert Garcia of California asked Instacart CEO Chris Rogers to provide details on how prices are set, saying algorithm-driven pricing could be worsening financial pressure on consumers.

On Thursday, CART closed at $44.95, down 1.53%, and is trading after hours at $44.94, off 0.02%, on the NasdaqGS.

Key Benefits

Unmatched time-to-value with Customer Journey Analytics:

By accelerating the foundational technical setup, the solution drastically reduces the overall value realization timeline for Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), enabling clients to mostly focus on insight generation, not technical setup.

Reduced implementation timeline: With AI-assisted automation, Qualified Digital slashes the technical implementation and configuration timeline, allowing businesses to activate the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK in a matter of days instead of multiple weeks.

Enterprise ready: The accelerator enables a fast and scalable migration by automating complex and repetitive tasks. This significantly reduces the time needed to move from older Adobe data collection methods to the unified AEP Web SDK, regardless of whether your Adobe Tags property contains tens or hundreds of tags.

Human in the loop

While the AI-assisted automation takes care of the major technical migration tasks, the human, in this case the analytics implementation engineer, stays in full control of the validation and publishing process.

“By minimizing the manual implementation burden, our AI-assisted accelerator helps clients realize value with Customer Journey Analytics and the rest of the Adobe Experience Platform solutions faster,” said Kevin Haag, SVP of Data Strategy at Qualified Digital.

Qualified Digital's AI-assisted migration accelerator is available immediately to new and existing Adobe Experience Cloud customers looking to modernize their data collection framework and rapidly unlock the full potential of the Adobe Experience Platform and its application services Real-Time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics, Journey Optimizer & Mixed Modeler.

The company has prominent partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash and is a retail investor favorite at the intersection of robotics and last-mile delivery.

Investors believe Serve’s robots can lower the cost of food deliveries by eliminating human couriers and make cities greener and safer by taking cars off the road. Management often argues that you “do not need a two-ton car to deliver a two-pound burrito.”

Serve started as an internal project within Postmates in 2017 and was spun out shortly after Uber acquired Postmates in December 2020. The company was listed on the NASDAQ through a reverse merger in April 2024 and faces intense competition from other robot delivery startups such as Starship, Nuro, Avride, and Coco Robotics. The company lost about $80 million on $2 million in revenue over the last twelve months, and its stock has about $100 million in average daily trading volume.

The Bear Cave believes Serve Robotics is a well-intentioned experiment with poor economics and a subpar solution for last-mile delivery.

Serve’s robots travel on public sidewalks and are not always treated with dignity and respect. In some cases, people flip the robots over for amusement or to steal the food carried inside.

Some of Serve’s problems are self-inflicted. A video posted on X last month by entrepreneur Nikhil Krishnan showed a Serve robot awkwardly forcing its way through a restaurant’s sidewalk seating while on a delivery. The post was captioned:

“There’s all these ground robots in Miami doing deliveries.

Seeing them in action makes me less bullish on these sidewalk robots as a form factor - people just don’t like dealing with them, they bully them (maintenance costs go up), and they’re slow.

Feel like the most likely end state is autonomous cars carrying food deliveries and drones for lighter ones.”

The Bear Cave spent hours observing Serve robots in our hometown of Brickell and reached a similarly negative conclusion.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sSy0!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82b55126-f537-48be-bf1f-9d63b0bb3d70_2500x1666.webp",N,,2025-12-18 18:04:54.082073

Adding generative AI into the exploratory process of drug research has helped surface novel solutions.
In ten years, we expect to see new medicines that have been shaped by AI.","The journey from molecule to medicine requires years of laboratory work. ""There are more medicinal molecules out there than stars in the universe,” said Eli Lilly and Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Information and Digital Officer Diogo Rau from The Big Interview stage on December 4. “But finding one that works is about as rare as finding a single star in a galaxy, like finding one star in the Milky Way.” Researchers test molecules against hypotheses or known biological targets (like blocking a pain receptor) and see what works. They do that millions of times to find the single molecule that will lead to a health outcome.

But thanks to AI, we may be able to shrink that timeline—and end illness altogether.

AI as a Lab Partner

Equipment sterilization and worker safety notwithstanding, the trial-and-error process of developing new pharmaceutical products has been roughly unchanged for the better part of the last century. But according to Rau, AI is not only speeding up the timeline of discovery, but giving researchers new ways to approach it. Adding generative AI into the exploratory process of drug research has helped surface novel solutions. In fact, the first time Rau’s team used generative design on molecules, they produced some results that were promising, but unlike anything else the lab had ever come across. Intrigued, the team ran these experiments by Lilly staff chemists, and the response surprised Rau: “They said, 'That's interesting. We hadn't thought about doing it that way.' So the AI actually inspired the chemists to go down a different path that they hadn't been exploring.”

This series of events speaks to a broader shift happening throughout the professional world—human-machine collaboration. Just as knowledge workers in other industries have had to learn how to incorporate AI into their workflow to boost efficiency and drive faster results, the sciences are no different. ""We always talk about how we're training our machines,"" Rau said. “But there's a lot that they're going to teach us on the human side that we're going to go explore… not because we trained them, [but] because they're actually teaching us.”

An Efficiency Booster

In the early years of artificial intelligence research, one of the oft-stated benefits of AI was faster and more accurate results in medical labs and scientific research. While Lilly has been on the forefront of applying computing power to pharmaceutical challenges since becoming the first commercial purchaser of a Cray-2 supercomputer in 1989, a strategic partnership with a market leader in AI chips will enable them to unlock unprecedented gains in research volume. Coming online in January 2026, Lilly's new technology stack will use purpose-built models trained on internal data to launch scientific AI agents (digital assistants supporting researchers), push forward drug discovery research, and advance manufacturing operations via virtual modeling to fine-tune supply chains.

Critically, this custom-built LLM will learn from past and future molecular experiments. According to Rau, ""There are more medicinal molecules out there than stars in the universe, but finding one that works is about as rare as finding a single star in a galaxy, like finding one star in the Milky Way."" With this much computing power, the dream of finding cures for as-yet incurable diseases is tangible. Adding AI to the equation speeds up that timeline significantly. Rau said that on the first day their supercomputer is online, it will be 7 million times as powerful as the Cray-2 supercomputer.

That kind of hyper acceleration forever changes the time horizon for pharmaceutical companies and their output. Due to the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, pharmaceutical patents expire 20 years after their filing date, allowing generic drugs to hit the market. That puts drugmakers in a constant cycle of discovery, testing, and go-to-market. ""We've got to be focused on what we're going to discover,"" Rau said.

Installing Guardrails to Accelerate Growth

While this kind of accelerated pace may seem anathema to the slow progress of safe science, Rau notes that Lilly has built governance best practices into their systems at every level, building a platform-agnostic system with the capacity to utilize up to 43 large language models (LLMs), with guardrails to protect against issues like exposure of personally identifiable information. While today, developers build out new products and systems, according to Rau, “The real vision is [that] anybody in any role… can just go and talk to a large language model and have the guardrails and make everything work.”

A Moon Landing Moment

The pace and fervor of this innovation can have tangible results. Even without AI, the scientific community has eradicated smallpox globally and turned once-fatal diseases into manageable conditions. With the support of artificial intelligence working in collaboration with lab researchers and civil society, Rau envisions a dramatic future. In ten years, we expect to see new medicines that have been shaped by AI. ""But,"" he said, ""by the end of the century we essentially could be disease free as we know it."" That is the true promise of AI.","https://media.wired.com/photos/69418666b871f460797b4955/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/_45A9557_IcHreasd.jpeg",N,,2025-12-18 20:59:55.244073

Delivery company Instacart will pay $60 million in customer refunds under a settlement reached with the Federal Trade Commission over alleged deceptive practices.

The FTC said Thursday that Instacart has been falsely advertising free deliveries. The San Francisco-based company isn’t clearly disclosing service fees, which add as much as 15% to an order and must be paid for customers to receive their groceries, the FTC said.

Instacart has also failed to clearly disclose that customers who enroll in a free trial for its Instacart+ program will be charged membership fees at the end of the trial. The FTC said hundreds of thousands of customers have been charged but have received no benefits from memberships or refunds. Instacart+ offers members free deliveries on most orders for $99 per year.

The FTC said Instacart also advertises a “100% satisfaction guarantee,” but customers who experience late deliveries or unprofessional service are typically only offered a small credit that can be used toward a future order and not a refund.

“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.

Instacart denied the FTC’s allegations of wrongdoing Thursday but said it reached a settlement in order to move forward and focus on its business.

“Instacart is proud to offer a transparent, affordable and consumer-friendly service. We provide straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation and generous refund policies – all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms,” the company said in a statement.

The settlement comes as Instacart is facing a separate probe by the FTC into its pricing practices.

Earlier this month, a report by Consumer Reports and two progressive advocacy groups — Groundwork Collaborative and More Perfect Union — found that Instacart charged different prices for the same grocery items even though online shoppers were filling their Instacart baskets at the same time and at the same stores.

The report suggested that Instacart may be using artificial intelligence tools to drive up costs for consumers. Instacart confirmed Thursday that the FTC has requested information on its pricing tools and the pricing practice of the retailers it works with.

In its own blog post Thursday, Instacart stressed that it isn’t a retailer and doesn’t control base prices listed on its website. It said retailers often test prices in order to see how sensitive consumers are when prices go up or down, and that’s what was happening in Consumer Reports’ case.

Instacart also said the company and its retailers don’t use information about shoppers’ income, zip code or shopping history to set prices.

Instacart said it encourages retailers to charge the same amount on its website as they charge for in-store shoppers. Some retailers, including Lowe’s, Ulta Beauty and Best Buy, already do that, Instacart said, but many others don’t.",https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Instacart_Settlements_93661.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-12-18 17:04:50.542780

Key Points:

The targeted support regime is expected to take effect on 6 April 2026, and will allow firms to provide suggestions relating to pensions and investments designed for groups of consumers with common characteristics without attracting the full regulatory compliance burden of offering personalised advice.

The FCA also published a joint statement with the ICO explaining how firms will be able to actively promote their targeted support services in compliance with existing direct marketing rules under data protection law.

Introduction

On 11 December 2025, the FCA published a Policy Statement (PS25/22) containing its near-final rules on targeted support. While the rules are in substantially final form, they cannot be made by the FCA until the government passes legislation to make the necessary changes to the regulatory framework. However, the government issued a consultation response on its draft Statutory Instrument on the same date, indicating that both the government and the FCA intend for the regime to take effect in April 2026.

Targeted support will allow firms to provide suggestions relating to pensions and investments designed for groups of consumers with common characteristics without attracting the full regulatory compliance burden of offering personalised advice. There will be a new regulated activity for this service, distinct from “advising on investments”.

Authorised firms seeking to offer targeted support will need to apply for a variation of permissions to include this new activity. The FCA has suggested that, once the regime takes effect, it intends to grant permissions promptly to firms that have engaged with the regulator through the pre-application support service.

Legislative Framework

In its feedback on the draft Statutory Instrument, HM Treasury confirms that appointed representatives will not be able to deliver targeted support. However, HM Treasury states that it will review this position once broader reforms to the appointed representatives regime have been introduced and are well established. HM Treasury also confirms that, while certain exemptions and exclusions will apply to the new regulated activity, AIFMs and UCITS managers will need to apply for the separate regulatory permission if they want to offer targeted support.

FCA Requirements

The FCA consulted on its regulatory framework for targeted support in December 2024 and June 2025. The regulator proposed that firms would need to:

Identify consumer segments with shared financial support needs or objectives and, where relevant, common characteristics, in order to deliver suitable ready‑made suggestions.

Communicate the nature and limitations of targeted support as well as the common characteristics of the consumer segment when delivering targeted support.

Adhere to existing product governance rules.

Regularly review and monitor the outcomes of the targeted support service.

The FCA reports that it received more than 100 responses to its main consultation on targeted support. It states that there was strong support for its proposals, however, there were requests for clarification and refinement. Although the FCA has maintained much of the framework as initially consulted on, it has made a number of adjustments in light of the feedback, including:

Adding guidance to make clear that suitability does not need to be assessed at the individual consumer level when providing targeted support.

Clarifying that, when defining consumer segments, firms should not use a level of detail that equates to a comprehensive consideration of a consumer’s characteristics or circumstances. The FCA has also included new guidance to provide greater context around the requirement for sufficiently granular consumer segments.

Clarifying that assumptions can be used to limit the number of common characteristics used to define a segment. However, firms must not make assumptions which are material to the suitability of the suggestion. For example, willingness to take investment risk could be assumed for a particular segment, but only if it is not material to the suitability of the suggestion.

Simplifying the rules and guidance on firms’ obligations for ongoing monitoring of the targeted support service, recognising the one‑off nature of targeted support. For example, the FCA has clarified that firms are not required to check suitability on an ongoing basis, although they should consider whether the ready-made suggestion remains suitable for the predefined consumer segment as part of monitoring outcomes.

Amending the rules on product monitoring so that firms should only consider whether mitigating action is needed in response to a significant adaptation to a product. The FCA has also removed the requirement for firms to determine retrospectively whether a consumer acted on a ready‑made suggestion and to take mitigating action for that consumer in light of a significant adaptation, recognising that identifying such situations would be difficult for firms.

Requiring firms to explicitly call the service “Targeted Support” in any communications to consumers which contain ready‑made suggestions.

Adding guidance encouraging firms to keep a record of how they meet their disclosure obligations.

Narrowing its rules on cross-subsidisation so that firms can only accept payments that are reasonably representative of the costs of providing the service from companies in the same group. However, the FCA will not introduce a requirement for firms to disclose to consumers the basis of their remuneration arrangements, including cross‑subsidisation.

Providing Additional Clarity

Alongside the Policy Statement, the FCA published a joint statement with the Information Commissioner’s Office to explain how firms will be able to actively promote their targeted support services in compliance with existing direct marketing rules under data protection law. This is in response to concerns that direct marketing rules could restrict firms seeking to make targeted support communications. However, the FCA notes that legislative changes to the direct marketing rules would be a matter for the government to consider. HM Treasury has stated that it will make legislation to enable workplace pension providers to deliver targeted support communications to members who have not opted out of direct marketing.

The FCA also published a statement with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) setting out how the FOS and the FCA intend to work together regarding any future complaints about targeted support that have wider implications or that require clarification of FCA rules. The statement suggests that the FOS will seek a view from the FCA if issues of interpretation arise, as would be the case under planned reforms to the FOS, to ensure a consistent approach. This approach seems to be aimed at allaying concerns firms might have about potential mass redress issues while the government review of the redress system remains ongoing.

Next Steps

Subject to the necessary legislation being made, the regime will take effect on 6 April 2026. The FCA plans to open the authorisation gateway in March 2026, and is already offering assistance to firms through its pre-application support service. The FCA also states that it will publish further details on how firms should design consumer segments before the regime takes effect. Additionally, the FCA indicates that it intends to consult on changes to its perimeter guidance in the future to provide greater clarity on the advice guidance boundary more generally.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15361_4613.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:04:44.954706

In today’s issue:

▪ GOP moderates go around Johnson

▪ Trump touts record, $1,776 ‘Warrior Dividend’

▪ Bongino leaving FBI

▪ New Medicaid work requirements

A group of moderate House Republicans added to Speaker Mike Johnson‘s (R-La.) headaches when they joined with Democrats to force a vote on extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies.

The support from Pennsylvania GOP Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Rob Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie and New York Rep. Mike Lawler gave Democrats’ discharge petition the key 218 signatures to force a vote on the House floor. The Democratic measure calls for an extension of the subsidies by three years.

The timing of the vote remains unclear. House rules set a waiting period before supporters of a discharge petition can call for the underlying bill to receive consideration on the House floor, and the chamber is set to leave for holiday recess through the rest of the year after Friday.

Johnson could call for a vote sooner, as he did after the success of another discharge petition last month forcing a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files. But he’s not required to do so.

The House on Wednesday night passed a partisan health care measure that includes a conservative alternative to extending the subsidies, but it has little chance of passing in the Senate.

The enhanced ACA subsidies are set to expire at the end of the month, and health insurance premiums could spike for more than 20 million Americans if they aren’t extended.

The final signatures on the petition backed by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats came after tensions reached a fever pitch between moderate Republicans supportive of extending the subsidies in some form and House GOP leadership.

GOP leaders and moderates had been discussing terms for bringing an amendment to the Republican health care proposal up for a vote to extend the subsidies, but Johnson declared Tuesday that no such vote would happen. Johnson said both sides were acting in “good faith,” but an agreement wasn’t reached.

That infuriated moderates who for weeks have been advocating for their party to back an extension of the subsidies with certain reforms.

Lawler called the decision “political malpractice” and “absolute bulls—.”

Fitzpatrick had put forward a separate discharge petition to extend the subsidies for two years with eligibility reforms, but that hasn’t gained much traction, leading him and others to back the Democrats’ petition.

“As I’ve stated many times before, the only policy that is worse than a clean three-year extension without any reforms, is a policy of complete expiration without any bridge,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement. “Unfortunately, it is House leadership themselves that have forced this outcome.”

The defections mark just the latest battle for Johnson, who has faced mounting criticism from members of his conference over his leadership.

The Speaker denied that he’s lost control of the conference after the rebellion from the moderates.

“We have the smallest majority in U.S. history. These are not normal times,” Johnson said. “There are processes and procedures in the House that are less frequently used when there are larger majorities.”

Lawler said his signing the petition isn’t an “indictment” of Johnson, recognizing that he has a “difficult” job dealing with all members of the House Republican Conference.

But it is the latest instance of Republicans undermining Johnson’s positions after months of the Speaker keeping most members in line.

To date, the defectors have mostly come from the conservative wing of the party. Four House Republicans sided with Democrats to force a vote on the Epstein files.

Meanwhile, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) is gathering signatures to force a vote on banning stock trading among members of Congress and their families.

And now Johnson has moderates splitting with him as well.

MODS POLL WELL: One data point out this morning that may help moderates’ case that their path is the way to go is a new Emerson College Polling survey looking at hypothetical 2028 presidential match-ups.

The poll shows moderates from both parties lead opponents from the more extreme ends. Respondents said they preferred a moderate Republican over a progressive Democrat by 12 points and backed a moderate Democrat over a MAGA Republican by 9 points.

A moderate Republican also had a 5-point advantage over a moderate Democrat, while a progressive Democrat led a MAGA Republican by 1 point.

“It is clear that a moderate candidate on both the Democratic and Republican side has appeal toward independent voters that a label of progressive or MAGA does not appeal to: the ‘moderate Democrat’ has a 17-point advantage over the MAGA Republican and the ‘moderate Republican’ has an 18-point advantage over the ‘progressive Democrat,’” said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling.

Smart Take with Blake Burman

Johnson said Wednesday that he has not lost control of the House after several Republicans crossed over to sign a Democratic-led discharge petition to extend ACA tax credits for three years. However, calls for leadership are coming from both sides of the aisle.

“I hope that the Speaker takes a different approach in the new year,” Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) told me, speaking about the increasing number of discharge petitions, a way for members to gather enough signatures to bring any vote to the floor.

“It’s not just the House and Senate. The president’s got to take a leadership role on this as well,” Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.) told me as well in a joint interview with Kiley.

Johnson noted the historically small majority. He’s not wrong. However, every day that goes by is a day closer to the November midterm elections, where members will start to look at their own races. We could be gearing up for a term where discharge petitions are a feature and not a bug.

3 Things to Know Today

1. The federal government has admitted fault in the January crash between an airliner and a Black Hawk helicopter in Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.

2. The State Department announced it is sending a package of arms sales worth more than $10 billion to Taiwan. It includes medium-range missiles, drones and military software.

3. The annual national defense policy bill has reached President Trump’s desk after the Senate signed off on the bipartisan, $901 billion spending package for fiscal 2026. It includes a pay bump for service members, additional military aid for Ukraine and a rollback of sanctions on Syria — and a provision pushing for unedited footage of U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.

Leading the Day

TRUMP ADDRESS: President Trump took his case directly to the American people Wednesday night when he promoted his accomplishments as his first year back in office is almost over.

Speaking from the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House, Trump argued he inherited a poor economy from former President Biden and has turned it around over the past 11 months, lowering costs and stopping the flow of migrants and drugs in the U.S.

The 18-minute speech marked a continuation of the president’s attempt to tie the country’s problems to his predecessor while portraying his own administration as turning things around. He pointed to the cost of eggs, gasoline, airfare and hotel rates coming down, investments from foreign trade deals and revenue coming in because of his wide-ranging tariffs.

Trump also announced his administration would send “Warrior Divided” checks worth $1,776 to more than 1.4 million U.S. service members and hinted at rolling out major housing reform initiatives next year.

But polls have continued to show most Americans don’t approve of his handling of the economy and believe he is more to blame for its status than Biden.

A PBS News/NPR/Marist poll released Wednesday showed only 36 percent of respondents said they approve of his handling of the issue, the lowest percentage recorded in either of his two terms.

▪ The Hill: Five takeaways from Trump’s speech.

HOUSE PASSES TRANS BILL: The House has narrowly passed a bill sponsored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) that would criminalize gender-affirming care for minors.

The chamber approved the legislation Wednesday in a mostly party-line vote, with all but four Republicans voting in favor and all but three Democrats voting against. The vote came after Greene reached a deal with House Republican leadership last week to bring her bill to the floor in exchange for her supporting a vote to advance the NDAA.

“We need to let kids grow up without manipulation from adults to make life altering decisions! Congress must protect America’s children!!!” Greene wrote on X before the vote.

The bill has almost no chance of advancing in the Senate, where it would need Democratic support to pass.

GRANT FUNDING CUT: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has terminated seven grants worth millions of dollars for the American Academy of Pediatrics, citing its use of “identity-based language,” The Washington Post reported.

The Post reported the decision surprised professionals at the organization, which has been among the sharpest critics of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‘s changes to federal vaccine recommendations.

A spokesperson for the department told the outlet the grants were cut for the organization, along with others, because they “no longer align” with HHS’s mission or priorities.

The academy warned the withdrawal of the funds could harm infants, youth and their families across the country.

HEADING TOWARD THE EXIT: FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino plans to step down from his role in January after less than a year on the job.

Bongino announced his decision Wednesday in a post on the social platform X, thanking Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel for the opportunity to serve.

Trump had indicated earlier that Bongino was interested in returning to being a conservative commentator, the role he held for years before becoming the second-highest-ranking official in the FBI. Bongino developed a major following during Trump’s first term through his radio show, podcast and appearances on Fox News.

But he reportedly clashed with Bondi over the release of the Epstein files and had misgivings about the job. He was reported to have mulled about leaving months ago, and speculation about his potential exit picked up again in August, when Trump tapped then-Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey as co-deputy director.

FCC INDEPENDENCE: Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr suggested the agency he leads isn’t independent from Trump’s administration during an intense back-and-forth with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D) pressed Carr about the agency’s responsibility to conduct oversight of major media companies without considering how members of the administration, including the president, feel about their content.

Luján noted the FCC website called the agency “independent.” But Carr argued the Communications Act of 1934, which established the FCC, didn’t include protections for commissioners to only be relieved of their position for cause.

“So formally speaking, the FCC is not independent,” he said.

The website later removed the word “independent” from its “About” section after Carr’s testimony.

The chair’s comments came as part of a grilling he received from Senate Democrats who accused him of trying to coerce local affiliate broadcasters to scrutinize content critical of Trump.

They also slammed him over the brief suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, who was taken off the air on ABC in September over comments he made regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Carr had suggested local affiliates should refuse to air Kimmel’s show before the suspension was enacted.

Kimmel’s suspension was criticized by members across the aisle, and Carr caught heat from some Republicans for his role, including Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee.

Carr defended himself, arguing local affiliates are “obligated” to scrutinize news and entertainment content that doesn’t “serve the public interest.”

NASA ADMINISTRATOR CONFIRMED: The Senate confirmed Jared Isaacman to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) after a roller-coaster road for him.

Isaacman’s confirmation passed comfortably in a 67-to-30 vote, but it came after his initial nomination was pulled and he was renominated last month. Trump withdrew the nomination for Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and close ally of Elon Musk, in May amid the president’s feud with the Tesla CEO.

Isaacman will take over leadership of NASA for Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who had been serving as interim administrator since July.

Trump has set a goal for NASA to return humans to the moon before China does. Isaacman has proposed a plan of increasing competition among private-sector entities as part of the effort.

NEW PROFILE PIC: Secretary of State Marco Rubio has embraced a photo of himself from a Vanity Fair article, which shows him looking down while standing in a corner.

Rubio made it his profile picture on X after accusing the outlet of having “deliberately manipulated” photos and content in its story.

MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS: Nebraska is set to become the first state to implement new work requirements for Medicaid in line with Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The legislation, which Trump signed into law earlier this year, requires low-income residents between the ages of 19 and 64 to work or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month to remain eligible for Medicaid benefits. The requirements only apply to those who received Medicaid through an expansion under the ACA that raised the income limit for qualification.

The law requires states to enact work requirements by 2027, but states can take action sooner.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen (R) said the goal is not to “take everybody to the curb” but ensure “we get every able-bodied Nebraskan to be part of our community,” The Associated Press reported.

The law permits exemptions for pregnant women, homeless people, those recently released from incarceration, those receiving addiction treatment, disabled people and parents and guardians of children younger than 14 years old.

All beneficiaries who are eligible because of the expansion must submit paperwork demonstrating they are meeting the requirements every six months or risk losing coverage.

AP reported the new policies could cause 4.5 million people to be uninsured by 2027.

NEWSHOUSE RETIRING: Rep. Dan Newhouse (Wash.), one of the two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for his role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021, announced he won’t seek reelection to another term next year.

Newhouse made the announcement Wednesday after having represented his central Washington district since 2015. He fended off two Trump-backed primary challenges in 2022 and 2024 over his vote in favor of impeachment, in which he was one of 10 Republicans to do so.

Trump was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.

Newhouse’s district is solidly conservative, having voted for Trump by 20 points last year.

With his retirement, California Rep. David Valadao (R) would be the only remaining House Republican who backed impeachment.

Elsewhere

RUSSIA MEETING: U.S. and Russian officials are reportedly planning to meet this weekend in Miami as part of the latest round of talks to try to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end.

Two people familiar with the matter told Politico of the plan, which remains up in the air but would include administration officials presenting the result of the most recent negotiations with Ukraine to the Russian officials. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner are expected to be present.

Senior U.S. officials have indicated that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed on most of the terms for a potential peace deal to end the war after nearly four years of fighting. One major development from the recent talks is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appeared to back off on insisting Ukraine join NATO, expressing openness to a similar mutual defense pact without joining the alliance.

The administration has signaled it believes it can get Russia to agree to the security guarantees.

But the major remaining issue is over control of land, with Zelensky refusing to give up any Ukrainian territory, including area currently under Russian occupation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that the Kremlin remains prepared to take Ukraine by military force if the negotiations fail.

Over the last 15+ years, he has built a career defined by curiosity, strategic thinking, and a commitment to ideas that feel natural in the real world, not only in presentations.

He began his journey in agencies such as DDB and Publicis, where he worked as a copywriter and later as a creative director, developing award-winning work recognised nationally and internationally. He then moved into the entertainment industry, spending five years at Warner Music Spain, where he crafted creative concepts, brand partnerships and cultural storytelling alongside artists and labels, an experience that strengthened his instinct for ideas that feel lived rather than forced.

Today, Leo’s work sits precisely where behaviours, platforms and culture meet. He focuses on shaping ideas that tap into how people already interact, across digital ecosystems, social behaviours or unexpected real world moments, and on helping teams think in systems rather than isolated assets.

Beyond advertising, Leo is a street photographer, a music obsessive, and someone who believes the best ideas come from paying close attention to the world (real and digital). That lens – half analytical, half emotional – is what he brings into every brief, every concept and every collab.

Leo sat down with LBB to discuss the basis of his own creativity, as well as how his approach to judging work has evolved

​

PERSON

I’ve always felt my creativity comes from living in two modes at once. One part of me is introverted, quiet and observant, the kind of person who notices the exact moment someone loosens their shoulders, or how a background colour suddenly completes a scene when someone walks by wearing the perfect contrasting shade. Those tiny signals become raw material I collect without even trying. But when I feel at ease, another part of me appears: the playful, collaborative one that turns those silent observations into ideas. My creativity lives in the tension between those two instincts.

There’s a cartoon by the Venezuelan artist Eneko hanging in my studio that reads: ‘You have to grow, so the child inside you will have more space to play.’ That’s exactly how I experience life and creativity. I approach the work with responsibility, but I approach ideas with curiosity. Creativity needs room to play, to explore, to make something out of nothing.

But that space doesn’t sustain itself. I’ve learned I need habits and iteration to protect it, while being careful to leave breathing room inside the structure. Too much routine makes the work predictable; too little makes it unfocused. I try to live in the middle: enough discipline to move forward, enough openness to be surprised.

And even though I enjoy what I do, most of my inspiration lives outside advertising: in music, photography, design, social media, video games. Those worlds still surprise me. And that surprise is always where my ideas begin.

PRODUCT

When I look at a piece of work, I pay attention to how it makes me feel, to the impression it leaves behind. Sometimes it’s: ‘I wasn’t expecting this.’ Other times: ‘Of course! This is exactly how it should be.’ And sometimes it’s that quiet frustration of: ‘I should’ve thought of this.’ That emotional trace tells me more than any formal criteria.

I’m drawn to ideas that find a new angle without shouting for attention. Work that feels culturally grounded, honest, scalable and fluent in how people actually speak. Ideas that aren’t trying to conquer the world, but reveal something that was already there.

My criteria have changed over time. When I was younger, I cared more about the clever twist for its own sake. Now I think much more about where and how an idea reaches someone. If a message appears in a place where people already feel comfortable (a behaviour, a platform, a ritual) it has a far better chance of being believed, felt and shared. An idea doesn’t need to demand attention; it just needs to belong.

What excites me most is work that becomes part of culture instead of interrupting it. Ideas that ‘hack the platform,’ that slip into real behaviours, the kind anyone could have made if they had noticed the same cultural loophole. Those ideas feel alive.

To me, the industry today moves between two impulses: work that tries to create meaning and work that tries to achieve metrics. Both matter, but only the first one leaves something that lasts. Culture remembers what feels true.

PROCESS

After reading a brief, the first thing I try to understand is where the idea could actually live. I look for the platform, the moment or the behaviour where the message would feel natural, a place where the brand can enter the conversation without forcing it. Finding that ‘home’ early on helps me see the creative potential more clearly and shapes everything long before I think about executions.

From there, I focus on how the message might resonate. I pay attention to the emotional tone of the moment, to how people are behaving, to what feels honest right now. I’m not chasing ideas yet; I’m trying to sense what kind of idea would feel true. Once I find that alignment, that ‘platform hack’, the creative process starts moving almost on its own.

When the idea itself begins to take shape, my process shifts depending on whether I’m working alone or with a partner. When I’m alone, I let the thoughts move freely: I write fragments, test tiny angles, walk while everything rearranges itself. I use AI like a wide-angle lens, to map possibilities, uncover blind spots, and stretch the idea before committing to anything.

With a partner, the process becomes shared. It stops being ‘your idea’ or ‘my idea’ and naturally becomes ‘our idea.’ Conversations replace internal monologues, contradictions sharpen thinking, and two perspectives start building a single direction in real time. It’s not about merging two processes; it’s about creating a new one together.

I know a piece is ready when it fits naturally into the space I identified at the start. If it feels authentic there, not like an interruption, but like something that truly belongs, something users in that space could have made themselves, then it’s ready.

PRESS

I grew up in Caracas, in a home where curiosity was part of everyday life. My father, an art critic, filled our days with books, exhibitions and conversations about meaning. My mother, a chemist specialised in paper conservation, taught me to value precision and how even the smallest, invisible detail can change everything. That mix of emotional and analytical thinking shaped how I approach creativity today.

Venezuela influenced me in quieter ways. Not through chaos, but through a cultural instinct for resourcefulness. Improvisation is part of the Venezuelan DNA. Watching how people solve the everyday with ingenious, simple solutions taught me to appreciate ideas that are intuitive and culturally sharpened.

Silence has always been the place where I think best. Today, music plays a big role in how I work. When I go on photo walks through Madrid, music acts like a filter. It isolates me just enough from the environment to see it with a bit of distance. That distance helps me notice moments that vanish when you’re too immersed: a shadow aligning with a colour, a gesture that tells a story, two strangers mirroring each other without realising it. Photography taught me to capture what disappears; music helps me detach just enough to recognise it.

Those early influences shaped how I work with clients, too. I’ve learned that clarity is one of the most powerful forces in any creative project. A brief overloaded with objectives dilutes ideas instantly. A focused intention, on the other hand, gives creativity something meaningful to respond to.

Inside agencies, culture matters as much as talent. People do their best work when they feel confident, when iteration is welcomed, and when there’s space to think. Creativity needs freedom, yes, but it also needs an environment where that freedom can turn into something real.",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2025-12/Leo-Sierra-VML.MmKJ1-HW.png,N,,2025-12-18 21:00:16.504381

As America industrialized and moved away from an agricultural economy, people faced more demands on their time. Packaged foods emerged as a solution offering convenience to the evolving American family, whether it be canned goods or snacks. Today, Americans seek brands that are high in quality, reliable, and reasonably priced. Furthermore, there's a growing emphasis on health-conscious and sustainable food options. Packaged food stocks are considered resilient investments. People always need to eat, so these companies can enjoy consistent demand as long as they stay on top of changing consumer preferences.

Market Update

The Fed’s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election. Still, questions remain about the direction of economic policy, as potential tariffs and corporate tax changes add uncertainty for 2025.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/kraft-heinz-cover-image-70bf6340ac4e_2023-11-09-121335_kpsu.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 16:02:07.235639

GlobalData forecasts the global intravascular ultrasound catheters (IVUS) market to see a steady market value growth at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% during the 2024-2034.

Philips currently accounts for 88% of the global market share for IVUS devices. North America is the largest market for IVUS medical devices, with a market value of $490 million. GlobalData predicts the North American IVUS market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6% during the forecast period.

Thomas Fleming, Medical Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The demand for IVUS medical devices stems from the increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) due to aging populations and a high rate of smoking in some countries. A worldwide increase in healthcare spending will also drive the market. However, the high cost of imaging techniques and a lack of heart specialty hospitals in some regions will act as barriers to the adoption of IVUS based procedures.”

The acquisition of SpectraWAVE will include the HyperVue Imaging System with AI-supported imaging inside the coronary arteries and X1-FFR, an AI-enabled angio-based FFR technology. X1-FFR provides a direct feed from angiography systems, which can be used by clinicians in finding the correct location for stent placements and other intervention. The acquisition will expand Philips’ current intravascular imaging and physiological assessment device portfolio, which includes OmniWire iFR technology and Eagle Eye Platinum IVUS.

The announcement of Philip’s acquisition of SpectraWAVE follows the earlier development of 501k clearance for SpectraWAVE’s Hypervue Intravascular Imagine System in 2023, $50 million of Series B funding for SpectraWAVE in September d2024, and SpectraWAVE gaining FDA clearance for X1-FFR in October 2025.

Fleming concludes: “The coupling of SpectraWAVE’s new technologies with Philips’ existing catalogue of products and market influence will potentially increase the adoption rates of IVUS based procedures. The burgeoning application of AI in medical technology will provide new innovations for IVUS technology as well as for the cardiovascular and diagnostic imaging sectors in general.”",https://www.globaldata.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GD-logo-vector_RGB-02-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 19:02:12.050785

The FDA also said the tainted formula remained on shelves at Albertsons' stores across 11 states, including Jewel-Osco grocery stores. At Walmart, the products were on shelves across 21, states, the FDA said, and at Kroger-owned stores across 10 states.

The letter advises the stores to contact the FDA in writing within 15 days detailing the steps taken to address the violations. NBC Chicago reached out to Target, Kroger, Albertsons and Walmart for comment.

What Is Infant Botulism?

Infant botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. According to the FDA, symptoms may include:

Constipation

Poor feeding

Drooping eyelids

Sluggish pupils

Low muscle tone

Difficulty sucking or swallowing

Weak or altered cry

Generalized weakness

Respiratory difficulty or arrest

The FDA warns that infant botulism can be fatal if not treated promptly.

Impact on Formula Supply

ByHeart's formula accounts for less than 1% of all infant formula sold in the U.S., and the FDA says the recall is not expected to affect nationwide supply or contribute to a formula shortage.

Are Other Brands Involved?

Since August, the FDA has received 83 reports of botulism potentially tied to infant formula. NBC 5 has asked the agency for the names of other brands involved, but no additional information has been released.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2023/11/image-97.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-12-18 16:01:35.069879

The Final Chapter for 2025 The influence of institutional investors like Elliott Management has fundamentally altered the trajectory of the retail market.","As the financial world closes out 2025, a significant shift in the retail landscape is taking center stage. Elliott Management, the powerhouse investment firm known for its aggressive activist campaigns, is reportedly moving into the final stages of preparing a multibillion-pound initial public offering (IPO) for its consolidated bookselling empire: Waterstones and Barnes & Noble. This move, expected to materialize in the second half of 2026, represents more than just a private equity exit; it is a high-stakes bet that physical, curated retail has not only survived the ""Amazon apocalypse"" but has emerged as a premium asset class for institutional investors.

The potential listing, which sources indicate will likely favor the London Stock Exchange over New York, comes at a time when the broader IPO market is finally showing signs of life after a prolonged freeze. By positioning these legacy brands as ""dividend-paying retail champions,"" Elliott is signaling a strategic pivot in how institutional capital views the high street. This event marks a definitive end to the era of retail ""doom-loop"" narratives, replacing them with a blueprint for operational excellence and community-focused commerce.

A Turnaround for the Books: The Path to Public Markets

The journey to this potential 2026 IPO began in 2018 when Elliott Management acquired Waterstones, followed by the 2019 acquisition of Barnes & Noble. At the time, the moves were met with skepticism; the rise of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) seemed to have rendered large-scale physical bookselling obsolete. However, Elliott’s strategy centered on a single, unconventional hire: James Daunt. As the CEO of both chains, Daunt dismantled the centralized, ""big-box"" corporate model, empowering local store managers to curate their own inventories and transform shops into community hubs.

The results have been nothing short of transformative. As of December 2025, the combined entity is reporting approximately $400 million in annual profit on $3 billion in sales. Barnes & Noble alone opened 67 new stores in 2025—the highest number in decades—with plans for another 60 in 2026. To streamline the business for the public markets, Elliott oversaw the sale of Barnes & Noble’s publishing arm, Union Square & Co, to Hachette Book Group in late 2024. This allowed the company to focus exclusively on its retail strengths, a move that has resonated with institutional analysts who favor ""pure-play"" investments.

Initial market reactions have been cautiously optimistic. The successful $6.26 billion IPO of Medline earlier this month has served as a bellwether, proving that there is significant investor appetite for profitable, private-equity-backed businesses with stable cash flows. In London, the prospect of a Waterstones listing is being hailed as a much-needed victory for the exchange, which has struggled to attract high-profile retail listings in recent years.

Winners and Losers in the Reimagined Retail Space

Elliott Management stands as the primary winner in this scenario, poised to realize a massive return on an investment that many deemed too risky six years ago. By successfully navigating the ""James Daunt effect,"" Elliott has demonstrated that institutional investors can do more than just strip assets; they can revitalize them. Conversely, Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. (NYSE: BNED)—a separate public entity that manages college bookstores—continues to face volatility, highlighting the stark contrast between the thriving retail arm and the more challenged academic sector.

For Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), the resurgence of Barnes & Noble represents a rare check on its dominance. While the e-commerce giant still controls roughly half of the U.S. print book market, the ""discovery"" experience of a physical B&N store has become a competitive moat that algorithms have yet to replicate. Publishing giants like News Corp (NASDAQ: NWSA), which owns HarperCollins, and Pearson plc (NYSE: PSO) also stand to benefit. A healthy, expanding physical retail footprint provides these publishers with essential shelf space for ""mid-list"" authors who often get lost in the infinite scroll of online marketplaces.

However, the ""losers"" in this shift may be the smaller, independent bookstores that lack the scale and institutional backing of an Elliott-funded giant. While the ""BookTok"" trend has boosted the entire industry, the aggressive expansion of B&N into suburban markets—often opening stores directly across from independents—could lead to a consolidation of the ""experience-led"" retail market, leaving smaller players squeezed by the very trends they helped start.

The Broader Institutional Shift: From Real Estate to ""Experience""

The Elliott move is not an isolated incident but part of a wider trend of institutional activism reshaping the retail sector in 2024 and 2025. We are seeing a divergence in strategy: some activists are focusing on real estate monetization, while others, like Elliott, are betting on operational revitalization. For instance, Macy's, Inc. (NYSE: M) has spent much of 2025 fending off pressure from Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital to unlock the value of its massive real estate portfolio, valued at nearly $9 billion. Similarly, Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS) remains under pressure from Vision One Management Partners to explore a sale or spin-off of its store assets.

In contrast, Elliott’s recent $1 billion+ stake in Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU) mirrors its Barnes & Noble strategy—focusing on leadership and brand revitalization rather than just asset stripping. This ""Experience-Led"" model is also evident in the blockbuster merger of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, backed by Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE: APO). That deal notably included minority investments from Amazon and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE: CRM), signaling that even tech giants recognize the value of physical luxury retail when backed by institutional discipline and AI-driven personalization.

This shift suggests that institutional investors are moving away from the ""retail is dead"" mantra toward a more nuanced ""retail is evolving"" thesis. The focus is now on companies that can offer what the digital world cannot: a ""third place"" for social interaction and sensory engagement. The regulatory implications are also significant; as these large, institutionally-backed entities grow, we may see increased scrutiny from antitrust regulators concerned about the consolidation of physical retail power.

What Comes Next: The 2026 Window and Beyond

Looking toward 2026, the success of the Waterstones/Barnes & Noble IPO will depend heavily on the macroeconomic environment and the continued cooling of inflation. If the listing proceeds as planned in the second half of the year, it will likely set a valuation benchmark for other private-equity-owned retail assets. We may see a ""follow-the-leader"" effect, where firms like Permira or Roark Capital look to the public markets for their own retail portfolios, such as Golden Goose or Subway.

Strategic pivots will be required for the combined bookselling entity as it enters the public sphere. Investors will be looking for a clear digital strategy that complements, rather than competes with, the physical stores. The integration of advanced data analytics—perhaps through partnerships similar to the Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) involvement in the Saks-Neiman deal—will be crucial for maintaining the ""curated"" feel at a public-company scale. The challenge for James Daunt will be maintaining the ""indie"" spirit of his stores while answering to the quarterly demands of public shareholders.

The Final Chapter for 2025

The influence of institutional investors like Elliott Management has fundamentally altered the trajectory of the retail market. By applying a combination of rigorous financial discipline and a deep respect for the ""craft"" of bookselling, Elliott has created a blueprint for how legacy brands can thrive in the 21st century. The upcoming IPO is not just an exit strategy; it is a validation of the idea that physical stores are a vital part of the modern social and economic fabric.

As we move into 2026, investors should keep a close eye on the formal filing dates for the Waterstones/B&N listing and monitor the performance of other activist-targeted retailers like Macy's and Lululemon. The ""Elliott Playbook"" has proven that with the right leadership and a focus on customer experience, even the most ""outdated"" industries can become market darlings once again. The next twelve months will determine if this retail renaissance is a permanent shift or a well-timed exit by some of the world's most sophisticated capital managers.

It's a case of second time lucky for J&J, as the FDA turned down its first marketing application for the subcutaneous variant of Rybrevant (amivantamab) last year due to manufacturing quality concerns.
That was seen as a major setback to J&J's stated ambition to grow the drug into a $5 billion-a-year blockbuster.
The green light for Rybrevant Faspro – which combines amivantamab with hyaluronidase – means that the drug is the first subcutaneous therapy cleared by the FDA for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and reduces dosing time from hours to minutes with reduced administration-related reactions, according to J&J.
So far, the growth of Rybrevant has been held back by complicated administration that sometimes needs split dosing, prolonged infusion times, and side effects – now overcome by Rybrevant Faspro – and J&J is now expecting sales to accelerate.","Johnson & Johnson has claimed FDA approval for Rybrevant Faspro, a subcutaneous version of its EGFRxMET bispecific antibody, for all the indications approved for the current, intravenous formulation.

The IV formulation of Rybrevant has four FDA approvals in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory EGFR-mutated NSCLC – as a monotherapy and in combination with other drugs, including chemotherapy and J&J's companion EGFR inhibitor Lazcluze (lazertinib).

It has been billed as a major competitor to market-leading EGFR inhibitor Tagrisso (osimertinib) from AstraZeneca, which is dosed orally. Tagrisso made sales of $5.8 billion last year but was bested by the Rybrevant/Lazcluze in the MARIPOSA trial on the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).

So far, the growth of Rybrevant has been held back by complicated administration that sometimes needs split dosing, prolonged infusion times, and side effects – now overcome by Rybrevant Faspro – and J&J is now expecting sales to accelerate. In the third quarter, the combined turnover of Rybrevant and Lazcluze reached $198 million, driven by the MARIPOSA readout.

The approval of the subcutaneous version comes on the back of the PALOMA-3 and improved clinical outcomes trial, which showed equivalence with IV Rybrevant at achieving blood levels of amivantamab and improved clinical outcomes, including extended overall survival (OS).

AZ has hit back with a recent approval for Tagrisso in combination with chemotherapy, which seems to have matched Rybrevant on PFS and OS in the FLAURA2 trial, and the two companies are now engaged in a marketing battle to extol the virtues of their respective datasets in the frontline setting.

""Patients now have a simple, chemotherapy-free frontline option that not only targets the disease more precisely but also significantly improves survival,"" commented Joelle Fathi, chief healthcare delivery officer for the GO2 for Lung Cancer patient advocacy organisation.

The savings accounts, set to launch next July for children with a U.S. Social Security number, were introduced earlier this year as part of Trump’s tax bill. Babies born between 2025 and 2028 will automatically receive a $1,000 deposit from the U.S. Treasury Department. All children under the age of 18 are eligible to open an account.

The government is encouraging parents, philanthropists and local governments to contribute to the tax-advantaged accounts, which can be invested in stock market index funds and later convert into traditional IRAs when recipients turn 18. Funds can eventually be used for expenses such as education, job training and buying a first home.

Dalio, whose net worth is estimated at $15.4 billion, praised the accounts as a tool for building financial literacy among children. “These Trump Accounts are great not just because they put money into stocks for these young people but also because they draw their attention toward how finance, stocks, companies and capitalism work to improve society and can work for them,” he wrote in a post on X yesterday (Dec. 17).

His announcement mirrors a similar contribution from Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. Earlier this month, the couple unveiled a $6.25 million donation that will place $250 into the Trump accounts of 25 million children aged ten and under who aren’t eligible for the Treasury’s seed deposit.

The Dalios and the Dells have collaborated philanthropically before. In 2020, the Dalios purchased 60,000 Dell laptops to support virtual education during the Covid pandemic. Dalio’s broader charitable efforts also include more than $7 million in contributions to Dalio Philanthropies, his family foundation, as well as roughly $280 million donated to nonprofits in Connecticut.

The Dalios’ support for Trump accounts also ties into a new component of the initiative known as the “50 State Challenge” which aims to encourage philanthropists to expand funding in their local communities. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the program during a press conference yesterday. “Ray has made the first move, but we welcome other donors and foundations in Connecticut and across the country to join him,” Bessent said, adding that 20 state governments are also in talks about supplementing the accounts.

The government has also launched trumpaccounts.gov, a website dedicated to the initiative that highlights “additional support” from at least eight companies nationwide. In most cases, corporate participation has taken the form of matching government contributions, with companies such as Dell, BNY and BlackRock pledging to supplement the Treasury’s $1,000 deposits for their employees’ children.

Not every billionaire, however, is convinced. While calling the accounts a “nice gesture,” Elon Musk took to X yesterday to describe the initiative as unnecessary in light of A.I.’s economic potential.

“There will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money. There will be universal high income,” Musk wrote, echoing a Silicon Valley belief that technology-driven productivity gains will eventually provide people with steady, recurring payouts.",https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/GettyImages-2243629590.jpg?quality=80,N,,2025-12-18 15:01:54.121142

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LEVI. Levi Strauss & Co.'s share was trading at $22.55 as of December 16th. LEVI’s trailing and forward P/E were 16.75 and 15.17 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) is emerging as a prime beneficiary of a structural shift back toward premium denim, supported by compelling consumer search data that suggests demand is durable rather than fashion-cycle driven. As the world’s largest branded apparel company and a global leader in jeanswear, Levi’s operates across more than 110 countries and generates roughly $6.2 billion in annual revenue through wholesale, direct-to-consumer, and e-commerce channels.

Alternative data indicates that consumer interest in denim has rebounded meaningfully, with Google searches for Levi’s jeans up 59% year over year, overall Levi’s brand searches up 52%, and category-level denim searches up 25%, all reaching five-year highs. This momentum has accelerated throughout 2025 and reflects converging tailwinds such as return-to-office trends, Y2K-inspired styles, and a preference for versatile, utility-oriented apparel that aligns with Levi’s heritage positioning.

High-intent e-commerce indicators reinforce this signal, with Amazon searches for Levi’s up 47% year over year and Google Shopping searches surging 94%, suggesting elevated conversion intent rather than casual browsing. Importantly, these search trends correlate strongly with operational performance. Levi’s Q3 2025 results exceeded expectations, with revenue of $1.54 billion growing 7% year over year, gross margins expanding to 61.7%, and EPS of $0.34 beating consensus. The company has now delivered 12 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, while direct-to-consumer sales rose 11% and e-commerce grew 16%, highlighting successful digital execution.

Strategically, Levi’s premium positioning and culturally resonant marketing, exemplified by its “REIIMAGINE” campaign with Beyoncé, have translated into tangible results, including 12% growth in women’s denim. Management’s decision to raise full-year guidance underscores confidence in sustained momentum. Overall, the breadth and intensity of consumer search growth provide a buffer against execution risks and support a probability-weighted outlook of continued outperformance into mid-2026.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on V.F. Corporation (VFC) by Fun-Imagination-2488 in April 2025, which highlighted the turnaround under new leadership, brand revitalization efforts, margin recovery, and debt reduction. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 62.84% since our coverage. This is because the turnaround execution gained investor confidence. The thesis still stands as operational discipline continues. Paradox Intelligence shares a similar thesis but emphasizes alternative data and demand-led momentum.

Levi Strauss & Co. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 37 hedge fund portfolios held LEVI at the end of the third quarter which was 36 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of LEVI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

While the FDA has voluntarily requested companies phase out artificial dyes by the end of next year, several states — most notably Texas, California and West Virginia — have gone further with outright bans or labeling restrictions on foods containing certain ingredients.

Changes all round Osborne’s appointment comes at a pivotal moment as OpenAI faces mounting challenges while pursuing aggressive global expansion.","The revolving doors at OpenAI are spinning once more as there is another recruitment change.

Former UK Chancellor George Osborne has officially joined OpenAI to spearhead the company’s global expansion efforts. The 54-year-old retired Conservative politician will become managing director of the firm’s ambitious “OpenAI for Countries” initiative, marking a dramatic career pivot that signals how AI is reshaping global politics and economics.

Osborne will assume his new London-based role next month, a BBC report confirms. The appointment comes as OpenAI aggressively pursues international partnerships, with the program designed to help governments build AI infrastructure and integrate AI into public services.

Major tech companies have been investing heavily in UK AI development, with Microsoft announcing a $30 billion infrastructure commitment and an additional $1 billion from companies like Nvidia and Google.

A ‘hire’ purpose

OpenAI’s decision to recruit Osborne represents a calculated move to bridge Silicon Valley innovation with European regulatory frameworks. The former Chancellor, who controlled the UK’s treasury from 2010 to 2016, brings unprecedented government experience to a company valued at approximately $750 billion.

Osborne expressed enthusiasm about joining what he described as “the most exciting and promising company in the world right now,” following conversations with CEO Sam Altman and COO Brad Lightcap, sources close to the matter indicate. The OpenAI for Countries initiative extends the company’s $500 billion “Stargate” data center project beyond American borders, with existing partnerships already established in Argentina, Australia, Germany, and South Korea.

Osborne will be very busy. Fintech firm Coinbase has just appointed him to chair its internal Global Advisory Council. Osborne, who originally joined Coinbase as an advisor in January 2024, will now lead the company’s global strategy and influence international policymakers.

On his X account, Osborne states he is also co-host of the Political Currency podcast, Chair of British Museum, and president of Northern Powerhouse Partnership. That said, he is stepping away from his investment banking position at Evercore.

Global AI politics

This appointment highlights how AI has evolved into critical national infrastructure, with early governance decisions poised to influence global economics and geopolitics for decades. OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane emphasized that the hire reflects “a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure,” with timing crucial for shaping how technology develops worldwide, Monday’s company statements reveal.

Osborne joins a growing trend of British political figures transitioning to major tech companies. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently accepted advisory roles with OpenAI rival Anthropic and Microsoft in October, while Nick Clegg concluded his seven-year tenure with Meta’s global affairs team earlier this year.

Changes all round

Osborne’s appointment comes at a pivotal moment as OpenAI faces mounting challenges while pursuing aggressive global expansion. The company is currently defending multiple lawsuits from families whose children died by suicide after interacting with ChatGPT, including the family of 16-year-old Adam Raine who killed himself in April.

While Osborne arrives, others have left.

Hannah Wong, the executive who steered OpenAI through its most chaotic period, has announced she’s leaving the company.

Wong’s exit continues a troubling pattern that has plagued OpenAI throughout 2025.

Four months ago, co-founder John Schulman joined rival Anthropic while another co-founder Greg Brockman took a sabbatical. Then in September, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati and two other research leaders announced departures, creating a significant brain drain from the company’s leadership ranks.

Tom Cunningham, an economics researcher, also left in September after growing frustrated with limits around publishing certain kinds of work.",https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2025/12/George-Osborne.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:05:40.941091

The lawsuit, originally filed by the Federal Trade Commission, targets the company’s Uber One service. While Uber markets the subscription as a way for users to save money on rides and food deliveries, prosecutors argue the program relies on ""dark patterns"" and unfair billing practices to pad the company's bottom line.

“When a consumer signs up for a subscription service, they expect to get the savings that are advertised and to be able to try it out without being unlawfully charged,” Nessel said in a statement Thursday. “They shouldn’t have to jump through hoops just to cancel a service they no longer want.”

Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges several violations of consumer trust:

Uber allegedly used ""negative option marketing,"" a practice where customers are automatically charged when a free trial ends without explicit secondary consent.

The suit claims Uber exaggerated how much money subscribers would save by joining Uber One.

Prosecutors allege Uber charged some customers before their scheduled billing dates, including those still within their trial period.

The lawsuit calls the process of canceling Uber One as intentionally difficult, designed to frustrate users into maintaining paid memberships.

Nessel is seeking restitution for Michigan residents, along with civil penalties and a permanent injunction, alleging violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act and the federal Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act.

Michigan is joined in the coalition by 19 other states, including Ohio, Illinois and New York, as well as the District of Columbia and local prosecutors in California.

A trial is not expected to begin until February 2027. In the meantime, Michigan residents who believe they have been unfairly charged by subscription services can file a complaint through the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Team.

AI’s next frontier isn’t merely smarter chat-based assistants, it’s autonomous agents that reason, plan, and execute across entire systems. But to accomplish this, enterprise developers need to move from prototypes to production-ready AI agents that scale securely. This challenge grows as enterprise problems become more complex, requiring architectures where multiple specialized agents collaborate to accomplish sophisticated tasks.

Building AI agents in development differs fundamentally from deploying them at scale. Developers face a chasm between prototype and production, struggling with performance optimization, resource scaling, security implementation, and operational monitoring. Typical approaches leave teams juggling multiple disconnected tools and frameworks, making it difficult to maintain consistency from development through deployment with optimal performance. That’s where the powerful combination of Strands Agents, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, and NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit shine. You can use these tools together to design sophisticated multi-agent systems, orchestrate them, and scale them securely in production with built-in observability, agent evaluation, profiling, and performance optimization. This post demonstrates how to use this integrated solution to build, evaluate, optimize, and deploy AI agents on Amazon Web Services (AWS) from initial development through production deployment.

Foundation for enterprise-ready agents

The open source Strands Agents framework simplifies AI agent development through its model-driven approach. Developers create agents using three components:

Foundation models (FMs) such as Amazon Nova, Claude by Anthropic, and Meta’s Llama

Tools (over 20 built-in, plus custom tools using Python decorators)

Prompts that guide agent behavior.

The framework includes built-in integrations with AWS services such as Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), local testing support, continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) workflows, multiple deployment options, and OpenTelemetry observability.

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is an agentic platform for building, deploying, and operating effective agents securely at scale. It has composable, fully managed services:

Runtime for secure, serverless agent deployment

Memory for short-term and long-term context retention

Gateway for secure tool access by transforming APIs and AWS Lambda functions into agent-compatible tools and connecting to existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

Identity for secure agent identity and access management

Code Interpreter for secure code execution in sandbox environments

Browser for fast, secure web interactions

Observability for comprehensive operational insights to trace, debug, and monitor agent performance

Evaluations for continuously inspecting agent quality based on real-world behavior

Policy to keep agents within defined boundaries

These services, designed to work independently or together, abstract the complexity of building, deploying, and operating sophisticated agents while working with open source frameworks or models delivering enterprise-grade security and reliability.

Agent evaluation, profiling, and optimization with NeMo Agent Toolkit

NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit is an open source framework designed to help developers build, profile, and optimize AI agents regardless of their underlying framework. Its framework-agnostic approach means it works seamlessly with Strands Agents, LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, and custom enterprise frameworks. In addition, different frameworks can interoperate when they’re connected in the NeMo Agent Toolkit.

The toolkit’s profiler provides complete agent workflow analysis that tracks token usage, timing, workflow-specific latency, throughput, and run times for individual agents and tools, enabling targeted performance improvements. Built on the toolkit’s evaluation harness, it includes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-specific evaluators (such as answer accuracy, context relevance, response groundedness, and agent trajectory) and supports custom evaluators for specialized use cases, enabling targeted performance optimization. The automated hyperparameter optimizer profiles and systematically discovers optimal settings for parameters such as temperature, top_p, and max_tokens while maximizing accuracy, groundedness, context relevance, and minimizing token usage, latency, and optimizing for other custom metrics as well. This automated approach profiles your complete agent workflows, identified bottlenecks, and uncovers optimal parameter combinations that manual tuning might miss. The toolkit’s intelligent GPU sizing calculator alleviates guesswork by simulating agent latency and concurrency scenarios and predicting precise GPU infrastructure requirements for production deployment.

The toolkit’s observability integration connects with popular monitoring services including Arize Phoenix, Weights & Biases Weave, Langfuse, and OpenTelemetry supported systems, like Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Observability, creating a continuous feedback loop for ongoing optimization and maintenance.

Real-world implementation

This example demonstrates a knowledge-based agent that retrieves and synthesizes information from web URLs to answer user queries. Built using Strands Agents with integrated NeMo Agent Toolkit, the solution is containerized for quick deployment in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime and takes advantage of Bedrock AgentCore services, such as AgentCore Observability. Additionally, developers have the flexibility to integrate with fully managed models in Amazon Bedrock, models hosted in Amazon SageMaker AI, containerized models in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) or other model API endpoints. The overall architecture is designed for a streamlined workflow, moving from agent definition and optimization to containerization and scalable deployment.

The following architecture diagram illustrates an agent built with Strands Agents integrating NeMo Agent Toolkit deployed in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

Agent development and evaluation

Start by defining your agent and workflows in Strands Agents, then wrap it with NeMo Agent Toolkit to configure components such as a large language model (LLM) for inference and tools. Refer to the Strands Agents and NeMo Agent Toolkit integration example in GitHub for a detailed setup guide. After configuring your environment, validate your agent logic by running a single workflow from the command line with an example prompt:

The following is the truncated terminal output:

Instead of executing a single workflow and exiting, to simulate a real-world scenario, you can spin up a long-running API server capable of handling concurrent requests with the serve command:

The following is the truncated terminal output:

The agent is now running locally on port 8080. To interact with the agent, open a new terminal and execute the following cURL command. This will generate output similar to the previous nat run step but the agent runs continuously as a persistent service rather than executing one time and exiting. This simulates the production environment where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore will run the agent as a containerized service:

The following is the truncated terminal output:

Agent profiling and workflow performance monitoring

With the agent running, the next step is to establish a performance baseline. To illustrate the depth of insights available, in this example, we use a self-managed Llama 3.3 70B Instruct NIM on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) P4de.24xlarge instance powered by NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs (8xA100 80 GB GPU) running on Amazon EKS. We use the nat eval command to evaluate the agent and generate the analysis:

nat eval --config_file examples/frameworks/strands_demo/configs/eval_config.yml

The following is the truncated terminal output:

The command generates detailed artifacts that include JSON files per evaluation metric (such as accuracy, groundedness, relevance, and Trajectory accuracy) showing scores from 0–1, reasoning traces, retrieved contexts, and aggregated averages. Additional information in the artifacts generated include workflow outputs, standardized tables, profile traces, and compact summaries for latency and token efficiency. This multi-metric sweep provides a holistic view of agent quality and behavior. The evaluation highlights that while the agent achieved consistent groundedness scores—meaning answers were reliably supported by sources—there is still an opportunity to improve retrieval relevance. The profile trace output contains workflow-specific latency, throughput, and runtime at 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals. The command generates a Gantt chart of the agent flow and nested stack analysis to pinpoint exactly where bottlenecks exist, as seen in the following figure. It also reports concurrency spikes and token efficiency so you can understand precisely how scaling impacts prompt and completion usage.

During the profiling, nat spawns eight concurrent agent workflows (shown in orange bars in the chart), which is the default concurrency configuration during evaluation. The p90 latency for the workflow shown is approximately 58.9 seconds. Crucially, the data confirmed that response generation was the primary bottleneck, with the longest LLM segments taking roughly 61.4 seconds. Meanwhile, non-LLM overhead remained minimal. HTTP requests averaged only 0.7–1.2 seconds, and knowledge base access was negligible. Using this level of granularity, you can now identify and optimize specific bottlenecks in the agent workflows.

Agent performance optimization

After profiling, refine the agent’s parameters to balance quality, performance, and cost. Manual tuning of LLM settings like temperature and top_p is often a game of guesswork. The NeMo Agent Toolkit turns this into a data-driven science. You can use the built-in optimizer to perform a systematic sweep across your parameter search space:

nat optimize --config_file examples/frameworks/strands_demo/configs/optimizer_config.yml

The following is the truncated terminal output:

This command launches an automated sweep across key LLM parameters, such as temperature, top_p, and max_tokens, as defined in the config (in this case optimizer_config.yml) search space. The optimizer runs 20 trials with three repetitions each, using weighted evaluation metrics to automatically discover optimal model settings. It might take up to 15–20 minutes for the optimizer to run 20 trials.

The toolkit evaluates each parameter set against a weighted multi-objective score, aiming to maximize quality (for example, accuracy, groundedness, or tool use) while minimizing token cost and latency. Upon completion, it generates detailed performance artifacts and summary tables so you can quickly identify and select the optimal configuration for production. The following is the hyperparameter optimizer configuration:

In this example, NeMo Agent Toolkit Optimize systematically evaluated parameter configurations and identified temperature ≈ 0.7, top_p ≈ 1.0, and max_tokens ≈ 6k (6144) as optimal configuration yielding the highest accuracy across 20 trials. This configuration delivered a 35% accuracy improvement over baseline while simultaneously achieving 20% token efficiency gains compared to the 8192 max_tokens setting—maximizing both performance and cost efficiency for these production deployments.

The optimizer plots pairwise pareto curves, as shown in the following pairwise matrix comparison charts, to analyze trade-offs between different parameters. The parallel coordinates plot, that follows the matrix comparison chart, shows optimal trials (red lines) achieving high quality scores (0.8–1.0) across accuracy, groundedness, and relevance while trading off some efficiency as token usage and latency drop to 0.6–0.8 on the normalized scale. The pairwise matrix confirms strong correlations between quality metrics and reveals actual token consumption clustered tightly around 2,500–3,100 tokens across all trials. These results indicate that further gains in accuracy and token efficiency might be possible through prompt engineering. This is something that development teams can achieve using NeMo Agent Toolkit’s prompt optimization capabilities, helping reduce costs while maximizing performance.

The following image shows the pairwise matrix comparison:

The following image shows the parallel coordinates plot:

Right-sizing production GPU infrastructure

After your agent is optimized and you’ve finalized the runtime or inference configuration, you can shift your focus to assessing your model deployment infrastructure. If you’re self-managing your model deployment on a fleet of EC2 GPU-powered instances, then one of the most difficult aspects of moving agents to production is predicting exactly what compute resources are necessary to support a target use case and concurrent users without overrunning the budget or causing timeouts. The NeMo Agent Toolkit GPU sizing calculator addresses this challenge by using your agent’s actual performance profile to determine the optimal cluster size for specific service level objectives (SLOs), enabling right-sizing that alleviates the trade-off between performance and cost. To generate a sizing profile, you run the sizing calculator across a range of concurrency levels (for example, 1–32 simultaneous users):

Executing this on our reference EC2 P4de.24xlarge instance powered by NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs running on Amazon EKS for a Llama 3.3 70B Instruct NIM produced the following capacity analysis:

As shown in the following chart, calculated concurrency scales almost linearly with both latency and end‑to‑end runtime, with P95 LLM latency and workflow runtime demonstrating near-perfect trend fits (R² ≈ 0.977/0.983). Each additional concurrent request introduces a predictable latency penalty, suggesting the system operates within a linear capacity zone where throughput can be optimized by adjusting latency tolerance.

With the sizing metrics captured, you can estimate the GPU cluster size for a specific concurrency and latency. For example, to support 25 concurrent users with a target workflow runtime of 50 seconds, you can run the calculator:

This workflow analyzes current performance metrics and generates a resource recommendation. In our example scenario, the tool calculates that to meet strict latency requirements for 25 simultaneous users, approximately 30 GPUs are required based on the following formula:

The following is the output from the sizing estimation:

Production agent deployment to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

After evaluating, profiling, and optimizing your agent, deploy it to production. Although running the agent locally is sufficient for testing, enterprise deployment requires an agent runtime that helps provide security, scalability, and robust memory management without the overhead of managing infrastructure. This is where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime shines—providing enterprise-grade serverless agent runtime without the infrastructure overhead. Refer to the step-by-step deployment guide in the NeMo Agent Toolkit Repository. By packaging your optimized agent in a container and deploying it to the serverless Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, you elevate your prototype agent to a resilient application for long-running tasks and concurrent user requests. After you deploy the agent, visibility becomes critical. This integration creates a unified observability experience, transforming opaque black-box execution into deep visibility. You gain exact traces, spans, and latency breakdowns for every interaction in production, integrated into Bedrock AgentCore Observability using OpenTelemetry.

The following screenshot shows the Amazon CloudWatch dashboard displaying Amazon Bedrock AgentCore traces and spans, visualizing the execution path and latency of the deployed Strands agent.

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore services extend well beyond agent runtime management and observability. Your deployed agents can seamlessly use additional Bedrock AgentCore services, including Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity for authentication and authorization, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway for tools access, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory for context-awareness, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Code Interpreter for secure code execution, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser for web interactions, to create enterprise-ready agents.

Conclusion

Production AI agents need performance visibility, optimization, and reliable infrastructure. For the example use case, this integration delivered on all three fronts: achieving 20% token efficiency gains, 35% accuracy improvements for the example use case, and performance-tuned GPU infrastructure calibrated for target concurrency. By combining Strands Agents for foundational agent development and orchestration, the NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit for deep agent profiling, optimization, and right-sizing production GPU infrastructure, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for secure, scalable agent infrastructure, developers can have an end-to-end solution that helps provide predictable outcomes. You can now build, evaluate, optimize, and deploy agents at scale on AWS with this integrated solution.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LEVI. Levi Strauss & Co.'s share was trading at $22.55 as of December 16th. LEVI’s trailing and forward P/E were 16.75 and 15.17 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) is emerging as a prime beneficiary of a structural shift back toward premium denim, supported by compelling consumer search data that suggests demand is durable rather than fashion-cycle driven. As the world’s largest branded apparel company and a global leader in jeanswear, Levi’s operates across more than 110 countries and generates roughly $6.2 billion in annual revenue through wholesale, direct-to-consumer, and e-commerce channels.

Alternative data indicates that consumer interest in denim has rebounded meaningfully, with Google searches for Levi’s jeans up 59% year over year, overall Levi’s brand searches up 52%, and category-level denim searches up 25%, all reaching five-year highs. This momentum has accelerated throughout 2025 and reflects converging tailwinds such as return-to-office trends, Y2K-inspired styles, and a preference for versatile, utility-oriented apparel that aligns with Levi’s heritage positioning.

High-intent e-commerce indicators reinforce this signal, with Amazon searches for Levi’s up 47% year over year and Google Shopping searches surging 94%, suggesting elevated conversion intent rather than casual browsing. Importantly, these search trends correlate strongly with operational performance. Levi’s Q3 2025 results exceeded expectations, with revenue of $1.54 billion growing 7% year over year, gross margins expanding to 61.7%, and EPS of $0.34 beating consensus. The company has now delivered 12 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, while direct-to-consumer sales rose 11% and e-commerce grew 16%, highlighting successful digital execution.

Strategically, Levi’s premium positioning and culturally resonant marketing, exemplified by its “REIIMAGINE” campaign with Beyoncé, have translated into tangible results, including 12% growth in women’s denim. Management’s decision to raise full-year guidance underscores confidence in sustained momentum. Overall, the breadth and intensity of consumer search growth provide a buffer against execution risks and support a probability-weighted outlook of continued outperformance into mid-2026.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on V.F. Corporation (VFC) by Fun-Imagination-2488 in April 2025, which highlighted the turnaround under new leadership, brand revitalization efforts, margin recovery, and debt reduction. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 62.84% since our coverage. This is because the turnaround execution gained investor confidence. The thesis still stands as operational discipline continues. Paradox Intelligence shares a similar thesis but emphasizes alternative data and demand-led momentum.

Levi Strauss & Co. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 37 hedge fund portfolios held LEVI at the end of the third quarter which was 36 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of LEVI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

See our latest analysis for Kraft Heinz.

The leadership reboot and breakup story is landing against a tougher backdrop, with a year to date share price return of negative 19.6 percent and a five year total shareholder return of negative 10.3 percent. However, the recent one week lift hints that investors are starting to price in at least some turnaround potential.

If this shake up has you rethinking your defensive staples, it could be worth scanning healthcare stocks to see which names the market is rewarding for steady growth and resilience right now.

With the stock still trading well below many estimates of intrinsic value despite years of sluggish returns, the next question is simple: is this a genuine reset for Kraft Heinz, or are markets already baking in the growth ahead?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 8.6% Undervalued

With Kraft Heinz last closing at $24.75 against a narrative fair value near $27, the story hinges on a slow but material profitability rebuild.

Ongoing portfolio optimization, divesting non core brands, and reinvesting into high margin segments and key power brands should lead to structurally higher operating margins and improved profitability in future periods.

The potential deal would value OpenAI at over $500 billion; however, sources caution that negotiations remain fluid and terms could still change significantly.

The talks come as OpenAI prepares for a potential initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion. This investment would add Amazon to a growing list of major technology companies betting heavily on OpenAI’s capabilities, following substantial deals with Nvidia and Oracle earlier this year. Amazon’s potential investment is more than just a capital injection, it could reshape the competitive landscape of enterprise AI solutions and challenge long-standing partners like Microsoft.

Investment Details Point to Strategic Computing Partnership

As part of the deal, OpenAI is reportedly planning to use Amazon’s Trainium chips. These specialized chips compete directly with offerings from Nvidia and Google in the AI computing market, suggesting the partnership goes beyond financial investment into deeper technical collaboration.

Amazon’s financing could serve as an anchor for a broader fundraising round involving additional investors. This approach would allow OpenAI to secure significant capital while diversifying its investor base beyond its primary backer, Microsoft.

Beyond the investment itself, discussions reportedly include OpenAI selling an enterprise version of ChatGPT to Amazon. This commercial component would give Amazon access to OpenAI’s conversational AI technology for integration into its business services. However, the scope of integration rights remains unclear, particularly whether Amazon could incorporate ChatGPT features into consumer-facing applications such as shopping tools.

Developing advanced AI systems requires massive computing power, creating opportunities for cloud providers like Amazon to monetize their infrastructure. This investment would position Amazon to benefit both as an investor in OpenAI and as a provider of the computational backbone powering its AI models.

Amazon’s Move Challenges Microsoft’s OpenAI Exclusivity

Amazon’s possible investment marks a major shift in OpenAI’s corporate relationships, particularly with Microsoft. Microsoft currently holds a 27% stake in OpenAI and has exclusive rights to sell OpenAI models to its cloud customers.

This arrangement has allowed Microsoft to power AI products such as Copilot with OpenAI’s technology, giving the company a significant competitive edge in the enterprise AI market. It enabled Microsoft to deploy OpenAI’s models immediately while building its own internal AI capabilities.

However, since OpenAI restructured away from its nonprofit origins in October, it has been free to pursue broader partnerships with other firms.

An Amazon investment would give the company direct access to the technology underpinning Microsoft’s recent AI product launches, potentially leveling the competitive field. It could also allow Amazon to receive future OpenAI developments that the company releases alongside Microsoft.

Implications for Microsoft’s AI Product Strategy

The potential Amazon-OpenAI partnership raises important questions about Microsoft’s standing in the AI landscape. While Microsoft retains its equity stake and exclusive cloud sales rights, Amazon’s involvement could influence which new OpenAI capabilities remain exclusive to the Microsoft ecosystem.

As OpenAI develops next-generation AI technologies, it may now have greater flexibility in distributing those innovations across different partners.

Microsoft’s AI products – especially Copilot – have relied heavily on early access to OpenAI’s models and features, although the company has made recent pivots to reduce this dependency. Even if existing agreements safeguard current integrations, future developments from OpenAI might no longer default to Microsoft.

Amazon’s significant investment could include provisions for parallel or early access to emerging technologies, potentially weakening Microsoft’s advantage.

The competitive dynamics go beyond access to AI models. As Amazon integrates OpenAI technology into its cloud services, it could create AI-powered business tools that directly challenge Microsoft’s offerings.

The Federal Trade Commission, a consumer protection agency, is looking into the grocery delivery giant's use of AI pricing tools after an investigation found it was charging customers substantially different prices for the same items, according to a Reuters report Wednesday.

An investigation by Consumer Reports, Groundwork Collaborative, and More Perfect Union published earlier this month found prices for about three-quarters of surveyed items on Instacart varied by up to 23% from user to user among volunteers shopping at the same time. The report estimated such price variations could add up to about $1,200 per year in additional costs for the typical household shopping on Instacart. A review of an Investopedia editor's transactions on Instacart found that prices for a range of products at Costco (COST) also varied from one order to the next.

""Much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,"" a company spokesperson told Investopedia. ""First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing—prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores,” the spokesperson said.

The FTC said in an emailed statement Thursday that it has a ""longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations. But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart’s alleged pricing practices.""

The FTC sent Instacart a civil investigative demand over its Eversight pricing tool, named for a company that Instacart acquired in 2022, Reuters reported. The tool helps retailers test consumer reactions to different prices, and retailers who use the tool could see a 1% to 3% bump in revenue, according to Instacart's website.

Early this year, the FTC said that ""surveillance pricing,"" which Instacart says it does not use, has become more popular among online retailers. With surveillance pricing, companies could use data about a shopper such as their location, browsing history, and even the movements of a computer mouse to guess how much they might be willing to spend and influence displayed prices.

Key Takeaways:

Laura Burdese steps into the CEO role after serving as deputy since 2023.

Jean-Christophe Babin stays on as chairman, head of Bulgari Hotels, and president of the Bulgari Foundation.

The move signals LVMH’s strategic continuity while deepening operational leadership across jewelry and hospitality.

Bulgari will usher in a new era of leadership this July, as Laura Burdese is set to become chief executive officer of the storied Roman jeweler. Her promotion follows a one-year stint as deputy CEO and more than two decades of executive experience across beauty, watches, and luxury retail.

The transition comes as Jean-Christophe Babin, who has led Bulgari since 2013, pivots to focus on key growth verticals within the maison, including its expanding hotel division and philanthropic foundation. He will remain chairman of the Bulgari board, CEO of Bulgari Hotels, and president of the Bulgari Foundation, continuing to report to Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH Watches & Jewelry.

Burdese, also reporting to Bianchi, has been instrumental in Bulgari’s recent marketing evolution and helped oversee the development of its new high-tech jewelry manufacturing site in Valenza, inaugurated this spring. That facility—now the largest of its kind dedicated to a single brand—includes Scuola Bulgari, a new public training school aimed at fostering craftsmanship talent within Italy.

The leadership shift reflects a carefully choreographed handover between two seasoned executives who have worked closely to elevate Bulgari’s profile through both product innovation and branded experiences. Burdese’s ascent also reinforces LVMH’s focus on internal succession and cross-sector leadership development. She previously led Acqua di Parma and held senior roles at Swatch Group and L’Oréal.

During his tenure, Babin was pivotal in advancing Bulgari’s watchmaking credentials—most recently celebrated with the Octo Finissimo Ultra COSC, the world’s thinnest mechanical timepiece. His leadership also extended to hospitality, with Bulgari Hotels now present in Rome, Paris, Tokyo, and beyond, with further openings slated for Miami and Los Angeles.

As Burdese steps into the top job, the maison is positioned to continue its strategic expansion across jewelry, watches, hospitality, and cultural programming, supported by a legacy of Italian craftsmanship and a sharpened global vision.",https://theimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bulgari-Appoints-Laura-Burdese-as-CEO-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:02:56.458535

In the US, Vantage began the data centre ABS market for what the Securities and Exchange Commission deems qualified institutional buyers in 2018.
As part of data centre financing, lenders must account for refinancing risk, which is intertwined with the risk that data centre tenants will not renew their contracts.
Europe does at least have the example of the US market to follow, where there is a thriving data centre ABS market.
“The need for data centre financing is a very good test [for Europe’s capital markets],” says Florence Coeroli, UK and global head of engineering at Société Générale.","Since the influential Draghi report on European Union competitiveness was published in September 2024, politicians have embarked upon a series of reforms to shake the bloc out of stagnation.

Many of the reforms identified by Mario Draghi, former ECB president and Italian prime minister, aim to boost GDP growth. Key among them are measures to invigorate capital markets into a so-called Savings and Investment Union, which includes a plan to revitalise securitization.

Securitization’s advocates have largely welcomed the proposals, but so far nothing has been put into practice as parliamentarians deliberate what the European Commission has recommended.

Whether the EU can step up to meet the extraordinary demand for data centres — Morgan Stanley estimates there is a $1.5tr financing gap worldwide for data centres up to 2028 — will provide a big test for this vision of its competitiveness.

Rising to the data centre challenge plays into each of three areas for action Draghi highlights in his report: “closing the innovation gap with the US and China, especially in advanced technologies”; “decarbonisation and competitiveness”; and “increasing security and reducing dependencies”.

The importance of data centres to the first objective is clear, while their huge energy demand makes them an important consideration in the second. The final area plays into the increasingly popular idea of data sovereignty and having control over key infrastructure by locating it domestically.

“One of the things we’ve often seen is a lot of the growth in Europe being driven by countries wanting their own digital infrastructure,” said Latham & Watkins partner Jeremiah Wagner at a GlobalCapital event in London in October. “That’s a big movement and I think that’s driven on a geopolitical basis.”

As an example, in October Italy recognised data centre developer Vantage as carrying out nationally strategic infrastructure investments that support the country’s economic agenda, one of only four companies to achieve the designation. It allows Vantage to gain expedited permission for its developments, but such designations are only part of the picture.

EU data centre developers still need access to affordable financing. In that respect, the bloc is coming from a standing start in each of the three phases of financing needed to develop a data centre.

First is the purchase of the site and gaining permission to build. Then comes the development and construction. Finally, there is the financing backed by the income the data centre generates.

“Where the meat of the financing is done is in that construction phase, because the meat of the [capital expenditure] is in that two-year span… from spade in the ground to when the data centre is complete and operating,” Barclays managing director Gordon Beck said at the same GlobalCapital event.

The project finance market is crucial during the construction phase, when data centre developers raise non-recourse debt from banks and/or institutional investors to pay for the building work.

Projects then typically operate for an initial period, after which the project finance debt is refinanced, often through the securitization or private placement markets.

“In a simplified picture, you need both bank debt and capital markets financing,” says Heiko Ludwig, global head of structured finance at Nord LB. “You need bank debt in the early part because it’s more flexible. Ideally, you’d then put it into the long-term arms of asset managers, pension funds and others… In my opinion, it should not be assumed that there is an endless future supply of very long-term bank debt, like 20 years and longer.”

Before even coming to that, however, developers need to obtain a site to build on. “When you’re speculatively purchasing land with the intent of acquiring power and permits, that’s probably best suited to something in the private credit world or a relatively structured facility and, frankly, a relatively higher risk facility versus the kind of cash flow debt financing that comes later in the piece,” said Beck at the GlobalCapital event.

Even some early construction work can require equity, or other more speculative capital, to line up tenancy contracts and close a project financing.

“For data centre developers, raising finance is a bit chicken and egg,” says Oliver Bradley, global head of digital infrastructure at Macquarie Capital. “Potential tenants want to know how much capacity you have in the next three to six months, which means that developers have to have begun construction, which requires a significant capital commitment.

“To get the tenancy contracts, you need to have financed and partially built your data centre, but to raise debt, you need to have the contracts.”

Given the country’s dominance in AI and data centre investment, the US is by far the largest project finance market for the sector.

“As of Q3 [2025], there is an estimated $70bn-$80bn of non-recourse debt raised to finance data centres in the US,” says Syed Usman Ahmed, head of digital infrastructure at Apterra Infrastructure Capital. “Four years ago the market was around $5bn. By year end, we expect at least $100bn of deals will have closed.”

Much of this non-recourse debt has been provided by banks. For example, two bank-funded US deals that closed in the latter half of this year are the $925m financing for Rowan Digital Infrastructure’s Bauxite hyperscale campus and Lambda’s $275m financing to enlarge its AI data centre portfolio.

The Rowan deal was led by SMBC, MUFG, Mizuho and Société Générale, while the Lambda deal was led and arranged by JP Morgan and syndicated to a wider lender group.

Vantage has also been in the market with a $38bn US data centre financing, which sources have confirmed is likely to be the largest ever project financing for any asset class.

Project finance remains a bank-led market, but institutional investors are increasingly backing greenfield data centre financings. In October, Blue Owl Capital issued $27.3bn of notes through Beignet Investor LLC, a project finance-style holding company, to invest in an 80% interest in a US data centre joint venture with Meta.

Europe is trailing the US in the development and financing of data centres, although transactions such as Bulk Infrastructure’s €410m financing for its N01 Data Center Campus in Norway have closed this year.

“If you look at the data centre capacity due to come online in the next year, it would be about three times larger in the US versus Europe,” says Jonathan Tweed, head of TMT finance at Société Générale in London. “Europe is lagging behind the US, with project financing volumes remaining similar between 2024 and 2025.”

Both land and power are more expensive in many European markets — each factor critical to data centre development — and Europe’s capital markets are less liquid. A GlobalCapital source notes that about €7bn of data centre project finance deals have closed in Europe this year, as of early November.

“I think that the hyperscale players have been focusing their attention on the US so far,” says Tweed. “The European data centre pipeline is, however, expected to grow rapidly next year with Sovereign AI and larger projects being announced throughout Europe in multiple locations.”

Liquid capital markets are essential to financing data centres, as most banks expect the construction debt they provide to be refinanced.

Securitization is widely seen as offering the most competitive balance between pricing and flexibility, but the gap between Europe and the US is even more stark when comparing the depth of their respective markets in the asset class. At the time GlobalCapital went to press, there had only ever been two data centre securitizations in Europe.

In the US, Vantage began the data centre ABS market for what the Securities and Exchange Commission deems qualified institutional buyers in 2018. QTS started a similar market in data centre CMBS in 2021.

In the time since those deals, the US CMBS market has swallowed about $20bn of paper, while the US ABS market has supported another $43bn, not including trades done in the 4(a)(2) private placement market.

In November, QTS tapped the CMBS market with a $3.46bn deal to refinance its 2021 trade of $3.2bn, likely the biggest CMBS deal of any type all year.

Data centre project financings usually run for five years and are ‘hard mini-perms’, which in project finance jargon means they require refinancing at or before maturity. Failure to refinance is treated as an event of default.

In addition, many banks have reduced their long-term infrastructure lending in the wake of reforms to bank capital requirements under Basel III.

As part of data centre financing, lenders must account for refinancing risk, which is intertwined with the risk that data centre tenants will not renew their contracts.

“The tenors of most project financings for data centres are shorter than the tenancy contracts,” says James Richards, an executive director in project finance at Standard Chartered. “The banks take refinancing risk, which is related to renewal risk for the tenancy contracts.”

Debt servicing depends on rental payments to data centres from their tenants. “When banks size the debt, they evaluate how much will be amortised at maturity and whether the contracts can be easily renewed or replaced,” says Richards.

“The amount of refinancing risk is partially determined by the level of renewal risk and the attractiveness of the site for alternative tenants, as new lenders will want to see long-term contracts in place.”

Several tenancy extensions are often required for full project debt amortisation, taking place in tandem with at least one refinancing.

Other crucial considerations for lenders are construction risk and tenant creditworthiness. Construction risk is sometimes mitigated by the developer making completion guarantees.

Lenders will also carefully evaluate tenants’ credit ratings and business models — a simpler process for hyperscalers such as Microsoft than for a newer company like, for example, CoreWeave.

Risks aside, there is immense appetite from project finance lenders to fund data centres, as the project pipeline is brimming and pricing on construction loans sits in the low-200bp to low-400bp range, according to market sources.

Top tier data centre ABS issuers in the US have priced deals with spreads on the senior notes of 140bp-160bp. In October, Compass, a dominant player in US data centre securitizations, priced a $326m single tranche, triple-A rated ABS at 125bp, yielding less than 5%.

The bottom line for many is that if the EU is going to get close to finding enough financing for data centres in terms of both scale and duration, securitization is going to have to step up. S&P expects annual data centre financing needs to rise to $173bn by 2028.

“At the moment, the bank market is working very well for sponsors, but if you add up all the numbers for future needs for new and existing infrastructure, you come to a total volume that most likely could not be financed in the traditional way with the existing bank capital in Europe,” says Nord LB’s Ludwig.

Europe does at least have the example of the US market to follow, where there is a thriving data centre ABS market.

Senior managing director at Guggenheim Partners, Matt Bissonette, a banker who has been involved in digital infrastructure financing for more than a decade, expects a record year for data centre securitization issuance in 2026. “It’s hard to put an exact number on it… but I could see a path towards $30bn across data centre securitization markets for stabilised assets alone,” he says.

“We’re seeing new investors participate, people focusing on bringing more capital into the digital infrastructure space, and I think that trend is only going to continue.”

Andrew Butville, director of ABS at MetLife Investment Management, believes the $13.8bn of US data centre ABS to have been priced by mid-November in 2025 could double in 2026.

“That’s based on the construction pipeline of data centres and project finance and bank finance that’s flowed into the sector,” he says.

There is plenty of evidence that investors will flock to the market to lap it up. If they cannot find paper at home, Bissonette expects more European investors to head to the US. “They’ve been limited because of regulation, but there is certainly demand from folks there,” he says.

“There is a very, very strong relative value in the securitized market versus the corporate market, especially for the highest quality assets and issuers. If you’re buying corporate bonds, you can see a pretty big pick-up versus the underlying hyperscalers.”

The relative value judgement will vary from buyer to buyer, however, and when they get into the market.

“We still like the space from a credit perspective, but spreads have really tightened to the point where we don’t see a lot of value in particular shelves,” says Butville. “We’ve sold some of our exposure because it’s just so much tighter than where we bought it.”

The question is whether Europe’s securitization market will be able to follow the US example.

“The need for data centre financing is a very good test [for Europe’s capital markets],” says Florence Coeroli, UK and global head of engineering at Société Générale. “You need issuers that are willing to go for it and test the market. For investors to put in the work to understand the asset class, they need to know there will be more transactions.”

Despite the scale of the challenge, European market sources are bullish. Matt Dunn, partner at Clifford Chance, says “the European ABS market for data centres is poised for significant growth” and could “become one of the cornerstones of digital infrastructure financing in Europe, mirroring the established success seen in the US”.

“We expect the data centre sector to grow,” agrees Kate Galustian, head of European ABS at BlackRock. “It’s early days, but it’s an exciting space. We want a broad investable universe.

“In an area like this, we would be extremely selective given the lack of historical data… In principle, the story is strong, but there are number of tech and operational factors to consider, as well the nascency of the market.”

That caution speaks to both the opportunity and the challenge for sponsors issuing European data centre securitizations. Sponsors want to deepen their access to capital, but the asset class is quite different to typical European securitization deals.

“There are US investors looking at the European market, but issuers that already do ABS in the US want to come to Europe to attract new investors,” says Coeroli. “They want the financing to be additive and not drawing liquidity away from the US market.

“At the same time, it’s good to have those US investors because it gives you certainty when you come to issue,” she says, considering they may already have good knowledge of and appetite for the asset class. “And these US-based investors may deploy specific euro liquidity pockets for the European deals.”

One of the most important questions for those involved with data centre securitizations is how to structure the deals to best tap into the different pools of liquidity. The best-case scenario is a structure that can bring in both ABS investors and those who like data centres as an asset but are less familiar with securitization.

“Data centres potentially bring new types of investors into the market, away from just traditional securitization investors, but it’s very early to try and quantify the depth of the market given there’s only been a couple of deals in Europe,” says Galustian.

Looking at those two deals is somewhat instructive, however. Both used a structure more similar to a US data centre ABS than a typical European ABS or CMBS, only issuing fixed rate notes. Such bonds are unusual in Europe’s securitization market.

“I wouldn’t be surprised to see more structural features coming into future deals targeting European investors,” says Henrik Nilsson, executive director at Natixis. “The European investor base would like to buy floating rate notes for example, but you need to work out how to do the hedging.”

The challenge with hedging is the long-dated nature of the assets. Data centre securitizations typically have strong incentives to call the deal at the anticipated repayment date (ARD) in the form of accelerated amortisation and step-up coupons. However, the ARD is normally five years away, but, if missed, the legal final maturity can be decades away, potentially making hedging very expensive.

Another big question is whether to mortgage the data centre and put that mortgage into a CMBS structure or securitize the cashflows from the lease directly in an ABS. Both are used in the US, but Vantage used ABS for both European deals.

“Sponsors are looking at a combination of US private placements and potentially an ABS into European markets,” says Nilsson. “The two deals from Vantage have really put [the ABS option] on the map and there’s definitely more to come.

“Sponsors want to diversify their funding sources as much as they can. The ABS route opens up new investors and then there’s the CMBS route as well. Securitization is needed to get the liquidity the market will need.”

A challenge with CMBS in Europe is that the market is far less liquid than in the US. There had been just 11 public deals by mid-November, according to GlobalCapital’s Asset Backed Monitor, and that is considered a bumper year for European CMBS.

“Ideally, we would like to see a bigger European CMBS market, but we are seeing more and more deals and, especially this year, the market has been quite active,” says Nilsson. “That is definitely helpful for data centre deals because there’s an overlap in the investor base.”

The other recurring problem for European securitization issuers is fragmented regulation. Each country has its own tax and insolvency laws, which makes it difficult to combine assets in different countries into one deal.

The challenge applies across asset classes, not just to data centres, and can make it hard for issuers to achieve the scale they need for a securitization.

Data centres, however, may have it better than some other asset classes because the assets are normally big enough to support a standalone securitization.

“The beauty and the difficulty of Europe is the number of different jurisdictions [versus the single, large market in the US],” says Coeroli. “We will need to consider ABS transactions country by country [instead of multi-country issuance], but that allows us to [target] deals that are the right size for the investors in a certain country.”

However, regulatory fragmentation could become a barrier that prevents issuers accessing more efficient funding structures as the market develops.

“In the US, there are master trusts of data centres,” says Nilsson. “In Europe, it’s a bit more tricky to implement because there are multiple jurisdictions. Given the size of the assets here, in most cases, it probably works to do it jurisdiction by jurisdiction. I think a master trust could be done, but there are questions on the legal side and you’d have to get everyone comfortable with the structure.”

Certainly, a solution to the EU’s fragmentation problem is not close at hand. “It takes time to create a solution that mitigates [the overreliance on bank debt],” says Nord LB’s Ludwig. “There isn’t really one answer… Maybe it takes a European solution of not thinking the unified market is one location but one set of rules. For example, if you have to deal with 16 different sets of insolvency laws, it becomes a very complicated consideration.”

Meanwhile, the US market develops apace. Not only are floating rate tranches under consideration, but there is a debate about extending the tenor of securitizations.

Head of structured products at Conning Asset Management, Michael Nowakowski, says he would not be surprised to see a 10-year ARD on a data centre deal in 2026 given that other types of securtization have done the same and that some of the biggest tenants of data centres — the hyperscalers like Alphabet and Meta — which are the underlying credits for the paper, have issued long-dated corporate bonds.

“We’re already seeing longer ARDs in some other spaces where they’re pushing seven and 10-year... so why not this next?” he says.

However, he urges for the pace to slow in 2026: “I hope the chorus of investors who are flagging a little bit of caution on this dampens some of the untethered growth that’s happening right now in this space.”

Bissonette of Guggenhiem Partners says it feels like the “early innings” in the development of digital infrastructure. “We have incredible demand from investors and clients that are bringing new sites online who want to access the structured markets.

“We’re trying to solve for a significant portion of a $1tr-plus need over the next five to 10 years.”",https://assets.euromoneydigital.com/dims4/default/b2fa504/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5120x2688+0+96/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Feuromoney-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe7%2F23%2F85c8a20d4c7b8fbce5febe4706cc%2F2d5mwrd.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:03:28.136601

Maplebear shares are experiencing downward pressure. Why is CART stock trading lower?

What To Know: Reuters reported Thursday that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has sent Maplebear, which operates Instacart, a civil investigative demand related to its AI-driven pricing tool known as Eversight.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the FTC is seeking information about how the Eversight software is used by retailers to test different prices. The tool has drawn criticism following a recent study that found shoppers were shown different prices for the same grocery items on Instacart.

The FTC said it does not comment on potential or ongoing investigations but stated it was ""disturbed"" by reports about Instacart's alleged pricing practices. The agency noted that the opening of a probe does not prove wrongdoing and that not all investigations lead to lawsuits.

Instacart said last week that pricing tests conducted through Eversight are randomized and not based on individual user data or behavior. The company also said it has been working with retailers to encourage price parity between in-store and online pricing.

People who received Lilly’s Zepbound in the head-to-head trial regained 5 kg on orforglipron.
Although patients could switch from Zepbound to orforglipron, Custer said Lilly doesn’t see the oral option cannibalizing injectable sales.","Eli Lilly has shown patients maintained most of their weight loss after switching from injectable GLP-1s to its oral drug candidate, teeing the drugmaker up to target people taking Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy.

Lilly has filed for FDA approval of its oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, orforglipron, using data in patients who received the small molecule as an initial treatment for obesity. But the Big Pharma spotted a chance to piggyback on its head-to-head study of Wegovy and Zepbound to establish orforglipron for maintenance use. Patients who finished the trial were offered the chance to re-randomize to orforglipron or placebo.

After 52 weeks of daily oral dosing, patients who received Wegovy in the head-to-head trial had gained 0.9 kilograms. The patients weighed 113.5 kg before taking Wegovy, 95 kg at the end of the head-to-head trial and 95.9 kg after 52 weeks on orforglipron.

People who received Lilly’s Zepbound in the head-to-head trial regained 5 kg on orforglipron. The figures for that cohort are 115.8 kg at baseline, 90.9 kg after the Zepbound study and 95.9 kg after 52 weeks on orforglipron. All the figures come from per-protocol-like analyses focused on patients who stayed on the assigned treatment. Lilly is yet to share figures for analyses including patients who stopped treatment.

The drugmaker said the most common adverse events on orforglipron were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 4.8% and 7.2%, respectively, for patients who went from Wegovy or Zepbound to orforglipron. Discontinuation rates in the placebo cohorts were 7.6% and 6.3%.

Writing in a note to investors in October, BMO Capital Markets analysts said the readout on orforglipron in the maintenance setting was underappreciated. The analysts said the trial was a “unique opportunity” to win market share from Novo. Lilly could use the data to drive switches from Wegovy to orforglipron, chipping away at sales of its main rival’s flagship product.

Ken Custer, Ph.D., president of cardiometabolic health at Lilly, discussed the opportunity on an earnings call in October. Lilly has very bullish expectations for orforglipron as a first-line starter incretin, Custer said, and sees maintenance use as “an exciting boost” beyond those forecasts. Although patients could switch from Zepbound to orforglipron, Custer said Lilly doesn’t see the oral option cannibalizing injectable sales.

Lilly has a Commissioner's National Priority Voucher that could accelerate FDA approval of orforglipron. Novo’s oral form of Wegovy is in line to beat orforglipron to market. However, Lilly could have a supply edge because production of orforglipron, a small molecule, may be more scalable than manufacture of Novo’s relatively high-dose peptide.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-1348209410.jpg?VersionId=ULXrxYF8OKCZEpCYyowVdLQrz2EO2vmh,N,,2025-12-18 10:06:59.121604

Despite investment scams’ significant share of the overall value of claims, they represent just 7.1 per cent of the volume of reports in 2025 – however, this is up from 5.6 per cent in 2024. Purchase scams maintained the largest share of claims, at 71 per cent, unchanged from last year. One in three (35 per cent) reported investment scams originated on social media.

Fraudsters are turning to text, but social media remains top scam source

Looking more broadly at all scam types, social media remains the biggest source of reports by Gen Z customers in 2025, accounting for six in 10 (58 per cent) cases, compared with 45 per cent across all generations.

Amid significant advances and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence this year, three in four (75 per cent) believe AI has made online scams more convincing. This has led to one in three Gen Z consumers (34 per cent) now actively avoiding online shopping due to scam concerns – the highest rate of any generation, and 12 percentage points higher than older age groups (22 per cent).

Barclays data shows that these scammers have responded to this declining online confidence by pivoting towards more direct and trusted channels. Average monthly reports of scams originating via text/SMS have increased 40 per cent from 2024, now accounting for 14 per cent of claims.

One in four are skipping finfluencer background checks to avoid FOMO

Barclays research also found that 42 per cent of those who acted on social media investment content lost money – and not always by being scammed. While scams involve deliberate fraud, many investors also face losses after following unregulated advice from ‘finfluencers’. One in four (24 per cent) say they feel pressured to act quickly on unsolicited tips, often mistaking displays of wealth for credibility. This rises to 48 per cent among Gen Z (18–27).

Consumers show growing support for data sharing to fight scams

Eight in 10 (81 per cent) consumers believe more work should be done to protect them from scams, and 79 per cent think tech companies should do more to prevent scams occurring on their platforms, up from 75 per cent in spring of this year. Almost half (45 per cent) would welcome tech companies and banks sharing personal data with each other, if it was done to prevent them falling victim to a scam.

Barclays Fraud and Scams Expert Kirsty Adams, says: “Once again, scammers adopted new tactics in 2025, and as a result we saw a shift in the nature of scams reported by our customers. While fraudsters targeted victims with higher-stakes opportunities, we witnessed the resurgence of scams coming via text message, as confidence in online channels has declined.

“There’s no doubt that scammers will attempt to take advantage of shoppers during the festive sales, so we’re urging people to remain vigilant. Looking ahead to 2026, we’re hopeful we will see continued progress in the fight against fraud, in the form of cross-industry collaboration.”

Kirsty’s top tips on staying ahead of the scammers in 2026:

Never disclose personal details: Your bank will never ask you for your debit card PIN, your password, or your complete online banking login details. Requests along these lines should jump out as a red flag.

Verify company details: If you are in doubt about a company that has contacted you by phone, it is always worth double checking their contact details. Check official websites and call the listed number directly yourself.

Take your time: When it comes to making purchases online or committing to an investment, don’t be forced into making any hasty decisions. Always remember that legitimate organisations shouldn’t push you into anything.

Be sceptical of promises: Our data shows the average investment scam claim is higher than any other scam type. Remember the old adage; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, and remain sceptical of any promise of unrealistic returns.

Beware of scam texts: If you’re sent a one-time passcode to authorise a payment or registration, always read the full message to check it matches up with what you’re doing. If it doesn’t, stop the transaction and don’t use the code or give it to anyone.

The American group has announced several significant installations.

According to HP, this dynamic reflects a structural shift in the market towards shorter runs, shorter lead times and more intelligent production environments, notably its PrintOS suite, which enables real-time control of operations via data analysis.

16 new Indigo presses for Cimpress

First example cited: Cimpress, owner of Vistaprint and Pixartprinting, installs 16 HP Indigo presses since Drupa in June 2024, including 10 Indigo 120K models.

The equipment has been deployed at several sites, including Vistaprint Windsor in Canada, Pixartprinting in Italy and Vistaprint Venlo in the Netherlands. HP states that the group has exceeded three million prints, without specifying the reference period.

Robert Keane, founder and CEO of Cimpress, states: ""The HP Indigo 120K model has changed the pace and predictability of our production. We're seeing more stability, shorter lead times and better operational coordination, exactly what our large-scale business needs.""

At European sites, the overall efficiency rate (OEE) is said to exceed 60%. Pixartprinting USA, for its part, is said to have reached the LS Mark Champion level of 180%.

RRD focuses on PageWide and Indigo in several segments

Another customer highlighted by HP is the American company RRD (formerly RR Donnelley), which has accelerated its digital transformation plan on an international scale. The agreement signed with HP at Drupa resulted in several installations of HP Indigo and HP PageWide presses, including the PageWide T4250 HDR model. HP is not disclosing further details of this order.

According to HP, this inkjet press combines high productivity, offset-like quality and a wide range of applications, thanks to a high-definition recirculating nozzle architecture and an optimized drying system.

The manufacturer points out that this configuration makes it possible to better meet growing demand in the mailing, label, packaging and commercial printing sectors, while limiting waste and energy consumption.

Up to 10,000 orders a day with HP 15K and HP Site Flow

Germany-based Friedmann Print, a subsidiary of the Ludo Fact Group, also operates an automated production line combining HP Indigo 15K presses with the HP Site Flow software solution. This system integrates automated order grouping, tracking and planning functionalities.

According to HP, this configuration can handle up to 10,000 unique orders per day for personalized applications such as calendars, cards and collectible games. It could also be used to mass-produce cards with controlled shrinkage via random sequencing, without affecting print speed or quality.

And at peak times, over 150,000 shipments per month would be handled.

The printer would also save 25-30% on paper, thanks to optimized workflows.

A changing production environment for HP

HP emphasizes the convergence between its hardware solutions (Indigo LEPx presses, PageWide HDR inkjet) and its software ecosystem (PrintOS, Site Flow), which it presents as the key to a more resilient and cost-effective production environment.

- Approval builds on a trusted solution in neurovascular embolization for over 25 years.

IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) – Today, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, a leader in neurovascular care, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an expanded indication for the TRUFILL n‑BCA Liquid Embolic System for embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) for the treatment of symptomatic subacute and chronic Subdural Hematoma (cSDH) as an adjunct to surgery.

cSDH is often caused by minor head trauma that leads to bleeding between the dura and arachnoid membranes, particularly among older adults and those on anticoagulation therapy. While surgical intervention is the traditional standard of care, recurrence rate estimates range between 10% to 20%. Embolization of the MMA offers a minimally invasive endovascular approach by targeting smaller brain vessels thought to contribute to hematoma persistence and regrowth.1

The approval is supported by findings from the MEMBRANE randomized controlled trial, which evaluated the safety and effectiveness of MMA embolization in patients with cSDH2. The results of the MEMBRANE study demonstrated that TRUFILL n-BCA is superior in effectiveness compared to Standard of Care (SOC) for embolization in the MMA for the treatment of symptomatic cSDHi, and importantly, TRUFILL n-BCA was demonstrated to be safe for treating cSDH2.

""This approval reinforces the enduring value of TRUFILL n-BCA and our commitment to delivering innovative technologies that improve outcomes for patients and address complex neurovascular conditions,"" said Christian Cuzick, President, Worldwide Neurovascular, Johnson & Johnson MedTech.

""There is an unmet need for new treatment options for chronic subdural hematoma, particularly for patients at risk of recurrence or complications from surgery,"" said Dr. Chris Kellnerii, Director of Cerebrovascular & Intercerebral Hemorrhage programs, Mount Sinai, and investigator in the MEMBRANE trial. ""The MEMBRANE study demonstrated a positive treatment effect in favor of TRUFILL over standard of care and reinforces the potential of MMA embolization to improve outcomes for patients with cSDH.""

TRUFILL n-BCA has been a trusted solution in neurovascular embolization for over 25 years, supporting the treatment of patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) since its original FDA approval in 2000. This expanded indication brings TRUFILL n-BCA's established performance into the treatment of cSDH, a condition where traditional surgical interventions may not always be suitable or effective for long-term control.

The reality is that in many cases, the existing inventory of finished buildings can be purchased at prices significantly below the cost of new construction. An exception to this could be in the industrial sector, although for residential, office, and retail assets, sale prices are very favorable.

Depending on the sector, financing is also challenging, especially for office development (and acquisition) as most lenders are extremely concerned and not willing to provide debt, in general, for projects. Financing for most other asset classes is available, although at lower loan-to-value or loan-to-cost than historically achievable, thereby requiring more equity from the developer or buyer.

What do you think are the biggest construction needs in Minnesota?

Affordable Housing. There are more people in need of shelter today than ever before in modern history. While we have wonderful organizations and developers doing this work, the high cost and complicated system to navigate the required capital stack is becoming more challenging to accomplish. As such, new streamlined processing, along with new incentives to promote more affordable housing, must be created to make this happen.

What’s the biggest misconception you encounter about your work?

Many believe that real estate development is easy and overflowing with profit. In reality, real estate development is tough on a “good day” and very challenging on a “difficult day.” Our marketplace today mostly reflects a “difficult day,” or more specifically, a challenging 5-1/2 years. There are so many lingering and current headwinds in the Twin Cites which still need to be navigated.

The United Kingdom government has laid final legislation before parliament to provide a regulatory regime for digital assets, set to come into force in 2027. It gives the country’s top finance sector watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the necessary powers to oversee the space and integrate digital assets into the country’s financial regulation. In response, the FCA launched a consultation on its proposed approach, promising to take into account the “unique aspects of cryptoassets.”

UK sets FCA oversight for cryptoassets

Crypto regulation endures U.K. political shift

Clarity arrives for digital asset firms

FCA advances rulebook for crypto firms

On Monday, HM Treasury laid the final draft of a ‘statutory instrument’ before parliament that will create new regulated activities for ‘cryptoassets’ and place the sector within the FCA’s jurisdictional oversight, allowing the regulator to finally bring digital assets within the U.K.’s financial regulatory regime.

“Bringing crypto into the regulatory perimeter is a crucial step in securing the U.K.’s position as a world leading financial centre in the digital age,” Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves MP said. “By giving firms clear rules of the road, we are providing the certainty they need to invest, innovate and create high skilled jobs here in the UK, while giving millions strong consumer protections, and locking dodgy actors out of the U.K. market.”

The digital asset sector remains largely unregulated in the U.K., barring anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) rules, and those related to the promotion of financial products.

However, according to the Treasury’s December 15 announcement, the legislation presented to parliament will provide “firm and proportionate rules” that will come into force from 2027, “giving firms legal clarity over the sector’s regulatory position and boosting consumer confidence by ensuring consumers are robustly protected.”

The major change will be that digital asset firms will need to be regulated by the FCA in the same way as other providers of financial products, including being subject to the established transparency standards and licensing regime.

“Cryptoassets firms will be backed to innovate and grow under plans to make the UK a global destination for digital assets and attract more investment,” the Treasury said. “Consumers will be protected by bringing cryptoassets into scope of similar rules to those for other regulated financial products like stocks and shares.”

Meanwhile, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Lucy Rigby KC MP, placed the emphasis very much on supporting the digital asset sector, saying that “by establishing a comprehensive regulatory regime for cryptoassets, the government is taking another step towards delivering on its ambition for the UK to be a world-leading hub for digital finance.”

Slow road to regulation

In October 2023, HM Treasury, under the previous Conservative government of Rishi Sunak, published detailed proposals for creating a U.K. financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets, including stablecoins. Essentially, it involved a mix of integrating cryptoassets into existing financial regulation with certain bespoke new rules.

When 14 years of Conservative rule came to an end in July of last year, a certain amount of uncertainty crept back in as industry and observers awaited what the new Labour government would do. However, in November of last year, the Treasury confirmed that it will proceed with introducing the regime broadly in line with the previously published proposals.

An end to uncertainty

The long-awaited progress toward substantive regulation for digital assets in the U.K. received a warm response from some working in the area, who have been living in a state of limbo and uncertainty for some time.

Hannah Meakin, partner at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, told CoinGeek that the legislation represents “the corner piece of the jigsaw because it provides key definitions and explains how cryptoassets will be able to be offered to the public and listed, what types of abusive behaviour will be prohibited and which activities will require authorisation.”

With the legislation now in place and set to come into force in 2027, the next stage of the process will involve the FCA, whose job it will be to regulate the digital asset space, firming up how it proposes to slot the new asset class into the existing regulation framework.

“The FCA will be able to develop the rules and guidance it has proposed, and industry will be able to provide more informed feedback to help make the final regime as effective as possible,” said Meakin. “There are already some key provisions, such as for information sharing between authorised persons to combat market abuse and the prospect of a list of legitimate market practices as carve-outs to the offences.”

She added that “We will see more tailoring to the particular characteristics of cryptoassets at the next level, where the FCA has significant power to design the detailed rules.”

With this in mind, following the Treasury’s introduction of the final legislation to parliament on Monday, the FCA launched a consultation on its proposed approach to digital asset regulation.

On Tuesday, hot on the heels of the Treasury’s announcement, the FCA published a consultation on its proposed rules and guidance for firms conducting regulated cryptoasset activities, such as trading platforms, intermediaries (including cryptoasset lending and borrowing), staking and decentralized finance (DeFi).

“Under the government’s plans, our regulatory remit for cryptoassets will expand from the current Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLRs) and financial promotions regime to a more comprehensive crypto regime,” said the regulator. “Our proposed rules and guidance are aimed at effectively promoting market integrity, protecting consumers, and supporting innovation and competition in the UK cryptoasset sector.”

Likely much to the relief of digital asset-market participants, the FCA also confirmed its consultation would take into account “the unique aspects of cryptoassets” when deciding their place in the future regulatory regime.

The collaboration will combine Pearson’s expertise in skills development with IBM’s watsonx AI technology to create personalised learning tools for businesses, public-sector organisations, and educational institutions.

The announcement follows research from Pearson indicating that inefficient career transitions and skills mismatches could cost the US economy $1.1 trillion in lost earnings annually. Both companies say the partnership is intended to help close that gap by enabling faster, more relevant skills acquisition as AI reshapes job roles and training needs.

Developing New AI Learning Platforms

Under the agreement, IBM and Pearson will co-develop learning products powered by watsonx Orchestrate and watsonx Governance, with availability planned globally. IBM will also help Pearson build a custom AI-powered learning platform, modelled on IBM’s internal Consulting Advantage system, which blends human expertise with AI assistants, agents and workflow assets.

According to both companies, the platform is designed to support Pearson’s long-term transformation efforts by improving operational efficiency, enhancing data-driven decision-making and accelerating the development of new learning products and services.

Workforce transformation and employee upskilling

IBM named Pearson its primary strategic partner for customer upskilling and workforce transformation. As part of the partnership, IBM customers — and IBM’s own workforce of more than 270,000 employees — will have access to Pearson’s enterprise learning solutions. These include:

Credly, used for digital credentialing

Faethm, for strategic workforce planning

Pearson Professional Assessments, which delivers IBM’s professional certification exams globally

The companies will also explore the development of tools to verify the capabilities of AI agents before deployment. IBM said the effort combines its work in responsible AI with Pearson’s expertise in assessment and credentialing.

Leadership Perspectives

“Technology is evolving faster than human skills can keep pace. To close this gap, learning must be embedded seamlessly into the flow of work. When people learn where work happens, it has an immediate impact on productivity and performance,” said Omar Abbosh, CEO of Pearson. “Together with IBM, we’re building trusted AI-powered learning tools that will help people and organisations adapt, learn, and thrive in a world of constant change.”

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said the collaboration aims to scale access to AI-enabled learning: “Whether you’re leading a company or just graduating, everyone needs to build new skills for the AI era. IBM and Pearson are bringing AI-powered education to more organisations to help people learn faster.”

These two healthcare stocks are top names to invest in, but they haven't both been doing well of late.

Eli Lilly has generated $25 billion in revenue from its fast-growing GLP-1 drugs this year.

Novo Nordisk, in contrast, has been facing a lot of adversity and has had to cut its guidance due to rising competition.

10 stocks we like better than Novo Nordisk ›

Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) are two of the leading companies in the fast-growing GLP-1 weight loss market. These healthcare companies have tremendous long-term growth prospects due to their promising GLP-1 products.

Lately, however, they've been going in opposite directions. Shares of Eli Lilly are up 35% over the past 12 months, while Novo Nordisk is down 53% (returns are as of Dec. 15). But will those trends hold up over the long haul? Here's a closer look at which healthcare stock may be the better buy right now.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

The case for Eli Lilly

Eli Lilly recently crossed $1 trillion in market cap, becoming the first healthcare company to do so. The only real surprise was how quickly it happened, but given the company's incredible growth prospects, it's something I expected would happen eventually.

The business has been booming thanks to Lilly's highly popular and effective GLP-1 drugs. Through the first nine months of the year, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss) have generated a combined $25 billion in revenue. That's more than half of the $46 billion in total sales the company reported over that time frame.

In a head-to-head trial against Novo Nordisk's top weight loss drug, Wegovy, Zepbound has proven to be more effective in helping people shed pounds (with a 20.2% average weight loss versus 13.7%, over a 72-week trial). Going with the leading GLP-1 brand could be a no-brainer move for investors. Plus, Lilly has a promising Alzheimer's drug in Kisunla, which regulators approved last year.

Eli Lilly's been a growth machine. Although it has soared more than 570% in five years, it could still go even higher in the long term.

The case for Novo Nordisk

Novo Nordisk has been a troubled stock over the past 12 months, but it's a company that I believe can turn things around. Investing in Novo Nordisk, the company behind the popular diabetes drug Ozempic, does come with a bit of risk these days. It's changed CEOs, and it slashed its guidance due to competition from compounded versions of its drugs, which explains the sharp reduction in its share price.

But these problems are temporary in nature, so I remain bullish on the stock over the long haul. And it's during ""temporary trouble"" that billionaire investor Warren Buffett says is a great time to invest in a company. Novo Nordisk is trading at a heavily discounted valuation -- just 14 times its trailing earnings. By comparison, Eli Lilly trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of over 50. Expectations are far lower for Novo Nordisk than they are for its rival, and that can work to the advantage of investors who buy the healthcare stock now.

During the first nine months of 2025, Ozempic has generated sales growth of 13% at constant exchange rates, while Wegovy has grown by 54%. Ozempic was first approved in 2017 and has a long track record; its ability to still rise at such a decent pace is a strong testament to its brand. (Lilly's Mounjaro, by comparison, was approved in 2022.) Wegovy's approval came in 2021.

There's a lot of bad news and bearish expectations baked into Novo Nordisk's stock right now, but the reality is that its fundamentals remain solid. Investors who stay the course could be rewarded handsomely.

Novo Nordisk looks like the better stock today

I continue to own shares of Novo Nordisk despite its recent adversity because I'm confident the business can and will turn things around. It's still developing more GLP-1 drugs, and all it takes is one promising study to remind investors just how much growth there is in the GLP-1 market; it's not a winner-take-all arena, and there's room for multiple big players.

With its severely undervalued shares, Novo Nordisk has much more upside than Eli Lilly. While both stocks are excellent investments when looking at the long haul, the Danish drugmaker gives investors more value for their money today.

This is equivalent in size to Nvidia’s two California “spaceships” combined and will be considered the largest technology campus in Israel.
Nvidia Israel currently has about 400 open positions.
The final decision was made last week during a visit by Nvidia Israel executives, led by Amit Krig, to the company’s U.S. headquarters.
This, in turn, placed pressure on the Israel Land Authority, which moved swiftly to accommodate the company.","Now it is official: Nvidia’s spacecraft is set to land in Kiryat Tivon. After a five-month process in which the world’s most valuable company examined several alternatives for establishing a new mega-campus in Israel, Nvidia has chosen Kiryat Tivon. The company, currently valued at about $4.3 trillion, will purchase the land from the state for approximately NIS 90 million (approximately $28 million), making it the first international technology company in Israel to build a major campus on land it owns. Until now, the campuses of multinational giants such as Intel, Microsoft, Google, and Meta have all been located in leased properties.

The decision signals an extraordinary level of commitment by Nvidia to Israel, which has already become the company’s second-largest development center outside the United States.

With the official announcement, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said: “Israel is home to some of the world’s most brilliant technologists and has become NVIDIA’s second home. Our new campus will be a place where our teams can collaborate, invent, and build the future of AI. This investment reflects our deep and enduring commitment to our families in Israel and their unique contributions to the AI era.”

Amit Krig, Senior Vice President of Software Engineering and Israel Site Leader, added: “NVIDIA’s growth in Israel has been remarkable, driven by the extraordinary talent and engineering excellence of our teams. We’re grateful to Jensen and NVIDIA’s leadership for their trust and support in this next phase of growth, and to the Ministry of Treasury and the Israel Land Authority for their partnership. We look forward to bringing this vision to life and continuing to build the future of AI.”

The new campus, designed in the shape of a “spaceship,” similar to Nvidia’s headquarters in Silicon Valley, will be built on approximately 90 dunams and span about 160,000 square meters. This is equivalent in size to Nvidia’s two California “spaceships” combined and will be considered the largest technology campus in Israel.

The complex will include a park, cafés, restaurants, and shared workspaces, effectively functioning as a self-contained city, in line with the campus models of companies such as Google and Apple in the U.S. It is expected to accommodate more than 10,000 employees. Construction is slated to begin about a year after Nvidia completes its planning processes, with occupancy expected in 2031. The estimated cost of the project runs into the billions of shekels.

This will be Nvidia’s first “spaceship-style” campus outside the U.S., although the company is also advancing plans for a similar site in Taiwan, near the factories that manufacture its GPUs, which currently dominate the global artificial intelligence chip market.

Nvidia currently employs around 5,000 people in Israel, with its largest site located in Yokneam, built on the foundations of Mellanox, which Nvidia acquired in 2020 for $7 billion. The company also occupies roughly half the floors of the Rubinstein Towers in Tel Aviv and recently announced an expansion in Be’er Sheva, where it plans to employ hundreds of workers in the Gav-Yam high-tech park.

Beyond office space, Nvidia operates a server farm in Israel and the Israel-1 supercomputer, ranked among the world’s 50 most powerful. On Wednesday, Calcalist revealed that Nvidia is also planning to establish another server farm, the largest in Israel, adjacent to its existing facility in the Mevo Carmel industrial zone. The total investment in that project is estimated at $1.5 billion and will be shared between Nvidia and the real estate company Mega Or, with which it is in advanced negotiations.

Nvidia Israel currently has about 400 open positions. Israel is now the company’s second-largest global center, with a hiring pace exceeded only by the United States and surpassing Nvidia’s growth rates in both Europe and India.

The Kiryat Tivon site was selected from a long list of proposals Nvidia received after publishing a public request for information in July. While the state sought to steer the company toward more northern locations, such as Kiryat Ata, to support areas affected by the war, Nvidia ultimately preferred to remain close to its existing operations in Yokneam and the server farms in Mevo Carmel.

The final decision was made last week during a visit by Nvidia Israel executives, led by Amit Krig, to the company’s U.S. headquarters. During that visit, Jensen Huang also met Avinan Or, an Nvidia employee who was kidnapped on October 7 and released in the most recent deal.

Nvidia had been exploring options for a northern campus for some time, but slow progress with government agencies prompted the company to launch a public land-search process. This, in turn, placed pressure on the Israel Land Authority, which moved swiftly to accommodate the company. This week, the government approved the land allocation at a discount of about NIS 70 million ($21.7M), without Nvidia having requested one. The approval required signatures from the defense and finance ministers, as Israeli law mandates such approval for land transactions with entities not registered in Israel.",https://pic1.calcalist.co.il/picserver3/crop_images/2025/12/17/SkU00JXemZg/SkU00JXemZg_0_130_3000_1689_0_large.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 04:59:28.832878

Summary

Johnson & Johnson is rated a buy, with accelerating revenue and earnings growth driven by TREMFYA, CARVYKTI, and robust MedTech innovation.

JNJ's portfolio reshaping (divesting Orthopaedics and focusing on premium cardiovascular and vision franchises) should enhance margins and long-term growth prospects.

TREMFYA's rapid adoption in IBD and the anticipated 2026 launch of icotrokinra position JNJ for continued immunology growth despite STELARA's LOE.

I have over 15 years of experience investing and have provided research services to mid-sized hedge funds with assets under management between $100 and $500 million. I also have had a brief stint as a sell-side analyst. I am now focusing primarily on managing my own money and my purpose here is to share my views and benefit from the insights of the Seeking Alpha user community. Feel free to provide your feedback on my thesis in the comment section and I would love to have a discussion even if you have a variant view. My strategy is medium-term investing in ideas where there is a catalyst to unlock value and drive upside or short selling in case there is a downside catalyst. I also like to invest in growth stories available at a reasonable price. In terms of sector preferences, I am a generalist. However, I had spent most of my professional career analyzing industrial, consumer, and technology sectors. So, this is where I usually have higher conviction while investing.

https://ankar.ai/ About Atomico Atomico is the founder-built European venture capital firm.","Ankar raises $20M (£15M) in Series A funding led by Atomico to transform how breakthrough ideas become protected innovation

Ankar is building the AI operating system for innovation, reinventing how companies generate and protect their inventions

Ankar has seen strong growth and secured leading customers, including Fortune 500 companies such as L’Oreal and global law firm Vorys

New funding led by Atomico will be used to scale the go-to-product, engineering and go-to-market teams and grow Ankar’s AI-powered patent platform globally

London, UK, 17 December 2025: Ankar, the AI platform transforming how companies and law firms capture and protect their patents, has raised a $20 million (£15 million) Series A round led by Atomico, with Index Ventures doubling down and Norrsken VC and Daphni participating. The company will use the funding to grow its team and expand further into the US.

Invention is how humanity’s biggest challenges are solved, and AI is fundamentally changing how inventions become protected assets. It enables patent teams to analyse novelty, draft claims and evaluate prior art with unprecedented depth and speed. Yet fragmented tools, gaps in AI trust, and slow enterprise adoption have held organisations back. Ankar solves these challenges with an operating system that unifies the entire patent lifecycle into one secure workflow for the first time.

Its platform orchestrates how ideas become defensible IP globally, bringing novelty assessment, drafting and prosecution together so teams can do in hours what once took weeks. Acting as an assistant rather than an autopilot, Ankar delivers end-to-end strategic patent generation with stronger claims, clearer framing and more defensible portfolios.

Fixing a broken system

Patents can take up to 24 months to secure and still rely on scattered Word documents, spreadsheets, emails and outdated IP systems. This inefficiency slows teams down and discourages inventors from filing altogether.

Ankar replaces this fragmented process with a unified platform that supports the entire patent lifecycle. It performs instant novelty and prior-art analysis across 150+ million patent applications and 250+ million scientific publications, turns invention disclosures into high-quality draft applications with strategic guidance on claim strength and scope, and consolidates all history and analysis into a single view when examiners respond – enabling faster, stronger and more defensible outcomes, just as competition for IP is intensifying.

Built for security in the AI era

Patent workflows require the highest confidentiality in the enterprise world, and Ankar has been built for this. Co-founders Tamar Gomez and Wiem Gharbi previously built mission-critical software at Palantir in Europe and the US, experience that now shapes Ankar’s approach to secure patent retrieval, claim-level reasoning, LLM governance and AI safety inside enterprise-controlled environments.

This matters more than ever: generative AI is making it easier for competitors to replicate designs, architectures and experimental approaches. As a result, C-suites, especially in automotive, electronics and other R&D-heavy sectors, are prioritising deeper, more defensible patent portfolios to secure future revenue.

The company’s platform helps patent teams go from idea to granted patent in a fraction of the time, delivering an average 40% boost in productivity and hundreds of hours shifted to high-value work. This is vital, as figures show that intangible assets such as IP now make up to 90% of the value of S&P 500 companies, yet patent professionals still spend around half of their time on manual, administrative work. Ankar is already showing meaningful adoption, with 96% of users saying they would recommend the platform to colleagues.

Accelerating growth

This Series A brings Ankar’s total funding to $24 million. The capital will be used to double the company’s 20-person team, expand engineering, product and design, and grow Ankar’s go-to-market organisation to support rising demand across Europe and the US. The long-term ambition is to become the software layer that orchestrates how ideas turn into defensible patents globally, which will be the core infrastructure of innovation in the AI era.

Tamar Gomez, co-founder of Ankar AI, said: “Invention is how we solve humanity’s biggest challenges, yet the systems that protect those ideas are decades out of date. AI will redefine how global organisations innovate over the next five years, turning IP from a cost centre into a growth driver. The companies that adopt Ankar now will shape the future of innovation.”

Wiem Gharbi, co-founder of Ankar AI, said: “Patents sit at the intersection of deep technical knowledge and precise legal reasoning, and AI can finally unlock real leverage in that process. Ankar gives professionals the analytical depth they’ve never had before, enabling stronger strategy and better protection. Atomico shares our ambition to build the infrastructure behind the next generation of global innovation.”

Andreas Helbig, partner at Atomico, said: “Tamar and Wiem bring exceptional technical depth and first-hand experience of how broken the patent process is. Their momentum with Fortune 500 companies shows they’re building the right product at exactly the right moment. We’re proud to support their mission as they build the foundational infrastructure for how the world’s most important ideas are protected and commercialised.”

Jean-Yves Legendre, Competitive IP Intelligence Manager at L’Oréal, said: “Most vendors came with a fixed solution. With Ankar, they began with our needs. They understood patents, spoke our language, and adapted to our needs by configuring their existing technology into a solution that fits our reality.”

To own U.S. Bancorp, you need to believe its mix of traditional banking and fee-based payments can keep earning power resilient while digital competitors intensify. The Avvance and Coinstar expansions modestly reinforce the near term catalyst around digital engagement and payments, but they do not alter the key risk that faster moving fintech and non-banks could chip away at fee income over time.

Among recent developments, the expanded Coinstar partnership is especially relevant, as it extends everyday banking access beyond branches and supports the same digital and payments narrative that underpins Avvance’s embedded lending push.

As part of its 2026 plan, Barclays revised targets for companies within the financial services group. Budish anticipates constructive market conditions next year, especially benefiting alternative asset managers and wealth brokers. The outlook is less clear, however, for exchanges and traditional asset managers, which are expected to face a more mixed environment.

In Q3 2025, Robinhood Markets achieved record revenues of ~$1.3 billion, which represented a doubling (over 100%) year-over-year increase. EPS more than tripled from the previous year and totaled $0.61, which was $0.07 higher than estimates. The company’s subscription service, Robinhood Gold, reached a record 3.9 million subscribers, showing over 75% year-over-year growth and strong adoption, particularly among new customers.

A key area of growth for Robinhood is its prediction markets business, which has shown rapid acceleration, doubling volume every quarter to 2.3 billion contracts in Q3. This segment surpassed $100 million in annualized revenue and is tracking towards a $300 million run rate. The company sees its competitive advantage in this area as its distribution, using its ecosystem of over 26 million funded accounts.

The financing supports a diverse portfolio of 45 wind and solar projects located across Germany and France.
CEE RF9 will repower at least 29 projects with state-of-the-art wind turbines and photovoltaic modules.
The cashflows generated by operating assets serve as a substitute for equity and set new standards for institutional renewable energy investments.
CEE RF9 was launched at the turn of 2024/2025 as the latest generation of the successful “CEE Renewables Fund/RF” product series.","Global law firm White & Case LLP has advised a consortium of leading international lenders, including CIBC, ING Bank, KfW IPEX-Bank, SMBC, SEB and UniCredit, on the complex financing structure of up to €1.6 billion for CEE RF9, Germany’s largest repowering fund.

The financing structure for CEE RF9 is unique for alternative investment funds which belongs to CEE Group, an asset manager specialized in renewable energies and part of the Canadian Brookfield Asset Management Group. The financing supports a diverse portfolio of 45 wind and solar projects located across Germany and France. In addition to providing lending capacity, ING acted as Original Issuing Bank, while UniCredit served as Facility and Security Agent, Hedge Coordinator and Account Bank.

CEE RF9 will repower at least 29 projects with state-of-the-art wind turbines and photovoltaic modules. As a result, the installed capacity of the overall portfolio will increase from the current 457 MW(p) to approximately 1.1 GW(p), which corresponds to an expansion of more than 140%.

This transaction marks a milestone in the German renewables market, as it enables the consolidation of investment fund financing at the portfolio level for the first time and does not require additional equity from existing investors. The cashflows generated by operating assets serve as a substitute for equity and set new standards for institutional renewable energy investments.

“This landmark transaction demonstrates the continued appetite of international lenders to support innovative renewable energy solutions in Europe, having advised on this unique portfolio financing structure to accelerate the expansion and repowering strategy of renewable energy projects will make a significant contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy sector and the achievement of climate goals” said White & Case partner Florian Degenhardt who led the Firm’s deal team.

CEE RF9 was launched at the turn of 2024/2025 as the latest generation of the successful “CEE Renewables Fund/RF” product series. The fund transferred existing portfolios consisting of 45 European PV and onshore wind assets from previous CEE RF funds to the new platform, with the aim of extensive repowering by 2030.

The White & Case team which advised on the transaction was led by partner Florian Degenhardt and included local partners Matthias Grigoleit and Roland Arlt, counsel Beate Treibmann and associates Martin Riederer, Dana Masberg, Robert Bente and Sarah Bischoff and transaction lawyer Ioana Marinescu (all Hamburg), with support from partner Guilhem Becvort, local partner Ruslana Hrischeva, associates Sophia Fotso and Ignacio Martinez (all Luxembourg) and Maxim Arrazola de Onate (Brussels & Luxembourg), partner Amaury de Feydeau and associates Tsveta Pencheva and Sarah Pupin (all Paris), and partner Anthony Colegrave and associate Celine Ng (both London).","https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_glossy,ret_img,w_32,h_32/https://bebeez.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cropped-BeBeez-International-favico-32x32.png",N,,2025-12-18 08:59:43.631696

At least a dozen of the biggest food and beverage manufacturers laid off tens of thousands of workers in 2025 as companies reassessed their priorities in the wake of declining profits and shifting consumer preferences. Layoffs affected both manufacturing and corporate workers as businesses moved to ruthlessly assess their portfolios and slim down.

While many companies restructured in response to falling consumption and other broader headwinds, some businesses faced challenges unique to their operations. Beyond Meat, for example, laid off about 6% of its workforce as the plant-based meat segment continued its multiyear decline.

The agreement was signed at dfcu Bank’s head offices in Nakasero, Kampala, and establishes a long-term strategic partnership focused on advancing the bank’s digital transformation agenda.

Central to the collaboration is the development and deployment of an enterprise-grade software integration platform, an API Gateway, designed to securely link dfcu Bank’s internal systems with external partners across multiple sectors.

The API Gateway is expected to enhance interoperability, speed up collaboration, and support product co-creation in banking, insurance, telecommunications, education, and other industries that increasingly depend on seamless digital integration.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, dfcu Bank Chief Executive Officer Charles Mudiwa said the partnership marked a key milestone in the bank’s transformation journey and reflected its commitment to innovation and customer-centric service delivery.

He said upgrading core systems was essential to making the bank future-ready and competitive in a rapidly evolving digital economy.

Mudiwa noted that customer expectations have shifted significantly due to rapid technological change, with clients increasingly demanding convenience, reliability, and efficient service delivery.

He said dfcu’s digital strategy is aimed at ensuring customers can access modern banking services seamlessly, anytime and anywhere.

According to him, the goal is to make banking fit naturally into customers’ lives rather than requiring customers to adjust their routines to access financial services.

dfcu Bank’s Chief Technology, Digital and Operations Officer Musa Musazi said the API Gateway will act as a central integration layer, enabling secure and seamless communication between dfcu Bank and its partners.

He explained that through the platform, customers of dfcu Bank and partner institutions will be able to access each other’s products and services, expanding reach and creating added value for all stakeholders.

What exactly is L’Oreal looking for in these startups, especially since beauty tech has been around a while now?
We're interested in new ideas that accelerate brand innovation and those founders or teams passionate about making a difference alongside our global beauty brands.
Is one goal to identify missing capabilities in beauty tech that L'Oreal might eventually acquire?
What are your hopes for the Big Bang Beauty Tech Innovation Program and how do you see it fostering innovation through partnerships with startups going forward?","From virtual try-on experiences, to hyper-personalised recommendations, emerging technologies like AI are rapidly reshaping the beauty industry. One giant in the field that has a particular interest in staying at the forefront of this innovation is the world's biggest beauty company by sales, L’Oréal.

Maintaining that leadership position means staying ahead of the curve. And at the heart of this innovation are startups, bringing the agility, experimentation, and speed that traditional R&D alone can’t deliver.

For the past two years, L’Oréal has been holding its Big Bang Beauty Tech Innovation Program in the SAPMENA region, designed to discover, support and nurture promising startups from across the

region with an opportunity to develop their pilots in beauty tech innovation.

The top Grand Finale winners receive a L’Oréal-funded commercial pilot opportunity and a year-long mentorship programme with senior executives from L’Oréal and the programme partners. Startups that run successful pilots in SAPMENA could gain access to L’Oréal’s global network, with the SAPMENA region acting as a launchpad to leverage valuable partnerships and market insights.

Campaign Asia-Pacific spoke with Lex Bradshaw-Zanger, L’Oréal chief marketing & digital officer, South Asia Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, to find out more about why the beauty giant is keen to partner with startups to stay ahead, how much AI and emerging technology is impacting sales, and balancing the focus on technology and innovation with the need for human oversight to remain competitive in the fast-evolving beauty landscape.

You recently held the Big Bang Beauty Tech Innovation Program grand finale in Singapore. What exactly is L’Oreal looking for in these startups, especially since beauty tech has been around a while now?

Lex Bradshaw-Zanger: Beauty tech means many things for us. It embodies how we integrate digital and data technology into our business, right from upstream scientific research in our labs to downstream marketing. Last year, we focused on media, marketing, and commerce, but this year we broadened it to include research and operations. We're interested in new ideas that accelerate brand innovation and those founders or teams passionate about making a difference alongside our global beauty brands. We know it’s not easy for startups to work with a big corporate, so we've learned to create ways to build real partnerships.

Is one goal to identify missing capabilities in beauty tech that L'Oreal might eventually acquire?

Acquisition is always a possibility. For example, we acquired ModiFace, an AR/VR startup we first partnered with in 2018. They now provide services across many of our brands globally. But not everything leads to acquisition. Many partnerships focus on leveraging technology differently or more efficiently. We have venture funds and scouting programs to explore all these timelines, from pilots in local markets to scaling globally.

Do startups you partner with see a direct impact, like increased sales?

While I don’t have specific numbers, that’s definitely part of the plan. We commit to commercial pilots with them and provide mentorship across our global ecosystem, including partners like Google, Meta, and Accenture. We also help raise their visibility through PR and brand association. It’s designed as a win-win: startups get access and growth opportunities, and we gain fresh innovation. Some technologies, like AI-enabled dubbing, crowdsourced creative content, and TV-to-e-commerce integrations, are already enhancing marketing performance and consumer conversion.

How much of this is about marketing innovation?

Marketing today is about doing both simple things better at scale, with AI efficiency, and creating new excitement and relevance. These startups show both ends of the spectrum: increasing quality and scale in content production and pioneering innovative formats like direct TV integration.

How is AI changing product creation and personalisation at L’Oréal?

We were recently voted the most innovative AI company in Europe. AI helps us move beyond PowerPoint ideas to real enterprise-grade solutions across the value chain, from speeding product development and using molecular databases in partnership with IBM, to automating content production for e-commerce and creating personalised marketing briefs internally through our own AI 'create tech' platform. AI also helps sift and analyse consumer data for better insights. It’s human plus machine, boosting speed, efficiency, and sustainability.

What about human oversight versus automation? What ethical considerations do you uphold?

Human oversight is always essential. We haven’t moved to fully automated AI. For example, customer chats always have an option to switch to a human agent. We’ve committed to not creating AI-generated human images like hair or skin because we sell real products for real people. Transparency about AI use is key, as is our internal AI ethics board that reviews new products. As we enter this post-truth era, brand quality, reputation, and consistency become more important than ever.

How do you handle concerns in this 'post-truth' era about AI-generated content versus human authenticity?

We take responsibility seriously and are transparent about AI use. We don't use AI to create deceptive images or content. Brand quality and trust will be paramount as consumers seek consistent, credible products and messaging.

Can you share some particularly exciting startups from your current program?

Sure. One is Halo AI from Dubai. They use AI to identify influencers and manage outreach in beauty advocacy. Another is an Indian startup called Without that transforms unrecyclable waste into recyclable material, aligning with our sustainability goals. Sravathi AI is also an Indian startup that works on bringing AI into upstream lab chemistry for product development. Heat Seeker out of Australia creates synthetic consumer data to gain insights when real-world testing isn’t feasible. Plus, Wubble out of Singapore uses AI to help real musicians produce bespoke brand music, which we could use in stores or ads. These examples cover a broad spectrum from sustainability to consumer insights and content creation.

What are common roadblocks when working with startups and how do you overcome them?

Complexities like legal, compliance, security issues in large corporations can be tough for startups. We create special frameworks and pilot projects to help startups navigate these. We also coach startups on adapting their pitches and understanding our specific needs. It’s about a mutually beneficial learning and growth process.

Why do so many startups (80%) struggle to scale, and how do you help close that gap?

Having a good idea isn’t enough. It needs to fit the right brand, product, market, and moment. We commit to pilots with selected startups to limit pitching and focus on action. During this, we help them refine their propositions and approach. It’s like tailoring a cover letter to a job, understanding what customers need and when.

Are you worried about nurturing future competitors by working with startups?

We believe it’s about adding capability to grow the category as a whole. We’re the number one beauty company and see it as our responsibility to lead innovation and ecosystem building. We don’t see startups working with us as direct competitors but as partners advancing the industry.

How do you see beauty tech and AI evolving in the future?

Three areas: First, AI in product creation—faster, smarter, sustainable processes. Second, AI changing brand-consumer interaction through virtual trials, skin analysis, and personalised e-commerce experiences. Third, AI driving efficiency internally across all functions, factories, labs, offices, with AI tools empowering our teams.

What are your hopes for the Big Bang Beauty Tech Innovation Program and how do you see it fostering innovation through partnerships with startups going forward?

Open innovation is a big focus for us. It’s about finding opportunities, partnering with startups, and mentoring them for mutual success beyond just one-off pilot deals. We are building a community to foster ongoing innovation across many markets and brands, supported by our accelerator based here in Paris.

What’s really important for me, I’ve said this many times, is creating a true win-win. It’s not just about paying a startup for a pilot with one brand; we offer 12 months of mentoring support. I personally get involved in three or four of those mentorships, where I meet the startups to share experience on working with our teams and to help with their pitch decks. We also connect them with our partners who can help them scale and grow. Our approach goes beyond just finding new technology, it’s about building lasting, collaborative relationships that enable startups to thrive and innovate alongside L’Oréal, creating benefits for both sides.

Nvidia’s strong financial performance and positive earnings call sentiment are the most significant factors driving the stock score. However, technical analysis indicates potential bearish momentum, and the high valuation suggests limited upside potential.

“The market has been crying out for something more distinctive, and interesting in the sports betting space. At betr, we’re not interested in being part of the herd,” said Tony Thomas, Chief Marketing Officer of betr.

“This campaign, featuring The GOAT, talks to our ambition to stay ahead of the game & two steps ahead of the competition.”

“In terms of disruption, we have genuinely disrupted the betting category. A category stuck in over stereotyped cliché portrayals of Aussies and created something distinctive that can work across all channels in potent ways.”

When asked for a statement, The Goat nodded in agreement.

The campaign includes a series of films produced by Good Oil, featuring practical animatronics created by Oscar-winning studio Weta. The work is running nationally across all channels in collaboration with PHD Media.

But the U.S. oil industry still has some skin in the game when it comes to Venezuela.
Gulf Coast refiners in particular.
So, if there is a regime change after all, the U.S. lifts sanctions and Venezuelan oil flows more freely to Gulf Coast refiners.
In that case… “Heavy crude pricing would get more expensive,” Chowdhury said.","All the very serious geopolitical implications aside, economically, a U.S. blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers couldn’t really come at a better time. Globally, there is a glut of crude oil — prices are low and over the years, the U.S. has mostly weaned itself off of Venezuelan oil because of production decreases and sanctions. But the U.S. oil industry still has some skin in the game when it comes to Venezuela. Gulf Coast refiners in particular.

Years before fracking, the U.S. looked to Latin America for oil, especially Venezuela and Mexico. The problem was their oil was heavier — syrupy.

“U.S. refiners invested about $100 billion from 1990 to 2010 to handle heavier crudes as global supply patterns changed because of the additional heavy crude that was coming from Venezuela and Mexico,” said Debnil Chowdhury with S&P Global Energy.

But that $100 billion bet didn’t go as planned. Gregory Brew with the Eurasia Group said in Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela, and his administration took a more aggressive nationalist stance and seized assets from U.S. oil companies.

“[There’s also been] years of general mismanagement and technical inefficiencies on the side of Venezuelans,” Brew said.

And the U.S. imposed sanctions.

So, those Gulf Coast refineries made for Venezuelan oil, found themselves largely without. They’ve pivoted, but it’s still not an ideal match.

“Even though refineries have changed into processing much more light oil, they still are thirsty for heavy,” said Francisco Monaldi with Rice University.

So, if there is a regime change after all, the U.S. lifts sanctions and Venezuelan oil flows more freely to Gulf Coast refiners.

“The Venezuelan barrels, I think, would slip right into our system very effectively,” said Dan Pickering with Pickering Energy Partners. “It would be a positive on the margin for U.S. gasoline consumers and the U.S. refining system.”

But regime change is a big if, so there’s another scenario to consider: a sustained blockade with large amounts of heavy Venezuelan crude taken out of the global market. In that case…

“Heavy crude pricing would get more expensive,” Chowdhury said.

Refineries would keep operating — but it could hurt their margins.",https://img.apmcdn.org/be882ea8294357ac4f3d6a58a820a0309d628eb9/widescreen/a3368d-20251217-a-mural-depicting-an-oil-pump-and-the-venezuelan-flag-2000.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 21:00:03.479005

Delta Air Lines DAL said on Wednesday that Glen Hauenstein, its president and the architect of its premium-focused strategy, will retire in February.

Hauenstein, 64, joined the Atlanta-based airline in 2005 and has served as president since 2016. During his tenure, he led a sweeping transformation that repositioned Delta from a mass-market carrier to a premium brand.

He championed high-end products and persuaded travelers to pay for seats, such as first class, that were once given away as free upgrades.

The strategy has delivered strong results: premium products accounted for 43% of Delta's passenger revenue in the latest quarter, up eight percentage points from pre-pandemic levels.

Executives now expect revenue from premium cabins to surpass main cabin ticket sales as early as 2026.

""Glen's vision and strategic mindset have been essential in transforming Delta into the leading global airline we are today,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said.

Under Hauenstein's leadership, Delta generated far more revenue per seat than its rivals, more than twice the industry average, according to Jefferies analysts.

The company's success has forced rivals United UAL and American Airlines AAL to follow suit, investing heavily in upgraded cabins and luxury ground experiences to attract high-paying travelers.

Hauenstein also drove the shift in loyalty programs to reward total spending rather than miles flown, a model now standard among major U.S. carriers.

""It's hard to know whether you're lucky or good, but I would say he was good before he was lucky,"" said Robert Mann, a former airline executive turned consultant.

Hauenstein was instrumental in expanding Delta's global footprint, building a network that spans six continents and forging joint ventures with carriers such as Virgin Atlantic, Air France-KLM AF, and Korean Air 003490.

He will retire on February 28 but remain with Delta through 2026 as a strategic adviser.

The airline named Joe Esposito, senior vice president of network planning, as executive vice president and chief commercial officer. Esposito will oversee revenue management, sales, and the SkyMiles loyalty program.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 23:03:26.048830

Its software platform supports patent professionals throughout the entire lifecycle of intellectual property, from idea capture and novelty assessment to drafting, prosecution and portfolio strategy.

The platform unifies fragmented patent tasks into a secure, unified workflow that allows users to manage everything in one place rather than across disconnected documents, spreadsheets and legacy systems. The platform helps users to create patent plans from start to finish, including making claims, clearer descriptions and more secure patent portfolios.

Under the hood, the platform uses AI to accelerate and enhance key patent processes, including performing instant novelty and prior-art analysis across hundreds of millions of patent applications and scientific publications. The platform is also built with robust governance and secure data controls tailored for sensitive patent work to ensure that corporate inventions and proprietary information remain protected throughout the IP generation and prosecution process.

“Invention is how we solve humanity’s biggest challenges, yet the systems that protect those ideas are decades out of date,” said co-founder Tamar Gomez. “AI will redefine how global organizations innovate over the next five years, turning IP from a cost center into a growth driver. The companies that adopt Ankar now will shape the future of innovation.”

Ankar’s solution is designed for both in-house IP teams and external patent law firms, helping them boost productivity, with customers reporting measurable gains while shifting effort from manual, administrative tasks to higher-value strategic work.

Oracle falls on AI datacenter concerns

Shares of tech giant Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ) fell more than 5% on Wednesday on reports Blue Owl Capital will not back the company’s $10 billion AI datacenter in Michigan, which is expected to be used for OpenAI.

Blue Owl had been in talks with lenders and Oracle over a potential investment in the 1-gigawatt data center project in Saline Township, but those discussions ultimately stalled.

Shares of Oracle have been the poster child for AI datacenter buildout concerns, as investors worry about the amount of capital needed for the projects, their ultimate payback, and the circular nature of the deals.

Shares of Oracle are down over 41% over the past three months but remain up 14% year-to-date.

Fed still has room to cut - Waller

Federal Reserve Governor said Wednesday that the U.S. central bank still has room to cut interest rates amid concerns that the job market has softened.

“I still think we’re probably, you know, maybe we’re 50 to 100 basis points off of neutral,"" which means the Fed still has room to cut interest rates, Waller said at the Yale School of Management CEO Summit in New York.

Given the outlook, ""there’s no rush to get down"" on interest rates, Waller said, and ""we just can steadily, kind of bring the policy rate down towards neutral"" amid what’s likely to be an economy with moderating inflation.

The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points last week, citing a desire to prop up a faltering labor market despite indications of sticky inflationary pressures.

Data this week has pointed to a struggling jobs market, as although grew more than expected in November, this was accompanied by an increase in the jobless rate to a four-year high.

The rise in payrolls was also much smaller than a sharp decline seen in prior months.

Other readings also flagged some cooling in the U.S. economy. Purchasing managers index data for December showed growth in both and was lower than expected, while delayed data for October showed growth cooling from the prior month.

Waller’s comments are of particular interest following a Wall Street Journal report that President Donald Trump is set to interview him for the next Fed Chair. Trump has previously noted that former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett are his top picks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term at the helm of the Fed is scheduled to end in May.

Waller was appointed to the Fed’s board by Trump, but is seen as more of an underdog for the role because he does not have as close a personal relationship with Trump as either Warsh or Hassett, the WSJ reported.

The for November is due on Thursday.

Elsewhere, Lennar (NYSE: ) stock fell after the U.S. homebuilder reported fourth-quarter profit which came up short of expectations, as worries surround the impact of elevated costs on homebuying demand.

Warner Bros Discovery’s (NASDAQ: ) board rejected Paramount Skydance’s (NASDAQ: ) $108.4 billion hostile bid, citing lack of financing assurances.

The decision to recommit to Netflix’s (NASDAQ: ) buyout offer marked the latest twist in the race for assets that include Warner Bros’ storied film and TV studio and its extensive film and television library.

In addition to that potentially positive news for retailers, Adobe also reported that online sales have remained solid following a strong start to the season. E-commerce sales on U.S. retail sites were up 6.1% as of December 12.

For the seven days following Cyber Week, e-commerce returns were down 0.1%, Adobe reported.

The early numbers on returns could support a trend researchers and shopper surveys have been spotlighting since early fall - that consumers are being more deliberate and more informed about their purchases, and that AI is helping them do that.

“Consumers are being very strategic, considered and conscientious about what they buy within the broader macroeconomic environment,” Vivek Pandya, Director, Adobe Digital Insights said.

Pandya noted that consumers ""are using AI tools to determine the best items to select for their holiday shopping, and given this elevated level of consideration we're seeing incrementally lower rates of return than observed in previous years.”

Adobe previously reported that AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail sites was up 760% in November, compared to the previous November. AI chat services and browsers were used most frequently by shoppers looking for video games, appliances, electronics, toys, and personal care products.

Adobe’s numbers are based on Adobe Analytics data culled from over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, covering 100 million products and 18 product categories.

On returns, Adobe found that while shoppers are buying primarily on their mobile phones, they are using their desktops to make returns. While 52.4% of overall online spending was done on a mobile device, only 39.1% of returns happened on a mobile device rather than a desktop.

Based on past patterns, Adobe is expecting the last week in December to be the busiest time for returns. In the 2024 holiday season, one out of every eight returns occurred between December 26 and December 31. Returns are also expected to be elevated through the first two weeks of January.

Online shoppers also are continuing to use BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) flexible payment plans to cover record amounts of spending, according to Adobe. During the first six weeks of the holiday season BNPL plans were used for $13.9 billion in online spending, up 6% over last year.

The idea behind BenchmarkCards is to give developers a clearer picture of what a benchmark actually tests and where its limits are. Each card includes five sections covering the benchmark’s purpose, data sources, evaluation method, possible risks, and ethical or legal considerations. This makes it easier to compare benchmarks side by side and choose the right one for a specific task. For example, a company trying to reduce harmful content might choose a toxicity-focused benchmark, while a researcher studying fairness would select a bias-focused one.

The researchers hope that this shared format becomes a common language across the AI community. To speed things up, the team also built an automated workflow that can create a benchmark card in about 10 minutes instead of several hours. Indeed, the system pulls information from research papers, converts it into readable text, extracts key details using AI, and then checks those details for accuracy using fact‑verification tools.

Esposito has worked for Delta since 1990, starting in a customer service position in Orlando. Delta says he has spent of his time at Delta working closely with Hauenstein to build its premium model and global network.

NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz's decision ‌to ​tap Steve Cahillane - the dealmaker who steered ‌Kellogg through one of the packaged food industry's biggest breakups - signals the ketchup maker may be ​positioning itself for major asset sales as it pushes ahead with its own split, according to bankers, analysts and a former executive.

Kraft Heinz announced the ‍CEO change while in the midst of ​separating its more than 200 brands into two companies. Shares of the Jell-O maker, among the worst performers in packaged food, are down ​19% this year, ⁠versus a rise of almost 3% in the broader S&P 500 Consumer Staples index.

Former Kellogg CEO Cahillane, appointed to run Kraft Heinz on Tuesday, oversaw the separation of the Corn Flakes and Pringles maker about two years ago, which later saw privately-held Mars scooping up the faster-growing snacks division, Kellanova, at a 33% premium.

With Cahillane on board, Kraft Heinz may be hoping to woo a suitor for ‌its sauces and condiments business, which is expected to have higher margins than its grocery division, according to analysts.

""It's clear ​they're signaling ‌to the market and potential ‍buyers that they're in play,"" ⁠said Bill Johnson, the CEO of H.J. Heinz until 2013, when it was taken private by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil-based 3G Capital. ""We have someone who knows how to do these deals.

""It's (also) an acknowledgement the management team needed upgrading. In case they can't sell the company, they need someone who can operate it better than it's been operated,"" Johnson added.

SHOPPERS CUT BACK

Sales of packaged food in the United States have faltered as shoppers cut back due to sky-high prices, and try newer brands with less processing, hurting Kraft Heinz and its rivals like Conagra.

Kraft Heinz, created in ​a 2015 megadeal, however, has particularly struggled with well-worn brands like Crystal Light drinks, Lunchables meal kits and Kraft Mayo.

Cahillane will also lead Kraft Heinz's condiments and spreads business, which includes Heinz ketchup and Philadelphia cream cheese, after the split, set to be finalized at the end of 2026.

That division is expected to command a higher multiple than Kraft Heinz's overall because of the higher margins, exposure to international markets and potential faster growth. Kraft Heinz's multiple lags peers including General Mills , Mondelez and Conagra.

This year ushered in a crop of major deals for consumer-facing companies like Kraft Heinz, which have faced blowback from shoppers on high prices and wrestled with increasing costs from tariffs.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is also smoothing the path for deal-making, in contrast to his predecessor former President Joe Biden.

Huggies diaper maker Kimberly Clark ​announced plans to acquire Kenvue, which markets pain reliever Tylenol, for nearly $50 billion last month. European confectioner Ferrero bought Kellogg's smaller cereal unit, W.K. Kellogg, for $3.1 billion earlier this year, another success for Cahillane.

To be sure, Max Gumport, a senior analyst at BNP Paribas, said in a research note that he struggles to see logical buyers for Kraft Heinz's business after ​the split.

Kraft Heinz failed to sell Oscar Mayer last year. It also attempted to sell coffee brand Maxwell House.

Council Member Shaun Abreu, who sponsored the legislation, said the suit amounts to retaliation against workers.
We won’t stand by while the apps retaliate against workers who organized for a minimum wage,” Abreu said in a statement.
“Over 80,000 delivery workers at the core of our food delivery ecosystem take on dangerous conditions using their own personal equipment to bring meals to our doors.
Uber and DoorDash have also sued the city repeatedly in recent years over minimum wage increases.","Uber and DoorDash are suing New York City over its Tipping Law, which requires them to offer customers the option to tip at least 10% at checkout — not after an order is paid — claiming that the law exacerbates the city’s affordability crisis and violates the companies’ right to free speech.

“The city compels [Uber and Doordash] to advocate for and implicitly endorse the city’s preferred message — i.e., that New York City customers should tip delivery workers, that they should do so before those workers complete the delivery, and that 10% is an appropriate amount,” the companies allege in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. “The Tipping Law unlawfully compels [them] to convey and endorse a message in New York City that they do not communicate now and would not otherwise communicate.”

The Tipping Law was passed in July and takes effect next month. Council Member Shaun Abreu, who sponsored the legislation, said the suit amounts to retaliation against workers.

“Our goal is to protect workers who perform a difficult, valuable service. We won’t stand by while the apps retaliate against workers who organized for a minimum wage,” Abreu said in a statement. “Over 80,000 delivery workers at the core of our food delivery ecosystem take on dangerous conditions using their own personal equipment to bring meals to our doors. If a customer wants to reward that work with a tip, the apps shouldn’t make it harder for them to do so.”

A DoorDash spokesperson accused the City Council of “pressuring customers” to tip and “turning tipping into an added tax,” and said the lawsuit was about “fighting rising costs and ensuring delivery remains fast and affordable for all New Yorkers.”

A spokesperson for Uber did not immediately respond when asked for comment.

The companies argue that the law“constitutes a regulatory taking” of their property rights by controlling how they communicate with customers and that, because they’ve increased delivery fees after laws raising the minimum wage for their workers to $21.44/hour passed, prompting customers to tip before a delivery will “materially impair [their] goodwill, customer demand, business opportunities, and revenue,” because of increased costs to using their platforms and “growing customer tip fatigue.”

The city’s Law Department, which reviews lawsuits against the city, said it is reviewing the suit.

The city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection called the suit disappointing, accusing the companies of wanting to hide the option to tip, take away consumer choice and punish workers.

“We are disappointed that, once again, Uber and DoorDash are attempting to limit app-based delivery workers’ right to fair and dignified compensation — now, by seeking to restrict consumers’ ability and choice to decide how and when to tip,” the department said in a statement. “Tipping has always been voluntary, but hiding the option in the app or adding hurdles to the process takes that choice away from consumers and punishes workers by lowering their overall potential earnings.”

Their suit is one of the latest clashes between tech platforms and the New York City government over regulations aimed at increasing worker and consumer protections. Earlier this month, Instacart filed a suit to challenge Local Law 124, which increases the minimum wage for grocery delivery workers to $21.44/hour and requires the company to pay workers for time they spend “on call,” not just time they physically spend delivering groceries. Uber and DoorDash have also sued the city repeatedly in recent years over minimum wage increases.

Additionally, in October of this year, the city sued a slew of big tech companies, including Meta, Google, Snap and ByteDance, arguing that their platforms — Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube and TikTok — are fueling a youth mental health crisis. It argues that in “deliberately” trying to maximize youth engagement, it caused young people to become addicted to the platforms and are therefore liable to pay for counseling and other resources in schools to address the issues they’ve caused. The suit is currently in the pre-trial phase.",https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1856636909.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-12-17 18:04:38.894111

""Glen and his team have been central to Delta's premium strategy, as we evolved over two decades to become the airline of choice for travelers who want to invest in great experiences in the air and on the ground,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in a note to employees. ""I could not have asked for a better co-pilot to help lead Delta in becoming the best performing airline in the world.""

Delta is promoting Joe Esposito, who has been at Delta for 35 years — most recently as senior vice president of network planning, pricing and revenue management — to executive vice president and chief commercial officer.

Hauenstein, 64, has been with Delta since 2005 and was named to his current role in 2016. He was previously executive vice president and chief revenue officer at the airline. He will become a strategic advisor until the end of 2026.

During his tenure, Hauenstein grew Delta's international network and helped the airline identify new ways to earn more per seat, in part by successfully getting customers to pay for first-class seats it used to give away for free. In October, Delta said that premium-travel revenue would overtake sales from main cabin next year.

At times, Delta's strategies proved successful with too many customers. Overcrowding in its Sky Club airport lounges prompted the airline to raise the entry bar to get rid of unsightly lines.

""Glen has played a significant role in Delta's transformation since its [2005] bankruptcy filing,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel-industry consulting firm. Hauenstein pushed for the now-industry standard to move the loyalty program to reward spending and not just miles flown and encouraged Delta to invest in better pricing and revenue software, he said.

Harteveldt added that Delta must also figure out when it will upgrade its cabin interiors and make sure it's not alienating customers, some of whom have complained about high redemption rates for frequent flyer miles.

While Delta continues to generate more profit than other carriers, competitors like United Airlines have been investing heavily in revamped cabins, complimentary fast Wi-Fi and new planes. American Airlines , which had been late to the luxury travel boom, is also investing in better products on board and at the airport.

Along with leaning into affluent consumers, Hauenstein had also noted a trend of wealthy baby boomers who were willing to travel.

""Being a baby boomer, I can say this without fear of retribution. There's only so much time to go to Europe or almost so much time to go see Australia or Japan,"" he said on an earnings call in April. ""And so you've got this wealth effect where this cohort of retirees is wealthier than any other cohort even with the most recent rundown, and they want to go do things.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108243221-1766003032115-gettyimages-2245813826-DELTA_CENTENNIAL_NYSE.jpeg?v=1766003103&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-12-17 17:07:02.702227

He became CFO of Booz Allen in 2022 after serving in a variety of roles in the corporate office, including chief strategy officer and executive vice president of financial planning and analysis, strategic finance and corporate development.

Prior to his time at BCG, he served for seven years in an executive role at Booz Allen’s global commercial business. There, he focused on large-scale transformation for both government and commercial customers, S&P Global said.

The Tuesday release credited Calderone with shaping “many aspects” of Booz Allen’s financial and strategic transformation during his long career at the company. As chief strategy officer, he developed and rolled out “VoLT,” a growth strategy built around velocity, leadership, and technology, the release said.

He also built and led the company’s corporate development team, guiding more than $1.5 billion in merger-and-acquisition transactions as well as equity investments, divestitures, and joint ventures. Earlier in his career, he designed and executed Booz Allen’s Vision 2020 growth strategy and led the company’s restructuring in 2013, S&P Global noted.

Calderone’s “leadership and public company experience will be essential as we continue building the financial and operational foundation for Mobility as an independent company,” Eager said in the release.

The planned spin-off will allow Mobility more flexibility to pursue near- and long-term growth opportunities, including in used car offerings and expanding both geographically and into adjacent markets, according to an April 29 announcement. S&P Global, meanwhile, will remain focused on providing credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow services, the company said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_WBwzFeD1Qq_sRXMCTJGmGR9q32wiSwWon_2AMdI9vw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTU4NDg0MTM3XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-17 16:04:43.863009

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

Market Update

As a result of the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.

Robert Bosch, LLC v. Westport Fuel Systems Canada, Inc., No. 2:23-cv-00038 (E.D. Tex.), Dkt. No. 38 (Payne, J.)

On November 6, 2025, Judge Payne denied Robert Bosch’s motion to compel Westport Fuel Systems Canada to substantively respond to an interrogatory concerning obviousness-type double patenting (OTDP). Specifically, the interrogatory concerned Westport's factual and legal bases for contending that the asserted patent was not invalid for OTDP.

In response to the motion, Westport countered that Bosch never properly pleaded OTDP. Westport pointed to Bosch’s answer, which asserted only statutory invalidity grounds “under one or more sections of Title 35.” Beyond this ""perfunctory, single-sentence"" reference to solely statutory invalidity theories, id. at 2, Bosch otherwise failed to identify where it had timely notified Westport of its OTDP theory.

Given Bosch's failure, Judge Payne agreed with Westport that Bosch’s OTDP theory was untimely. The court noted that Bosch’s pleading contained a single sentence listing statutory invalidity provisions but “nowhere . . . state[d], or even hint[ed], that any non-statutory invalidity bases are asserted.” Id. at 2. Because OTDP is a “judicially-created doctrine,” not a statutory § 101 defense, the court held that Bosch’s answer could not reasonably be read to include it. Id. (citing Eli Lilly & Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 251 F.3d 955, 967 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).

The court was also unpersuaded by Bosch’s alternative argument — that Bosch lacked a basis to raise OTDP until after claim construction. According to Judge Payne, Westport’s infringement contentions were enough to put Bosch on notice years earlier, and raising OTDP for the first time in a supplemental damages interrogatory response — after the amended-pleadings deadline, after fact discovery, and with expert reports imminent — constituted undue delay. With OTDP not properly in the case, the motion to compel was denied as moot.

PLS IV, LLC v. GDC Technology Limited, No. 2:24-cv-00466 (E.D. Tex.), Dkt. No. 62 (Gilstrap, J.)

On November 24, 2025, Judge Gilstrap issued a claim construction order resolving four disputes across two digital security-related patents. In its order, the court applied an exception to a lesser-known claim construction rule involving ""whereby"" clauses. Specifically, the court considered whether the disputed claim's “whereby” clause limits the scope of the method. The method involves generating and transmitting an ""encoded block of data"" to a ""user's system,""

whereby the user’s system is able to receive and authenticate portions of the encoded block of data before the entire encoded block of data is received

Id. at 4–5 (quoting U.S. Patent No. 7,340,602 at Cl. 25). The parties disagreed over whether this whereby clause should be treated merely as an intended result of the method steps (i.e., the general rule for whereby clauses) or as a substantive claim limitation (i.e., an exception to the general rule).

Judge Gilstrap applied the exception, holding that the clause is limiting. Relying on Hoffer v. Microsoft Corp., 405 F.3d 1326, 1329–30 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court explained that while “‘whereby’ clauses often recite intended results, they cannot be disregarded when they supply a condition material to the invention.” The court went on to explain that here, “the clause ‘clearly describes a capability of the user’s system,’ and the applicant chose to pair the encoding method with a transmission step and a receiving system that must have the specified ability.”

Gatekeeper Solutions, Inc. v. Darktrace, Inc., No. 4:24-cv-00723 (E.D. Tex.), Dkt. No. 39 (Jordan, J.)

We now transfer from Marshall to Sherman, but we may not be there long. This November, Judge Jordan granted Darktrace’s motion to transfer Gatekeeper Solutions’ email security patent case to the Northern District of California. Applying Fifth Circuit § 1404(a) principles, the court held that Darktrace had demonstrated that the Northern District of California is “clearly the more convenient venue” for this action, finding that no factors weighed against transfer.

Gatekeeper, a New York company, accuses Darktrace's email protection feature of patent infringement. This email protection feature prevents users from sending messages to conflicting recipients. Darktrace, headquartered in San Francisco, supported its motion with uncontroverted evidence that all of its ""likely witnesses"" work in or near San Francisco, none are located in the Eastern District of Texas, and the accused product’s technical documentation resides on servers in Darktrace’s San Francisco and Cambridge, UK, offices.

Gatekeeper had some evidentiary hooks at its disposal. Darktrace maintained a small sales office in Plano at the time the lawsuit was filed, though that office closed by the time of the court's decision. Moreover, even though two dozen of Darktrace's clients were located in the transferee district, it did have a customer in the Eastern District of Texas.

But these small hooks were insufficient to warrant keeping the case. Judge Jordan found that most of the private interest factors favored transfer or were neutral.

The first factor — access to proof — favored California because of Darktrace's uncontested testimony that all relevant technical documents are stored on servers in San Francisco and none in the Eastern District of Texas.

The second factor — the availability of compulsory process — likewise favored transfer. Nearly two dozen Darktrace customers who use the accused product and former employees (i.e., ""potential"" third-party witnesses) are located in the Northern District of California, compared to only one customer in the Eastern District of Texas. The court even considered the fact that current employees may leave before trial as favoring transfer.

The third factor — cost for willing witnesses — favored California because all putative willing witnesses resided there, while Gatekeeper identified none in Texas.

For the public interest factors, the court found that the local interest factor also tilted westward, with the remaining factors being neutral.

Though the court concluded that the congestion factor was neutral, it noted that the Sherman Division faces an unusually high caseload. Indeed, despite its finding of neutrality, the court spent a page discussing district-wide statistics and their inconclusive nature, all while suggesting that the Eastern District of Texas is, in fact, quite congested.

The local interest factor weighed decisively in favor of transfer. Darktrace is headquartered in San Francisco, relevant witnesses and documents are located there, and several of the accused acts occurred in that district. By contrast, neither party resides in the Eastern District and Darktrace has no remaining presence there.

Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices.

dfcu Bank has taken a major step in its digital transformation journey by signing a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with global technology leader IBM and IBM Platinum Partner Envision Global.

The MoU was signed at dfcu Bank Head Offices in Nakasero, Kampala, and formalises a long-term strategic partnership aimed at strengthening the bank’s digital infrastructure and transforming how it connects with customers, partners, and the whole financial ecosystem.

The agreement focuses on developing and deploying an enterprise-grade software integration platform called the API Gateway.

This platform will allow dfcu to securely and efficiently connect its internal systems with external partners, enabling faster collaboration, product co-creation, and innovation across various sectors, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, education, and other industries.

“The partnership is a critical pillar of the bank’s ongoing transformation journey, which is aimed at improving customer experience and ensuring long-term competitiveness. Additionally, upgrading core systems is essential to making the bank future-ready and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of its customers,” Charles Mudiwa dfcu Bank Chief Executive Officer, said.

He explained that today’s customers are increasingly demanding higher levels of service, convenience, and reliability, driven by rapid technological change.

To that effect, dfcu is focused on enabling customers to access modern banking services seamlessly, allowing them to bank wherever they are and whenever they want, without unnecessary barriers.

“The main purpose of the API Gateway is system integration, acting as a bridge that allows seamless communication between the bank and its partners. Through this platform, customers of both the bank and partner institutions will be able to access each other’s products and services, enhancing reach and value for all stakeholders,” Musa Musazi, Chief Technology, Digital & Operations Officer at dfcu, said.

IBM brings to the partnership its globally developed API Gateway technology, an enterprise-grade integration solution designed to support secure, scalable, and reliable connectivity.

Envision Global, an IBM Platinum Partner, on the other hand will be responsible for implementing and deploying the platform within dfcu Bank’s ecosystem, ensuring it meets agreed quality standards, timelines, and enterprise requirements.

At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.
He was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley.
In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups.
They followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook.","When the billionaire chief executive of AI chipmaker Nvidia threw a party in central London for Donald Trump’s state visit in September, the power imbalance between Silicon Valley and British politicians was vividly exposed.

Jensen Huang hastened to the stage after meetings at Chequers and rallied his hundreds of guests to cheer on the power of AI. In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.

“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.

But his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.

Starmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.

Not done, Huang called to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.

This week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn ChatGPT maker, Open AI, hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.

He was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.

They followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that, but said he was paid “extremely well”.

Meanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.

TBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.

The Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”

Jobs with the biggest US AI companies could be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also required comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing, as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.

Selling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.

Britain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.

The revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield, the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco startup incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08f3e143004db91eb604503fa3c2704aef40f751/1796_74_2930_2344/master/2930.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1330bbc1f14518b03f398a7c2514ab85",N,,2025-12-17 14:03:40.918656

Ambros furthers a tear of investments from RA Capital, which, according to data compiled by BioPharma Dive, was the most prolific venture capital firm in biotech over the past four years.
Since 2022, RA Capital has participated in 85 funding rounds, including more than a dozen this year.","A young drug company has raised $125 million to get a medicine used for a rare kind of chronic pain approved in the U.S.

Officially launched on Tuesday, Ambros Therapeutics was co-founded by biotechnology entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The startup’s main asset is a new “bisphosphonate,” a type of drug that prevents bone loss. Research indicates these compounds also possess anti-inflammatory properties and can act as pain relievers.

Ambros’ medicine, called neridronate, was discovered, developed, and commercialized by another company, Abiogen Pharma, for the Italian market. There, it’s already approved to treat a couple of bone diseases as well as an uncommon disorder known as “complex regional pain syndrome Type I.”

In that latter condition, patients who’ve undergone surgery or suffered an injury, such as a broken bone or sprain, subsequently experience a disproportionate amount of pain from the initial trauma. The pain is persistent, and can feel like extreme burning, throbbing, stabbing or squeezing.

Ambros bought from Abiogen exclusive rights to neridronate in North America. Now, with its new Series A funding, the startup aims to begin in the first three months of next year a late-stage study that could serve as the foundation for an approval filing with the Food and Drug Administration.

In addition to financing that study, the money will be used for “related regulatory preparations and pre-commercial activities,” Ambros said in a statement. The FDA has already granted neridronate a few designations that could speed its regulatory review and give it commercial benefits. Ambros said an estimated 65,000 new cases of CRPS-1 occur annually in the U.S.

RA Capital Management and an arm of Patient Square Capital co-led the round. They were joined by Abiogen Pharma and more than half a dozen other investors.

“Neridronate is one of the few late-stage programs with a well-established mechanism, extensive real-world experience, and the potential to meaningfully change the trajectory of CRPS-1,” said Matthew Hammond, an RA Capital partner, in that statement.

Ambros furthers a tear of investments from RA Capital, which, according to data compiled by BioPharma Dive, was the most prolific venture capital firm in biotech over the past four years. Since 2022, RA Capital has participated in 85 funding rounds, including more than a dozen this year.

Ambros’ haul also comes at a time when pain research — long considered too risky a proposition for most life sciences backers — is drawing more interest, in good part because of the recent approval of a non-opioid pain medication from Vertex Pharmaceuticals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Q8dHTPNVdfKEShMzywzN1ZZ0u7VnhJ6ZlucQOISYAC0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTgxNjMyMDM3X1RzOVRoTGguanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-17 14:03:09.483530

There are already businesses winning the AI race, whether they make hardware, operate cloud platforms, or run the large language models that have become so popular among consumers.

But other industries are starting to embrace AI instead of fighting it, showcasing how seriously executive teams are taking this new technology to bolster their competitive positions.

In fact, a prominent streaming giant just decided to partner with a top AI company in a move that could impact the media and entertainment sector. Investors should take notice.

The House of Mouse is leaning into AI

It was announced on Dec. 11 that Walt Disney (DIS 0.89%) entered a three-year partnership with OpenAI, licensing more than 200 characters (including Mickey Mouse, characters from Inside Out and Frozen, and Marvel superheroes) for photo generation on ChatGPT and video generation on Sora by those apps' user bases. Disney can show these user-generated videos on Disney+, its streaming platform.

What's more, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI. And it will become a customer, integrating OpenAI's technology across its organization in various ways for its employees and to help create new products for customers.

This is clear evidence that Disney is leaning into AI, at a time when those in Hollywood worry about the tech's impact on content creation.

""Disney and OpenAI affirm a shared commitment to responsible use of AI that protects the safety of users and the rights of creators,"" the press release reads.

This is an encouraging statement for those in the industry, but it will be interesting to see how much appetite there is for watching AI-created videos from viewers.

Disney benefits because it can potentially earn incremental revenue by leveraging its intellectual property in this new way. While it's not known if the business will make money from its characters' use on ChatGPT or Sora prompts, it can drive more engagement on Disney+ if this type of short-form content catches on. Disney could better compete with Meta Platforms' Reels on Facebook and Instagram and Alphabet's YouTube Shorts. There is intense competition for attention.

And it gives Disney a first-mover advantage. Perhaps if AI-generated videos go viral, investors could see similar moves by Netflix, for example.

One obvious critique of this decision might be that Disney is selling out and diluting the value of its intellectual property, making its famous characters available to the masses. With ChatGPT counting 800 million weekly users (as of early November), however, this is a good example of a media and entertainment powerhouse attempting to stay ahead of the curve.

This partnership highlights just how valuable Disney's intellectual property is. With characters, storylines, and franchises that span Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, no company can go toe-to-toe with this depth and breadth of content. It makes sense that OpenAI would want to sign a deal with an industry leader. This also suggests there has been significant demand from ChatGPT and Sora users to be more creative and work with Disney characters rather than other studios' intellectual property.

Alpha Bank Cyprus on Wednesday said that 2025 marked a milestone year that reshaped its position in the local market.

This follows the completion of the transfer of most banking activities of the former AstroBank after securing all supervisory approvals, a move aimed at strengthening its scale and ability to support the Cypriot economy.

The bank described the transaction as a “strategic joining of forces that significantly enhances its market presence and creates a new growth dynamic for its operations in Cyprus”.

As a result of the acquisition, Alpha Bank Cyprus has become the country’s third-largest bank, with total assets exceeding €6.6 billion, a loan portfolio of more than €2 billion and deposits above €5.6 billion.

The expanded scale is expected to support increased investment in technology, innovation and human capital, while reinforcing stability, efficiency and the overall customer experience.

The bank said that it is “building an organisation with meaningful size, a solid capital base and a clear strategy, capable of consistently supporting sustainable economic growth and delivering high-quality services to both individuals and businesses”.

A key priority, the bank said, is the “full utilisation of the combined expertise and experience of Alpha Bank and the former AstroBank teams”.

This will involve “a strong focus on corporate and business banking, as well as private and digital banking, an area that continues to evolve rapidly and requires continuous investment in innovation”.

At the same time, Alpha Bank Cyprus stated that it is “stepping up its focus on sustainable finance and green transition solutions, linking the future of banking with responsibility towards society and the environment”.

“Customer service excellence remains central to its strategy, with the bank aiming to deliver products and services aligned with real market needs, including financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, green investment solutions, housing and consumer products on favourable terms, and specialised services for emerging sectors such as technology and energy,” Alpha Bank Cyprus said.

The bank also said that the “digital transformation is at the core of its strategy“, with investments in artificial intelligence, data analytics and automation “designed to simplify processes, reduce servicing costs and create added value for customers”.

“Through the adoption of modern technologies, the bank aims to enhance transaction security, improve response times and offer greater convenience and transparency in the management of banking affairs,” the bank added.

Operational efficiency was described as “a strategic foundation”, supported by continuous improvements in internal processes, stronger risk management and “the promotion of a culture of accountability to safeguard long-term sustainability“.

Moreover, Alpha Bank Cyprus said that “customer needs guide every initiative, with the design of integrated customer journeys that combine innovation, security and ease of use to make banking as simple and immediate as possible”.

The bank also stated that International Banking Services and the Wealth and Institutional Banking division are playing a growing role in the expansion of operations.

These aim to “support entrepreneurs establishing companies in Cyprus, businesses financing trade and operational flows, and investors managing cross-border transactions”.

“The Wealth and Institutional Banking segment targets high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors, offering specialised products and comprehensive solutions in wealth management, investment planning and advisory services,” the bank said.

“By leveraging the international expertise of the Alpha Bank Group and the complementary portfolio of the former AstroBank, Alpha Bank Cyprus provides advanced investment options with transparency and high quality, strengthening long-term trust-based relationships,” it added.

What is more, the Alpha Bank Group described Cyprus as a mature yet dynamic market with strong prospects, citing its strategic location between Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, a developed business ecosystem and a high-quality talent base.

The acquisition of most of the former AstroBank’s banking activities aligns with the group’s strategy to develop regional growth hubs in Greece, Cyprus, England and Luxembourg, creating a unified and modern European banking ecosystem.

“Through the transaction, the group said it has strengthened its capital base and reaffirmed its long-term commitment to regional markets,” the bank said.

The group is also transferring private banking expertise to Cyprus, following international recognition such as the Best Private Bank in Greece award at the Global Private Banking Awards 2025.

Alpha Bank said its strategic cooperation with UniCredit further enhances capabilities, expanding access to European products, services and expertise.

“Cyprus is expected to play an upgraded role as a financial hub, facilitating capital and investment flows and creating new business opportunities,” the bank said, with Alpha Bank Cyprus “aiming to be at the forefront” of this regional connectivity.

Looking ahead, the bank said geopolitical and energy uncertainty is likely to affect tourism, trade and investment, with Cyprus remaining vulnerable due to its size.

The expected normalisation of interest rates is set to put pressure on profitability, increasing the need for revenue diversification and more efficient operating models.

Stricter regulatory and ESG requirements will also demand sustained investment in expertise.

“In this environment, partnerships, outward orientation and consolidation are becoming increasingly important,” the bank said.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/alpha-bank-cyprus-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 14:04:06.261296

Firefly Video Editor Enters Public Beta The public beta of the Firefly video editor marks another step toward consolidation.","Generative AI has made video creation faster but not always predictable. For creators and enterprises experimenting with AI video tools, the biggest challenge has rarely been generation; it has been control. Adobe’s latest Firefly updates indicate the company is now squarely addressing that gap.

With new precision editing tools, expanded partner models, and a limited-time offer of unlimited generations, Adobe is positioning Firefly less as a novelty engine and more as a production-ready layer within modern creative workflows.

Announced on December 17, Adobe’s updates focus on a simple but consequential idea: creators should not have to start over every time AI gets something slightly wrong.

Moving Beyond “Regenerate Everything”

Anyone who has experimented with AI-generated video is familiar with the trade-off: accept small imperfections or regenerate an entire clip and lose what worked. Firefly’s new Prompt to Edit controls aim to change that equation.

Instead of regenerating full videos, creators can now make targeted changes to existing clips using text instructions powered by Runway’s Aleph model. A misplaced object, an unwanted background element, or a subtle lighting issue can be corrected without discarding the original output.

This approach reflects a shift in how Adobe views generative AI, not as a one-shot generator, but as an editable medium that fits into iterative creative processes. For teams producing marketing videos, social content, or brand storytelling at scale, that distinction matters.

Camera Motion Becomes Part of the Prompt

Beyond static edits, Adobe is also extending control to camera movement. With the Firefly Video Model, creators can now upload a reference video to guide camera motion while anchoring the scene to a chosen start frame.

The result is closer to directed cinematography than random motion generation. For use cases such as product videos, explainer content, or brand narratives, this could reduce the trial-and-error cycles that often slow AI-assisted production.

Taken together, text-based edits and motion referencing suggest Adobe is prioritising predictability and repeatability, two attributes enterprises typically demand before adopting creative AI at scale.

Upscaling as a Workflow, Not a Separate Tool

Generative AI does not stop at creation; it often exposes quality gaps when assets move across platforms. Adobe’s integration of Topaz Astra into Firefly Boards addresses a practical issue: low-resolution or legacy footage that does not meet today’s distribution standards.

With Topaz Astra, creators can upscale footage to 1080p or 4K directly within Firefly Boards while continuing other tasks. This parallel processing model reflects how creative teams actually work, especially in agencies or marketing departments managing multiple assets simultaneously.

Rather than positioning upscaling as a standalone enhancement, Adobe is embedding it into the broader content assembly process.

Expanding the Model Ecosystem

Adobe is also widening the choice of image models available within Firefly. The addition of FLUX.2 from Black Forest Labs introduces a model optimised for photorealism, advanced text rendering, and multi-reference support.

By continuing to support both Adobe-built and partner models across Firefly and Creative Cloud tools, Adobe appears to be betting that flexibility, not exclusivity, will define the next phase of creative AI adoption.

Firefly Video Editor Enters Public Beta

The public beta of the Firefly video editor marks another step toward consolidation. Designed as a browser-based assembly space, the editor allows creators to combine AI-generated clips, live footage, music, and audio into finished stories.

Users can work either through a traditional timeline or by editing text transcripts, a feature that aligns well with interview-driven content and talking-head videos. Exports support multiple formats, from vertical social videos to widescreen outputs that integrate with traditional editing pipelines.

For Adobe, this positions Firefly not just as a generator, but as a connective layer between ideation and final delivery.

Adobe’s limited-time offer of unlimited image and video generations for eligible Firefly plans until January 15 is more than a promotional lever. It lowers the cost of experimentation at a moment when creators are still learning how to direct AI effectively.

Unlimited access encourages iteration, refinement, and exploration behaviours that ultimately lead to better outputs and deeper product adoption. It also reinforces Adobe’s emphasis on commercially safe models, a key consideration for enterprise users.

What stands out in this update cycle is not a single feature, but a pattern. Adobe is aligning Firefly with real-world creative constraints: precision, quality, collaboration, and workflow continuity.

As generative AI moves from early experimentation to everyday production, tools that respect how creators actually work may matter more than raw generation speed. Adobe’s latest Firefly updates suggest the company understands that transition—and is building accordingly.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/ciol/media/media_files/2025/12/17/image-2025-12-17-16-40-57.png,N,,2025-12-17 16:03:48.338249

The appointment of Kraft Heinz CEO Steve Cahillane places a seasoned consumer packaged goods executive at the helm during one of the company’s most consequential transitions in decades. Cahillane will also serve as CEO of Global Taste Elevation Co., one of the two entities that will emerge from Kraft Heinz’s planned separation.

Abrams-Rivera will step down at the start of the year and remain an advisor through March 6, 2026, to ensure continuity and a smooth leadership handoff.

A Leadership Change Timed to Transformation

Kraft Heinz framed the decision as a strategic move aligned with its separation plan, announced in September 2025. The company intends to divide into Global Taste Elevation Co. and North American Grocery Co., each operating as a standalone, publicly traded business.

Cahillane called the role a personal milestone and said the breakup will sharpen competitiveness.

He said the separation will help Kraft Heinz move faster, focus more clearly on brand building, and unlock growth opportunities across categories and regions.

Board Chair Miguel Patricio said Cahillane’s experience makes him uniquely qualified to lead during the transition. He credited Abrams-Rivera with reshaping the organization and preparing it for the upcoming split.

Kraft Heinz CEO Steve Cahillane Brings Deep CPG Credentials

Cahillane most recently served as chairman, president, and CEO of Kellanova, the global snacking company formed after Kellogg’s separated its North American cereal business. He led Kellanova until its acquisition by Mars Inc. in December 2025.

During that tenure, Cahillane oversaw portfolio expansion across brands such as Pringles, Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts, and Kellogg’s international businesses. He also guided the operational and structural separation that created Kellanova, an experience Kraft Heinz now views as directly relevant.

Earlier in his career, Cahillane served as CEO of The Nature’s Bounty Co., where he led the global health and wellness business. Before that, he spent seven years at The Coca-Cola Company, including as president of Coca-Cola Americas, the beverage giant’s largest unit by revenue.

He also held senior leadership roles at AB InBev, building a career that spans beverages, snacks, packaged foods, and wellness.

Board Changes Follow the CEO Appointment

Alongside the CEO announcement, Kraft Heinz outlined additional governance changes. John T. Cahill, vice chair of the board and former Kraft CEO before the Kraft-Heinz merger, will become board chair effective Jan. 1.

Cahill will continue to lead the board’s Separation Committee, which has overseen planning and execution of the breakup since earlier this year. Patricio will remain on the board but step away from the chair role.

The board also said it will launch a global search for a CEO to lead North American Grocery Co., the second business created through the separation.

What the Separation Means for Kraft Heinz

The company expects the separation to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals, tax opinions, and final board approval. The company intends the transaction to be tax-free for shareholders.

Management said the move will reduce operational complexity and allow each company to allocate capital and resources more precisely. Global Taste Elevation Co. will focus on faster-growing and international brands, while North American Grocery Co. will concentrate on core U.S. and Canadian grocery staples.

With Kraft Heinz CEO Steve Cahillane taking charge, the company signals continuity in strategy rather than disruption. His track record suggests a focus on disciplined execution, brand investment, and portfolio clarity.

While investor sentiment has soured on American recently, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have had their shares climbing. In short, American posted a loss, while Delta and United delivered solid profits.

While United is introducing new routes for 2026, Delta is adopting customer-centric policies, becoming the only U.S. carrier to enforce a popular AI-related ban on flight attendants. American Airlines had to act fast.

By leaning heavily into luxury cabins, elevated lounges, and a more polished onboard experience, American Airlines is betting that passengers will open their wallets for comfort, and the premium edge will bring it back into the race.

American Airlines Aims To Beat United And Delta Air Lines After Years Of Losing Passengers' Favor

Executives are calling it a ""customer reimagination"""", a clean break from years of cost-cutting and volume focus. American Airlines is betting on premium products and loyalty perks, such as long-haul privacy suites, upgraded regional cabins, and enhanced credit card benefits.

""We think investing in customer experience will help us grow the top line,"" said Nat Piper, American Airlines' newly appointed Chief Commercial Officer, in an interview with Reuters.

American's premium push hinges on the Boeing 787-9 and the Airbus A321XLR, using the new jets to launch fresh routes and tap higher-yield, premium-focused demand.

Chief Strategy Officer Steve Johnson described the overhaul as the airline’s most sweeping in decades, forecasting a meaningful revenue uplift beginning in 2026.

""As these changes that we're making are introduced and have some time to gel, you're going to see them deliver value to us,"" Johnson told Reuters.

The Boeing 787-9, outfitted with 51 lie-flat seats and privacy doors, has become American Airlines' most profitable widebody, now deployed on highly competitive transatlantic routes like Chicago–London. In this market, United Airlines has traditionally been strong.

On Thursday, American Airlines will introduce the Airbus A321XLR on the New York–Los Angeles route, one of the country’s fiercest battlegrounds and a corridor where Delta Air Lines maintains a strong foothold. Later, it will be deployed on secondary transatlantic routes such as Edinburgh, using its fuel efficiency to profitably serve thinner markets.

American Airlines Premium Features on its Boeing and Airbus ​​Aircraft

With expanded seating, new lie-flat suites, and Premium Economy on its Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321XLR jets, American Airlines is doubling down on premium travel.

The carrier aims to attract high-yield passengers with enhanced experiences, including upgraded dining, Wi-Fi, and lounge access, while competing head-to-head with Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.

Challenges That American Airlines Will Face In The New Strategy

American Airlines CEO Robert Isom blames higher costs from new labor agreements and overexposure to a sluggish U.S. domestic market for American's underperformance.

Supply-chain issues have also delayed deliveries, including the Airbus A321XLR, and slowed upgrades of older Boeing 777 jets due to shortages of cabin components.

Operational reliability remains a weak spot: American Airlines still trails Delta Air Lines and United Airlines in on-time performance and ranks near the bottom in the latest J.D. Power satisfaction survey.

Beyond the operational challenges, investors have turned bearish, sending American's stock price down this year, while Delta and United shares have risen.

American Airlines Stock Price — 6% down

Delta Air Lines Stock Price — 20% up

United Airlines Stock Price — 18% up

CEO Robert Isom acknowledged the challenge ahead, saying American must deliver for its employees, customers and shareholders, according to an audio recording reviewed by Reuters.

It's Tricking You Into Spending More. | The New Republic,"Monica Potts, Rachel Kahn, Ellie Quinlan Houghtaling, SOLIDARITY? Timothy Noah, First Person Viva Hammer",,,,,https://newrepublic.com/article/204525/artificial-intelligence-consumers-data-dynamic-pricing,"Turns out, AI is also spying on your shopping habits and using that information not only to sell you more things, but at a higher price.
This has all been illustrated by a string of reports on how companies are using AI to target consumers.
But sometimes companies are deploying AI to actually trick you into paying even more for things.
It’s hard to set a shopping budget if you can’t be sure what your grocery staples will cost on any given week.
They’re also weary of the second-order effects of building up AI, like the toll of data centers on their communities.","As if it’s not bad enough that artificial intelligence is coming for your job—or at least making it worse—and the data centers fueling it are raising your utility bills and destroying your environment. Turns out, AI is also spying on your shopping habits and using that information not only to sell you more things, but at a higher price.

This has all been illustrated by a string of reports on how companies are using AI to target consumers. The reports make clear that while Big Tech has pushed AI on Americans as a tool to make their lives easier, the technology may in fact be making their lives even harder. This is what happens when any large, concentrated industry is allowed to grow unregulated, and all signs suggest it will get much worse.

In October, the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator published research showing that companies use loyalty programs to hook consumers, creating a captive audience they can track. Because consumers opt into these programs in the hopes of discounts and rewards, the programs are exempt from many state and federal laws about surveillance. And some companies eagerly abuse that legal opening.

Of course, loyalty programs pre-date AI, not to mention the internet itself. But gone are the punch cards of yore. The Vanderbilt report’s lead example is the McDonald’s Monopoly game promotion, which has been around for decades but has now gone digital. Let’s say you win a food item on a peel-off token; to redeem it, you have to use the restaurant’s app, and that requires forfeiting one’s privacy:

To be eligible for these prizes, customers must agree to be tracked on far more than their Big Mac purchases. McDonald’s nearly 10,000-word privacy policy notes how the company can monitor customers’ precise geolocation, browsing history, app interactions, and social media activity. The company then uses this data to train its artificial intelligence models and build profiles on its customers—predicting their “preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, or aptitudes.” McDonald’s leverages these psychological profiles to drive repeat customer engagement over time.

If McDonald’s succeeds in its goal of reaching 250 active loyalty users by 2027, the report adds, the company “will hold psychological and behavioral profiles on a quarter of a billion consumers—a scale rivaling that of a national intelligence agency.”

The central goal here, at least as far as we know, is to drive more McDonald’s sales—both on an individual level and across its entire customer base—by harvesting data. That’s bad enough. But sometimes companies are deploying AI to actually trick you into paying even more for things.

Groundwork Collaborative, Consumer Reports, and More Perfect Union collaborated on an investigation released this month showing that Instacart, the grocery shopping and delivery app, used AI-enabled data collection to manipulate and change prices. The investigators sent 437 shoppers out in four cities and placed items in their Instacart shopping carts at the same time. The results showed that almost three-quarters of the items had prices that varied, and prices for the same items could vary as much as 23 percent. These variations are often invisible to consumers.

Dynamic pricing has long been used by airlines to shift prices as demand changes, and it’s been adapted to consumer goods at online retailers, like Ticketmaster. But AI has turbocharged the practice, making it easier to target price changes to specific customers based on geolocation and IP data, in an attempt to maximize the amount a customer will pay. Customers are largely ignorant of this fact—because companies are loath to disclose it prominently—and in some cases may not have much choice. Many families use apps like Instacart for the convenience; they may not have the time or ability to physically shop in a store themselves. But now we know what they’re paying for this convenience: The Instacart report estimates that the hidden pricing differences could amount to as much as $1,200 a year for some customers.

It’s hard to set a shopping budget if you can’t be sure what your grocery staples will cost on any given week. In other words—trigger alert, President Trump!—it’s an affordability issue. Representative Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat, has introduced legislation to regulate how companies can use AI to set prices and wages, but it’s unlikely to go anywhere in this Republican-led government. In fact, Trump issued an executive order this month promising to investigate and withhold federal funds from states that pass “cumbersome” AI regulations.

Some states have promised to push for new regulations regardless. That’s what Americans want: Half of Americans are more concerned than excited about AI, and 61 percent want more control over how it is used in their lives. They’re also weary of the second-order effects of building up AI, like the toll of data centers on their communities.

But reform-minded politicians are playing catchup while the AI bubble continues to balloon, enriching a handful of companies that are propping up an otherwise ho-hum stock market. Meanwhile, Americans who want to be treated fairly as consumers find themselves getting a bad deal. They can’t shop for Cheerios or a plane ticket for the holidays without wondering just how severely they’re being screwed by AI-trained algorithms. A reckoning is coming. The bubble will probably burst, and Americans’ retirement savings will plummet. But whom will they blame for the damage? The wise policies of the future depend on naming the right villains today.",https://images.newrepublic.com/3470d1f1f85bb0c685f0f4ae7b90bc6cf0597e9a.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-12-17 13:03:32.654805

In this way, STELAH moves toward its goal: making green hydrogen a more sustainable and competitive alternative. The consortium aims to accelerate the market arrival of highly efficient, scalable electrolyzers, essential to reducing costs and contributing to the decarbonization of industries and long-distance transport.

The joint work focuses on developing and validating high-performance electrodes—both anodes and cathodes—along with optimized stacks capable of delivering superior performance compared to currently available alkaline electrolysis technologies.

Milestone Achieved: Higher-Performance, Sustainable, and Scalable Materials

The Matteco team has developed new advanced combinations of catalytic materials for anode and cathode composition, characterized and validated by the University of Valencia.

These new formulations, which avoid the use of scarce and critical materials such as platinum derivatives, exhibit greater electrochemical activity and improved stability—essential factors for continuous electrolysis in industrial operating environments. In addition, they have been scaled to the size planned for this phase of the project.

Meanwhile, the teams from Técnicas Reunidas and AIJU have evaluated the electrodes with different substrates in a precursor stack setup. The results have been satisfactory: they confirm the feasibility of the new material combinations under representative operating conditions and their scaling potential.

These results pave the way for the next milestone: integrating the optimized materials into cell prototypes and modular stacks at the final planned size.

By dialing up the intensity level within the company, OpenAI is following a playbook occasionally used by Silicon Valley tech companies during times of heightened competitive threats.
Google declared its own code red after OpenAI’s ChatGPT came on the scene a few years ago.
By December of 2023, Google, armed with a newly-christened Gemini large language model, was matching OpenAI’s ChatGPT on a series of benchmarks.
The next code red OpenAI’s past code reds have been called to deal with threats ranging from China’s DeepSeek to Anthropic’s Claude.","Fast-forward just one year to this December when employees got a decidedly different holiday present: a five-alarm “code red” laid out in a memo from CEO Sam Altman, bracing the team for “rough vibes” and economic headwinds in the wake of increased competition, and trying to light a fire under them to refocus over the coming weeks.

As part of the missive, Altman announced a temporary postponement of many of the initiatives that had promised to get OpenAI closer to its stated financial goal of breaking even by 2030. That includes delaying several major revenue generators that the company was counting on: advertising, an expanded e-commerce offering, and (to a lesser extent) agentic systems.

The company is not in a life-threatening crisis. ChatGPT topped Apple’s App Store charts as the most downloaded free app in the U.S. in 2025, and just last week, OpenAI announced a groundbreaking partnership with Walt Disney Co. that will bring the media company’s characters to OpenAI products (along with a $1 billion investment). But the code red alert reveals a real concern within OpenAI that the $500 billion company could lose its position as the standard-bearer and pacesetter for generative AI technology.

The data backs that up. While ChatGPT still holds a big lead with more than 800 million weekly users, Google’s Gemini is gaining fast: In its Q3 earnings, Google’s parent company Alphabet announced that its Gemini app now has 650 million monthly active users, up from 450 million in July. Preliminary November data from SimilarWeb reveals Google Gemini generated 1.351 billion website visits—a 14.3% increase from October. Meanwhile, ChatGPT fell below the 6 billion benchmark it had touched in October, recording 5.844 billion visits and marking its second month-over-month decline in 2025.

In the lucrative market for enterprise customers, OpenAI appears to have lost significant market share, falling to 27% according to one recent report by Menlo Ventures, while Gemini has risen to 21% and rival startup Anthropic leads at 40%. (OpenAI disputes the figures from Menlo, noting that the venture capital firm is an investor in Anthropic; it notes that more than 1 million business customers now use OpenAI tools, with sharp upticks in usage metrics over the past year. The company also just released a survey of its enterprise users that showed enterprise usage of OpenAI’s models more than doubling over the past year in many countries outside the U.S.)

As one former OpenAI researcher told Fortune, the situation is serious. “It’s pretty remarkable that Sam is so open about it…this is one of those few moments where he’s very transparent about the threat that OpenAI is receiving from Google.” As this person sees it, “If Google overtakes OpenAI in raw performance, it’s basically going to kill OpenAI’s API business…There’s a chance Google is going to give out Gemini for free entirely, too. And that could kill the consumer subscription business for OpenAI as well.”

The internal call to arms lays bare the very precarious position this market leader is now in, particularly as it confronts industry titans like Google (as well as Microsoft and Meta), with tens of billions of dollars in cash on their balance sheets and massive ecosystems of products to boost their distribution.

For Altman, a longtime tech entrepreneur, the historic matchups of Silicon Valley’s past, pitting innovators and incumbents in winner-takes-all battles, are surely contributing to the sense of urgency: The annihilation of browser pioneer Netscape by Microsoft or the eclipse of BlackBerry’s handheld communications gadgets by Apple’s iPhone comes to mind. But there’s also the example set by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose famous “lockdowns” over a decade ago helped repel the threat of Google’s nascent—and ultimately doomed—social networking product.

The decisions made by OpenAI and its competitors at this critical juncture in a fast-moving market will decide which company cements its hold on what some have called the most transformative technology since electricity, and which will end up as odd footnotes in the final writing of the history of AI.

Demis versus Sam

Altman views new competitive threats like a “pandemic” that must be fought immediately and forcefully before any competitor gets too much traction, according to someone recently briefed on OpenAI’s thinking. “You just don’t let any competitor get oxygen,” Altman has said.

OpenAI unleashed the first element of its counterattack in mid-December, with the release of GPT-5.2, internally code-named Garlic. The model puts OpenAI back on top of many closely watched benchmarks for AI performance. Then on December 16, OpenAI launched a new image generation model designed to show it can match the buzz created by Google’s Nano Banana.

But even the company acknowledges that these are merely initial moves in what needs to be a much broader effort to regain momentum. The code red will last eight weeks—a time frame the company says is longer than its previous such exercises because of the holidays. The plan is to “exit” the code red in late January with the release of a second big product update. During this time some of its recent initiatives will be put on the back burner so that OpenAI can concentrate on shoring up its core ChatGPT product and the AI models that underpin it.

“The code red is to really signal to the company that we want to marshal resources in one particular area, and that’s a way to really define priorities and define things that can be deprioritized,” OpenAI’s CEO of applications Fidji Simo said on a call with reporters last week to announce GPT-5.2. Simo said that GPT-5.2 had been in the works for months and that the timing of its release last week was not directly related to the code red, but she said the launch was helped by the additional resources and focus of the alert.

One OpenAI employee who works on ChatGPT and its coding products describes the mood inside the company as focused but not panicked. “We were starting to get distracted before with all the other things we had going on, and this is going to get the whole company to focus a bit more on the core product. For us working on ChatGPT, it’s good.” And while OpenAI employees recognize that Gemini 3 is a good model, the person said they were not worried about a sudden mass defection of developers from OpenAI to Google.

By dialing up the intensity level within the company, OpenAI is following a playbook occasionally used by Silicon Valley tech companies during times of heightened competitive threats. Facebook’s lockdowns were an extreme example, with employees putting their personal lives on hold to buckle in for marathon work sessions accompanied by posters with printed Roman battle cries and the glare of a large neon “lockdown” sign.

Google declared its own code red after OpenAI’s ChatGPT came on the scene a few years ago. Since then, Google has reoriented the company to win the AI wars. Sergey Brin, Google’s billionaire cofounder who stepped back from day-to-day involvement in 2019, is back full-time, pitching in on some of the technical work and exhorting staffers to push themselves harder and to work longer hours, according to media reports.

And Demis Hassabis, the now Nobel Laureate (for his work on AI science breakthrough AlphaFold) and former child chess prodigy, is at the center of Google’s efforts. He’s been at Google since 2014 when he sold his startup to the tech giant; in 2023 he was put in charge of Google’s merged AI divisions: DeepMind and Google Brain. With a team of thousands under his command, Hassabis has redoubled the company’s efforts on large language models, OpenAI’s stronghold. By December of 2023, Google, armed with a newly-christened Gemini large language model, was matching OpenAI’s ChatGPT on a series of benchmarks. But when that model was fully released to the public in early 2024, its strong performance on many tasks was eclipsed by an embarrassing debacle over its image-generation capabilities. (In an effort to try to make the model less likely to produce toxic images, it actually made the model politically correct to the point of ridiculousness, depicting black Vikings and Nazis for instance). That misstep, along with the “glue as a good pizza topping” advice that Gemini gave later that spring, made a lot of people question whether Google really had gotten its mojo back. But in the past year, it has shown it can produce models that are as capable, if not more capable, than those created by OpenAI.

As one tech entrepreneur mused to Fortune about Google and OpenAI, “Look, in some ways this is Demis vs. Sam [Altman], and if we’re honest, who do you believe in more here? Sam may be ruthless but long term is he really a match for Demis?”

Gemini rising

When Allie K. Miller, an AI advisor and investor, recently attended a Shark Tank–type event hosted by Mark Cuban, she was struck by what happened when Cuban said the words “Nano Banana.” She expected that the mention of Google’s whimsically named AI image generator might cause confusion among the thousands of people in the audience, who Miller described as mostly new to AI. Instead, the crowd nodded in recognition.

Like ChatGPT itself, she explained, “there are certain AI tools or models that you just start hearing over and over and over again that gain such a big pop culture moment.”

Google initially released Nano Banana in August, but it was the new Nano Banana Pro, which came out in late November, that has turned heads within the tech world and the general public. Hyper-realistic AI images of famous actors in movie scenes that never existed and tons of AI-generated memes filled social media feeds, eliciting expressions of wonder—the kind of adoration OpenAI had become accustomed to basking in. Nano Banana Pro was especially proficient at generating images with readable and context-appropriate text in the image, something that previous image generators couldn’t do reliably. This made the model good for creating PowerPoint slides and info graphics.

What may have truly spooked Altman, however, was the performance of Gemini 3, the newest version of Google’s flagship AI model (and the model powering Nano Banana Pro). From the impressive answers it delivers to complex business questions, to its writing and coding capabilities, Gemini 3 very quickly earned plaudits from influential AI users and the general public.

Google said that it achieved Gemini 3’s performance gains from both pre-training (the initial process of building an AI model in which it is fed tremendous amounts of data and simply taught to predict the next word in a sequence) as well as through post-training, in which a model’s outputs are shaped through different learning processes to exhibit certain qualities, such as being helpful and friendly. This surprised many AI industry insiders, since the conventional wisdom had been that any advantages from pre-training had largely been exhausted.

Worse for Altman, there were also rumors that many of OpenAI’s large pre-training runs in 2025 have failed to produce models that were any better than prior ones. If this is the case, it could be one of the major causes of anxiety within OpenAI because it implies that there’s some formula for success and model improvement that the company is not currently able to replicate. (When OpenAI released its newest GPT-5.2 model this past week, it said little about how it trained the AI. But it did say that it had found ways to optimize “all phases of training.”)

Because the performance of its models has long offered one of its primary defensive moats, OpenAI can’t afford to fall behind the competition for long. And as Altman and company endeavor to add features that match its rivals’ other strengths, the company needs a best-in-class AI model as its foundation.

That’s especially true when it comes to its battle with Google, which has nine products each boasting more than 1 billion users, including Gmail, Chrome, and YouTube.

“People are shifting over to Gemini not just because it’s got a better model, but they’re realizing that this capability is baked into everything,” says Ajay Agrawal, a researcher on the economics of AI. Just matching Gemini now won’t cut it—OpenAI will have to be measurably better, or bake what they’re doing into some workflows just to keep up. Says Agrawal, “It’s hard to imagine now that they’ll be able to just keep going with just a language model as a general tool.”

In the enterprise market, OpenAI needs to stop Anthropic’s gains in the sector and convince more businesses that ChatGPT is the best choice to meet their specialized security and privacy needs.

Enterprise customers are critical to OpenAI’s future, says Futurum Research CEO Daniel Newman, because the most substantial revenue opportunity is not in users paying for individual subscriptions for ChatGPT but in businesses applying AI to their vast pools of internal data and “consuming trillions of tokens daily.” It’s the “great unlock” that will allow OpenAI to finance its huge computing costs.

The importance of enterprise to OpenAI was underscored last week when COO Brad Lightcap spoke at a Fortune event. “I wake up every day and think about enterprise,” said Lightcap. “We have not yet really captured that moment of enterprise AI penetration,” he said, referring to the broader AI industry.

The company’s latest survey of its enterprise users shows that its existing customers are rapidly scaling up, with usage of OpenAI’s models among technology companies growing 11x year-over-year, while the figures for the healthcare sector are 8x and for manufacturing 7x, respectively. But the report does not break down either total customer numbers or the monetary value of these accounts.

The next code red

OpenAI’s past code reds have been called to deal with threats ranging from China’s DeepSeek to Anthropic’s Claude. But with 3,200 employees, the company is now larger than ever, and the former nonprofit’s mission has evolved, driven by the increasing pressures of building a sustainable business. And the extent of Altman’s ambitions means there will be more code reds ahead.

Looking beyond the next eight weeks, OpenAI is on a collision course with another consumer giant: Apple.

Altman has made no secret about how important he believes new types of hardware devices will be in the way that people use AI, and he has set an ambitious goal of creating an OpenAI gadget that replaces the smartphone as the standard gadget people carry around. In May he hired former Apple design guru Jony Ive and acquired Ive’s startup, with the goal of producing this new generation of AI gadgets. Speculation about those new devices ranges from glasses to a wearable pendant-like gadget.

While Altman has expressed mixed opinions about glasses as a form factor, he has spoken about innovations in 3D technology that, while still years away from being commercially viable, could eventually make glasses an ideal AI gadget. In the near term, Altman is optimistic about screen-based devices and audio interfaces, according to the source briefed on his thinking.

“We are all living in the constraints of this same kind of computer that we have been using for a long time, and that feels totally wrong and limiting,” Altman said at a conference in November, alongside Ive. “We don’t know how to figure out the right answer, but we think the world deserves better stuff.”

The first version of OpenAI’s hardware devices will be available in less than two years, Ive said at the event. For its part, Apple—like Google—is certain to ramp up its own efforts after being initially caught flat-footed by OpenAI.

As this battle rages, it will also be fought with perception: Which company do consumers trust? Which one do you want to own your data and get to “know” you? There, it’s not yet clear that there is a winner. But perception is a funny thing—and can change quickly. Just a few years back, Google was widely perceived to be a tech behemoth with too much power. Then OpenAI came along. As one Twitter user wryly noted of Altman’s AI company: “They somehow made Google look like the underdog good guys that everyone cheers for.”

The financing supports a diverse portfolio of 45 wind and solar projects located across Germany and France.
CEE RF9 will repower at least 29 projects with state-of-the-art wind turbines and photovoltaic modules.
The cashflows generated by operating assets serve as a substitute for equity and set new standards for institutional renewable energy investments.
CEE RF9 was launched at the turn of 2024/2025 as the latest generation of the successful ""CEE Renewables Fund/RF"" product series.","Global law firm White & Case LLP has advised a consortium of leading international lenders, including CIBC, ING Bank, KfW IPEX-Bank, SMBC, SEB and UniCredit, on the complex financing structure of up to €1.6 billion for CEE RF9, Germany's largest repowering fund.

The financing structure for CEE RF9 is unique for alternative investment funds which belongs to CEE Group, an asset manager specialized in renewable energies and part of the Canadian Brookfield Asset Management Group. The financing supports a diverse portfolio of 45 wind and solar projects located across Germany and France. In addition to providing lending capacity, ING acted as Original Issuing Bank, while UniCredit served as Facility and Security Agent, Hedge Coordinator and Account Bank.

CEE RF9 will repower at least 29 projects with state-of-the-art wind turbines and photovoltaic modules. As a result, the installed capacity of the overall portfolio will increase from the current 457 MW(p) to approximately 1.1 GW(p), which corresponds to an expansion of more than 140%.

This transaction marks a milestone in the German renewables market, as it enables the consolidation of investment fund financing at the portfolio level for the first time and does not require additional equity from existing investors. The cashflows generated by operating assets serve as a substitute for equity and set new standards for institutional renewable energy investments.

""This landmark transaction demonstrates the continued appetite of international lenders to support innovative renewable energy solutions in Europe, having advised on this unique portfolio financing structure to accelerate the expansion and repowering strategy of renewable energy projects will make a significant contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy sector and the achievement of climate goals"" said White & Case partner Florian Degenhardt who led the Firm's deal team.

CEE RF9 was launched at the turn of 2024/2025 as the latest generation of the successful ""CEE Renewables Fund/RF"" product series. The fund transferred existing portfolios consisting of 45 European PV and onshore wind assets from previous CEE RF funds to the new platform, with the aim of extensive repowering by 2030.

The White & Case team which advised on the transaction was led by partner Florian Degenhardt and included local partners Matthias Grigoleit and Roland Arlt, counsel Beate Treibmann and associates Martin Riederer, Dana Masberg, Robert Bente and Sarah Bischoff and transaction lawyer Ioana Marinescu (all Hamburg), with support from partner Guilhem Becvort, local partner Ruslana Hrischeva, associates Sophia Fotso and Ignacio Martinez (all Luxembourg) and Maxim Arrazola de Onate (Brussels & Luxembourg), partner Amaury de Feydeau and associates Tsveta Pencheva and Sarah Pupin (all Paris), and partner Anthony Colegrave and associate Celine Ng (both London).",https://www.whitecase.com/sites/default/files/images/hero/2022/08/Public_Relations_option_22.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 14:04:10.265328

Listen HERE.

The album features original artwork by Shepard Fairey, with 100% of net proceeds benefiting Los Angeles wildfire recovery and housing relief initiatives. It is available nationally at Urban Outfitters on unique orange translucent vinyl.

“Home is where the heart is. Our home is LA, and our hearts were shattered by the devastation of this year’s horrific fires in Altadena, Malibu, and Pacific Palisades,” said the FLOOD editorial team. “So many of our friends, neighbors, and comrades in the music and arts communities were impacted, and are still working toward a path to recovery. This record is both a tribute and a tangible contribution to those rebuilding their lives.”

Highlights include Elliott Smith’s alternate version of “Angeles,” Norah Jones’ achingly beautiful rendition of “God Only Knows,” ”Rilo Kiley’s ode to LA “Let Me Back In,” a “freestyle remix” of “Cadavre Exquis” from Chino Moreno of Deftones’ ††† (Crosses) project, Local Natives performing “Lemon” in singer Taylor Rice’s backyard overlooking Altadena, and The Flaming Lips’ psychedelic take on “Good Vibrations.”

Several contributors were personally affected by the fires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of Dawes lost their homes and studio in Altadena, while Poolside’s Jeffrey Paradise lost his home in Pacific Palisades. Dawes’ “Time Spent in Los Angeles (for Altadena)”—recorded with Andrew Bird and Alan Hampton—and Poolside’s “Pull Together” with Satin Jackets both appear on the LP.

Jeffrey Paradise from Pooliside revealed, ""The fire has been one of the hardest times for me. But the support from the community and friends has been one of the best things that’s ever happened to me. It’s an interesting dichotomy. Hard to think that we’re somehow almost a full year on and still picking up the pieces, though. That doesn’t get talked about as much. It’s why this LP is so important one year on. It underscores that the recovery effort is still going and will keep going.”

Taylor Griffin from Dawes stated, ""It’s my belief that music can be healing. Even physically. The right song or the right collection can help pain be contextualized or processed or even moved on from. I love being a part of a release like this that makes healing its primary objective. Not to mention, to help raise a little money for those who need it. ""

Nik Ewing from Local Natives said, “Like many in our community, we performed benefit concerts right after the LA fires. Watching our friends in Dawes at one of those concerts, who just lost everything, perform a stripped-down version of ""Time Spent in Los Angeles"" transform into a melancholic, but hopeful anthem, brought a tear to everyone's eye while also saying ""we got this.""

We performed this version of “Lemon” overlooking Altadena before the fires. We are proud to be among LA legends and others contributing to this beautiful compilation, aiding in the long, long road to recovery and rebuilding from the widespread devastation.

The album culminates with a soul-stirring rendition of Talking Heads’ “Burning Down the House” by Quazar and the Bamboozled, led by Altadena Musicians co-founder Brandon Jay along with support from Rilo Kiley’s Pierre de Reeder, featuring dozens of musicians personally impacted by the fires—transforming the song’s literal “fighting fire with fire” lyrics into an anthem of resilience and renewal.

“I was so glad to be able to contribute to this,” Rilo Kiley’s de Reeder said. “Being able to help Brandon out and host so many fire-affected folks, bringing their talents together for a very cathartic recording of ‘Burning Down The House,’ was very special. Also happy that we were able to contribute a Rilo Kiley track as well.”

All proceeds benefit the Gimme Shelter Collective, FLOOD’s nonprofit initiative supporting artists and communities affected by the wildfires, in partnership with Altadena Musicians, Instrumental Giving, and the California Community Foundation Wildfire Recovery Fund.

Production is supported by Levi Strauss & Co. Each LP is pressed as a sustainable EcoSonic recyclable record and will be available in multiple exclusive color configurations through Urban Outfitters, Amoeba Music, indie retailers,Barnes & Noble, and FLOOD Magazine

With 252 pages in a 12"" x 12"" format, FLOOD’s 10th anniversary edition is the largest issue the team has ever produced, packed with dozens of incredible artists representing the past, present, and future of FLOOD’s editorial spectrum, while also looking back at key moments and events in the magazine’s history.

While they commemorate a decade of FLOOD, they are also celebrating 25 years of Gorillaz with a career-spanning cover interview with Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett on their visionary project, along with insights from De La Soul and Little Dragon, and 16 pages of images from Gorillaz’ vaults.

On the flip side of this issue’s Gorillaz cover is another act building their own magical universe: Miami-raised, LA-based duo Magdalena Bay. This marks the first of what will undoubtedly be many more magazine covers to come for them.

Throughout these pages, you’ll find reflections on FLOOD’s first 10 years: a decade of dynamic live photographs, their #1 albums from each year, and visual highlights from FLOODfest events, while they also turned the tables and asked 26 artists (including My Morning Jacket, Spoon, Lucy Dacus, Phantogram, Amyl and the Sniffers, Hot Chip, Blondshell, and many more) to write about the albums that moved them most during the FLOOD era so far.

You’ll also find extensive interviews with Mac DeMarco, Lord Huron, Wolf Alice, Automatic, Bootsy Collins, and many more. Plus, Fred Armisen details his Perfect Day in LA, The Zombies’ Colin Blunstone breaks down each track on their classic Odessey and Oracle album, and Nation of Language details their favorite films of the past decade.

The issue also includes dozens of pages showcasing amazing artwork and photography, with features on the evocative photo work of actor Norman Reedus, legendary visual artist Cey Adams, the iconic punk and new wave photography of Michael Grecco, and the story behind Smithsonian artists Rigoberto A. González and Felipe Galindo being targeted by the Trump administration.

Toronto, Dec. 17, 2025 /CNW/ - The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) has announced an initiative to explore policy measures for expanding access to online investment advice, including hybrid and automated models, with the goal of improving access to advice for more investors.

""Our policy framework was designed for traditional advisory services, and we hope the review will identify any regulatory barriers in CIRO's current policy,"" said Alexandra Williams, Senior Vice-President, Strategy, Innovation, and Stakeholder Protection. ""This review will help identify whether any aspects of our current framework may be creating barriers, particularly for Canadians seeking affordable tailored online advice.""

Currently, there is no dedicated regulatory framework for CIRO-regulated members using online or hybrid advisory models. Instead, members rely on exemptive relief and special terms and conditions. Through this process, CIRO will consider whether further policy development is required and will seek input on:

Assessing rules and guidance in the digital context;

Identifying areas where regulatory requirements could be met through technology-augmented means; and

Examining any unintended consequences arising from current frameworks.

Any policy developed would be part of CIRO's ""Access to Advice"" strategic pillar and would build on the work being done on non-tailored advice for ""Do-it-yourself"" investors, supporting access to trustworthy information that helps them make more informed decisions.

About CIRO:

The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) is the pan-Canadian self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers, mutual fund dealers and trading activity on Canada's debt and equity marketplaces. CIRO is committed to the protection of investors, providing efficient and consistent regulation, and building Canadians' trust in financial regulation and the people.

Software companies NVIDIA and Palantir have joined CenterPoint in forming Chain Reaction, which is aimed at speeding up AI buildouts for energy producers and distributors, data centers and infrastructure builders. Among the initiative’s goals are to stabilize and expand the power grid to meet growing demand from data centers, and to design and develop large data centers that can support AI activity.

“The energy infrastructure buildout is the industrial challenge of our generation,” Tristan Gruska, Palantir’s head of energy and infrastructure, says in a news release. “But the software that the sector relies on was not built for this moment. We have spent years quietly deploying systems that keep power plants running and grids reliable. Chain Reaction is the result of building from the ground up for the demands of AI.”

CenterPoint serves about 7 million customers in Texas, Indiana, Minnesota and Ohio. After Hurricane Beryl struck Houston in July 2024, CenterPoint committed to building a resilient power grid for the region and chose Palantir as its “software backbone.”

“Never before have technology and energy been so intertwined in determining the future course of American innovation, commercial growth, and economic security,” Jason Wells, chairman, president and CEO of CenterPoint, added in the release.

In November, the utility company got the go-ahead from the Public Utility Commission of Texas for a $2.9 billion upgrade of its Houston-area power grid. CenterPoint serves 2.9 million customers in a 12-county territory anchored by Houston.

A month earlier, CenterPoint launched a $65 billion, 10-year capital improvement plan to support rising demand for power across all of its service territories.

Reuters, citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter, reports that the funding deal is not yet finalized and discussions remain fluid, but that it would value OpenAI at about $500 billion.

OpenAI completed a restructuring in October that was designed to give it more freedom to pursue deals like this to raise capital. Against a backdrop of growing fears that valuations in the AI sector are overheating, OpenAI has forged ahead with a series of deals since then, including a $1 billion injection from Disney along with a licensing agreement allowing the use of its characters on OpenAI’s video app Sora.

The Amazon deal would also reportedly see OpenAI granted the ability to use Amazon's Trainium chip, which would mark a major win for the tech giant's semiconductor business. Nvidia still dominates the AI chip market, but companies such as Meta and Amazon are gaining traction with rival offerings.

It would be the second major agreement between the two companies in recent months. In November, OpenAI agreed to buy $38 billion worth of capacity from Amazon Web Services, which chief executive Sam Altman said would help it expand towards the “massive, reliable compute” needed to scale the company.

OpenAI has made more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure commitments in the last few months, including with chipmakers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. The scale and circular nature of those deals has heightened fears that the AI industry could be operating in an investment bubble.

Those concerns were renewed last week when Oracle's stock fell by as much as 16% following the release of its earnings report, which showed its AI spending far outpacing returns. It shaved as much as $70 billion off the company's valuation.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2244440792.jpg",N,,2025-12-17 11:05:59.877974

Medline manufactures and distributes branded and non-proprietary medical products, such as surgical kits, gloves, protective apparel, and advanced wound care items. The company, which is backed by private equity firms Blackstone (BX), Carlyle (CG), and Hellman & Friedman, anticipated $5.4 billion from the IPO but raised more.

Medline Uses ‘Greenshoe’ to Top IPO Raise

The boost in Medline’s IPO outing was aided by strong investor demand and the issuance of an additional $900 million in shares. This was made possible thanks to the “greenshoe” overallotment option that allowed extra shares to be sold on top of the offering’s base size.

Medline’s performance exceeds Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology’s (CTATF) public debut raise of $5.3 billion in May. It also beats several other closely watched IPOs seen this year, including design software platform Figma’s (FIG) $2.4 billion, crypto exchange Bullish’s (BLSH) $2.1 billion, and buy now, pay later provider Klarna’s (KLAR) $1.9 billion IPO raises.

Medline Overcomes Investors’ Tariff Concerns

The aforementioned private equity firms acquired Medline in 2021 in a $34 billion deal, putting forward a collective $17 billion equity investment. The medical supply and logistics company initially planned to go public during the second quarter of this year, aiming to raise about $5 billion.

However, the firm halted the move as President Donald Trump’s tariff regime rendered financial markets volatile. Yet, Medline’s chart-topping rise suggests that investors see the medical supply company as less exposed to policy changes compared to other firms in the healthcare sector.

This is even as companies such as Figma suffered price crashes following their public debut earlier in the year.

In the first seven months of 2025, stablecoin transaction volumes surpassed $4 trillion, up 83% year-on-year, and now sit alongside traditional networks in terms of scale. Regulators are moving in parallel: the SEC has opened the door to multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, and major custodians such as BNY Mellon, State Street, and DBS are broadening their digital-asset operations.

Yet this market infrastructure's maturity process comes with caveats. Banks, EMIs and payment institutions continue to face rising client demand for digital-asset payments, while few are prepared to build and maintain these systems in-house.

Against this backdrop, B2BINPAY now introduces an expanded White Label Solution that shortens time to market and enables operators to add crypto payments and wallet functionality without long development cycles.

A Shift From Long-Term Development to Ready-Made Deployment

Instead of assembling blockchain teams, managing node operations, onboarding KYT providers, or coordinating multiple chain integrations, institutions can now launch a branded crypto payments and wallet stack based on B2BINPAY's existing infrastructure.

The platform draws on the same operational base that serves over 980 merchants, processes more than $5.1 billion in incoming transactions, and supports 350+ digital assets across 10 blockchains.

Where Institutions Capture Value

The White Label Solution functions both as a technical layer and a business enabler. Institutions can generate revenue through:

Tiered fees on deposits and withdrawals;

Configurable mark-ups on swaps and conversions;

Hedging and risk-management tools that support internal spread capture.

This setup allows banks, EMIs and PSPs to retain ownership of the client relationship and economics while relying on an established provider for the underlying operations.

About B2BINPAY

B2BINPAY is the leading global all-in-one crypto ecosystem for business, offering secure, efficient, and scalable services to integrate cryptocurrency payments seamlessly into operations. The company is headquartered in Rome, Italy. It has 980+ merchants, and it has processed more than $5.1 billion of incoming transactions. The platform supports 10 blockchains for USDT and USDC and more than 350 coins. It follows KYC and KYT principles.

Trump's threat specifies ""all sanctioned oil tankers going into, and out of, Venezuela.""
US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the tanker had been transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.
US oil giant Chevron, for example, was given special licences by the Biden administration in 2022 to resume Venezuelan oil exports.
There are already expectations that the global oil market will face oversupply next year.","Donald Trump's announcement of a ""total and complete blockade"" of sanctioned oil tankers travelling to and from Venezuela has raised questions about the economic consequences for the regime of leftist president Nicolas Maduro.

Trump has made oil a central target in his ongoing campaign against Maduro, which was sparked by the US president's claims that Maduro was to blame for the illegal flow of both migrants and drugs to the US from Venezuela.

The fragile Venezuelan economy is exceptionally dependent on oil. If Trump's blockade threat turns out to be more than just words, it would have significant implications for Caracas.

What exactly has Trump threatened?

In a Truth Social post on Tuesday (Dec. 16), Trump said Venezuela ""is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America"" before saying he was ordering the blockade.

Since late August, the US has been setting up a major naval build-up across the Caribbean Sea — one of the largest US naval deployments in the region since the so-called Cuban missile crisis in 1962.

Up to a dozen US military vessels have been operating in the Caribbean in recent weeks, including aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.

How a blockade will work

A naval blockade is a military operation where warships encircle a specific coastline with a view to prevent maritime traffic from entering or leaving.

Trump's threat specifies ""all sanctioned oil tankers going into, and out of, Venezuela.""

Last week, US forces seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the tanker had been transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. Caracas decried the seizure as an act of ""international piracy.""

If successfully and fully implemented, the naval blockade threatened by Trump would dramatically reduce the amount of oil coming out of Venezuela. However, it is not yet clear exactly which tankers would be affected or precisely how a blockade would be carried out.

As is often the case with Trump's social media pledges, there are also legal doubts. Elena Chachko, an international law scholar from UC Berkeley Law School in the US, told news agency Reuters that a blockade would raise ""serious questions on both the domestic law front and international law front.""

While Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, is heavily sanctioned and many vessels which pick up oil there are specifically sanctioned, others which transport oil from the country are not. US oil giant Chevron, for example, was given special licences by the Biden administration in 2022 to resume Venezuelan oil exports. The idea at the time was that softening Venezuelan sanctions would ease wider oil market pressures in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

But in October this year, the Trump administration gave Chevron fresh authorization to produce oil in Venezuela argueing the US company was a vital partner for Caracas.

How US sanction already hit

Venezuela is almost completely dependent on oil for state income. Crude oil and related products such as petrochemicals account for more than 90% of Venezuela's export revenues. They keep Maduro's heavily sanctioned and isolated government functioning and in power.

Experts say that if there were more cargo seizures, or if Trump were to follow through on the blockade, much of Venezuela's oil would remain in the country, while that which makes its way out would likely be sold at a steep discount.

There is already evidence that the recent seizure of a Venezuelan tanker by US forces and the threat of further measures is having an impact.

According to data analytics firm S&P Global Commodities Insights, the number of oil tankers travelling to Venezuela has fallen sharply over the past few weeks. The London, UK-based firm said in a report on Tuesday that as of the week starting December 14, there were 17 tankers sailing to or around Venezuelan waters. That's down from 24 vessels a month earlier.

The S&P report also noted that several sanctioned vessels currently ""appear to be turning away"" from Venezuelan waters and the broader Caribbean Sea following the US seizure of the tanker and subsequent sanction announcements.

On December 11, the US sanctioned six shipping companies and six tankers which operated regularly in Venezuela's oil sector, with more sanctions likely in the coming weeks.

Could the Venezuelan economy handle the damage?

Given the level of crisis the Venezuelan economy has endured over the past decade, few can predict what fresh depths it could reach without impacting Maduro's grip on power.

The country's oil output has already been in decline in recent years as a result of sanctions, corruption and economic mismanagement. Venezuela has the world's largest deposit of known oil reserves but has increasingly struggled to maximize revenues from it.

During the rule of Maduro's predecessor, late Hugo Chavez, oil prices and revenues soared but they have fallen dramatically for more than a decade. Whereas Caracas once pulled in more than $100 billion (€85.6 billion) a year from oil, the figure is now closer to $20 billion.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Venezuela's economy endured ""the single largest economic collapse for a non-conflict country in almost half a century,"" in the period since Maduro took office in April 2013.

What about global oil markets?

Although oil prices jumped by more than 1% on Wednesday, most analysts say Trump's blockade threat on Venezuelan output has a limited impact on global markets.

""Overall, export volumes from Venezuela are relatively small in the global supply share. With all eyes on the Russia-Ukraine discussions, the market is still under downside risk,"" one oil trader told Reuters.

Muyu Xu, senior oil analyst at Brussles-based data analytics firm Kpler, told Reuters that while Venezuelan oil production accounts for around 1% of global production, ""most of it is concentrated on a small pool of Chinese buyers, and others in the US and Cuba.""

There are already expectations that the global oil market will face oversupply next year.

Saad Rahim, chief economist of commodity-trading giant, Trafigura, told the Financial Times earlier this month that the oil market will face a ""super glut"" as a burst of new supply collides with weakness in the global economy, and weighing on already falling prices for crude oil in 2026.

The big ones include Palo Alto Networks’ acquisition of CyberArk and IBM’s acquisition of Confluent. There was also the completion of HPE’s acquisition of Juniper Networks. All these acquisitions would eventually lead to the convergence of partner programs. The question now is how will these programs impact partners? While many partners are excited about the opportunities to offer more products and services to customers, some will clearly struggle to cope as well.

New and enhanced partner programs – 2025 saw enhancements to some vendor partner programs as well as the launch of the new ones. The biggest change to partner programs would be VMware Broadcom’s new VMware Cloud Service Provider (VCSP) program that began on Nov. 1 with a slew of changes in store for partners. The other will be the Cisco 360 partner program which goes live in February next year. Google Cloud has also announced plans to launch a new partner program next year that will be more AI-driven to simplify the process for partners. While these new programs have been designed to provide partners with better opportunities and capabilities to reach out to new customers and support existing ones, some partners may still find it difficult to adopt these new programs.

For example, Cisco gave partners more than a year to understand how their new Cisco 360 partner program will work. The vendor also co-designed the program with a lot of feedback from their partners. But even with the workshops and events to share more about the changes to the program, some partners are still finding it harder to adopt the changes.

Rise of value-added distributors and value-added resellers – The days of pure play distributors and resellers are becoming numbered, especially in APAC. Conversations with vendors and partners throughout the year reveal that distributors and resellers are now focused on adding more value to the products they are offering as they realize this would enable them to get more profits. This includes services like consultation which a lot more distributors and resellers are moving into. Advisory and consultancy services are proving to be of greater need especially with organizations wanting to have the best plans and roadmap in their AI and tech journey.

Some distributors are also investing in developing AI use cases with vendors that they can easily provide to customers. These use cases are normally based on common customer challenges and can be adopted to different markets and industries in the region as well, making it simpler for the distribution and enablement of AI in organizations.

These changes and trends are based on conversations that CRN Asia has had with vendors and partners throughout 2025. While there is still time for partners to relook into their strategies and see how they can scale properly, the reality is, partners that have already adopted the changes will definitely have a head start compared to the rest.

What the industry says

At the recent GTDC APJ summit in Singapore, Frank Vitagliano, CEO of GTDC said, ""Distributors have become an even more vital component of IT suppliers' market and sales expansion objectives in recent years, especially in the ultra-competitive cloud, cybersecurity and AI fields that require fast, cost-effective growth. An optimal distribution strategy boosts channel performance and ROI and provides greater incentives for everyone, including current and potential investors.""

Vendors have stated that partners would need to be ready to use AI to enhance their capabilities and be subject matter experts, especially when dealing with customers.

Chetan Krishnamurthy Vice President, Ecosystem and Digital Sales, IBM APAC, stated that speed and scale will be key to growing volume and velocity for IBM partners. This includes the need to automate some processes to make it more seamless for both partners and customers.

Meanwhile, Jacob Pereira, Head of APAC Partnerships at Zoom believes that 2026 will see a new breed of partners rising, especially with the enhancements Zoom has made to its partner program and also the increasing demand from customers to have more products and services.

For Suchanda Mandal, VP of APAC partnerships at Cloudflare, the vendor is on a journey to become 90% partner. Speaking to CRN Australia, Mandal explained that to grow the channel, first, they need to be ready and their partners need to be ready. This includes investing in people and process technology to make it easier for partners to do business with Cloudflare.

Damien Wong, Senior Vice President for Asia Pacific and Japan (JAPAC) stated that while Tricentis does not work 100% through partners, his desired end state is that every customer should have partners that work with them. Wong believes that training and enablement actually help partners address challenges they face. It’s also why Tricentis is very focused on helping ensure partners are well-trained, well-certified, and that they understand that as the portfolio evolves.

Other vendors and partners have also shared their views on the opportunities and challenges that they have experienced and also expecting in the future. At the end of the day, the channel ecosystem will very much be dependent on how both partners and vendors make it seamless to deal with customer demands in 2026.",https://www.crnasia.com/news/2025/partners/media_1a8c4bef3e3ead820c90ff5ded83f043d37bfa564.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-12-17 13:03:27.178212

Holders of Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, 7,000-credit and 50,000-credit plans receive unlimited image and video generations in the Firefly app for a limited period.","Adobe has rolled out a series of updates to its Firefly generative AI platform, adding new video editing tools, additional partner models and a browser-based video editor, alongside a promotion that removes generation limits for some subscribers.

The company is introducing a Prompt to Edit feature for video, camera motion controls, a new video upscaling option from Topaz Astra, and access to the FLUX.2 image model from Black Forest Labs. It is also moving Firefly video editor into public beta as a lightweight, web-based assembly tool for AI-generated and traditional footage.

Adobe is pitching Firefly as a single environment for working with multiple generative models at different stages of a creative workflow. The platform sits alongside tools such as Photoshop and Premiere in its wider Creative Cloud portfolio.

Prompt-based video edits

The new Prompt to Edit feature lets users apply natural language instructions to existing AI-generated clips. Creators generate footage inside Firefly, then send it to Runway's Aleph model, which interprets text prompts and makes targeted changes without regenerating the full video.

Adobe highlighted example instructions such as ""Remove the person on the left side of the frame,"" ""Replace the background with a clean studio backdrop,"" and ""Change the sky to overcast and lower the contrast."" The model applies those instructions to the chosen clip inside Firefly.

The approach is designed for cases where a generation is close to the desired result and only requires selective refinements. It reduces the need to re-roll whole scenes in search of incremental improvements.

Firefly also adds camera motion controls within the Firefly Video Model. Users upload a start frame image and a separate reference video that contains the desired camera movement. The system then recreates similar motion in a generated sequence, anchored on the supplied frame.

Adobe said the combination of text-based editing and camera-motion references is aimed at preserving strong takes and cutting down on trial-and-error generation cycles for short-form and social content.

Upscaling with Topaz Astra

Adobe is expanding its use of third-party AI models inside Firefly through new integrations. Topaz Astra, from Topaz Labs, is now available in Firefly Boards for video resolution upscaling.

The model can increase output to 1080p or 4K. Users can apply it to low-resolution clips or older footage that lacks definition.

Adobe positions the integration as a way to prepare back-catalogue content for current distribution formats. The company said that while upscaling runs in Boards, creators can continue other tasks or queue additional videos for processing.

On the image side, Firefly now supports FLUX.2, the latest model from Black Forest Labs. FLUX.2 generates and edits images at up to 1 megapixel and handles flexible aspect ratios. It focuses on photorealistic detail and advanced text rendering and can work with up to four reference images.

FLUX.2 is accessible inside Firefly's Text to Image module, Prompt to Edit and Firefly Boards. It is also available in Photoshop's Generative Fill and is scheduled for Adobe Express from January.

Browser-based video editor

Alongside the new models, Adobe is opening Firefly video editor to a broader audience in public beta. The tool runs in the browser and functions as a multi-track editor for assembling AI-generated clips, audio and user-uploaded footage.

Users can work in a traditional timeline view for frame-accurate cuts, pacing and layering. They can also edit by text in workflows such as talking-head or interview videos, where the transcript drives the reordering or trimming of segments.

The editor supports exports in multiple aspect ratios. Adobe is positioning it for vertical social formats as well as widescreen outputs that can sit beside content created in desktop tools.

In a blog outlining the direction for Firefly, Adobe described the editor as the place where separate AI generations, live footage and soundtracks come together into finished pieces.

Unlimited generations offer

Adobe is coupling the product updates with a temporary removal of generation limits across Firefly for some paying customers. Holders of Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, 7,000-credit and 50,000-credit plans receive unlimited image and video generations in the Firefly app for a limited period.

The promotion covers Firefly's own commercially safe image and video models and a set of partner models that now includes FLUX.2, Google's Nano Banana and OpenAI's GPT Image, alongside the new Topaz Astra upscaler.

Adobe said that many customers work with several AI systems in parallel and prefer not to move between separate tools for model selection, generation and editing. It is framing Firefly as a central environment for those tasks across still and moving images.

""As model innovation accelerates across the industry, the combination of industry-leading models plus Adobe's best-in-class creative tools is where things become truly transformative-turning AI from 'generation' into a practical, end-to-end creative workflow,"" said Adobe.

The company plans further integrations of external models and deeper links between Firefly, Creative Cloud and Express as it builds out its generative AI ecosystem.",https://itbrief.com.au/uploads/story/2025/12/17/compatible_Firefly_Video_Editor.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:04:03.631139

Who Are Republic Services’ Top Shareholders?

Republic Services’ shareholder base is led by large institutional investors that tend to hold through market cycles, which can help keep long-term ownership stable. Recent filings show a mix of selective accumulation and trimming, suggesting balanced sentiment rather than a strong directional shift, and for investors this points to confidence in the business alongside valuation awareness.

Cascade Investment, L.L.C.: 109,816,832 shares (35.47%), ~$23.6B value. Cut 4,258 shares (-7.97%).

The Vanguard Group, Inc.: 19,006,141 shares (6.14%), ~$4.09B value. Added 47,135 shares (+0.25%).

Pictet Asset Management Ltd.: 4,030,807 shares (1.30%), ~$868M value. Cut 1,275,628 shares (-24.04%).

Hedge Fund Highlights

One notable move came from Tairen Capital, founded by Terry Zhang, which increased its Republic Services position by over 4,000% last quarter. The firm now holds roughly $8.6M value of the stock, which may indicate growing interest in RSG’s defensive cash flow profile following recent share price weakness.

Another increase was seen from Magnetar Financial, led by Alec Litowitz, which boosted its stake by nearly 472% to about $4.2M value. While still modest in size, the sharp change suggests Magnetar may be leaning more positively on Republic Services’ long-term earnings stability.

Gotham Asset Management, run by value-focused investor Joel Greenblatt, raised its position by roughly 41%, bringing its total holding to approximately $36.6M value. The move appears consistent with Gotham’s focus on high-quality businesses with durable margins.

Meanwhile, Scopus Asset Management, founded by Alexander Mitchell, increased its exposure by nearly 39%, now holding about $8.8M value of the stock, and for investors this pattern suggests selective hedge fund interest without signs of crowded positioning.

Republic Services’ Recent Insider Trades

Insider trades can offer useful context, though they should be viewed carefully and alongside broader ownership trends. Recent filings for Republic Services show a cluster of small purchases, primarily from directors.

Katharine B. Weymouth (Director): Bought 478 shares for ~$100K

Norman Thomas Linebarger (Director): Bought 6 shares for ~$1K

Michael J. Larson (Director): Bought 114 shares for ~$24K

Brian Scott Tyler (Director): Bought 12 shares for ~$3K

Manuel Kadre (Director): Bought 109 shares for ~$23K

Thomas W. Handley (Director): Bought 66 shares for ~$14K

James P. Snee (Director): Bought 12 shares for ~$3K

Jennifer M. Kirk (Director): Bought 66 shares for ~$14K

Catharine D. Ellingsen (Director): Bought 88 shares for ~$18K

Sandra M. Volpe (Director): Bought 66 shares for ~$14K

Jonathan Vander Ark (Director): Bought 131 shares for ~$28K

Brian A. Bales (Director): Bought 368 shares for ~$77K

Brian M. DelGhiaccio (Director): Bought 115 shares for ~$24K

These transactions represent a very small fraction of Republic Services’ 309.6M shares outstanding, and it appears insider ownership levels were not materially affected, though for investors the clustering of modest purchases may suggest comfort with the stock near recent price levels.

What the Ownership & Insider Trade Data Tell Us

Republic Services’ shareholder base remains anchored by large, long-term institutions led by Cascade Investment, Vanguard, and BlackRock. Hedge fund activity points to selective accumulation, while insider purchases appear limited in size and broadly distributed.

Taken together, it appears investors continue to view Republic Services as a durable, cash-generative business, though positioning across institutions and insiders suggests a measured approach as the stock trades at elevated valuation levels relative to its historical range.

On a final note, we've found 1 warning sign for Boston Scientific that we think you should be aware of.","If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Boston Scientific, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.10 = US$3.7b ÷ (US$43b - US$5.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025).

Thus, Boston Scientific has an ROCE of 10.0%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Medical Equipment industry average of 11%.

In the above chart we have measured Boston Scientific's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Boston Scientific for free.

How Are Returns Trending?

While in absolute terms it isn't a high ROCE, it's promising to see that it has been moving in the right direction. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 10.0%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 36%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.

The Bottom Line

In summary, it's great to see that Boston Scientific can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 171% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.

Osborne, who stepped down as a member of parliament in 2017, is to begin his new job next month and will be based in London.

“I recently asked myself the question: what’s the most exciting and promising company in the world right now? The answer I believe is OpenAI,” he said on social media.

‘Democratic values’

OpenAI chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane said Osborne joining the company reflected a belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure, and that “decisions about how it’s built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come”.

The OpenAI for Countries programme has so far engaged with governments in more than 50 countries.

Lehane said on social media that the scheme is designed “to ensure that global AI systems are built on democratic values”.

It is an extension of the Stargate programme that was unveiled at the beginning of 2025, and initially focused on building infrastructure such as data centres in the US and expanded to other countries in April.

Osborne is the chair of the British Museum, hosts a podcast and was the editor of the Evening Standard from 2017 to 2020.

They took the name Ankar for their new company from the name of an omniscient and powerful knight found in pre-Islamic poetry.
The new funding for Ankar comes as intellectual property has become increasingly critical to corporate value.
“Patent claims are basically the scope of protection for your invention—like, what are the most important pieces of my invention that I want to protect?
[Ankar’s] tool can help suggest an initial set of claims and then help the patent attorney think through potential options for broadening these claims,” Gharbi said.","Ankar was founded by Tamar Gomez and Wiem Gharbi in 2024. The pair met while working at Palantir, where they both encountered the time-consuming process of trying to obtain patents for new technology. Gomez, who has a business background, worked as a development strategist for Palantir, while Gharbi, who is a data scientist by training, worked on machine learning applications. They took the name Ankar for their new company from the name of an omniscient and powerful knight found in pre-Islamic poetry.

“We are trying to turn IP that has been viewed as a cost center for a very long time into more of a strategic and competitive asset that we need today in a world that is becoming more and more competitive,” Gharbi, who is Ankar’s chief technology officer, told Fortune.

The new funding for Ankar comes as intellectual property has become increasingly critical to corporate value. Intangible assets like IP now represent up to 90% of the value of S&P 500 companies, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. Yet the systems for protecting those assets remain stubbornly outdated, according to Gomez and Gharbi, who say they witnessed how time-consuming and difficult it is to obtain a patent when they were working at Palantir.

“To go from something that’s in the head of the inventor—an innovation—to something that is a bankable asset that can be leveraged by the company in the form of a patent took years, basically,” Gomez, who is Ankar’s CEO, said. “The tools to do so were incredibly legacy or just non-existent. It was like a hodgepodge of manual processes.”

Patent attorneys can spend weeks searching multiple databases and reading patent filings to try to determine the extent to which, if any, prior patents might conflict with the new invention they were hoping to protect. Then it can take many more weeks to craft a patent application with the right arguments to try to overcome any objections from patent examiners. Securing a patent can take up to 24 months.

Ankar wants to use large language models to streamline that process. Because these models can search for phrasing that has the same meaning, even if it doesn’t use the exact same keywords, they can quickly surface patent filings from databases that previously would have taken multiple searches and hours of reading to discover.

The startup’s invention discovery tool searches across 150 million patent applications and 250 million scientific publications and produces reports assessing how “novel” an invention is and what claims have already been made by previously patented inventions that might be similar (what’s known in the patent world as “prior art.”) The platform helps inventors harvest their ideas and guides patent attorneys through drafting applications, including spotting gaps in existing patents where claims for a new invention might get the most traction. It also supports patent lawyers when they have to respond to possible challenges from patent examiners, giving them a single view of the entire history of the application process.

“Patent claims are basically the scope of protection for your invention—like, what are the most important pieces of my invention that I want to protect? [Ankar’s] tool can help suggest an initial set of claims and then help the patent attorney think through potential options for broadening these claims,” Gharbi said. “So it’s no longer about just helping you kind of generate words, because we think that the value of just generating words is going to decrease over time. It’s going to become more about like, how do I generate the best qualities of the scope of protection?”

The company has secured some notable early customers, including global cosmetics giant L’Oréal and global law firm Vorys. Ankar says that so far its customers have reported an average 40% boost in productivity, with hundreds of hours shifted to high-value strategic work.

Jean-Yves Legendre, competitive IP intelligence manager at L’Oréal, praised Ankar in a statement, saying that the startup “understood patents, spoke our language, and adapted to our needs.”

Many global companies, particularly in automotive, electronics, and R&D-heavy sector are redoubling efforts to protect their intellectual property, concerned that generative AI will make it easier for competitors to replicate product designs, architectures, and processes.

The brokerage started Siemens Healthineers at Outperform with a €55 price target, arguing that the stock’s valuation does not reflect its medium-term growth profile or leading market position.

“Trading close to all-time low multiples since the IPO, we believe the valuation is not reflective of the company’s medium-term mid-to-high single-digit sales and double-digit underlying earnings growth potential, nor its no.1 positioning and track record of outperformance in core markets,” analysts led by Natalia Webster wrote.

The company added a further 7 percentage points of market share in Imaging, reinforcing its leading position, and gained 10 percentage points in Radiation Oncology since the pre-Varian acquisition period in 2020, analysts noted.

“We believe it can continue to outperform core markets, supported by scale, new innovations, AI-integration and synergistic offerings to hospital customers,” they added.

RBC estimates around 6% group sales growth rate over the 2026-30 period and expects margin expansion driven by mix, productivity initiatives, and price increases, offsetting near-term headwinds from tariffs, foreign exchange, and China.

The bank also sees potential upside from the Diagnostics division, noting that a sale or further margin improvement could unlock additional value.

Separately, RBC initiated coverage on Koninklijke Philips at Sector Perform with a €25 price target, reflecting a more balanced risk-reward view.

The bank said Philips’ valuation discount versus peers is justified by “lower sales growth potential, lower margins and returns,” as well as ongoing regulatory and execution concerns.

RBC acknowledged progress at Philips following its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts, with the company on track to deliver €2.5 billion in productivity savings over 2023–25.

However, the analysts said recent regulatory warnings underline that “further attention is needed on fixing its quality and safety measures,” particularly in its Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care segments.

The bank forecasts Philips to deliver around 4% constant-exchange-rate sales growth rate over 2025–28, below consensus, alongside gradual margin expansion to 13.5% by 2028 financial year.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning four major retailers about compliance with a recall of infant formula that has been linked to botulism.

Ann Oxenham, the FDA’s top compliance officer for the human foods program, sent letters to Albertsons, Kroger, Target and Walmart Friday about ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula products remaining on some store’s retail shelves as late as Nov. 26.

“These warning letters highlight the critical responsibility that retailers have in effectuating a recall, particularly when dealing with products that pose serious health risks to our most vulnerable populations, such as infants,” the agency said in a statement released Monday.

No infant deaths attributed to the outbreak have been reported. At least 51 cases across 19 states resulted in infant hospitalizations as of Dec. 10, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

ByHeart issued a recall of the formula on Nov. 8. The company expanded the recall three days later to include all of its products, including unexpired formula cans and single-serve “anywhere pack” sticks, according to an agency news release.

When the agency’s state and local partners made 4,000 visits to retail stores in the weeks after the initial recall, they found the formula stocked at more than 175 locations across 36 states.

“Food safety is a shared responsibility, and it is of utmost importance that all parties in the supply chain act swiftly and vigilantly to protect our nation’s children from unsafe food,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement.

Botulism in babies occurs when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinum bacteria, according to the CDC. Symptoms can take weeks to develop, but they include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control and difficulty swallowing.

The ByHeart formula products were found at Walmart stores in 21 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 26, according to the FDA warning letter to CEO Doug McMillon.

“As a participant in the supply chain, your firm should take prompt and effective action when notified of a product recall,” Oxenham wrote.

A Walmart spokesperson told States Newsroom that the health and safety of their customers is “always a top priority.”

“When notified of the recall, we moved swiftly to issue a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores and clubs and online. We take all reports of inaction seriously and will respond to the letter,” the spokesperson said.

Even though Target told the FDA that the big-box store put a block on bar codes for cans of ByHeart formula and the single-serve packs on Nov. 11, an investigator found the formula at a New Hampshire location five days later, according to the warning letter.

A larger agency audit discovered the recalled formula was still on Target shelves across 20 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 20. Associates told state and local FDA partners that they were not aware of the recall or confused about the scope of which products were potentially affected by the contamination, among other explanations.

An auditor even found the single-serve formula packs marked down at an Arkansas Target with a $2 discount weeks after the nationwide recall, the letter states.

Target did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The recalled formula was found at several Albertsons stores, including Acme and Safeway, across 11 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 19, according to an FDA letter sent to CEO Susan Morris.

Agency officials had a call with the company’s leadership on Nov. 20 asking for a plan about the issue, but Oxenham wrote that the company did not deliver one.

In a statement provided to States Newsroom, a spokesperson for the company said “they are committed to the health and safety of our customers.”

“We have procedures to address product recalls, including working closely with suppliers and regulators to identify and remove affected items and communicate guidance to customers,” a spokesperson said. “ByHeart infant formula products have been removed from our store shelves.”

The FDA wrote to Kroger interim CEO Ronald Sargent on Friday, too, saying that the formula was found at the company’s stores across 10 states “well after the recall was initiated and subsequently expanded.” Kroger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ByHeart is issuing refunds for all products purchased on or after Aug. 1 from their website, and parents or caregivers can also get their money back if they purchased the formula from retailers, according to a statement.

The company has had safety issues recently: A Pennsylvania plant closed this year after inspectors found mold, dead insects and a leaking roof in a formula production area, The New York Times reported last month.

Two years ago, a hazardous bacterium that can cause sepsis and meningitis in infants was found in a processing area of the same plant and in finished formula shortly after, according to the Times.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/citypulse/original/20250523-131120-699-city_pulse_generic_og_image.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:02:45.925167

The operation will cover 20 percent of SGTM’s capital, representing up to twelve million shares for a total amount that could reach 5.04 billion dirhams (approximately $540 million), positioning this offering as the second-largest IPO in the history of the Moroccan stock market, behind only Maroc Telecom’s landmark listing in 2004.

Unprecedented Market Response Shatters All Records

The SGTM IPO generated extraordinary investor enthusiasm that exceeded even the most optimistic projections. The offering attracted nearly 173,000 subscribers, marking the highest number of individual participants ever recorded for an IPO in Morocco and surpassing the previous record held by Maroc Telecom in 2004, which had drawn 133,000 investors during its public offering. The subscription period closed on December 8 with the MAD 5 billion operation oversubscribed by 3,400 percent, generating total demand exceeding MAD 171 billion ($17.1 billion), an astronomical figure that demonstrates the pent-up demand for quality equity issuers in the Moroccan market.

According to the Casablanca Stock Exchange preliminary data, the construction and infrastructure group sold 12 million shares equal to 20 percent of its share capital at a price of 420 dirhams per share, excluding preferential allocations granted to some investor categories. The company scheduled to begin trading on December 16, 2025, with the deal ranking as the second-largest IPO ever completed in Casablanca behind only Maroc Telecom’s 2004 listing, and significantly exceeding the scale of other offerings completed in 2025, including Vicenne and Cash Plus, which had already helped revive activity on the primary market.

The overwhelming subscriber response indicates growing household willingness to invest in equities when company fundamentals appear solid, reflecting a maturation of Morocco’s retail investor base and increased financial literacy among the general population. For SGTM, this listing opens new financial horizons while allowing historical investors to monetize their holdings and institutionalize the company’s shareholder base, transforming what was previously a family-owned enterprise into a publicly accountable corporation subject to enhanced governance standards and disclosure requirements.

Strategic Rationale Behind the Public Listing

SGTM views this IPO as a critical step in its long-term development and opening strategy, designed to position the company for accelerated growth in both domestic and regional markets. By offering part of its capital to the market, the group aims to strengthen its financial structure, attract new strategic and financial partners, improve operational transparency through regular public disclosure, and enhance its visibility both nationally and across the African continent where infrastructure demand continues to surge.

The offering also supports a critical managerial objective: involving employees directly in the company’s performance and enabling them to share in the value created through their collective efforts. This employee participation component reflects modern corporate governance practices that align workforce incentives with long-term shareholder value creation, fostering a culture of ownership and accountability throughout the organization.

The company’s decision to pursue a public listing occurs against a backdrop of extraordinary growth opportunities. SGTM’s backlog has climbed to around MAD 35 billion ($3.5 billion) as of late 2024, almost double its level at year-end, giving SGTM roughly three years of sales “almost secured” at current run-rate. This robust pipeline provides solid visibility on future activity and supports the company’s growth ambitions in Morocco and in several African markets where it maintains operational presence.

Five Decades of Infrastructure Excellence

Founded in 1972 by brothers Ahmed and Mohamed Kabbaj, SGTM has evolved from a challenger in a market dominated by foreign firms into one of the central players of Morocco’s construction and infrastructure industry. The family-owned group, which has remained 100 percent Moroccan and independent throughout its history, has spent over half a century helping shape the country’s physical and economic landscape through completion of more than 1,000 flagship projects.

The company positions itself as a multi-specialist operator active across five main business lines: dams and hydraulic works, tertiary buildings, transport infrastructure and civil works, maritime and river works, and industrial, mining, and energy-related structures. Its impressive track record includes major dams that provide water security for agriculture and urban populations, ports such as Tanger Med and Nador West Med that serve as gateways for international trade, large stadiums that host national and international sporting events, sections of Morocco’s high-speed rail line connecting major cities, industrial units supporting manufacturing sectors, and university campuses that expand educational infrastructure.

As of the end of 2024, the company employs more than 21,000 people across its operations, backed by a sizeable equipment fleet comprising approximately 2,500 machines ranging from earthmoving equipment to specialized construction machinery. This substantial workforce and capital equipment base enables SGTM to simultaneously execute multiple large-scale projects while maintaining quality standards and meeting demanding delivery schedules.

The group’s geographic footprint extends beyond Morocco’s borders, with the company actively operating in six other African countries including Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and Burkina Faso. This regional diversification reduces dependence on any single market while providing exposure to infrastructure development opportunities across West Africa, where governments are investing heavily in roads, ports, energy facilities, and social infrastructure to support economic development and improve living standards.

Explosive Revenue Growth Driven by Infrastructure Boom

Financially, SGTM enters the public market with impressive scale and a visible growth trajectory that has accelerated dramatically in recent years. Consolidated revenue rose from about MAD 8.8 billion ($880 million) in 2022 to MAD 11.1 billion ($1.11 billion) in 2024, representing growth of approximately 26 percent over the two-year period. More significantly, revenue reached around MAD 11 billion in 2024, up from MAD 8.5 billion in 2023, marking growth of approximately 30 percent in a single year.

For 2025, SGTM anticipates similar robust expansion, with revenue expected to reach close to MAD 14 billion ($1.4 billion), replicating the annual increase of more than 25 percent achieved in 2024. This extraordinary growth trajectory reflects the company’s success in capturing major infrastructure contracts associated with Morocco’s accelerating development programs, particularly those linked to preparation for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2030 FIFA World Cup.

The 2030 World Cup alone is boosting SGTM’s business by approximately 15 percent according to company leadership, though this understates the broader transformational impact on Morocco’s construction sector. As Hicham Kabbaj, a company executive, noted in an interview, “The 2030 World Cup is an accelerator of the infrastructure development in the country,” driving demand across multiple project categories from transportation networks to hospitality facilities.

The company’s most visible World Cup-related project is its role in constructing the Hassan II Stadium, which is being built approximately 35 miles east of Casablanca and will feature a design capacity of 115,000 seats, making it the largest football stadium in the world when completed. In September 2025, the firm completed total renovation of Rabat’s Moulay Abdellah Stadium, demonstrating its capacity to deliver complex projects on aggressive timelines.

World Cup Infrastructure: A National Transformation

Morocco’s successful bid to co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup with Spain and Portugal has unleashed an unprecedented wave of infrastructure investment that creates enormous opportunities for construction companies like SGTM. The country is preparing to invest approximately $5 billion in infrastructure projects specifically tied to World Cup preparation, though this figure represents only the tournament-specific investments and does not capture the full scope of the broader national development program.

The Moroccan government has committed approximately MAD 150 billion ($15 billion) to infrastructure projects across multiple sectors through 2030, with Fouzi Lekjaa, Morocco’s minister in charge of the budget, explaining that the country’s infrastructure projects for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations are being designed as integral components of World Cup preparation, ensuring that every dirham spent provides lasting value beyond the immediate tournament requirements.

The comprehensive development program includes renovating five existing stadiums and investing MAD 5 billion ($500 million) in construction of the world’s largest football stadium in Benslimane near Casablanca. Beyond sports venues, Morocco plans to invest MAD 12.5 billion ($1.3 billion) to develop highway infrastructure, with investments spanning from 2025 to 2032 and focusing on three major projects: the Continental Rabat-Casablanca Highway, Tit Mellil-Berrechid Highway, and Ain Harrouda and Sidi Maarouf junctions.

These highway projects are designed to improve access to the Grand Stadium in Casablanca for the World Cup, ease traffic flow on the Rabat-Casablanca corridor, and improve connectivity across the Casablanca region, addressing longstanding congestion challenges while creating modern transportation infrastructure that will serve the country for decades.

The construction sector represents about 6 percent of Morocco’s GDP and 16 percent of employment, positioning it at the heart of a public investment program exceeding MAD 1,000 billion ($100 billion) through 2031. Large-scale projects in water infrastructure, transport, ports, industrial platforms, renewable energy, and social facilities are already underway or planned, with the World Cup adding an additional layer of urgency and visibility for stadiums and transport upgrades.

Economic impact analyses project substantial returns from these investments. According to Valoris Securities estimates, each World Cup match is projected to contribute between $25 million and $37.5 million to the economy, with total direct economic benefit estimated at $1.2 billion and GDP growth contribution of 0.6 to 0.9 percent during the 2024-2030 period. The tournament is expected to create 200,000 to 250,000 direct and indirect jobs while generating an 80 percent increase in tourist arrivals by 2030.

Valuation Framework and Investment Thesis

The valuation framework adopted for the SGTM IPO centers on discounted cash flow methodology, using a business plan covering 2025-2031 that incorporates projected revenue growth, margin profiles, investment schedules, and working capital requirements. According to detailed analysis, the weighted average cost of capital is set at 7.96 percent, combining a risk-free rate of 2.88 percent, an equity risk premium of 6.07 percent, and an unlevered beta of 0.9, which translates into a cost of equity close to 9.93 percent.

The terminal growth rate is capped at 2.5 percent, positioned conservatively below macroeconomic forecasts for Morocco’s construction sector to provide valuation cushion. On this basis, the discounted cash flow model yields an equity value of MAD 26.692 billion ($2.67 billion), or MAD 445 per share, placing the IPO price of MAD 420 toward the lower end of the theoretical range and providing investors with immediate value appreciation potential.

This valuation of around MAD 25 billion ($2.5 billion) for the entire enterprise reflects SGTM’s position as a family-owned construction group coming to market through an initial public offering made entirely by share disposal from the founding Kabbaj family. The IPO pricing strategy balances the interests of selling shareholders seeking to monetize decades of value creation with the need to attract new investors through attractive entry valuations that leave room for capital appreciation.

The timing of the IPO is directly linked to favorable macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions. Construction activity is accelerating across Morocco, supported by record public investment programs and the momentum generated by World Cup preparation. SGTM’s substantial order book, robust profit margins, conservative balance sheet, and IPO valuation that sits below model-based estimates create a compelling investment proposition for both institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to Morocco’s infrastructure boom.

Casablanca Stock Exchange: A Market Reborn

SGTM’s arrival on the Casablanca Stock Exchange occurs during a particularly active year for the bourse, which is witnessing the return of sizeable listings after several quieter years when capital-raising activity had languished and investor sentiment remained subdued. The exchange has experienced a remarkable transformation, with the benchmark MASI index surpassing the symbolic threshold of 19,000 points and reaching a record MAD 1 trillion ($100 billion) market capitalization for the first time in its history during July 2025.

Before SGTM, Cash Plus had received AMMC approval for its own listing, scheduled for December 8 following a dual operation of new and existing shares totaling 3.8 million units at a fixed price of 200 dirhams, for a global amount of approximately 750 million dirhams ($75 million). The fintech company’s IPO generated MAD 48.82 billion ($4.88 billion) in subscription requests for just MAD 750 million in available shares, representing a 64-fold oversubscription from 80,759 investors across 75 nationalities and 12 regions.

Cash Plus made history as Morocco’s first fintech to list on the Casablanca Stock Exchange, landing a valuation of about $550 million and drawing one of the largest investor turnouts the market has seen from a technology-driven issuer. The listing closed on November 25 after the IPO raised $82.5 million in total, including $44 million in new capital that will go directly into scaling the company through expansion of its nationwide footprint, strengthening its agent network, and pushing its digital ecosystem further into payments, mobile wallets, and app-based services.

Earlier in 2025, Vicenne made a notable market debut on July 15 with an IPO that was oversubscribed 64 times, attracting 32.1 billion Moroccan dirhams ($3.2 billion) in total demand for only MAD 500 million in shares. The healthcare equipment supplier’s offering attracted nearly 38,000 investors from 48 countries including buyers from the UK, UAE, France, the US, and Luxembourg, demonstrating international appetite for Morocco’s growing equity market.

Vicenne raised MAD 500 million by selling 2.1 million shares at a subscription price of MAD 236 per share, with the Bourse de Casablanca commenting that “this operation confirms the Casablanca Stock Exchange’s ability to concretely support the development of Moroccan companies by offering them effective and accessible financing solutions, regardless of their size or sector of activity.”

Beyond the completed 2025 listings, the pipeline remains robust. GPC Carton, a packaging manufacturer benefiting from Morocco’s position as leading exporter of corrugated papers and cartons in the Middle East and North Africa region, is preparing its listing. Other major companies including Dislog, Diana Holding, and Ynna Holding are reportedly considering public offerings, pointing to renewed momentum and confidence in the Casablanca market as a viable channel for raising growth capital.

Structural Reforms Drive Market Revival

The resurgence of the Casablanca Stock Exchange reflects deeper structural reforms implemented by Moroccan authorities in collaboration with international partners such as the World Bank. These reforms aim to modernize the exchange, attract more foreign capital, and establish Morocco as a regional financial center. According to Raef Kawar, a partner at Rabat-based investment banking firm EuraBridge, “Morocco has understood that to be able to attract more capital, we need to have the standards that potential investors are looking for.”

The government has introduced new financial instruments including sukuks and green bonds to broaden financing options, while finalizing plans to introduce a derivatives market that would allow investors to trade and manage risk more efficiently. These initiatives reflect recognition that developing robust, internationally competitive capital markets is essential for financing Morocco’s ambitious infrastructure and economic diversification programs without excessive reliance on government budgets or foreign debt.

The improved regulatory environment and enhanced market infrastructure have begun attracting foreign institutional investors who previously viewed Morocco as insufficiently developed for meaningful capital allocation. The 64-times oversubscription of Vicenne’s IPO, with more than 17 percent of institutional allocations going to foreign investors, demonstrates that international capital is responding to Morocco’s reform efforts and recognizes the country’s investment potential.

Private equity firms including Mediterrania Capital Partners have structured several recent listings including Cash Plus, Akdital, TGCC, and CMGP, bringing sophisticated financial engineering and institutional credibility to the market. This participation by established private equity investors provides validation of company quality and corporate governance standards, making public offerings more attractive to risk-averse retail and institutional investors.

Capital Markets Performance and Economic Context

Morocco’s stock market performance has been exceptional by regional and global standards. The MASI index rose 74 percent from early 2023 through late 2025, dramatically outperforming most developed and emerging market indices over the same period. The index gained 1.30 percent to close at 19,168.83 points in a single day during July, bringing its year-to-date performance to an impressive 29.75 percent.

Total market fundraising reached MAD 3.4 billion ($340 million) in 2025, surpassing 2024’s MAD 3.1 billion and demonstrating sustained momentum in primary market activity. Since 2022, IPOs have raised more than MAD 147 billion ($14.7 billion), confirming the growing appeal and maturity of the Casablanca market for both companies seeking funding and investors looking for new opportunities.

This capital markets revival occurs against a backdrop of solid macroeconomic performance despite global uncertainties. According to the High Commission for Planning, Morocco’s economic growth accelerated to 4.8 percent in the first quarter of 2025, up from 3.0 percent a year earlier, primarily driven by a 4.6 percent increase in non-agricultural activities stimulated by major infrastructure projects related to AFCON 2025 and World Cup 2030 preparation.

Public finances remain under control despite increased infrastructure spending, with the central bank projecting a budget deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP for 2025. This trajectory is supported by increased tax revenues from economic growth and rigorous expenditure management that prioritizes high-impact investments while containing current spending. The government has structured World Cup-related financing through innovative mechanisms including public-private partnerships and specialized funding vehicles that avoid burdening the general state budget.

Investment Banking and Market Infrastructure

SGTM’s IPO benefits from sophisticated financial advisory services provided by Morocco’s leading investment banks. Attijari Finances Corp., the investment banking arm of Attijariwafa Bank, is acting as the financial advisor and global coordinator for the offering, bringing decades of capital markets experience and deep relationships with institutional investors across Morocco, Africa, and Europe.

Attijari Intermédiation serves as lead manager of the placement syndicate, coordinating the distribution of shares to various investor categories. Co-lead managers include BMCE Capital, Saham Capital Bourse, CFG Bank Capital Markets, and Upline Securities, ensuring broad distribution capacity and access to diverse investor bases ranging from retail individuals to large institutional asset managers.

This syndicate structure reflects best practices in emerging market IPOs, where multiple banks collaborate to maximize distribution while managing pricing and allocation decisions. The competitive dynamics among syndicate members help ensure aggressive marketing efforts while the coordination provided by the global coordinator maintains consistency in messaging and execution.

Broader Implications for Moroccan Capital Markets

The SGTM IPO carries significance that extends well beyond the transaction itself, representing validation of Morocco’s economic trajectory and capital markets infrastructure. The overwhelming investor response—173,000 subscribers generating MAD 171 billion in demand—demonstrates that retail investors, who have historically been skeptical of equities, are now willing to allocate capital to well-structured offerings backed by companies with strong fundamentals and visible growth prospects.

This shift in investor psychology reflects multiple factors: improved corporate governance standards that provide better protection for minority shareholders, enhanced disclosure requirements that increase transparency and reduce information asymmetry, growing financial literacy as more Moroccans gain exposure to capital markets through various channels, and concrete examples of wealth creation through earlier IPOs that have delivered strong returns for subscribers.

For other Moroccan companies contemplating public listings, SGTM’s success provides a powerful demonstration effect. The ability to raise MAD 5 billion at premium valuations while generating extraordinary oversubscription proves that the market has capacity to absorb large offerings when properly structured and marketed. This should encourage additional companies to consider IPOs as viable alternatives to private equity or debt financing for funding growth initiatives.

The diversification of listed sectors—from healthcare (Vicenne) to fintech (Cash Plus) to construction (SGTM)—enhances the attractiveness of the Casablanca exchange to portfolio investors seeking sectoral diversity. Previously, the market was heavily weighted toward financials and materials, limiting options for investors wanting broad economic exposure. The addition of high-growth companies from various sectors creates more balanced index composition and reduces concentration risk.

Challenges and Risk Factors

Despite the overwhelmingly positive market reception, SGTM and the broader Moroccan construction sector face legitimate challenges that could impact future performance. The surge in contracts brings operational pressures including scarcity of qualified talent in engineering and project management roles, rising input costs for materials and equipment that compress margins, execution risk associated with delivering multiple large projects simultaneously, and working capital requirements that increase as the company scales operations.

SGTM’s international expansion ambitions, including pursuit of contracts in the Middle East region and particularly in Saudi Arabia for the 2034 World Cup, introduce additional complexities related to operating in unfamiliar regulatory environments, managing currency exposures, competing against well-established international contractors, and adapting to different construction standards and practices.

The concentration of revenue growth on World Cup-related projects creates temporary demand that will eventually moderate, requiring SGTM to identify sustainable growth drivers beyond the tournament cycle. While infrastructure investment is expected to remain elevated through 2030, the post-World Cup environment could see reduced public sector contracting volumes unless Morocco successfully transitions to a more diversified industrial and services economy that generates ongoing construction demand.

Macroeconomic risks include potential fiscal constraints if government revenues disappoint or if debt servicing costs rise significantly, currency volatility that could impact import costs for equipment and materials, inflationary pressures that erode purchasing power and increase wage demands, and external shocks such as regional instability or global economic downturns that reduce investor confidence and capital flows.

Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Morocco’s Financial Future

SGTM’s record-breaking IPO represents more than a successful capital-raising transaction for a single company—it marks a defining moment in the evolution of Morocco’s capital markets and broader economic development trajectory. The offering’s overwhelming reception, with nearly 173,000 subscribers generating demand 34 times the available supply, validates years of regulatory reform and demonstrates that Morocco has successfully created a functioning equity market capable of channeling domestic savings toward productive investments.

The timing of SGTM’s listing, coinciding with historic infrastructure investment programs tied to AFCON 2025 and World Cup 2030, positions the company to benefit from extraordinary growth opportunities while providing public market investors with direct exposure to Morocco’s transformation. The construction sector’s central role in the country’s development strategy—representing 6 percent of GDP and 16 percent of employment—ensures that SGTM’s fortunes are closely tied to national success.

For the Casablanca Stock Exchange, the successive listings of Vicenne, Cash Plus, and SGTM in 2025 highlight a market gaining momentum and capable of mobilizing public savings to support high-value projects. Since 2022, IPOs have raised more than MAD 147 billion, confirming that the exchange has matured into a credible capital formation mechanism that complements traditional bank lending and foreign direct investment.

Looking ahead, the continued development of Morocco’s capital markets depends on sustaining the reform momentum, expanding the investor base both domestically and internationally, encouraging more companies to consider public listings, and maintaining the quality of corporate governance and disclosure that underpins investor confidence. If these conditions are met, the Casablanca Stock Exchange could evolve into a true regional financial center, attracting capital from across Africa and the Middle East while providing Moroccan companies with efficient access to growth financing.

SGTM’s December 16 trading debut will provide the ultimate test of market sentiment, with opening price performance signaling whether the extraordinary subscription demand translates into sustained buying pressure from investors who missed allocation opportunities. If the stock performs well in the aftermarket, it will encourage the pipeline of companies contemplating IPOs while reinforcing retail investor enthusiasm for equity participation.

The renaissance of Morocco’s capital markets, exemplified by SGTM’s landmark offering, demonstrates that emerging markets with sound fundamentals, credible institutions, and compelling growth narratives can attract substantial capital even in an uncertain global environment. As infrastructure investment accelerates and economic diversification progresses, Morocco’s experience may provide a template for other African nations seeking to develop robust domestic capital markets that reduce dependence on external financing while empowering local entrepreneurs and investors to build shared prosperity.

Ron was born in Whitefish to Clarence and Edna (Munson) LaBrie on Nov. 25, 1943. He was raised in Whitefish and graduated from Whitefish High School in 1962.

He met the love of his life, Merrilyn Burr, in 1950 and they became childhood friends and later high school sweethearts despite the sand throwing at that fateful first encounter. Ron and Merrilyn were united in marriage on April 27, 1962, and continued to live in Whitefish where their first son Michael was born.

Ron worked in the timber industry prior to the family moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota where sons Craig, Rodney and Jason were born. In 1973, Ron had the opportunity to manage the local Goodyear store in Redwood Falls, Minnesota and the family was there until 1985 when Ron, Merrilyn and Jason began their next adventure in Phoenix, Arizona and eventually settled in Scottsdale where they have lived for over 30 years.

He was especially suited for sales and service where his clients and customers loved his honesty, dedication, and work ethic. He continued to work in the automotive sales and service industry until he retired. Retirement was not for Ron as he missed interacting with customers and he just celebrated his five-year anniversary at the Scottsdale Crossing Albertsons where he greatly enjoyed his co-workers and customers. Ron loved family visits, taking Merrilyn out to eat, crossword and word puzzles, working in the yard and spoiling his dogs and those that came to visit.

Exposing sensitive customer data or hard-fought intellectual property to APIs so you can use closed models like ChatGPT is a non-starter.

Outside of Chinese AI labs, the few open-weights models available today don't compare favorably to the proprietary models from the likes of OpenAI or Anthropic.

This isn't just a problem for enterprise adoption; it's a roadblock to Nvidia's agentic AI vision that the GPU giant is keen to clear. On Monday, the company added three new open-weights models of its own design to its arsenal.

Open-weights models are nothing new for Nvidia — most of the company's headcount is composed of software engineers. However, its latest generation of Nemotron LLMs is by far its most capable and open.

When they launch, the models will be available in three sizes, Nano, Super, and Ultra, which weigh in at about 30, 100, and 500 billion parameters, respectively.

In addition to the model weights, which will roll out on popular AI repos like Hugging Face over the next few months beginning with Nemotron 3 Nano this week, Nvidia has committed to releasing training data and the reinforcement learning environments used to create them, opening the door to highly customized versions of the models down the line.

The models also employ a novel ""hybrid latent MoE"" architecture designed to minimize performance losses when processing long input sequences, like ingesting large documents and processing queries against them.

This is possible using a combination of the Mamba-2 and Transformer architectures throughout the model's layers. Mamba-2 is generally more efficient than transformers when processing long sequences, which results in shorter prompt processing times and more consistent token generation rates.

Nvidia says that it's using transformer layers to maintain ""precise reasoning"" and prevent the model from losing context of the relevant information, a known challenge when ingesting long documents or keeping track of details over extended chat sessions.

Speaking of which, these models natively support a million token context window — the equivalent of roughly 3,000 double spaced pages of text.

All of these models employ a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, which means only a fraction of the total parameter count is activated for each token processed and generated. This puts less pressure on the memory subsystem, resulting in faster throughput than an equivalent dense model on the same hardware.

For example, Nemotron 3 Nano has 30 billion parameters but only 3 billion are activated for each token generated.

While the nano model employs a pretty standard MoE architecture not unlike those seen in gpt-oss or Qwen3-30B-A3B, the larger Super and Ultra models were pretrained using Nvidia's NVFP4 data type and use a new latent MoE architecture.

As Nvidia explains it, using this approach, ""experts operate on a shared latent representation before outputs are projected back to token space. This approach allows the model to call on 4x more experts at the same inference cost, enabling better specialization around subtle semantic structures, domain abstractions, or multi-hop reasoning patterns.""

Finally, these models have been engineered to use ""multi-token prediction,"" a spin on speculative decoding, which we've explored in detail here, that can improve inference performance by up to 3x by predicting future tokens each time a new one is generated. Speculative decoding is particularly useful in agentic applications where large quantities of information are repeatedly processed and regenerated, like code assistants.

Nvidia's 30-billion-parameter Nemotron 3 Nano is available this week, and is designed to run efficiently on enterprise hardware like the vendor's L40S or RTX Pro 6000 Server Edition. However, using 4-bit quantized versions of the model, it should be possible to cram it into GPUs with as little as 24GB of video memory.

According to Artificial Analysis, the model delivers performance on par with models like gpt-oss-20B or Qwen3 VL 32B and 30B-A3B, while offering enterprises far greater flexibility for customization.

One of the go-to methods for model customization is reinforcement learning (RL), which enables users to teach the model new information or approaches through trial and error, where desirable outcomes are rewarded while undesirable ones are punished. Alongside the new models, Nvidia is releasing RL-datasets and training environments, which it calls NeMo Gym, to help enterprises fine-tune the models for their specific application or agentic workflows.

Nemotron 3 Super and Ultra are expected to make their debut in the first half of next year. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2022/03/23/nvidia_dgx_logo.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 04:21:47.427545

Nvidia is not new to open source AI models, and obviously has been involved in running just about every open source AI model ever created as well as the closed ones that have become household names such as Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and OpenAI GPT.
Briski added that in 2025 Nvidia was the largest contributor for open source stuff on Hugging Face, with 650 open models and 250 open datasets set free.
The Super variant has 100 billion parameters, with up to 10 billion activated at once, and the Ultra version has 500 billion parameters with 50 billion activated at any given time.
If Nvidia offers support, it doesn’t have to charge a lot but only enough to cover its model development costs to undercut the increasingly closed AI model makers.","An alien flying in from space aboard a comet would look down on Earth and see that there is this highly influential and famous software company called Nvidia that just so happens to have a massively complex and ridiculously profitable hardware business running a collection of proprietary and open source software that about three quarters of its approximately 40,000 employees create.

So it is not a surprise at all to us at all that as the proprietary model makers – OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are the biggies – continue their rise and intensify their competition that not only is Meta Platforms considering a shift to closed models dubbed Avocado – the open source Llama 4 models are toast, after all – but that Nvidia is doubling down on its Nemotron open source models.

It’s very simple. Nvidia can get AI clusters of any scale it needs to do AI training at cost, and given its hugely profitable AI hardware business, Nvidia is the only one that can afford to give its models away for free and charge very little for its AI Enterprise software stack that has libraries to support all kinds of AI and HPC models. (It is $4,500 per GPU per year, which is relatively cheap against a GPU accelerator that costs maybe $35,000 to $45,000 depending on volume and model in the “Blackwell” series.)

In a sense, this is a return to the way hardware and software were sold during the early days of IBM’s System/360 mainframe, which broadened the use of computation and data storage in the second wave of computer commercialization six decades ago. Back then, you bought a very expensive mainframe system and it came with a team of blue-suited techies that would help you program it for free. Over the years, companies took control of developing their own application software or went to third parties for it, and Big Blue turned customer service into a profit center through its Global Services behemoth.

This will ultimately, we think, be Nvidia’s trajectory as it goes for full stack integration, including datacenters, and vertical integration from the chip up through the highest levels of the software stack. Nvidia could even end up being an AI utility in its own right. (Utility is a much better word than cloud, which is a vague term and intentionally so.)

Nvidia is not new to open source AI models, and obviously has been involved in running just about every open source AI model ever created as well as the closed ones that have become household names such as Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and OpenAI GPT. In a prebriefing ahead of the Nemotron 3 unveiling, Kari Briski, vice president of generative AI software for enterprise at Nvidia, said that in the past two and a half years, somewhere around 350 million open source AI frameworks and models have been downloaded, that the Hugging Face repository has over 2.8 million open models with every kind of variation under the sun to create a model for specific use cases, and that around 60 percent of companies are using open source AI models and tools. Briski added that in 2025 Nvidia was the largest contributor for open source stuff on Hugging Face, with 650 open models and 250 open datasets set free.

Nvidia got its start with homegrown transformer models with Megatron-LM, announced in 2019. Megatron-LM could train against 8 billion parameters, and do so across 512 GPU accelerators (using eight-way GPU nodes for model parallelism and 64 of these nodes for data parallelism). Megatron was expanded to 530 billion parameters through a collaboration with Microsoft in 2021 with Megatron-Turing NLG. The Neural Modules, or NeMo for short, toolkit was put out at the same time as the original Megatron-LM model, and the Nemotron models were built using this toolkit and its related libraries.

The original Nemotron models were called Nemotron-4 just to confuse us all, and they came out in June 2024 and spanned 340 billion parameters. With the Nemotron 1 models, Nvidia mashed up the Llama 3.1 foundation models with Nemotron reasoning techniques to create Llama Nemotron, spanning 8B, 49B, 70B, and 235B parameter scales.

With Nemotron 2 Nano, which came out earlier this year and which has variants with 9 billion and 12 billion parameters, Nvidia takes the transformer approach pioneered by Google in June 2017 and brought to fruition with its BERT model back in October 2018 and interleaves it with the Mamba selective state space approach developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon and Princeton University. The former is good at extracting features and dependencies from a lot of data, and the latter is very good at zeroing in on smaller subsets of data and their dependencies.

With Nemotron 3, which was unveiled this week, Nvidia is creating a hybrid mixture of expert (MoE) architecture designed to drive multi-agent systems that builds on this hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture. The result, says Briski, is increased reasoning efficiency thanks to the hybrid architecture.

“The hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture runs several times faster with less memory because it avoids these huge attention maps and key-value caches for every single token,” Briski explained. “So that architecture really reduces that memory footprint, which allows you to have more experts. We are going to introduce in the Super and Ultra versions a breakthrough called latent mixture of experts. All of these experts that are in your model share a common core and keep only a small part private. So it is kind of like chefs sharing one big kitchen, but they get to use their own spice rack. So there you are going to get even more memory efficiency with Super and Ultra through this latent MOE.”

The Nemotron 3 family has three members at the moment, two of which Briski mentioned by name there.

The Nemotron 3 family could very likely expand to larger and smaller models over time. Like other MoE models, there is an aggregate of parameters that the model is trained on and then a smaller subset of parameters that can be activated as it is being fine-tuned or doing inference. Nemotron 3 Nano has 30 billion parameters, with 3 billion activated at any time and is designed specifically so it can fit on a single Nvidia L40S GPU inference accelerator. The Super variant has 100 billion parameters, with up to 10 billion activated at once, and the Ultra version has 500 billion parameters with 50 billion activated at any given time.

Briski said that the fine tuning of the model is different between Nemotron 2 Nano and the Nemotron 3 models. Nemotron 2 Nano had a lot of supervised learning – meaning people correcting the model’s output and feeding that back into the model – and a dash of reinforcement learning – the model teaches itself as it is used, but Nemotron 3 has a lot of reinforcement learning. The Nemotron 3 model relies heavily on reinforcement learning and also adds a context window of up to 1 million tokens.

There is a technical blog from Nvidia here that explains some of the finer points of the Nemotron 3 models, but the gist is that Mamba cuts down on memory use while capturing long-range dependencies, the transformer layers have attention algorithms that handle complex planning and reasoning, and the MoE approach allows for a model to be effectively large but only activated where necessary (an approach that Google invented with its PaLM models that came into the field after BERT).

The latent MoE feature coming in the Super and Ultra versions allows an intermediary representation layer to be added between model layers that can be shared as token processing is performed, which allows 4X the number of experts to called while delivering the same inference performance. More experts leads to better answers and more intelligence. Nemotron 3 has multi-token prediction, a kind of speculative execution for AI models, and Super and Ultra variants have been pretrained in Nvidia’s NVFP4 4-bit data precision to boost effective throughput on inference. This training was done on a 25 trillion token pretraining dataset. (It is not clear that Nvidia is opening dataset this up to everyone – or that it even can.)

So how does Nemotron 3 stack up? Let’s go to Artificial Analysis, which is the AI benchmark for the moment. So far, only Nemotron 3 Nano 30B/3B is available, and here is how it rates in terms of output tokens per second for inference workloads:

This is a big performance boost compared to Nemotron 2 models. Not activating the whole model clearly helps with MoEs, which is kinda the design spec.

Here is how Nemotron 3 Nano 30B/3B compares when you plot out model accuracy (intelligence, on the Y axis) against token throughput (X axis):

You want to be up and to the right on this chart.

And finally, here is how Nemotron 3 Nano compares with the Openness Index – how open your model is – plotted on the Y axis against intelligence (correctness of answers) on the X axis:

It will be interesting to see if Nemotron 3 models can get technical support subscriptions from Nvidia either as part of the AI Enterprise stack or separately. If Nvidia offers support, it doesn’t have to charge a lot but only enough to cover its model development costs to undercut the increasingly closed AI model makers.",http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/nvidia-nemotron-logo.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:03:57.337181
ID6,Barclays,2025-12-17 06:03:12+00:00,DeSmog,How a Big Oil PR Firm Helped Top UK Cultural Institutions Defend Their Fossil Fuel Sponsorships,"Ellen Ormesher&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kathryn Clare, Ellen Ormesher, Kathryn Clare",,,,,https://www.desmog.com/2025/12/16/how-a-big-oil-pr-firm-helped-top-uk-cultural-institutions-defend-their-fossil-fuel-sponsorships/,"‘Dance Matters’ With more than 1,360 staff working across 27 global offices, Brunswick Group is one of the UK’s largest PR firms.
Brunswick Group has worked with more than 52 oil and gas companies since 2001, according to DeSmog research, including during some of the industry’s worst crises.
“Our dealings with Sadler’s Wells throughout this period have been defined by total stonewalling,” said a spokesperson from Cultural Workers Against Genocide.
Fresh demonstrations, organised by the campaign group Fossil Free London, erupted at the theatre group’s flagship venue in Islington just a few weeks later.
Vice-President Louise Charlton, who co-founded Brunswick Group in 1987, is a trustee of the National Theatre.","Sadler’s Wells, a top performing arts theatre in London, hired one of the United Kingdom’s biggest public relations agencies — and one with close ties to the oil industry — to help it defend a sponsorship deal with Barclays.

Brunswick Group — whose clients have included oil giants BP, Shell, and Aramco, as well as Barclays, a major financier of fossil fuel development — drafted a May 23 letter to the Financial Times defending corporate sponsorships of the arts, and signed by Sadler’s Wells and 10 other leading UK cultural institutions, according to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests filed by campaign group Culture Unstained and shared with DeSmog.

The letter was part of broader efforts by a group of high-profile theatres, museums, and galleries scrambling to respond to protests, open letters, and artist boycotts over sponsorship deals that critics accuse of disguising corporate complicity in the climate crisis and Israeli military operations in Gaza.

“A fossil fuel PR firm, Brunswick Group, is being commissioned by a publicly funded arts institution, Sadler’s Wells, to defend the theatre’s partnership with Barclays, the UK’s biggest climate-wrecking bank, which is also named by the United Nations as complicit in the genocide of Palestinians,” said Isobel Tarr, co-director of Culture Unstained.

Sadler’s Wells income of £41.8 million for the year ending 31 March 2024, the most recent information available in the UK Register of Charities, included about £4.6 million from nine government grants.

“By drawing other arts institutions into a defensive communication strategy which Brunswick Group themselves designed and delivered, it has manufactured a polarising narrative of ‘protestors versus the arts’ which is not remotely representative of the views held across the sector,” Tarr added.

Brunswick Group said it was “proud” to support the role of corporate sponsorships in the arts.

“These partnerships facilitate the widest possible access to cultural institutions and experiences, and we were happy to help co-ordinate this letter on behalf of a number of arts institutions,” said a Brunswick Group spokesperson. “The letter was not specific to any particular sector of business but making a vital point about the crucial role corporate partnerships play in supporting the UK’s cultural institutions.”

Sadler’s Wells did not respond to a request for comment.

Arts and Culture, Arms and Oil

Between 2016 and 2021, Barclays provided £124 billion ($167 billion) in financing to the fossil fuel industry, more than any other European lender, according to analysis by Reclaim Finance. By comparison, Barclays told the Guardian in 2024 that “it had supported the UK music and arts sector with £112 million over the past 20 years” (the equivalent of $164 million in 2025).

Barclays was also among the financial institutions underwriting Israeli government bonds funding military operations in Gaza, according to a United Nations report. In September, a U.N. commission found that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians.

Against a backdrop of growing protests urging Sadler’s Wells to cut ties with the bank, Brunswick Group began developing an 18-24 month communications strategy in November 2024, according to a Brunswick presentation to Sadler’s Wells leadership obtained through the freedom of information requests filed by Culture Unstained.

The group is part of a growing movement calling on museums, festivals, and other cultural institutions to cut funding ties with fossil fuel companies and their financiers.

Oil and gas companies use cultural sponsorships to maintain what the industry calls its “social license to operate” — enough public support to continue business as usual — despite the evidence that the industry has misled the public about climate change for decades while lobbying against climate action.

A Sadler’s Wells employee, who declined to be named for fear of professional repercussions, said Brunswick Group had drafted the May letter to the Financial Times “as though it represented the views of the organisation as a whole.

“But it does not represent the way I feel, or how a lot of staff in the organisation feel.”

The employee described an “atmosphere of silence” inside the theatre surrounding the Barclays partnership. “There has been virtually zero communication on this issue in the last two years.”

Many members of staff were angry, the employee said, that Nigel Higgins — who serves as both chairman of Barclays and chair of the Sadler’s Wells board of trustees — had been present at a staff listening session on the issue in October 2024. During the meeting, “some members of staff really spoke out and gave their thoughts. After that it was silent… It felt like a tick-box exercise to appease staff,” the employee said.

An employee of the Science Museum, who also asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional repercussions, said the letter was “universally ridiculed” by museum staff in private group chats. “It has been mentioned fairly regularly as an example of the divergence felt between workers, particularly among the lower grades, and the Science Museum’s leaders and directors,” the employee said.

The employee added that many staff remain opposed to the Science Museum’s partnerships with Indian conglomerate Adani Group, the world’s largest privately owned coal producer, and BP. BP supplies oil used by the Israeli military through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, according to the U.N. report.

Activists protested outside BP’s London headquarters ahead of its annual general meeting in April, holding banners reading “BP funds war crimes” and “Stop fuelling genocide and climate breakdown.”

“People are not really able to feel a lot of pride or joy in the work they do, because it just seems to be clouded by the really dire and unethical relationships which are sustained by the museum itself,” said the Science Museum employee.

The Science Musuem did not respond to a request for comment.

‘Dance Matters’

With more than 1,360 staff working across 27 global offices, Brunswick Group is one of the UK’s largest PR firms. Its clients include a quarter of FTSE100 companies, according to the company’s website.

After Shell admitted in 2004 to overstating its oil and gas reserves by 20 percent, it hired Brunswick Group to help defend its reputation in the ensuing scandal. Three of Shell’s top executives resigned in the wake of the revelation, which caused Shell’s shares to plunge 10 percent on the day the news was made public, and led to a $120 million fine from regulators in the United States.

In 2010, BP used Brunswick Group to help it grapple with the public backlash to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 and injured 17 workers, and spilled an estimated 4.9 million barrels (210 million gallons) of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

Sadler’s Wells had faced pressure over its Barclays partnership in the years before Brunswick Group developed its communications strategy.

In 2021, a campaign led by the actor Sir Mark Rylance published an open letter calling on Sadler’s Wells to drop its Barclays sponsorship over the bank’s financing of fossil fuel extraction. The Standard reported at the time that the theatre had a deal with the bank to offer “The Barclays Dance Pass scheme, which funds £10 ($13) tickets for up to 10,000 young people aged 16 to 30 a year.”

In August 2023, five climate activists from Fossil Free London ran on stage during a ballet performance of Romeo and Juliet, unfurling a banner that read “Drop Barclays Sponsorship.” Three months later, in November, a group made up of arts industry employees called Cultural Workers Against Genocide published a letter with more than 700 signatories — including dancers, performers, writers, and artistic directors — accusing Barclays of investing in Israeli arms firms and calling for dialogue with Sadler’s Wells management.

In January 2024, protestors from Cultural Workers Against Genocide disrupted a ballet performance of Edward Scissorhands at Sadler’s Wells theatre in Islington over the theatre’s ties to Barclays.

“Our dealings with Sadler’s Wells throughout this period have been defined by total stonewalling,” said a spokesperson from Cultural Workers Against Genocide. “They have refused to meaningfully engage with us in any form, despite thousands of artists, workers and audience members calling on them to reconsider their relationship with Barclays. For two years, those voices have been ignored.”

In September 2024, more than 1,000 artists and Islington residents, including actors Maxine Peake and Juliet Stevenson, and MP Jeremy Corbyn, signed an open letter demanding the theatre end its relationship with Barclays due to the bank’s investments in companies whose weapons and military technologies have been used against Palestinians.

Two prominent Irish choreographers, Oona Doherty and Michael Keegan-Dolan, also took a stand that month against the Barclays sponsorship by leaving their positions as associate artists at Sadler’s Wells, citing the bank’s financing of fossil fuel and arms companies.

In its November 2024 presentation, Brunswick Group suggested that Sadler’s Wells adopt a core message: “Dance Matters.” The brief diagrammed several issues that Sadler’s Wells could use in public engagement, such as “culture as a driver for the economy” — language that would appear in the May 2025 Financial Times letter.

“Ethical funding”, “culture as a target for activism”, and “government culture policy” were all greyed out — marking them as issues that Sadler’s Wells should avoid.

Fresh demonstrations, organised by the campaign group Fossil Free London, erupted at the theatre group’s flagship venue in Islington just a few weeks later. During performances of the ballet Swan Lake in December and January, protestors dressed in white tutus doused themselves in fake oil while holding banners that read “Cut Ties with Barclays.”

According to emails exchanged by trustees of the National Gallery and Brunswick staff between March and May 2025, Brunswick Group drafted the letter to the Financial Times defending corporate sponsorships and helped Sadler’s Wells to recruit the 10 other major arts and culture organisations in signing on. “The idea is to find a good moment to publish this in a national title, such as the Times, with a view to landing this in May — pending signatories and the right hook” said a 19 March email from a Brunswick Group employee to National Gallery trustee Tonya Nelson and Sadler’s Wells co-CEO Sir Alastair Spalding.

According to a 14 May Brunswick Group document forwarded to Victoria and Albert Museum Director Tristram Hunt by Sir Alistair Spalding, the publication date of the letter in Financial Times letters page was intended to mark the one-year anniversary of the Edinburgh International Festival’s decision to end its 20-year funding partnership with Baillie Gifford, a Scottish fund manager with investments in fossil fuels and arms manufacturers, following pressure from authors and other working in the publishing industry.

Baillie Gifford subsequently withdrew its support from several other literary festivals — moves that sent shockwaves through the culture industry by showing how vulnerable sponsorships could be to activist pressure.

Internal fossil fuel company documents unearthed by a United States Congressional investigation, and analysed by DeSmog show that BP, Shell, and other oil and gas companies have used sponsorships explicitly to protect against “external threats” such as “the policy and politics of climate change.”

These documents underscore the role of public relations companies — which often broker such sponsorships as part of a wide range of lobbying and reputation management services on behalf of the fossil fuel industry — in delaying climate action.

At a world leaders’ meeting ahead of the COP30 climate negotiations in Brazil last month, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warned that corporations were making record profits from climate devastation, “with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress.”

“Fossil fuel giants keep exploiting the needs of underfunded cultural institutions to try to save their reputations, bolstered by big PR firms,” said Sian Berry, Green Party peer and co-leader. “Hard-working campaigners have already persuaded many institutions to divest from these companies, but it must now be the responsibility of Government to kick fossil fuels out of the arts with a tobacco-style ban on advertising and sponsorship.”

Amid protest actions at many prominent venues, several institutions have ended fossil fuel partnerships, among them the National Portrait Gallery, Royal Shakespeare Company, and Scottish Ballet.

The Science Museum ended a sponsorship deal with Equinor in 2024 due to the Norwegian oil giant’s failure to lower carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goal of limited global warming to 1.5C — though the museum continues to receive money from BP.

In November 2025, the Museums Association — a membership organisation representing more than 7,000 individual members and 500 institutions — voted overwhelmingly in favour of a new code of ethics that recommends museums transition away from sponsorships by organisations involved with “environmental harm (including fossil fuels), human rights abuses, and other sponsorship that does not align with the values of the museum.”

DeSmog contacted the 10 additional institutions that signed the May letter organised by Brunswick Group. The British Museum responded to say: “The Museum, like our peers, benefits from a blend of public and private funding and, as a public body, has an obligation to ensure the long-term financial stability of the Museum. Both are essential for this stability and to keeping our doors open to everyone, free of charge, preserving the extraordinary collection in our care for centuries to come.”

The British Museum also referred DeSmog to a March Financial Times opinion essay in which director Nicholas Cullinan warned that the activists’ demands were forcing some organisations to scale back on programming. Cullinan raised concerns that institutions like the British Museum would have to introduce entry fees if they dropped corporate sponsorships — creating barriers to access for families with lower incomes.

“I fear that if we allow the debate to become too pious, in particular around the question of corporate sponsorship, it will be audiences, visitors and future generations who will ultimately pay the price,” Cullinan wrote. “What replaces that money? Who fills those gaps? If [protesters] have no answers, then their claim to be concerned about the future of the arts and culture will ring hollow.”

‘Risks and Reputation’

By early 2025, Arts Council England, a government body that distributes nearly £500 million of public arts funding annually, was already engaging with cultural organisations about the mounting activist pressure over sponsorships.

On 20 March, Tonya Nelson, executive director of enterprise and innovation at Arts Council England emailed Gabriele Finaldi, director of the National Gallery, to ask if he wanted to sign the letter drafted by Brunswick Group. “As you know, many arts and culture organisations are facing demands to refuse donations from corporations linked to certain political issues/events. Sadler’s Wells is leading an effort for a collective statement regarding the need to maintain corporate sponsorship” Nelson wrote, noting the British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, and National Theatre had already agreed to sign.

A spokesperson for Arts Council England said the organisation does not work with Brunswick Group, and that Nelson had shared the letter with the National Gallery in her capacity as a trustee. Arts Council England does not fund the National Gallery, the spokesperson added.

On March 24, Arts Council England hosted a “Risks and Reputation” round table at Sadler’s Wells, documents obtained via the FOIA request showed.

The meeting, chaired by Arts Council England chair and former Tate director Nicholas Serota, brought together leaders from 28 institutions across the UK — eight of whom would go on to sign the letter to the Financial Times two months later.

Minutes of the meeting revealed that participants discussing mounting “a bold, positive joint campaign” aimed at “raising awareness of the public value in private sector funding,” noting that “Government, and funders such as ACE [Arts Council England], endorsing this message will be both welcome and important.”

Representatives of the institutions expressed concerns over “misinformation” spread by activists, and noted that “the PR advice in general has been to avoid giving oxygen to the issues of protest and for arts organisations to stay silent in response. However, there is recognition that this simply doesn’t work in the current context, nor when organisations are dealing with the immediacy of stories being spread

through social media.”

Participants in the roundtable reflected that they had “maybe made missteps in making public statements in certain areas, e.g. Black Lives Matter/Ukraine I.e. in commenting on some issues in the public domain, it has created expectations that this will be the case in other areas, such as Israel/Gaza. This has created a lack of clarity about the role and stance of the arts organisation.”

The spokesperson for Arts Council England said that the boards and leadership teams of the organisations it supports are solely responsible for the selection of additional funders and types of funding. “These decisions can be complex and challenging, especially when audiences, artists, staff or wider stakeholders have strong views about sponsorship and private giving,” the spokesperson said. “While it is for each organisation to weigh up their choices, the Arts Council believes that corporate giving and philanthropic support play an important role in the funding ecology of the cultural sector, and we support organisations that draw on this potential source of revenue. We are here to share research, to encourage open discussion, and to support leaders as they navigate these decisions,” they said.

After the March round table, Brunswick Group staff (whose names and job titles were redacted in the FOIA responses) liaised directly via email with senior museum directors over the letter to the Financial Times, including the National Gallery’s Finaldi, and Science Museum Director Ian Blatchford.

The letter appeared in the Financial Times under the title, “One year on from the Baillie Gifford arts sponsorship boycott.” It argued that “[O]ur museums, theatres, festivals and artists need to operate within the economic structures in which society operates…we must find a way to show that cultural organisations contribute to a better world, and partnership with business and philanthropy is an admirable and valuable part of that mission.”

The letter referenced Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy’s warning in a February 2025 speech that “moral puritanism” towards corporate funding risks “killing off” arts and culture.

Nandy’s Department for Media, Culture and Sport funds several of the letter’s signatories, including the British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, National Gallery, and Science Museum Group. (Arts Council England does not fund the National Gallery, British Museum, or Victoria and Albert Museum).

From Oil Rigs to Old Masters

Beyond Brunswick Group’s extensive work for oil and gas clients, senior staff at the firm also have a network of ties to the arts industry.

Caroline Daniel, a partner at Brunswick Group, sits on the board of the Baillie Gifford Prize. Daniel also spent 17 years at the Financial Times, according to her profile on Brunswick Group’s website, including six as editor of the FT Weekend, which carries the majority of the paper’s coverage of arts and culture.

At least three Brunswick Group executives have held board positions at institutions that signed the letter to the Financial Times, and Brunswick Group has provided consulting services to at least four of the signatories.

David Lasserson heads Brunswick Arts, a division specializing in public relations, reputation management, and “maximising sponsorship” of arts and culture organizations, according to the company’s website. Lasserson has worked with the British Museum, the National Theatre, and the Southbank Centre, an arts venue in London, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Charlotte Sidwell, a director at Brunswick Group, has worked with the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, according to her employee profile on Brunswick Group’s website, as well as the East Bank — a cultural hub that opened in Stratford in January this year that is home to Sadler’s Wells’ new 550-seat theatre. Vice-President Louise Charlton, who co-founded Brunswick Group in 1987, is a trustee of the National Theatre.

Susan Gilchrist, Brunswick Group’s chair of global clients, is a former chair of the Southbank Centre, and also served as a trustee of London’s Old Vic theatre.

Patrick Handley co-heads Brunswick’s Energy and Resources team, which works directly with oil and gas clients. According to Handley’s LinkedIn profile, his clients include BP — Handley led Brunswick Group’s London crisis communications for BP during the Deepwater Horizon disaster, according to the Telegraph. He “often works with Brunswick Arts on prominent theatre, museum and art gallery assignments,” according to the firm’s website.

“The revelation that Sadler’s Wells has now turned to Brunswick, a PR firm known for rehabilitating the public image of fossil fuel giants like BP, is sadly not surprising. What is shocking is hearing a publicly funded arts institution adopt the same crisis-communications playbook and corporate language as Barclays and BP,” said the spokesperson for Cultural Workers Against Genocide.

“At this point,” they said, “we must ask ourselves, when did our cultural spaces stop being publicly held places of collective imagination, solidarity and courage, and become corporate vehicles defending the interests of financiers implicated in mass violence?”",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/23.03.2024_Andrea-Domeniconi_NZ6_1689-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 02:02:23.382244

Do you think there's more to the story for International Business Machines?","If you are wondering whether International Business Machines is still a value play after its big run up, or if you would just be buying into yesterday's story, this breakdown is designed to cut through the noise for you.

Even after a slight pullback of 2.4% over the last week and a modest 0.8% dip over the past month, IBM is still up 37.8% year to date and 35.8% over the last year, with gains of 139.4% over 3 years and 215.8% over 5 years.

Behind these moves, IBM has been in the headlines for its continued push into hybrid cloud and AI driven software, alongside ongoing portfolio reshaping and strategic partnerships that aim to reposition the company as a higher growth, higher margin platform rather than an old line hardware giant. Together, these developments have influenced how the market views IBM's long term relevance and risk profile, which is important context for judging whether today's price still makes sense.

On our valuation checks, IBM scores a , suggesting that on traditional metrics the stock does not appear broadly undervalued. Next we will unpack how different valuation methods interpret that score and then finish with a more nuanced way to think about what IBM may be worth.

International Business Machines scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the .

Approach 1: International Business Machines Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company is worth today by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those cash flows back into present value.

For International Business Machines, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $11.7 billion, and analysts expect this to rise steadily as the business leans further into hybrid cloud and AI software. Under Simply Wall St’s two stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, forecast cash flows grow to roughly $23.0 billion by 2035, with analyst estimates guiding the next few years and later years extrapolated from those trends.

Bringing all of those projected cash flows back to today, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of roughly $282.40 per share. With the DCF implying the stock is about 7.4% above its fair value, IBM screens as slightly overvalued on this measure, but not by a wide margin.

Result: ABOUT RIGHT

International Business Machines is fairly valued according to our , but this can change at a moment's notice. Track the value in your or and be alerted on when to act.

Approach 2: International Business Machines Price vs Earnings

For profitable, established companies like International Business Machines, the Price to Earnings, or PE, ratio is a useful shorthand for how much investors are willing to pay today for each dollar of current earnings. It captures not only what the business is earning now, but also how the market feels about its future.

In practice, higher expected growth and lower perceived risk usually justify a higher, or more generous, PE multiple, while slower growth or higher risk tend to cap what investors will pay. IBM currently trades on a PE of about 35.8x, which is above both the broader IT industry average of roughly 29.8x and the selected peer group at around 22.2x. This implies the market is assigning IBM a premium versus many of its rivals.

Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what PE multiple would be reasonable for IBM after factoring in its earnings growth outlook, profitability, industry, market value and risk profile. For IBM, that Fair Ratio sits around 39.3x, which is higher than the current market multiple. On this basis, while IBM looks expensive relative to peers, it still trades at a discount to what its fundamentals might justify.

Result: UNDERVALUED

PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your International Business Machines Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to attach your story about International Business Machines to the numbers behind its future revenue, earnings and margins.

A Narrative is your structured view of the company. It is where you spell out how you think IBM’s hybrid cloud, AI and quantum strategy will play out, link that story to a financial forecast, and then arrive at your own Fair Value instead of relying only on static ratios.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives as an accessible tool to decide when to buy or sell by comparing their Narrative based Fair Value to the current share price and seeing whether IBM looks attractively priced or stretched.

Because Narratives are updated dynamically as new news, earnings releases and estimates come in, your fair value view can automatically adjust when IBM announces, for example, a major AI win or a disappointing quarter.

For IBM today, one investor might build a bullish Narrative that assumes a Fair Value near $350 per share, while a more cautious investor could land closer to $198, and both perspectives can coexist transparently on the platform.

For International Business Machines, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading International Business Machines Narratives:

🐂 International Business Machines Bull Case

Fair Value: $350.00

Implied Upside vs Last Close: approximately 13.4% above $303.18

Revenue Growth Assumption: 6.14%

Assumes IBM can capture outsized digital transformation budgets in regulated sectors through hybrid cloud, AI and modernization, supporting structurally higher growth and margins.

Views the integration of Red Hat, HashiCorp and DataStax, plus quantum and automation innovation, as catalysts for a richer mix of high margin recurring software and stronger free cash flow.

Accepts meaningful risks from legacy revenue decline, intense competition, open source disruption, talent constraints and elevated debt, but believes execution can still justify a premium valuation.

🐻 International Business Machines Bear Case

Fair Value: about $293.89

Revenue Growth Assumption: 5.16%

Sees hybrid cloud, AI and acquisitions as solid but not transformational drivers, supporting mid single digit growth and margin improvement rather than a step change in performance.

Highlights macro uncertainty, government and consulting exposure, and sensitivity of consumption based software to slowdowns as key constraints on upside.

Concludes that with the share price already close to consensus fair value, IBM offers a more balanced risk reward profile unless growth or quantum monetization materially exceeds current expectations.

The MyoVista wavECG device is designed to provide conventional ECG functionality while serving as a platform capable of hosting AI-ECG algorithm(s). Following the recent publication of updated American Society of Echocardiography guidelines for the assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction, including revised age-based thresholds for cardiac relaxation (e’), the company elected to separate the FDA submissions for the MyoVista wavECG device and its impaired cardiac relaxation AI-ECG software algorithm. This allows the company to complete additional development and validation work required to update the AI-ECG algorithm to align with the new clinical standards, while advancing the regulatory review of the device independently.

Publicis Australia has been named as the global creative agency for Contiki.

Havas and Publicis Australia were selected from several agencies to join TTC’s primary agency roster, managed through the AAR Group.

Growth in 2025 was driven by: Product innovation, particularly in private credit, real estate, venture debt, and capital markets capabilities.
On the macro front, Lighthouse Canton assesses risks as balanced between slowing growth/labour markets and tariff-led inflationary pressures.
Lighthouse Canton has positioned itself at the forefront of embracing AI’s power to enhance analytical capabilities and operational efficiency while ensuring data privacy through enterprise-level solutions.
Throughout this turbulence, Lighthouse Canton remained anchored to its long-term strategy and ultimately emerged as a net beneficiary of the industry reset.","Q1: How did the business perform in 2025, and what drove its growth over the past year? How has the cost-income ratio trended this year, and what were the key factors influencing it? Looking ahead, what are your main priorities and strategic plans for 2026?

Lighthouse Canton delivered a milestone year in 2025, surpassing US$5 billion in assets under management and securing a transformational US$40 million strategic investment from Peak XV Partners, the firm’s first external capital raise in a decade. This endorsement validated Lighthouse Canton’s evolution from a high-growth independent Asian wealth manager into a fully institutional, multi-asset investment firm with global ambition.

Growth in 2025 was driven by:

Product innovation, particularly in private credit, real estate, venture debt, and capital markets capabilities.

Digital transformation, with substantial enhancements to the LC Vantage platform and enterprise-grade analytics.

Strategic talent acquisition, strengthening global leadership across wealth, asset management, and key client solutions.

Resilient client asset growth, supported by strong account acquisition despite global market volatility.

The cost-income ratio reflected planned investment in technology and headcount, positioning the firm to scale efficiently as it targets its next phase of growth.

Backed by Peak XV funding, Lighthouse Canton is entering its next decade with a bold vision: “10 Years Strong, 10x Ahead.”

Our strategic priorities for 2026 include:

Doubling AUM to US$10 billion by 2027, supported by deeper institutional partnerships and differentiated alternatives capabilities.

Doubling headcount to over 400 professionals, ensuring institutional-grade delivery across front, middle, and back office.

Accelerated AI integration, enhancing speed across the board, specifically around product development and operational efficiency.

Deepening geographic expansion in Singapore, India, the UAE, and the UK, with targeted entry into new high-growth markets.

Strengthened governance and risk frameworks, aligned with evolving global regulatory expectations.

Q2: Looking at the investment outlook for 2026, which markets and asset classes are you prioritising for client portfolios to capture opportunities while managing risks? How are clients currently allocating their portfolios, and what trends are you seeing in DPM adoption and investment behaviour?

Markets are currently focused on two main issues: the macro environment with implications for the pace and size of monetary easing, and concerns around an AI bubble.

On the macro front, Lighthouse Canton assesses risks as balanced between slowing growth/labour markets and tariff-led inflationary pressures. This balanced risk view leads to expectations that interest rates will ease but not significantly unless the macro environment deteriorates substantially.

Regarding AI bubble concerns, while acknowledging market exuberance exists, we believe it’s premature to declare it completely irrational. We recognise AI’s genuine transformative power while remaining vigilant about potential over-investment and capital misallocation that could eventually become detrimental to investment returns.

While we expect volatility, we also see it as premature to call an end to this “bubble”. From an investment advice perspective, we remain growth-biased but manage risks dynamically based on fundamental and price signals.

Q3: With artificial intelligence increasingly shaping the wealth industry, how has the firm leveraged technology and AI to transform processes and enhance value for both clients and the back office? What key technology upgrades were introduced in 2025, and what are your digital priorities for 2026 and beyond?

Lighthouse Canton has positioned itself at the forefront of embracing AI’s power to enhance analytical capabilities and operational efficiency while ensuring data privacy through enterprise-level solutions.

Within the investment team, AI has been leveraged substantially across three critical dimensions: delivering an expanded coverage footprint, accelerating speed-to-market on cutting-edge analysis, and enabling rapid development of new portfolios, especially in systematic alpha strategies.

The team now routinely deploys AI tools for improving visualisations in both internal analytics and external client communications, transforming how investment insights are generated, analysed, and presented. This investment-focused AI adoption complements the firm’s broader technology infrastructure built on the proprietary LC Vantage platform, launched in 2023 and continuously enhanced through 2025 as a full-stack digital private banking solution providing access to 50+ global markets in 20+ currencies across 14+ asset sub-classes.

Lighthouse Canton continues to enhance its technology infrastructure through strategic partnerships with leading global institutional custodians and platforms. The firm’s integration with BNY Mellon Pershing provides segregated custody with US$1 billion investor protection, positioning Lighthouse Canton as “the only Asian non-bank financial institution with this level of integration.” Complementing this, the partnership with Clearstream delivers institutional-grade custody and settlement capabilities across global markets.

Q4: The private banking industry saw a plethora of leadership and structural changes in 2025. Looking into 2026, what are your key priorities for attracting and retaining talent across the front, middle, and back office? Are there plans for new hires in key markets

Amid a year marked by widespread leadership turnover, cost rationalisation, and structural shifts across global private banks, 2025 created unprecedented talent dislocation in the sector. Throughout this turbulence, Lighthouse Canton remained anchored to its long-term strategy and ultimately emerged as a net beneficiary of the industry reset.

Our integrated model, combining separate wealth management and asset management businesses within one entrepreneurial organisation with institutional rigour, has become a clear differentiator for senior professionals seeking both stability and a meaningful growth runway.

While traditional private banks are often constrained by legacy structures and pure-play managers lack breadth in client solutions, Lighthouse Canton’s holistic platform empowers talent to engage clients across advisory, discretionary mandates, capital markets, and the full spectrum of alternative investments. This value proposition underpinned the firm’s ability to secure transformational leadership hires from leading global institutions in 2025.

Looking ahead to 2026, Lighthouse Canton’s talent agenda is grounded in the realities of its core markets — Singapore, India, the UAE, and the UK — each with distinct talent dynamics. The firm is advancing a dual-track strategy: continuing to attract seasoned senior professionals from top-tier global banks while simultaneously investing in the next generation of high-potential talent who can grow with the organisation and reinforce its long-term institutional strength.",https://asianprivatebanker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SocialMediaShare_APB_1200x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 11:05:09.480227

Further losses were limited by the continued weakness of the US dollar against a basket of major global currencies.

Markets are awaiting the release of key US labor market data later today, particularly the October jobs report, which had been delayed due to the US government shutdown. The data are expected to provide strong signals about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy path in 2026.

Price Overview

• Silver prices today: Silver fell by 3.0% to $62.17, from an opening level of $64.09, after recording an intraday high of $64.15.

• At Monday’s settlement, silver prices rose by 3.5%, resuming gains that had paused on Friday after reaching an all-time high of $64.66 per ounce.

US Dollar

The US dollar index slipped by around 0.1% on Tuesday, extending losses for a second consecutive session and nearing its lowest level in two months, reflecting continued weakness in the US currency against a basket of global currencies.

The dollar has remained under negative pressure since last week’s Federal Reserve meeting, as the outcome was less hawkish than markets had expected, reviving bets on the continuation of the Fed’s interest rate cutting cycle in 2026.

US Interest Rates

• According to the CME FedWatch Tool, pricing for keeping US interest rates unchanged at the January 2026 meeting currently stands at 73%, while the probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut is priced at 27%.

• Investors are currently pricing in two US rate cuts over the course of next year, while Federal Reserve projections point to a single 25-basis-point cut.

• To reassess these expectations, investors are closely monitoring further US economic data, in addition to comments from Federal Reserve officials.

• The US October jobs report is due later today and is expected to provide strong clues about the pace of growth in the world’s largest economy during the fourth quarter, which was heavily impacted by the longest government shutdown in US history.

Silver Outlook

At Economies.com, we expect that if US data come in less aggressive than market expectations, the likelihood of an earlier US interest rate cut in 2026 will increase, providing further positive momentum for non-yielding assets, led by precious metals such as gold and silver.

Gold prices fell in the European market on Tuesday for the first time in six days, pulling back from their highest levels in two months amid active correction and profit-taking operations, while losses were capped by the continued weakness of the US dollar against a basket of global currencies.

Markets are awaiting later today the release of key US labor market data, especially the October jobs report, which was previously delayed due to the US government shutdown. The report is expected to provide strong signals about the future path of Federal Reserve monetary policy in 2026.

Price Overview

• Gold prices today: Gold declined by about 0.8% to $4,271.67, from an opening level of $4,305.35, after recording a session high of $4,317.90.

• At Monday’s settlement, gold prices rose by 0.15%, marking a fifth consecutive daily gain, and had earlier reached a two-month high at $4,353.59 per ounce during Friday’s trading.

The US Dollar

The US Dollar Index fell by 0.1% on Tuesday, extending its losses for the second consecutive session and nearing a two-month low, reflecting continued weakness in the US currency against a basket of global currencies.

The dollar has remained under pressure since last week’s Federal Reserve meeting, as the outcome was less hawkish than markets had anticipated, reviving bets on the continuation of the federal rate-cut cycle in 2026.

US Interest Rates

• According to the CME FedWatch Tool, pricing for keeping US interest rates unchanged at the January 2026 meeting currently stands at 73%, while the probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut is priced at 27%.

• Investors are currently pricing in two US rate cuts over the course of next year, while Federal Reserve projections point to only one 25-basis-point cut.

• The October US jobs report is due later today, and is expected to offer strong clues about the pace of growth in the world’s largest economy during the fourth quarter, which was heavily affected by the longest government shutdown in US history.

Gold Outlook

Tim Waterer, Chief Market Analyst at KCM Trade, said that the US dollar remains weak, which helps keep gold prices in an upward bias, as markets believe the Federal Reserve may be underestimating the number of potential rate cuts next year.

Waterer added that if labor market data confirms that employment remains a weak spot, gold could benefit, as this would strengthen the case for an early rate cut in 2026.

SPDR Gold Trust

Gold holdings at SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed ETF, fell by 1.43 metric tons on Monday, bringing total holdings down to 1,051.69 metric tons, retreating from 1,053.12 metric tons, which was the highest level since October 20.

The British pound fell in European trading on Tuesday against a basket of global currencies, pulling back from a two-month high against the US dollar, amid relatively active correction and profit-taking, alongside investor reluctance to build new long positions ahead of key UK economic data.

These data are expected to play a decisive role in shaping the Bank of England’s policy decision later this week, with current expectations pointing to a 25-basis-point cut in UK interest rates to a 3.75% range, the lowest level since December 2022, marking the fourth monetary easing step this year.

Price Overview

British pound price today: The pound slipped more than 0.1% against the dollar to $1.3362, from an opening level of $1.3377, after recording an intraday high of $1.3384.

On Monday, the pound posted gains of less than 0.1% against the dollar, resuming its upward move that had paused on Friday due to correction and profit-taking from a two-month high at $1.3438.

UK Interest Rates

Market pricing for a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Bank of England at this week’s meeting remains steady above 90%.

The Bank of England meets on Thursday to discuss appropriate monetary policy in light of recent economic developments in the UK, particularly as concerns over financial stability have eased following the announcement of a relatively moderate autumn budget.

Voting results from the Bank of England’s November meeting, when rates were held unchanged, showed a growing inclination among policymakers toward delivering a fourth easing move this year.

Updated policy guidance and comments from the Bank of England governor are expected to provide strong signals regarding the path of UK interest rates in 2026.

Key Data

To reassess the above expectations, investors are closely watching the release of highly important UK economic data throughout the day, including labor market indicators, alongside other readings covering the performance of key sectors of the economy.

Outlook for the British Pound

At Economies.com, we expect that if UK data come in less hawkish than markets anticipate, expectations for a UK rate cut this week will increase further, adding more downside pressure on the British pound against a basket of global currencies.

The Japanese yen rose in Asian trading on Tuesday against a basket of major and secondary currencies, extending its gains for a second consecutive session against the US dollar and hitting a two-week high, supported by negative pressure on the US currency ahead of the release of US monthly jobs data.

The yen’s advance is also supported by increased demand ahead of the Bank of Japan’s meeting on Thursday and Friday, as markets widely expect a 25-basis-point rate hike, marking the second step of monetary tightening this year.

Price Overview

Japanese yen price today: The US dollar fell 0.35% against the yen to ¥154.70, the lowest level since December 5, from an opening level of ¥155.21, after recording an intraday high of ¥155.24.

The yen ended Monday’s session up 0.4% against the dollar, marking its third gain in the past four days, amid continued unwinding of yen carry trades.

US Dollar

The US dollar index fell about 0.1% on Tuesday, extending losses for a second straight session and approaching a two-month low, reflecting continued weakness in the US currency against a basket of global currencies.

The dollar has remained under pressure since last week’s Federal Reserve meeting, after the outcome was less hawkish than markets had expected, reviving bets on the continuation of the US rate-cut cycle through 2026.

To reassess these expectations, traders are awaiting later today the release of the long-delayed US jobs report for October, which had been postponed due to the federal government shutdown.

Bank of Japan

The Bank of Japan meets on Thursday and Friday to discuss appropriate monetary policy for the world’s fourth-largest economy, amid strong expectations of a 25-basis-point rate hike to a range of 0.75%, the highest level since 2008 during the global financial crisis.

Markets are closely watching Governor Kazuo Ueda’s comments for guidance on the policy outlook for 2026, as expectations grow that the Japanese government may pursue further fiscal expansion, adding complexity to the policy backdrop facing the central bank.

Japanese Interest Rates

Following recent inflation and wage data in Japan, market pricing for a 25-basis-point rate hike at this week’s meeting has stabilized above 90%.

Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda recently struck a more optimistic tone on the Japanese economy, saying the central bank will assess the pros and cons of raising interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting.

Three government officials told Reuters that the Bank of Japan is likely to raise interest rates this December.

Views and Analysis

Analysts at Société Générale said they expect the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates to 1% by July next year, while also anticipating a rate hike when the policy decision is announced on Friday.

They added that once rates reach 1%, the Bank of Japan will enter uncharted territory, making a cautious tightening pace more likely, with gradual 25-basis-point increases and close monitoring of the impact on economic growth and price levels.

OpenAI says the new GPT-Image 1.5 model brings several major improvements: more accurate prompt interpretation, better detail preservation, and significantly faster generation times.

The new model generates images up to four times faster than before, and users can queue up new images while others are still processing. The model is now live for all ChatGPT users and through the API.

OpenAI's app CEO Fidji Simo sees the new image generation as part of a bigger shift: ChatGPT is moving from a reactive, text-based tool toward a ""fully generative UI that brings in the right components based on what you want to do.""

Edits stay more consistent across lighting, composition, and faces

The model also handles image editing differently now. It makes targeted changes without messing up other parts of the image, keeping lighting, composition, and faces more consistent compared to its predecessor. OpenAI says it can handle adding, removing, combining, blending, and transposing image elements.

Use cases include photo editing, virtual try-ons for clothes and hairstyles, and style transformations. OpenAI's demos show things like combining multiple people and a dog from separate photos into one scene, or turning a photo into a movie poster with a golden age Hollywood look.

The model actually follows complex prompts now

The new model is noticeably better at following detailed instructions. In a test with a 6 x 6 grid that needed specific objects in each cell, the new version got the arrangement right, while the old one didn't, OpenAI says. This makes it easier to create images where the placement of elements really matters.

Text rendering is noticeably improved as well. The model can now handle denser, smaller text—so you can get legible snippets of articles, short tables, or infographics with numbers. However, OpenAI admits it still struggles with longer stretches of text, unusual fonts, multiple faces in one image, or producing content in different languages.

We ran our benchmark prompt that requires a detailed, complex, photorealistic scene with an unusual element: a horse riding an astronaut, something the models definitely haven't seen during training. Older models choked on this. But the latest generation, including Flux 2, does much better. The new Image-1.5 performs on par with Google's Nano Banana Pro, and far better than the previous version.

First impressions: the ChatGPT image model produces more intense-looking images compared to Google's Nano Banana Pro. With the same prompt, Nano Banana Pro interprets things more literally and produces a casual photo look rather than a polished photoshoot vibe. That said, this could be a prompting thing.

API prices drop 20 percent despite better performance

Developers can access the model as GPT Image 1.5 through the API. OpenAI says image inputs and outputs are 20 percent cheaper than the previous model. Pricing sits at 8 dollars per million input tokens and 32 dollars per million output tokens for images. Text tokens cost 5 dollars (input) and 10 dollars (output) per million tokens.

We recently shipped the Sora Android app, like a fully new app. We built it in 18 days. It went from zero to launch to employees and then ten days later, so 28 days total. We went to the public and that was done just with the help of Codex. The speed and ambition of working at open AI's are just dramatically more than what I can imagine. I guess it's kind of an embarrassing thing to say because everyone who's a startup founder thinks like, Oh yeah, my startup moves super fast and the talent bar is super high and we're super ambitious. But I have to say it working it openly, I just made me reimagine what that. Means.

On Tuesday, December 16, Adobe announced the public beta of the Firefly video editor, along with prompt-based editing, AI video upscaling, and support for the third-party model FLUX.2 from Black Forest Labs.

Firefly video editor is a browser-based software

Adobe’s online Firefly can now do more than generate. The new Firefly video editor is a web-based video editing software meant to assemble and tweak AI-generated video. Previously, Firefly generated videos in the web app that could be later taken into Premiere Pro, but the update brings prompting and editing into one online workspace.

The Firefly video editor, which is now in public beta, allows creators to combine generated clips using a multi-track timeline, a lightweight version reminiscent of similar tools in software like Premiere Pro.

Users can take advantage of the timeline to edit, or can also use the text editor to shorten, trim, and rearrange interviews and other talking-head videos.

The web-based software also supports exporting in multiple formats, including vertical and widescreen.

Firefly can now edit videos with prompts, rather than regenerating

Previously, if Firefly didn’t get a clip just right, the only option was to try again and regenerate the entire clip. Now, Adobe has introduced prompt-based editing, which allows creators to correct part of a clip without regenerating the entire thing.

Adobe demonstrated using the tool to swap one object out for another, replace the background, or even change the weather, while keeping the rest of the clip intact.

The update also allows users to adjust the “camera,” asking the AI for a wider shot, a bird’s-eye view, or perhaps a closeup.

The updates also give users more control over how the “camera” moves during a clip. Inside the Firefly Video Model, users can upload one image as a reference for the starting point, and another for the end, in order to direct the AI how to move the ""camera"" between those two perspectives.

AI upscaling for video is now available in Boards

Adobe is also adding the ability to upscale videos using AI, a feature that’s done using Topaz Astra. The feature has echoes of the new Photoshop tool to upscale images using Topaz AI, however, the video upscaling is only headed to Firefly Boards for now, not the new Firefly video editor yet.

Adobe says that the AI upscaling in Boards can be used to push a 1080p video to 4K.

Firefly adds FLUX.2 to third-party models

The update also brings another addition to Adobe’s list of supported third-party AI models with the addition of Black Forest Lab’s FLUX.2. FLUX.2 is a photo generator, not an image generator, however, which means the support is rolling out to Firefly Text to Image, Firefly Prompt to Edit, Firefly Boards, and Photoshop’s Generative Fill. (In January, FLUX.2 will also be available in Adobe Express.)

To give users more flexibility to experiment with the new tools, Adobe is giving current Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, and 7,000 credit and 50,00 credit generative AI plans unlimited photo and video generations on the Firefly app until January 15, 2026.

Summary

Adobe (ADBE) trades at a stunningly low forward earnings multiple as compared to software peers, reflecting deep market skepticism despite resilient earnings and sector-leading margins.

ADBE is expected to maintain free cash flow margins close to 40% and is integrating AI quickly, including partnerships with OpenAI and other leading AI models.

AI disruption fears have driven ADBE's valuation to a >50% discount versus software peers, yet its business model and profitability remain incredibly robust.

Buy rating is firmly maintained. I present a clear case on why the current pessimism massively overstates disruption risks; with significant downside already priced in.

Adobe: Seriously, Where Did the Buyers Go To?

It was just less than two years ago that Adobe Inc. (ADBE) mounted what seemed like a breathtaking comeback against all odds, as it recovered from the 2022/23 bear market. It appeared to

Cahillane said Chicago will remain the de facto home base for Kraft Heinz and its successor companies.","Kraft Heinz has named veteran Chicago-based executive Steve Cahillane as CEO beginning Jan. 1, taking the reins of the packaged food giant as it prepares to split into two companies.

Cahillane most recently served as chairman and CEO of Kellanova, the Chicago-based snack foods spinoff from cereal-maker Kellogg, which was acquired by Mars in a $36 billion deal that closed last week.

The announcement Tuesday comes at a pivotal time for Kraft Heinz, and brings in a longtime food industry leader who successfully guided Kellogg through its 2023 spinoff, an experience that will likely come in handy in his new role.

“I’ll take over the entirety of the business and focus on delivering a 2026 operating plan, while at the same time executing the split of the companies, very similar to what I just did at Kellogg,” Cahillane said Tuesday.

Cahillane left Kellanova when the Mars deal closed Thursday. He told the Tribune he is “taking the rest of the year off” before joining Kraft Heinz in January. Current CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera will then step down and transition to an advisory role.

Formed by the 2015 megamerger of Chicago-based Kraft Foods and Pittsburgh-based Heinz, the company, which is co-headquartered in both cities, has struggled to manage its massive portfolio, downsizing amid declining revenues and writing off billions of dollars in valuation.

In September, Kraft Heinz announced a separation plan that will create two publicly traded companies: Global Taste Elevation and North American Grocery, both of which are expected to get new names before the spinoff is completed.

Global Taste Elevation will include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia and Kraft Mac & Cheese, with the majority of sales coming from sauces, spreads and seasonings. North American Grocery’s portfolio will include Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables.

When Kraft Heinz splits into two companies, which is expected in the second half of 2026, Cahillane will stay with Global Taste Elevation and a new CEO will be named for North American Grocery.

Cahillane said he will spend the first two weeks as CEO studying the Kraft Heinz portfolios to determine if any tweaking is needed in the proposed split, with mostly Heinz products allocated to Global Taste Elevation and legacy Kraft brands under the North American Grocery banner.

While both portfolios represent billions in annual sales, Global Taste Elevation — the company Cahillane will helm after the split — has the faster-growing products in recent years.

As Kraft Heinz CEO, Cahillane said he will look to position the entire company for growth ahead of the split.

“The plan and the objective will be to get the entirety of the business growing,” Cahillane said. “That doesn’t mean that every brand can grow. I mean, no consumer goods company has every brand growing all the time, but you have to feed the winners and get the entirety of the company growing profitably.”

The Kraft Heinz split may follow some of the Kellogg blueprint.

Cahillane, 60, a Northwestern graduate and Harvard MBA whose resume includes top executive roles with The Nature’s Bounty and Coca-Cola, joined Michigan-based cereal giant Kellogg as chairman and CEO in 2017.

He engineered the spinoff of the Kellogg’s snacks business in 2023, taking the reins of the new company, Kellanova, and growing its portfolio of brands including Pringles, Cheez-It and Pop-Tarts before selling to Mars.

Meanwhile, the WK Kellogg cereal company was sold to Italian candy giant Ferrero for $3.1 billion in September.

Packaging the packaged food giant Kraft Heinz for sale is not necessarily the goal, Cahillane said.

“That’s not the plan, but as I remind people, and based on my past history, when you’re a public company, you’re for sale every day,” Cahillane said. “My goal is to return the business to organic growth and get the markets to appreciate that these iconic brands indeed have a bright future.”

Of particular interest in Chicago, is where the successor companies to Kraft Heinz call home.

Started as a horse-drawn cheese purveyor in 1903, Kraft has been a Chicago institution for more than a century, rolling out everything from Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Miracle Whip to Kraft Mac & Cheese.

Chicago has remained home through several corporate machinations, including the 2012 split that cleaved off the Mondelez snack foods business from the rest of Kraft.

The 2015 Kraft-Heinz merger made Chicago and Pittsburgh co-headquarters. Kraft Heinz said in September it “has no plans to change its current headquarter locations” after the split, with much of the corporate locus based at the Aon Center in Chicago.

While it has gone through several rounds of downsizing over the years, Kraft Heinz has 2,000 Chicago-area employees between its Aon Center headquarters and a Glenview research and development center, the company said.

Cahillane said Chicago will remain the de facto home base for Kraft Heinz and its successor companies.

“The intention would be the single home being Chicago,” Cahillane said. “When you look at the footprint of the people, it is most predominantly here in Chicago. There’s a much smaller footprint in Pittsburgh. So you can imagine that both those companies would be located in Chicago.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/p-NNsIIlYEy1_PeaYiJUy0eiDUc=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/12/16/6941f0569e699.hires.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 20:00:25.440093

If the final underlier level on the determination date is greater than the initial underlier level (set on the trade date and is expected to be the closing level of the underlier on the trade date), the return on your notes will be positive, subject to the maximum settlement amount (expected to be between $1,175.80 and $1,206.25 for each $1,000 face amount of your notes), and will be calculated in the manner set forth below. If the final underlier level declines by up to 10.00% from the initial underlier level, you will receive the face amount of your notes. If the final underlier level declines by more than 10.00% from the initial underlier level, the return on your notes will be negative.

You could lose your entire investment in the notes. Any payment on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page PS-3 of this pricing supplement) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

To determine your payment at maturity, we will calculate the underlier return, which is the percentage increase or decrease in the final underlier level from the initial underlier level. On the stated maturity date, for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, you will receive an amount in cash equal to:

·if the underlier return is positive (the final underlier level is greater than the initial underlier level), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1,000 times (b) 1.50 times (c) the underlier return, subject to the maximum settlement amount;

·if the underlier return is zero or negative but not below -10.00% (the final underlier level is equal to or less than the initial underlier level but not by more than 10.00%), $1,000; or

·if the underlier return is negative and is below -10.00% (the final underlier level is less than the initial underlier level by more than 10.00%), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1,000 times (b) approximately 1.1111 times (c) the sum of the underlier return plus 10.00% (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Because we have provided only a brief summary of the terms of your notes above, you should read the detailed description of the terms of the notes found in “Summary Information” on page PS-2 in this pricing supplement.

Your investment in the notes involves certain risks, including among other things, our credit risk and the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” beginning on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement so that you may better understand those risks.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the notes will be determined on the date the notes are initially priced for sale to the public (the “trade date”) based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the trade date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the trade date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the notes on the trade date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the notes and our estimated value of the notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

Our estimated value on the trade date is not a prediction of the price at which the notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another

PS- 2

affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the trade date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the initial issue date of the notes because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes and other costs in connection with the notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the notes at any time prior to the trade date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their trade date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the notes may have at law if

PS- 3

and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

KEY TERMS

Underlier: the Nasdaq-100 Index® (Bloomberg ticker symbol, “NDX <Index>”), as published by Nasdaq, Inc.

Specified currency: U.S. dollars (“$”)

Face amount: each note will have a face amount of $1,000; $ in the aggregate for all the notes

Purchase at amount other than face amount: the amount we will pay you at the stated maturity date for your notes will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for your notes, so if you acquire notes at a premium (or discount) to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, it could affect your investment in a number of ways. The return on your investment in such notes will be lower (or higher) than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount. Also, the stated buffer level would not offer the same measure of protection to your investment as would be the case if you had purchased the notes at face amount. Additionally, the cap level would be triggered at a lower (or higher) percentage return than indicated below, relative to your initial investment. See “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Notes Generally—If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected” on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement.

Cash settlement amount (on the stated maturity date): for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, we will pay you on the stated maturity date an amount in cash equal to:

·if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the cap level, the maximum settlement amount;

·if the final underlier level is greater than the initial underlier level but less than the cap level, the sum of (1) $1,000 plus (2) the product of (i) $1,000 times (ii) the upside participation rate times (iii) the underlier return;

·if the final underlier level is equal to or less than the initial underlier level but greater than or equal to the buffer level, $1,000; or

·if the final underlier level is less than the buffer level, the sum of (1) $1,000 plus (2) the product of (i) $1,000 times (ii) the buffer rate times (iii) the sum of the underlier return plus the buffer amount (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Any payment on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC, and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Initial underlier level (to be set on the trade date): , the closing level of the underlier on the trade date

PS- 4

Final underlier level: the closing level of the underlier on the determination date, subject to adjustment in limited circumstances as provided under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement; and subject to market disruption events and non-trading days as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Underlier return: the quotient of (1) the final underlier level minus the initial underlier level divided by (2) the initial underlier level, expressed as a percentage

Upside participation rate: 150.00%

Cap level (to be set on the trade date): expected to be between 111.72% and 113.75% of the initial underlier level

Determination date (to be set on the trade date): a specified date that is expected to be between 17 and 20 months after the trade date, subject to postponement in the event of a market disruption event or non-trading day as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the determination date be postponed by more than five trading days.

Stated maturity date (to be set on the trade date): a specified date that is expected to be the second scheduled business day after the determination date. The maturity date will be postponed if the determination date is postponed due to the occurrence or continuance of a market disruption event or a non-trading day on the determination date. In such a case, the maturity date will be postponed by the same number of business days from but excluding the originally scheduled determination date to and including the actual determination date. The maturity date will also be postponed if that date is not a business day.

In certain circumstances, the closing level of the underlier will be based on the alternate calculation of the underlier described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.

PS- 5

Business day: as defined under “Terms of the Notes—Business Day” on page S-47 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Trading day: notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying prospectus supplement, with respect to the underlier, a day, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion, on which (i) each of the relevant exchanges on which each underlier stock is traded is scheduled to be open for trading and trading is generally conducted on each such relevant exchange; and (ii) the underlier is calculated and published by the underlier sponsor

Use of proceeds and hedging: as described under “Use of Proceeds and Hedging” on page S-115 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Tax consequences: you should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the underlier. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the notes (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the notes. This gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the original issue price. However, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the notes.

ERISA: as described under “Benefit Plan Investor Considerations” on page S-101 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Supplemental plan of distribution: we will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “agent”), and the agent will agree to purchase from us, the face amount of the notes at the price specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The agent will commit to take and pay for all of the notes, if any are taken. The agent proposes initially to offer the notes to the public at the initial issue price set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement, and to certain unaffiliated securities dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of 1.89% of the face amount.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment for the notes on the original issue date, which is more than one business day following the trade date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisor.

We have been advised by Barclays Capital Inc. that it intends to make a market in the notes. However, neither Barclays Capital Inc. nor any of our affiliates that makes a market is obligated to do so and any of them may stop doing so at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity or trading market for the notes.

Calculation agent: Barclays Bank PLC

CUSIP no.: 06746EZF5

ISIN no.: US06746EZF59

Conflicts of interest: Barclays Capital Inc. is an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC and, as such, has a “conflict of interest” in this offering within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. Consequently, the offering is being conducted in compliance with the provisions of Rule 5121. Barclays Capital Inc. is not permitted to sell notes in this offering to an account over which it exercises discretionary authority without the prior specific written approval of the account holder.

FDIC: the notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS OF THE NOTES

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement, if a successor index is selected by the calculation agent as described in that section, the calculation agent may in its sole discretion adjust the initial underlier level, any level derived from the initial underlier level and/or any closing level of that successor index with a view toward offsetting, to the extent practicable, any difference in the relative levels of the original underlier and the successor index at the time the original underlier is replaced by the successor index, but the calculation agent may not adjust any other term of the notes.

The provisions set forth under “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” on page S-51 of the accompanying prospectus supplement are not applicable to the notes.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES

The following table and chart are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the impact that the various hypothetical closing levels on the determination date could have on the cash settlement amount at maturity assuming all other variables remain constant.

The examples below are based on a range of final underlier levels that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the closing level will be on any day throughout the term of your notes, and no one can predict what the final underlier level will be on the determination date. The underlier has been highly volatile in the past—meaning that the closing level has changed considerably in relatively short periods—and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.

The information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the notes assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the face amount and held to the stated maturity date. If you sell your notes in a secondary market prior to the stated maturity date, your return will depend upon the market value of your notes at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the table below, such as interest rates, the volatility of the underlier and our creditworthiness. In addition, assuming no changes in market conditions or our creditworthiness and any other relevant factors, the value of your notes on the trade date will, and the price you may receive for your notes may, be significantly less than the initial issue price. For more information on the value of your notes in the secondary market, see “Risk Factors” on page S-9 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, if Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes” on page PS-17 of this pricing supplement. The information in the table also reflects the key hypothetical terms and assumptions in the following box.

Key Hypothetical Terms and Assumptions Face amount $1,000 Upside participation rate 150.00% Cap level 111.72% of the initial underlier level Maximum settlement amount $1,175.80 Buffer level 90.00% of the initial underlier level Buffer rate approximately 111.11% Buffer amount 10.00% Neither a market disruption event nor a non-trading day occurs on the originally scheduled determination date No change in or affecting any of the underlier stocks or the method by which the underlier sponsor calculates the underlier Notes purchased on original issue date for the initial issue price noted on the cover page of this pricing supplement and held to the stated maturity date

Moreover, we have not yet set the initial underlier level that will serve as the baseline for determining the underlier return and the amount that we will pay on your notes, if any, at maturity. We will not do so until the trade date. As a result, the actual initial underlier level may differ substantially from the closing level of the underlier prior to the trade date.

For these reasons, the actual performance of the underlier over the term of your notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, if any, may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical closing levels of the underlier shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical closing levels of the underlier during recent periods, see “The Underlier—Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier” below. Before investing in the notes, you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the underlier between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the notes.

PS- 10

Also, the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your notes, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the underlier stocks.

The levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final underlier levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial underlier level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical cash settlement amounts, each based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level), and are expressed as percentages of the face amount of a note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical cash settlement amount of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $1,000 of the outstanding face amount of the notes on the stated maturity date would equal 100.000% of the face amount of a note, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) and the assumptions noted above.

Hypothetical Final Underlier Level

(as Percentage of Initial Underlier Level) Hypothetical Cash Settlement Amount

(as Percentage of Face Amount) 150.000% 117.580% 140.000% 117.580% 130.000% 117.580% 120.000% 117.580% 111.720% 117.580% 110.000% 115.000% 105.000% 107.500% 102.500% 103.750% 100.000% 100.000% 95.000% 100.000% 90.000% 100.000% 80.000% 88.889% 75.000% 83.333% 50.000% 55.556% 25.000% 27.778% 0.000% 0.000%

If, for example, the final underlier level were determined to be 25.000% of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be approximately 27.778% of the face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date at the face amount and held them to the stated maturity date, you would lose approximately 72.222% of your investment (if you purchased your notes at a premium to face amount, you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). In addition, if the final underlier level were determined to be 111.720% or more of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be capped at the maximum settlement amount (expressed as a percentage of the face amount), or 117.580% of each $1,000 face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date and held them to the stated maturity date, you would not benefit from any increase in the final underlier level over 111.720% of the initial underlier level.

The following chart also shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical cash settlement amounts (expressed as a percentage of the face amount of your notes) that we would pay on your notes on the stated maturity date, if the final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The chart shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of less than 90.000% (the section left of the 90.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical cash settlement amount of less than 100.000% of the face amount of your notes (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and, accordingly, in a loss of principal to the holder of the notes. The chart also shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of greater than 111.720% (the section right of the 111.720% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a capped return on your investment.

PS- 11

The cash settlement amounts shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on closing levels for the underlier that may not be achieved on the determination date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your notes on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell your notes, may bear little relation to the hypothetical cash settlement amounts shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the notes. The hypothetical cash settlement amounts on notes held to the stated maturity date in the examples above assume you purchased your notes at their face amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual issue price you pay for your notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your notes. If you purchase your notes for a price other than the face amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples.

Please read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes” on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.

We cannot predict the actual final underlier level or what the market value of your notes will be on any particular trading day, nor can we predict the relationship between the closing level of the underlier and the market value of your notes at any time prior to the stated maturity date. The actual amount that you will receive, if any, at maturity and the rate of return on the notes will depend on the actual initial underlier level, cap level and maximum settlement amount that we will set on the trade date and the actual final underlier level determined by the calculation agent as described above. Moreover, the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently, the amount of cash to be paid in respect of your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date may be very different from the information reflected in the table and chart above.

PS- 12

Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes

An investment in the notes involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the notes. Investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier or any of the underlier stocks, i.e. the stocks composing the underlier. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

You May Lose Your Entire Investment in the Notes

You can lose your entire investment in the notes. The cash payment on your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date will be based on the performance of the underlier as measured from the initial underlier level set on the trade date to the closing level of the underlier on the determination date (also referred to as the “final underlier level”). If the final underlier level is less than the buffer level, you will lose approximately 1.1111% of the face amount of your notes for every 1% that the final underlier level is less than the buffer level. Thus, you may lose your entire investment in the notes, which would include any premium to face amount you paid when you purchased the notes.

Also, the market price of your notes prior to the stated maturity date may be significantly lower than the purchase price you pay for your notes. Consequently, if you sell your notes before the stated maturity date, you may receive far less than the amount of your investment in the notes.

Your Maximum Payment on the Notes Is Limited to the Maximum Settlement Amount

Your ability to participate in any change in the value of the underlier over the term of your notes will be limited because of the cap level, which will be set on the trade date. The maximum settlement amount will limit the cash settlement amount you may receive for each of your notes at maturity, no matter how much the level of the underlier may rise beyond the cap level over the term of your notes. Accordingly, the amount payable for each of your notes may be significantly less than it would have been had you invested directly in the underlier.

If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected

The cash settlement amount will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for the notes. If you purchase notes at a price that differs from the face amount of the notes, then the return on your investment in such notes held to the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. If you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, the return on your investment in the notes will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount or a discount to face amount. In addition, the impact of the buffer level and the cap level on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your notes relative to face amount. For example, the buffer level, while still providing some protection for the return on the notes, will allow a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. Similarly, if you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount, the cap level will only permit a lower return on your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount.

The Stated Maturity Date of the Notes Is a Pricing Term and Will Be Determined By Us on the Trade Date

We will not fix the stated maturity date until the trade date. The term of the notes could be as long as the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. You should be willing and

PS- 13

able to hold your notes for up to the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The stated maturity date selected by us could have an impact on the value of the notes.

Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Levels of the Underlier on the Dates Specified

Any payment on the notes will be determined based on the closing levels of the underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the underlier determined at any other time.

No Interest or Dividend Payments or Voting Rights or Rights to Receive Any Underlier Stock

As a holder of the notes, you will not receive interest payments. As a result, even if the amount payable on the stated maturity date exceeds the face amount of your notes, the overall return you earn on your notes may be less than you would have earned by investing in a non-index-linked debt security of comparable maturity that bears interest at a prevailing market rate. In addition, as a holder of the notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the underlier stocks would have. Furthermore, investing in the notes will not make you a holder of any of the underlier stocks. Your notes will be paid in cash and you will have no right to receive delivery of any underlier stocks.

The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain

There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS. Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described above under “Key Terms—Tax consequences.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

Credit of Issuer

The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the notes and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the notes.

You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or

PS- 14

beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the notes or receiving a different security from the notes, which may be worth significantly less than the notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier

Adjustments to the Underlier Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes

The underlier sponsor may add, delete, substitute or adjust the underlier stocks or make other methodological changes to the underlier that could affect its performance. The calculation agent will calculate the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to the underlier. In addition, the underlier sponsor may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of the underlier at any time. Under these circumstances, the calculation agent may select a successor index that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the underlier or, if no successor index is available, the calculation agent will determine the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the underlier and, consequently, the value of the notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement, as modified by “Supplemental Terms of the Notes” above.

Non-U.S. Securities Risks

Some of the underlier stocks are issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the notes, involve risks associated with the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

We and Our Affiliates, and Any Dealer Participating in the Distribution of the Notes, May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest

We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and

PS- 15

products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, if any dealer participating in the distribution of the notes or any of its affiliates conducts hedging activities for us in connection with the notes, that participating dealer or its affiliates will expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit will be in addition to any selling concession that the participating dealer realizes for the sale of the notes to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the participating dealer to sell the notes to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the notes. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

Lack of Liquidity

The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the notes. The notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your notes to maturity.

Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes

In addition to the level of the underlier, the value of the notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including: the expected volatility of the underlier; the time to maturity of the notes; the dividend rates on the underlier stocks; interest and yield rates in the market generally; supply and demand for the notes; a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; and our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your notes and the estimated value of the notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales

PS- 16

commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes

The estimated value of the notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions (described above under “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes”), and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the notes, secondary market prices of your notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your notes, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the notes on the trade date, as well as the secondary market value of the notes, for a temporary period after

PS- 17

the initial issue date of the notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your notes.

PS- 18

The Underlier

The underlier is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that is designed to measure the performance of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. For more information about the underlier, see “Indices—The Nasdaq-100 Index®” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

In addition, information about the underlier may be obtained from other sources, including, but not limited to, the underlier sponsor’s website (including information regarding the underlier’s sector weightings). We are not incorporating by reference into this pricing supplement the website or any material it includes. Neither we nor any agent or dealer for this offering makes any representation that this publicly available information regarding the underlier is accurate or complete.

Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier

You should not take the historical levels of the underlier as an indication of the future performance of the underlier. The closing level of the underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing level of the underlier during any period shown below is not an indication that the underlier is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the term of your notes. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the underlier or the underlier stocks will not result in a loss on your initial investment on the stated maturity date.

Neither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the underlier. The actual performance of the underlier over the term of the notes, as well as the cash settlement amount, may bear little relation to the historical levels shown below.

The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the underlier based on the daily closing levels from January 2, 2020 through December 12, 2025. The closing level of the underlier on December 12, 2025 was 25,196.73. The dotted line indicates a hypothetical buffer level of 90.00% of the closing level of the underlier on December 12, 2025. The actual buffer level will be equal to 90.00% of the initial underlier level.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2025-12-16 20:59:10.638460

What's in the News

A U.S. appeals court has temporarily paused a government order that would have forced Delta and Aeromexico to unwind their joint venture by Jan. 1, allowing the carriers to keep coordinating U.S–Mexico schedules and capacity while the legal challenge moves forward.

Separately, Delta and Aeromexico have jointly sued the U.S. government in an effort to block the move to dissolve their transborder partnership, arguing the alliance improves pricing, connectivity and planning across key cross border routes.

Delta is in the final stages of replacing power units on more than 300 Airbus jets after reports of toxic fumes entering cabin air, with the airline indicating it is roughly 90% through the upgrade program.

Management issued Q4 and full year 2025 guidance calling for Q4 revenue growth of 2% to 4%, quarterly EPS of $1.60 to $1.90 and about $6 in EPS for 2025.

How This Changes the Fair Value For Delta Air Lines

The fair value estimate has risen slightly, increasing from approximately $71.60 to about $73.64 per share, reflecting modestly higher long term expectations.

The discount rate has fallen marginally, declining from roughly 9.26% to about 9.19%, which implies a slightly lower perceived risk profile in the valuation model.

The revenue growth assumption has increased moderately, moving from about 3.37% to roughly 3.77%. This indicates a somewhat stronger outlook for top line expansion.

The net profit margin assumption has edged down slightly, decreasing from around 7.29% to about 7.16%. This signals a modestly more conservative view on profitability.

The assumed future P/E multiple has risen slightly, from approximately 12.36x to about 12.76x. This suggests a small upward adjustment in the valuation applied to forward earnings.

He was born on January 16, 1942, and lived a life richly adorned with craftsmanship, faith, and family.

Richard was a master woodworker, serving as a supervisor at the wood mill at Hill Air Force Base (HAFB). His exceptional skills in woodworking and his leadership qualities led him to become the President of both the Utah Wood Carvers Association and the Weber Valley Wood Carvers. His dedication to his craft was evident not only in his work but also in his enthusiastic participation in the woodworking community.

He served his country with pride in the United States Navy, a time in his life that he cherished deeply. After returning home from his naval service, he married Afton Stallings on March 8, 1963 in Ogden, Utah. Together they had two children, Wayne and Nancie. After Afton’s passing in 2017, he met and married Violet Wharton on December 22, 2018.

Richard was also a devoted member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served for many years as an ordinance worker at the Ogden Temple, where his strong faith and testimony in the gospel shone through his actions.

Richard led a life full of adventure and joy, often finding solace in nature. An avid fisherman and hunter, he spent countless hours on the lake and ice, where he once caught an impressive 37-inch catfish. He was a recipient of the Silver Beaver Award, an honor bestowed by the Boy Scouts of America, recognizing his significant contributions to scouting. Richard dedicated over 22 years in the scouting program and was the wood badge course a director.

Those who knew him would remember his vibrant personality—he was a man full of mischief from a young age, with a wit that was sharp as a tack. His rough exterior belied a loving and dedicated man committed to his family and community.

Richard is survived by his wife, Violet Johnson; his children, Wayne (Annette) Johnson and Nancie (Gene) Moyes; six grandchildren, two step-grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and seven step-grandchildren. He also leaves behind his brothers, Dan and David Johnson. Through his marriage to Violet, he inherited 6 stepchildren, 30 grandchildren, 42 great-grandchildren, and 4 great-great-grandchildren, creating a legacy that reflects his commitment to family.

Richard rejoins in eternal peace his late wife, Afton; grandson, Michael James; and his parents, William and Jennie Johnson. He is also preceded in death by his siblings, Bill, Evelyn, Jim, Zann, and Kenneth.

Richard Thomas Johnson will be remembered for his skilled craftsmanship, unwavering faith, and the profound impact he had on the lives of those who loved him. His legacy will continue to thrive through the many lives he touched.

""Frankly, ski resorts across the Alps are losing huge amounts of their winter season as the climate warms.
But these days, arriving at a Swiss ski resort today isn't always the magical experience one might imagine.
Laax is part of the wider Flims Laax Falera ski area, and Fry suggests starting in its basecamp village.
""Ski lifts everywhere consume a huge amount of energy, so this is our first transition away from the traditional winter sports model.""","As warming winters threaten the future of snow, Laax has launched some of Switzerland's most ambitious sustainability projects, from on-demand gondolas to CO2-neutral lifts.

From the summit of Crap Sogn Gion, it felt like all of the Alps were on the move. Skiers were carving, snowboarders swooping, tobogganists gliding. But below the rolling clouds, a different sort of winter obsessive was heading to work.

At 2,228m (7309ft), with chairlifts spinning, Reto Fry – environmental manager for the Weisse Arena Group, which owns the resort of Laax, one of Switzerland's largest winter sports destinations – looked out towards the rippling glaciers and meringue peaks of the Unesco-listed Tectonic Arena Sardona. The landscape may be 300 million years old, but right now Fry's job is squarely fixed on the Alps' future.

""We need to find more solutions to solve the climate change problem,"" he said. Skiers and boarders were making the best of the first snowfalls of the 2025/26 season, but the horizon was roughening around the edges. ""Frankly, ski resorts across the Alps are losing huge amounts of their winter season as the climate warms. So, we're all in this together.""

But these days, arriving at a Swiss ski resort today isn't always the magical experience one might imagine. New climate scenarios by researchers from MeteoSwiss (Switzerland's Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology) and ETH Zurich university paint a stark picture: Switzerland is warming twice as fast as the global average, partly due to Alpine geography. According to the study, the country is becoming hotter and drier, facing heavier periods of rainfall and, crucially for winter sports, experiencing less snowfall.

Laax is part of the wider Flims Laax Falera ski area, and Fry suggests starting in its basecamp village. At Riders Hotel and Rocksresort (recently awarded the Best Green Ski Hotel 2025 at the World Ski Awards), every element has been considered, from energy use to waste, to food and beverage measures, to biodiversity, and this is replicated throughout the purpose-built eco-village.

Decarbonised buildings glimmer with solar-panelled architecture. E-vehicles scoot silently. Vertical gardens resemble beanstalks on ski-lift base stations to help nurture bird, bee and insect life. To list every win would take too long, but particular pleasures of staying are its roof gardens, seasonal, plant-based menus (a rarity in Switzerland) and plentiful and free water stations (even rarer). If you turn up with damaged ski gear, a repair service to extend its lifecycle is also offered gratis.

More like this:

• The stunning car-free village reached by cable car

• The ski resort Olympians flock to each summer

• The magic of the legendary 'enrosadira'

The latest transition to a CO2-neutral environment is the introduction of more than 20,000 flowers and perennials in specially designed gardens for the endangered black mud bee. Rarer still, the insect is being encouraged to nest in the rocky facades of the hotel buildings. ""The species is under immense pressure,"" explained Fry, ""so to help its comeback, we have created a suitable, diverse habitat that optimally meets the nesting and feeding requirements.""

Nature lovers will also find the Senda dil Dragun – the world's longest treetop path – winding through one of more than a dozen special wildlife protection areas. Look out for mountain hare, ibex and eagle, or print trails of more elusive critters such as red deer, chamois, bearded vulture and various species of grouse. Wolf and lynx are also rumoured to have returned.

Once you strap your skis or board on, another innovation is visible over in neighbouring Flims: the FlemXpress, the world's first on-demand cable car whose fifth and final section opens on 19 December 2025. A sustainable ski lift taxi system, the cutting-edge gondolas only travel when needed, reducing energy consumption by 50% – a radical shift given that around 90% of cabins in conventional lifts travel empty. Like ""an Uber of the Alps"", as Alicia Martinez, head of business performance for Weisse Arena Group, put it, the new system could ""revolutionise mountain transport, but also in cities"".

""The Willy Wonka-inspired lift where you push a button and end up where you want to go – we invented it for innovation and guest privacy, but more because of energy consumption,"" Martinez said. ""Ski lifts everywhere consume a huge amount of energy, so this is our first transition away from the traditional winter sports model.""",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0mnp7pn.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 20:00:36.477910

The company says the updated ChatGPT Images is four times faster than its predecessor. If you're a frequent ChatGPT user, you'll know it can sometimes take a while for OpenAI's servers to create images, particularly during peak times and if you're not paying for ChatGPT Plus. In that respect, any improvement in speed is welcome.

The new version is also better at following instructions, including when you want to edit something the new model just generated. You can ask the system to add, subtract, combine, blend and even transpose elements. At the same time, OpenAI says the update offers better text rendering. That's something many image models have traditionally struggled with, but according to the company, the new ChatGPT Images is capable of handling denser and smaller text. As part of the today's model update, OpenAI is additionally adding a dedicated Images section to the ChatGPT sidebar. Here you'll find preset filters and prompts you can look to for inspiration.

The new ChatGPT Images arrives just as Nano Banana Pro is responsible for a surge in Gemini usage. In October, Google said its chatbot had 650 million users, up from 450 million just a few months earlier in July. Nano Banana Pro has proven so popular, the company recently limited free users to just two image generations per day. For OpenAI, a strong response to Nano Banana Pro probably wasn't as important as ensuring it came out swinging against Gemini 3 Pro, but ChatGPT Images is a big part of why there are 800 million ChatGPT users.

""We believe we’re still at the beginning of what image generation can enable,"" OpenAI said. ""Today’s update is a meaningful step forward with more to come, from finer-grained edits to richer, more detailed outputs across languages.""

NVIDIA & SK hynix Are Co-Developing an ""AI SSD"" That Could Bring Massive Benefits to Inference Workloads

As traditional AI workloads shift from training to inference, there's a need to switch up the tech stack to ensure a low-latency, high-throughput environment. One of the reasons for this is how NVIDIA has decided to integrate general-purpose GDDR7 memory into the Rubin CPX GPU for prefill. According to a report by Chosun Biz, a similar approach is also expected for NAND chips. It is claimed that NVIDIA and SK hynix are developing a new SSD solution named ""Storage Next"" as an internal project, and it could revolutionize the NAND segment.

It is claimed that SK hynix plans to present a prototype by the end of next year, and that the AI SSD could scale up to a massive 100 million IOPS, which is significantly larger compared to what traditional enterprise SSDs feature. When examining the need for such a solution, it becomes clear that the current AI workload structure requires continuous access to massive model parameters, which cannot be accommodated by HBM or general-purpose DRAM products. The AI SSD would eventually allow a pseudo-memory layer, optimized for AI workloads.

The Korean giant is reportedly collaborating with NVIDIA on the Storage Next project, with the primary goal of enhancing throughput and energy efficiency through advanced NAND and controller architectures. While the goal certainly seems optimistic, it is also important to note that the NAND supply lines are already under massive pressure following demand for storage from CSPs and AI giants, and given that the AI SSD solution being discussed actually becomes mainstream, well, you could expect a DRAM-like situation with NAND Flash chips as well.

It appears that facilitating AI workloads comes at a high cost, which disrupts existing supply chains, leaving neither consumers nor suppliers sufficient time to react to the changing supply-demand situation. DRAM contract pricing is worsening with each day, and by the looks of it, NAND might be next.",https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2280_82220700-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 19:04:07.454416

Each installment highlights forward-thinking strategies to address today’s food and agriculture related challenges with innovative solutions. To view more pieces in the series, click here.

At Instacart, our mission is simple: to create a world where everyone has access to the food they love and more time to enjoy it together. For too many families, though, nutritious food remains out of reach. As U.S. food insecurity rises and chronic diet-related diseases become more prevalent, the connection between nutrition and health has never been clearer.

Since launching Instacart Health, we’ve worked to bridge the gap between food access and health outcomes by leveraging our technology, partnerships, research, and advocacy. Along the way, we’ve seen two powerful opportunities for the private sector to partner with governments: first, through direct, innovative collaborations that deliver tangible results — and second, by leveraging our learnings to help inform public policy.

On the former, for example, we were proud to work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to help bring Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) online and become the first online grocery marketplace to expand it to all 50 states and Washington, D.C., making it easier for millions of families to access nutritious food. We’ve since expanded to offer EBT SNAP payments across nearly 180 retail banners and more than 30,000 stores nationwide. And last year, we introduced a SNAP eligibility screener directly on our platform, allowing anyone to easily check if they could qualify for SNAP and find relevant state resources to enroll.

At the local level, programs like our Grocery Access Program Pilot in Columbia, South Carolina, and the Montgomery County Groceries Program in Maryland—both of which leverage Instacart Health technology to unlock grocery delivery for families facing food insecurity — are delivering measurable impact, including evidence of improved food access and healthier food choices. In DC, our latest and largest government partnership with the city’s Department of Health is helping families put more fruits and vegetables on their tables by giving 1,000 D.C. households access to monthly online grocery stipends through Fresh Funds, a program that allows providers to fund category-specific stipends, like fresh and frozen produce. Together, these initiatives show how public-private partnerships can expand food access and give every family the dignity and convenience of choice through online grocery.

The insights we’ve gleaned from these and other programs can be powerful in shaping public policies to combat hunger and nutrition insecurity. That’s why we recently released our new Instacart Health Policy Agenda, outlining our top policy recommendations and advocacy commitments in two focus areas: strengthening and modernizing food assistance programs and integrating nutrition into healthcare. This new agenda serves as a roadmap for how policymakers, private companies, and nonprofits can work together to expand access to nutritious food for all and improve health outcomes in communities across the country.

Among the nation’s first large-scale food access and nutrition programs, SNAP and Women, Infant, and Children programs (WIC) laid the foundation for nationwide food as medicine initiatives, ensuring millions of families could put healthy food on the table. That’s exactly why we’re advocating for their modernization. These programs remain as vital today as ever, and they deserve the tools and infrastructure needed to maximize their impact.

During the pandemic, online grocery shopping became a lifeline—saving time, reducing stress and perceived stigma, and even encouraging healthier purchases. Research from No Kid Hungry and the University of Kentucky found that families shopping online with SNAP bought an average of $5.24 more in fruits and vegetables without increasing their total grocery bill. By bringing programs like WIC online, we can help more families shop with dignity and flexibility while improving health outcomes. It’s also why our agenda calls for making the online SNAP pilot program permanent.

We’ve also seen firsthand how that food access can serve as a powerful form of preventive care. Across the country, states are incorporating food as medicine interventions into Medicaid and Medicare, with promising early results. Medically-tailored groceries and produce prescriptions are helping patients manage chronic conditions and improve key markers of health while reducing overall healthcare costs. To scale these solutions, we’re calling on legislators to enact clear policy guidance, streamlined waivers, and efficient billing systems that make nutrition-based care easier to implement at scale.

Finally, no conversation about nutrition security is complete without the consideration of children’s needs. We’re calling for expanded universal school meal programs and encouraging states to opt into the Summer EBT program, ensuring every child has access to healthy food year-round.

We’re proud to play our part in improving health outcomes. Our new Instacart Health Policy Agenda and growing network of public-private partnerships reflect our belief that expanding access to nutritious food is one of the most powerful ways to strengthen communities and advance public health. That’s because everyone deserves access not only to the food they love, but to the nutrition they need to live a healthy life.

In the course of the visit there was also a moving meeting between Huang and Israeli employee Avinatan Or, who survived two years in Hamas captivity.

Approval for the campus at the Kiryat Tivon site has been obtained from the Israel Land Authority, Minister of Defense Israel Katz, whose approval was required because it was a case of state land being acquired by an overseas entity, the director of the Planning Administration, the directors of the Ministry of Construction and Housing and the Ministry of Transport, and Israel Electric Corporation, which will assist in the provision of a high tension cable for the server farm that will be built at the site.

Minister of Construction and Housing Haim Katz announced in November that Nvidia would construct a 160,000 square meter campus housing over 8,000 employees, but Nvidia has made no response to that announcement. Its campus will be part of a new industrial zone called Tivon Tech that is currently at the planning stage.

To change that, the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, is encouraging women to prioritize their heart health. Leading that effort locally is Anna Szafranski, Vice President of Product and Commercial Value Streams, Cardiac Ablation Solutions at Medtronic, who is serving as the 2026 chair for the Twin Cities Go Red for Women® movement, empowering women to take charge of their heart health, while addressing critical gaps in research, education and care. Go Red for Women is dedicated to helping women lead healthier lives.

“As women, our days are packed, and life rarely slows down—but women’s health deserves attention now, not later,” said Szafranski. “Go Red for Women is a call to action: Red Means Go—for our hearts, our futures, and every woman who matters to us. Working in cardiovascular technology at Medtronic, I see firsthand how innovation can save lives, but prevention starts with awareness and action.”

Despite the threat of CVD, less than half of women are aware of its risk [2]. Go Red for Women is committed to closing gaps in access to care and championing a community of support.

“There is one source of support women can count on — each other. Anna’s unwavering passion and dedication to the Go Red for Women movement is creating a ripple of change in the Twin Cities,” said Krista Moffett, executive director, American Heart Association – Minnesota.

Celebrate Go Red for Women’s local achievements on February 12, 2026, at the 2026 Twin Cities Go Red for Women Evening of Empowerment to take place at Quincy Hall in Northeast Minneapolis. Now in its 22nd year, the event will feature inspiring survivor stories, an interactive pop-up experience, and curated bites.

Dive Brief:

IBM launched the IBM Consulting Application Management Suite for SAP to simplify and accelerate modernization efforts using generative and agentic AI, the company announced Monday.

Despite potential benefits from migrating to SAP S/4HANA, IBM said enterprise transition to the ERP system can be slowed by “legacy complexity, fragmented processes, and resource-intensive operations.”

SAP’s legacy ECC ERP system support will end in 2027 as the company aims to transition customers to its flagship ERP system S/4HANA. As the deadline looms, just 45% of organizations are live on the new ERP system, according to a survey of Americas’ SAP Users’ Group cited by IBM.

Dive Insight:

Companies are advertising AI agents as strategic tools to help move along complex migration projects for enterprises, but upgrading SAP’s ECC system presents unique challenges given how highly customized these systems can be.

IBM’s tool is the latest addition to a growing list of products offering assistance to enterprises migrating to S/4HANA. It creates specific code changes aligned with customer standards and provides proactive monitoring, impact analysis and process flow reverse engineering, according to the announcement.

SAP itself trained its Joule copilot to assist in ERP migrations, adding agentic automation to the product’s capabilities earlier this year. Global IT infrastructure company Kyndrylreleased a consulting tool in April to ease enterprise data migrations to SAP S/4HANA following the company’s own 18-month ERP migration.

The problem, according to Gartner Senior Director Analyst David Penny, is that migration tools aren’t addressing a core issue that exists with ECC customers: value creation.

SAP customers spent years customizing their ECC systems, creating a lot of technical debt along the way, Penny said. Migrating to S/4HANA means spending significant funds to upgrade or rewrite those customizations “to force the new system to run like the old one.”

The ECC customizations are “the elephant in the room,” Penny said.

“There are a load of tools to help you get to S/4, arguably they’ve been around for years and are getting better and better,” Penny said. “But all that does is get you to S/4. That doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve got any value added if you chose to convert your system.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ib-sJpmt8fNdqyJOFcXB1-6gds85AP_3wwaumVv5EyA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTk0OTA4MzM5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-16 18:02:33.883478

To solidify its dominance beyond hardware, Nvidia announced the acquisition of SchedMD, the developer behind the critical open-source software Slurm, which manages workloads for over half of the world’s top 100 supercomputers. This move effectively integrates Nvidia deeper into the infrastructure layer of generative AI. This ensures that its GPUs remain the undisputed backbone for foundation model developers and enterprise AI builders alike.

Nvidia Aims to Defend the $3 Trillion Total Addressable Market

The battle for AI supremacy is shifting from simple chatbots to massive industrial and enterprise use cases, a transition that UBS believes could lead to a $3.1 trillion revenue potential by 2030. While competitors like Broadcom (AVGO) have tumbled 16% in a single week, Nvidia’s relative strength is bolstered by the launch of its Nemotron 3 family of open AI models, which are designed to power the next generation of “agentic” AI systems.

Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS (UBS) Global Wealth Management, notes that there is zero evidence of a “circular financing” bubble reminiscent of the dot-com era, as Nvidia’s recent partnerships account for only 10% of its projected 2026 earnings. By acquiring SchedMD, Nvidia is owning the orchestration layer that prevents GPUs from sitting idle, a “must-have” capability for companies aiming to hit the 1 million trips per week threshold in the robo-taxi and robotics races.

Is Nvidia a Buy, Hold, or Sell?

Despite recent volatility, Nvidia (NVDA) maintains a commanding “Strong Buy” consensus among Wall Street analysts, with 39 out of 41 ratings issued in the last three months suggesting a Buy. The average 12-month NVDA price target stands at an aggressive $258.97, representing a potential upside of 48% from the last reported price.

A decade in, the night shift is just normal routine for Brett Johnson on maintenance.
As an overnight stocker, he works where he’s needed across the store, ensuring items are easy to find during the day shift.
“If I can stop them from feeling like that, I take pride in that.” There’s a certain determination, he says, that overnight associates share, a focus.
But the best part of the night shift?","Every evening, across 4,600 Walmart U.S. locations, overnight teams ready the stores for a new day. During these late hours, you can walk from grocery to cleaning supplies to seasonal and not encounter another customer. Walmart Radio is heard clearly. Footsteps echo.

At 10 p.m., Store #4255 in Elyria, Ohio, is winding down. Customers are wrapping up their evening to-do lists and it seems like a stillness is creeping over the aisles. But steps away, in the breakroom, a workday is just beginning. There is laughter. There are yawns. There are energy drinks in the fridge. And there is a quiet focus. Here, the holidays aren’t just celebrated. They’re built, one night at a time, by associates.

They gather on the sales floor for the start-of-shift meeting. Soon, the store becomes theirs alone.

A decade in, the night shift is just normal routine for Brett Johnson on maintenance. He moves through the store with the kind of unspoken authority that doesn’t come from a title but from time, from having learned every corner, every fix, every quirk.

When asked what the years have taught him, Brett doesn’t talk about tools or techniques first. He talks about honesty and the importance of speaking up when something’s wrong or when the workload gets heavy.

It’s an approach he models for the rest of the team because he believes in the importance of leading by example and taking pride in a job well done. For Brett, a clean floor isn’t just a task; it’s a promise that customers will walk in safely come morning for their holiday shopping. A repaired fixture isn’t just crossed off a list; it’s part of the foundation for a great holiday shopping experience, for both customers coming in the store and associates prepping items for pickup and delivery. He’s proof that a steady presence is its own kind of leadership.

For Rafiel Torres, the late hours are a time for introspection, self-reflection and clarity.

“I’m more in my thoughts,” he said. “I feel like it makes me love myself more, working overnight.”

Rafiel has been with Walmart for four years, starting when he was 16, and has been on the night shift for the last year. While he moves pallets and fills shelves, the aisles become a place where his mind settles, where the noise of the day finally fades enough for him to hear himself — and plan for the future.

“I actually just applied for HVAC school for next year,” he said. “I’m looking at doing that for a few years and then maybe going back for a degree in marketing or something, maybe starting my own business.”

Even though Rafiel prizes his time for late-night revelations, his favorite part of the holiday season at Walmart is the connection with his teammates and the moments they share.

“We always take a big picture, like when it’s Christmastime or Thanksgiving. We always take a big picture with our coaches. It’s always our pictures we remember….And being in Toys, especially with the whole crew there, just everybody being around each other during the holidays. We all get to talk about plans and things that we’re going to be doing, and it keeps the energy up.”

Chase Stevanus knows a thing or two about keeping energy up, and he stays on the go. As an overnight stocker, he works where he’s needed across the store, ensuring items are easy to find during the day shift. He also works to stay tuned in to what his teammates need.

“I like to make sure everyone is keeping their spirits up while they work, because it is night. Everyone’s tired,” he said. “If I can stop them from feeling like that, I take pride in that.”

There’s a certain determination, he says, that overnight associates share, a focus. That no matter how tough or busy or hectic it gets, especially during the holidays, they always come through. For Chase, hitting the 5 a.m. hour is his favorite time because that’s when day crews start to arrive, and customers soon after.

And while he didn’t start out thinking of Walmart as a place to build a career when he started 10 years ago, he now finds himself looking ahead to the next 10.

“I’ve always wanted to be a team lead, to be the person people can rely on and help them out. There’s plenty of things to learn. There’s plenty of opportunities, different departments to go to.”

In the tea and coffee aisle, there’s singing, voices trading made up lyrics to a tune from Mulan. All night, four associates on the modular team have been shoulder to shoulder, making steady progress from one end to the other. Now, each box and bag fit neatly together like tiles revealing a clear pattern, an aisle hit hard during the holidays reset and refreshed.

“I love when things come together. It’s really satisfying,” said Mary-Jane Helton.

And for Olivia Ruth True, the camaraderie of the mod team is essential to a job well done and making spirits bright.

“Sometimes we’re in a four-foot section together, working above and below each other, so we can spot each other,” she said.

But it’s not just about tackling the task at hand. It’s about being able to share when they’re having a rough day, when they might need some space or rooting for each other on goals outside of work. Mary-Jane plans to go to school for teaching and Olivia, a classically trained vocalist, hopes to finish up her degree and become a vocal coach. Sharing their dreams during their nights at Walmart have proved inspirational for both.

But the best part of the night shift? “We never miss a sunrise or sunset,” Olivia said.",https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/images/newsroom/2025/12/16/the-overnighters/the-overnighters-social.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 20:00:43.566381

As part of this agenda, FCDO has produced several sectoral documents specifying which types of interventions are likely to be most cost-effective based on a review of evidence— known as “best buys.”

These documents—while imperfect—could be useful to partner countries and other providers; publishing them could itself be a great way to improve systems as the government intends. But at present, FCDO’s best buy documents aren’t publicly available. These documents are too useful to be hidden away as internal documents. FCDO should publish them to allow others to build on them, encourage discussion, and positively influence recipients’ systems as well as other providers.

The birth of the best buy

The Department for International Development (DFID, the FCDO’s predecessor) was a major funder of research and evidence production in global development. By one estimate, it funded (directly or indirectly) 30 percent of published randomized control trials with a development focus, and 70 percent of those in the top five economics journals (a significant chunk of the rest came from the Economic and Social Research Council, also part-funded by UK aid). This research has a practical bent, allowing DFID/FCDO to design more effective interventions and discern between project proposals.

The “best buys” documents are attempts—spearheaded by DFID’s chief economist at the time, Rachel Glennerster (now CGD’s president)—to distil the knowledge generated by academic research into digestible summaries, categorising interventions by how cost-effective they are according to the evidence, and how strong that evidence is. They are part of FCDO’s ongoing effort to improve value for money and ensure that aid achieves maximum impact.

For example, work in the education sector has found that providing information on the value of schooling achieves orders of magnitude more learning-adjusted years of schooling than just providing inputs (for the same expenditure). The former is a great buy, the other a bad buy, according to the Global Education Evidence Advisory Panel report on learning best buys (that began its life as a DFID document).

It is not clear how many best buy documents exist. Business cases that we have reviewed have mentioned documents on humanitarian interventions (published 2018), climate (2019), education (2019), economic development (2019), and governance (2020).

Best buys influence within FCDO

These best buy documents appear to have been influential within DFID/FCDO. Business cases generally contain lengthy discussions of the evidence underpinning the proposed interventions, and since 2018 (when the first one that we are aware of was published) best buy documents are increasingly cited. At the peak in 2023, 43 percent of business cases for new projects referenced a best buys document (the share has since fallen, but there were far fewer newly published business cases in 2024-2025). And this share was far higher for projects above £40 million in value, programmes with costs above this threshold need to be reviewed by the FCDO’s Quality Assurance Unit, and so receive additional scrutiny. Such projects are nearly twice as likely to mention best buys.

Clearly, additional references in business cases do not necessarily mean that more aid is being spent on best buys. It may be pure signalling: that mentioning the documents makes the business case look more robust by suggesting that the programme officer has considered them. In some cases, business cases mention them only in the context of why an alternative intervention is being funded. For example, the “Transforming Access to Climate Finance” programme notes that the climate best buys paper makes “limited reference” to the intervention in question. But even if not all the interventions are selected à la carte from the best buys documents, the increase in citations suggests that, at the very least, programme officers are confronting the evidence therein.

Best buys influence outside FCDO

While the best buys have played a role in FCDO’s spend; if they were published, they could potentially influence billions of spend in other providers and national governments. This fits with the government’s ambition to move from service provision to system improvement.

This has arguably already happened in the education sector, where the UK collaborated with other aid providers to turn the best buys document into the Global Education Evidence Advisory Panel report, which is now viewed as an authoritative source of cost-effectiveness of learning interventions. In time, this could serve as a model for publishing and enhancing the influence of the remaining best buys: the collaboration with other providers alongside a panel of independent experts lent credibility to the findings. But simply putting what exists in the public domain would be a positive start.

The potential influence and impact of published best buy documents has already been recognised in some FCDO business cases. According to one (for the “Building Resilience, Inclusion and Diversity through Girls’ Education (BRIDGE)” programme), “influencing others to adopt best buys through technical assistance and government level support has been deemed a ‘mega buy’ by the UK.” This was in reference to national governments, but there is no reason to think it does not equally apply to other providers.

Obviously, aid is not provided solely to maximise impact: there are a host of other goals unrelated to averting disability-adjusted life years, increasing learning-adjusted years of schooling, or raising GNI per capita. But having assembled the evidence base in an easily digestible format for policymakers, there is surely little additional cost to sharing, with the potential benefit of influencing at least somebody. There are increasing calls for aid providers to focus on best/smart buys, and so the documents will likely find a ready audience. And this influence isn’t limited to aid. Developing countries could use this evidence in the design of their own systems. Many current FCDO programmes do not implement best buy interventions directly, but promote take-up of well-evidenced interventions. For example, one of the outputs of the “Partnership for Learning for All in Nigerian Education – PLANE” programme is to encourage the use of evidence-based learning approaches, such as teaching at the right level.

Are the best buys the best best buys?

The best buys we have seen are careful and serious reviews of the evidence that would be useful to anyone working in the area—but they rely on interpretation by the authors, and controversy around how projects are assessed may cause reluctance to publish. Collation of interventions into “great buys” and “bad buys” and so on inevitably involves a degree of judgement, and officials may not want that judgement to be exposed to external questioning. Other donors might disagree with the analysis, or at least place emphases differently. This is not necessarily just an attempt to avoid scrutiny: officials may feel strongly about their interpretation of the evidence and be concerned that different interpretations may muddy the waters for otherwise clear recommendations for policymakers.

But this is not a reason for not publishing. On the contrary, where there is controversy around the categorisation of interventions, this should be aired and explored if it is to influence (potentially) billions of pounds of aid spending. Even if best buys documents are imperfect, incomplete or have known shortcomings, publication can still inform debate and enable others to improve the assessments.

An inexpensive route to greater impact

The FCDO (and its predecessor) has done the work. It acknowledges that influencing spending from other actors is a cost-effective way to achieve greater impact. Its role in direct aid spending is greatly diminished, making this indirect impact relatively more important. So while it may trigger uncomfortable discussion as to how great some of the great buys are, there is an overwhelming case for making these documents public. And if these documents are actually influential in aid allocation decisions, there is a public interest rationale for publishing: being open about factors influencing decisions ex-ante would be a welcome step forward in transparency and also in moving to system support, expertise, and local provision.

FCDO should therefore put all of the best buy documents in the public domain, boosting both their transparency and developmental impact beyond their own spending.",https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/2025-12/FCDO-Foreign-Commonwealth-and-Development-Office.jpeg,N,,2025-12-16 17:02:20.764244

By Katie Castellani, State House News Service

It’s failed to find an audience on Beacon Hill, but Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is standing firm behind her proposed tax burden shift as others continue to warn about declining commercial property values and the growing city budget.

Wu’s proposal (HD 4422) to temporarily shift more property taxes to commercial owners as a way to relieve sharp increases for homeowners has failed to enter the legislative pipeline since senators have yet to assign it to a committee. Sens. William Brownsberger and Nick Collins, who oppose Wu’s proposal, have also revived “tax shock bills” (S 1933 and S 1935), signaling some interest in new residential property tax relief policies.

When asked about the “tax shock” proposals, Wu said they steer much needed funds away from the city while her proposal balances taxes without cutting city funding.

“The way that state tax laws very strictly control the revenues that cities and municipalities have around the commonwealth is a challenge right now in a high inflationary environment where costs of health care for city workers and other costs just to maintain the same level of city services are increasing far faster than two and a half percent,” Wu told the News Service, invoking Proposition 2½, which has limited annual property tax increases for more than four decades. “The proposals that have been put forward all take from funding that would otherwise be going to city services and so there is a direct cost from city services to those proposals.”

The Senate bills (S 1933/S1935) would allow municipalities to offer targeted, locally funded credits or rebates in years with sharp residential tax spikes, or to vulnerable taxpayers such as seniors or MassHealth enrollees.

It’s the second year in a row that Wu’s city council-backed tax shift plans have stumbled at the State House, and third quarter residential property tax bills in Boston are projected to increase by 13%.

Allowing Boston to stray from statewide rules governing the balance between residential and commercial property taxes could open the floodgates for similar requests, senators have warned.

Business groups say that shifting more of Boston’s tax burden onto its commercial sector could weaken the already-struggling office market and create ripple effects far beyond the city’s borders.

A June report from the Boston Policy Institute and the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University found that declining commercial property values are expected to continue falling. Under the report’s best estimate, inflation-adjusted office assessments are expected to fall 35% to 45% from 2024 through 2029. This would create a $1.7 billion hole in the city’s budget over that period.

“My sense is this problem is very real and the city is not taking it sufficiently seriously,” Center for State Policy Analysis director Evan Horowitz told the News Service Tuesday.

In a situation where property valuations are going down, the city can either accept lower tax collections and adjust the budget or raise tax rates to maintain current spending, he said.

“They are choosing to raise tax rates and pretending that it’s not a choice at all, that they’re being forced to do it and someone should rescue them,” Horowitz said.

He said Wu’s tax shift offers a temporary reprieve but the city’s situation calls for a permanent solution.

Part of the permanent solution would be to stop taking the maximum allowable revenue under Prop 2 ½ to “let the rates be what they are” and adjust the city budget accordingly, Horowitz said. The other part of the fix would be to work with other municipalities for more unrestricted general government aid from the state.

The Massachusetts Municipal Association recently released recommendations calling for a $351 million increase in discretionary local aid and adjustments to Proposition 2 ½, a voter law that the Legislature has not interfered with. Their recommendations include phased-in overrides and raising the 2.5% levy growth cap.

“I do think the city needs more state support, because they are hampered in their ability to raise revenues,” Horowitz said. “But they need to first acknowledge that, they get to control their tax rates, and they should set them appropriately, and build a process for doing that. They do not currently have such a process.”

Boston’s budget has grown 26% over the past four years, from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2022 to $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2026, according to a post on Brownsberger’s website. Also, the city’s total property tax levy has grown 26% over the same period and residential property values have risen more than commercial properties so residential taxpayers are picking up a greater share.

Boston’s residential property taxes are also among the lowest in the state because of an allowed 175% shift to commercial property and a large commercial base, Brownsberger’s site says, noting that the city’s residential tax levy ranks 332nd out of the 351 Massachusetts communities as a percentage of personal income.

During a Dec. 9 Senate session, Brownsberger said the decades of Boston increasing spending without “heavily burdening residential taxpayers” seem to be coming to an end.

Boston’s property taxes would be higher without state aid that supports about 10% of the city’s budget, according to Brownsberger. But he said Wu’s proposal is not an efficient solution.

“The proposal would give an additional property tax break even to our wealthiest homeowners, while increasing the burden on struggling small business owners,” Brownsberger said in the post. “Even for businesses that might seem strong economically, if we raise commercial taxes, employees and customers are going to bear much of the burden.”

Office vacancy rates in downtown Boston held steady at 18.8% during the third quarter 2025 and are up from 10% in the same period in 2020, according to an October CBRE report.

Another estimate from Colliers also found vacancy rates in the Greater Boston area – including both the city and suburbs – are stabilizing. The vacancy rate has remained around 24% year to date, according to Colliers’ third quarter 2025 Greater Boston office report released Oct. 23. However, a slowing macro-economy and sluggish job growth could constrain office market recovery in the near-term.

To address office vacancies, Wu said the city has been recruiting new businesses to fill empty desks throughout the city. She pointed to progress with major companies like Hasbro, Lego, KKR and Klaviyo moving to Boston or expanding their office space within the city.

Hasbro, which is planning to move its headquarters to Seaport by the end of 2026, represented the largest office lease deal in the third quarter 2025, encompassing almost 264,400 square feet over seven floors, according to CBRE. Leases signed by KKR and a renewal from BNY Mellon also helped boost quarterly leasing activity to 1.91 million square feet, the highest quarterly leasing volume since 2019. Without the major transactions, the leasing volume would have been about 1.3 million square feet, a 382,000-square-foot increase over the previous quarter.

While this is a bright spot amid the gloomy commercial real estate forecasts, Horowitz said “there is tiny room for optimism.”

“Mostly this is a problem that needs to be solved,” he said. “Values seem to be falling and there’s a lot more decline I think to work through the tax system.”

Wu said the city’s program to convert empty office spaces to residential units has exceeded expectations, so the city is extending it another year. There are 1,517 housing units in the pipeline as a result of the program.

Wu said the city is also working to make Boston “the easiest place to open a business” by streamlining permitting, getting rid of annual fees for certain types of licenses and working with property owners on how best to use city services for projects like fixing up sidewalks and a $110 million revolving fund aimed at sparking more downtown business development.",https://www.dotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-16-at-3.19.45-PM.png,N,,2025-12-16 20:00:21.910791

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 16, 2025-- Visa Inc. (V) today announced the launch of USDC settlement in the United States, marking a major milestone in the company’s stablecoin settlement pilot program and strategy to modernize its settlement layer underpinning global commerce. For the first time, U.S. issuer and acquirer partners can settle with Visa in Circle’s USDC, a fully reserved, dollar-denominated stablecoin.

With USDC settlement, issuers can benefit from faster funds movement over blockchains, seven‑day availability and enhanced operational resilience across weekends and holidays - without any change to the consumer card experience.

Initial banking participants include Cross River Bank and Lead Bank, which have started settling with Visa in USDC over the Solana blockchain. Broader availability in the U.S. is planned through 2026.

Additionally, Visa is a design partner for Arc, a new Layer 1 blockchain developed by Circle (currently in public testnet). Arc’s purpose-built design offers the performance and scalability needed to help support Visa’s global commercial activity onchain. Visa also plans to utilize Arc for USDC settlement within its network and to operate a validator node once Arc goes live.

“Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because our banking partners are not only asking about it - they’re preparing to use it,” said Rubail Birwadker, Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships, Visa. “Financial institutions are looking for faster, programmable settlement options that integrate seamlessly with their existing treasury operations. By bringing USDC settlement to the U.S., Visa is delivering a reliable, bank‑ready capability that improves treasury efficiency while maintaining the security, compliance and resiliency standards our network requires.”

Redefining the modern settlement experience

Visa’s U.S. stablecoin settlement framework features:

7-day settlement windows: improving speed and liquidity for banks and fintechs to settle seven days a week instead of the traditional five-business day window

Modernized liquidity and treasury management: enabling automated, next‑generation treasury operations for bank participants

Interoperability: bridging traditional payment rails with blockchain‑based infrastructure

Expanding a proven foundation of stablecoin innovation

The introduction of stablecoin settlement in the U.S. continues to build on years of Visa’s active stablecoin settlement pilots across the globe including in several countries within LAC, Europe, AP and CEMEA. As of November 30, Visa’s monthly stablecoin settlement volume passed a $3.5 billion annualized run rate – a significant milestone since Visa became one of the first major networks to settle transactions in a stablecoin in 2023. And in July, Visa announced added support for more blockchains and stablecoins in its stablecoin settlement pilot to give partners more flexibility in how they settle VisaNet obligations.

Visa first experimented with USDC settlement in 2021. Circle, the company behind USDC, emphasized the importance of integrating fully-reserved stablecoins into institutional settlement flows. “Bringing USDC settlement to the U.S. with Visa is a milestone for internet native money moving at the speed of software,” said Nikhil Chandhok, Chief Product and Technology Officer, Circle. “It helps card-issuing financial institutions modernize treasury and unlock new services while retaining the transparency and trust that USDC is known for.”

Early banking partners underscore the benefits of faster, API‑driven settlement experiences. Lead Bank, a technology‑forward community bank working closely with top fintech partners, noted that seven-day settlements and clearer liquidity timing are becoming increasingly important for its clients. “Lead Bank is proud to be among the first U.S. banks to enable USDC settlement with Visa,” said Jackie Reses, CEO, Lead Bank. “This capability brings speed and precision to treasury operations and helps us deliver modern financial services to the communities we serve.”

Cross River Bank, a leading infrastructure provider that offers embedded financial solutions, reinforces the importance of true interoperability. “Fintech and crypto innovators increasingly ask us to bring stablecoins into their existing product suite,” said Gilles Gade, Founder, President and CEO of Cross River. “A unified platform that natively supports both stablecoins and traditional payment networks is the foundation for how value will move globally. As one of the first U.S. banks to enable USDC settlement with Visa, we’re demonstrating how a tech-forward, deeply integrated banking partner can connect blockchain networks and legacy systems at scale.”

MONY wraps a traditional money-market fund in a token that can live on public rails, pairing the speed of crypto with the one feature payment stablecoins such as Tether and Circle cannot legally offer under new US rules: yield.

That makes MONY less a DeFi experiment than JP Morgan’s attempt to redefine what “cash on-chain” means for large, KYC’d pools of capital.

It also puts the bank in more direct competition with BlackRock’s BUIDL and the broader tokenized Treasuries sector, which has grown into a mid–tens of billions market as institutions look for yield-bearing, blockchain-native cash equivalents.

How GENIUS tilts the field

To understand the timing, one has to start with the GENIUS Act, the US stablecoin law passed earlier this year.

The statute created a full licensing regime for payment stablecoins and, crucially, banned issuers from paying interest to token holders simply for holding the token.

As a result, the core business model for regulated dollar stablecoins is now codified: issuers hold reserves in safe assets, collect the yield, and pass none of it through directly.

For corporate treasurers and crypto funds that hold large stablecoin balances for weeks or months, that embeds a structural opportunity cost. In a world where front-end rates hover in the mid-single digits, that “stablecoin tax” can run at roughly 4–5% per year on idle balances.

MONY is designed to sit outside that perimeter. It is structured as a Rule 506(c) private placement money-market fund, not a payment stablecoin.

That means it is treated as a security, sold only to accredited investors, and invested in US Treasuries and fully collateralized Treasury repos.

As a money fund, it is structured to pass most of the underlying income back to shareholders after fees, not to trap the entire yield at the issuer level.

Crypto research firm Asva Capital noted:

“Tokenized money-market funds solve a key problem: idle stablecoins earning zero yield.”

By letting qualified investors subscribe and redeem in either cash or USDC via JP Morgan’s Morgan Money platform, MONY effectively creates a two-step workflow.

This allows the investors to use USDC or other payment tokens for transactions, then rotate into MONY when the priority shifts to holding and earning.

For JP Morgan, this is not a side bet. The bank seeded MONY with around $100 million of its own capital and is marketing it directly into its global liquidity client base.

As John Donohue, head of Global Liquidity at JP Morgan Asset Management, put it, the firm expects other global systemically important banks to follow.

So, the message is that tokenization has progressed past pilots; it is now a delivery mechanism for core cash products.

The collateral contest

The economic logic becomes clearer when you look at collateral, not wallets.

Crypto derivatives markets, prime brokerage platforms and OTC desks require margin and collateral around the clock.

Historically, stablecoins like USDT and USDC have been the default because they are fast and broadly accepted. They are not, however, capital efficient in a high-rate regime.

Tokenized money funds are built to fill that gap. Instead of parking $100 million in stablecoins that earn nothing, a fund or trading desk can hold $100 million of MMF tokens that track a conservative portfolio of short-term government assets and still move at blockchain speed between vetted venues.

BlackRock’s BUIDL product has already shown how that can evolve. Once it gained acceptance as collateral on large exchanges’ institutional rails, it stopped being “tokenization as demo” and became part of the funding stack.

MONY is aimed at the same corridor, but with a different perimeter.

While BUIDL has pushed aggressively into crypto-native platforms through partnerships with tokenization specialists, JP Morgan is tying MONY tightly to its own Kinexys Digital Assets stack and the existing Morgan Money distribution network.

So, the pitch for MONY is not to the offshore, high-frequency trading crowd. It is to pensions, insurers, asset managers and corporates that already use money-market funds and JP Morgan’s liquidity platforms today.

Donohue has argued that tokenization can “fundamentally change the speed and efficiency of transactions.” In practical terms, that means shrinking settlement windows for collateral moves from T+1 into intraday, and doing it without moving out of the banking and fund-regulation perimeter.

Moreover, the risk for stablecoins is not that they disappear. It is that a meaningful slice of the large, institutional balances that currently sit in USDC or USDT for collateral and treasury purposes migrate into tokenized MMFs instead, leaving stablecoins more concentrated in payments and open DeFi.

The Ethereum signal

Perhaps the clearest signal in MONY’s design is the choice of Ethereum as its base chain.

JP Morgan has run private ledgers and permissioned networks for years; putting a flagship cash product on a public blockchain is an acknowledgment that liquidity, tooling and counterparties have converged there.

Thomas Lee of BitMine views the move as a watershed moment, stating simply that “Ethereum is the future of finance.” This is a claim now supported by the fact that the world’s largest bank is deploying its flagship tokenized cash product on the network.

However, the “public” blockchain launch here comes with an asterisk. MONY is still a 506(c) security.

This means that its tokens can only sit in allowlisted, KYC’d wallets, and transfers are controlled to comply with securities law and the fund’s own restrictions. That effectively splits on-chain dollar instruments into two overlapping layers.

On the permissionless layer, retail users, high-frequency traders and DeFi protocols will continue to rely on Tether, USDC and similar tokens. Their value proposition is censorship resistance, universal composability and ubiquity across protocols and chains.

On the permissioned layer, MONY and peer funds like BUIDL and Goldman’s and BNY Mellon’s tokenized MMFs offer regulated, yield-bearing cash equivalents to institutions that care more about audit trails, governance and counterparty risk than about permissionless composability. Their liquidity is thinner but more curated; their use cases are narrower but higher-value per dollar.

Considering this, JP Morgan is betting that the next meaningful wave of on-chain volume will come from that second group: treasurers who want Ethereum’s speed and integration without taking on the regulatory ambiguity that still surrounds a large part of DeFi.

A defensive pivot

Ultimately, MONY looks less like a revolution against the existing system and more like a defensive pivot inside it.

For a decade, fintech and crypto firms chipped away at banks’ payment, FX and custody businesses. Stablecoins then went after the most fundamental layer: deposits and cash management, offering a digital bearer-like alternative that could sit outside bank balance sheets entirely.

By launching a tokenized money-market fund on public rails, JP Morgan is trying to pull some of that migration back inside its own perimeter, even if it means cannibalizing parts of its traditional deposit base.

George Gatch, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, has emphasized “active management and innovation” as the core of the offering, implicitly contrasting it with the passive float-skimming model of stablecoin issuers.

Meanwhile, bank is not alone. BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have already moved into tokenized MMFs and tokenized cash-equivalent products.

So, JP Morgan’s entry shifts that trend from early experimentation to open competition among incumbents over who will own institutional “digital dollars” on public chains.

If that competition succeeds, the effect will not be the end of stablecoins or the triumph of DeFi.

Instead, it would be a quiet re-bundling as the settlement rails will be public, and the instruments running on them will look a lot like traditional money-market funds.

However, the institutions earning a spread on the world’s cash will, once again, be the same Wall Street names that dominated the pre-tokenization era.

JP Morgan Chase & Co. has formally entered the contest for on-chain cash, and the prize is not just a new product line. It is the billions of dollars in institutional capital that now sit in zero-yield stablecoins and early tokenized funds.

Zencoder faces steep competition from AI giants and well-funded startups Zencoder enters the AI orchestration market at a moment of intense competition.","Zencoder, the Silicon Valley startup that builds AI-powered coding agents, released a free desktop application on Monday that it says will fundamentally change how software engineers interact with artificial intelligence — moving the industry beyond the freewheeling era of ""vibe coding"" toward a more disciplined, verifiable approach to AI-assisted development.

The product, called Zenflow, introduces what the company describes as an ""AI orchestration layer"" that coordinates multiple AI agents to plan, implement, test, and review code in structured workflows. The launch is Zencoder's most ambitious attempt yet to differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded market dominated by tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and coding agents built directly by AI giants Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google.

""Chat UIs were fine for copilots, but they break down when you try to scale,"" said Andrew Filev, Zencoder's chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. ""Teams are hitting a wall where speed without structure creates technical debt. Zenflow replaces 'Prompt Roulette' with an engineering assembly line where agents plan, implement, and, crucially, verify each other's work.""

The announcement arrives at a critical moment for enterprise software development. Companies across industries have poured billions of dollars into AI coding tools over the past two years, hoping to dramatically accelerate their engineering output. Yet the promised productivity revolution has largely failed to materialize at scale.

Why AI coding tools have failed to deliver on their 10x productivity promise

Filev, who previously founded and sold the project management company Wrike to Citrix, pointed to a growing disconnect between AI coding hype and reality. While vendors have promised tenfold productivity gains, rigorous studies — including research from Stanford University — consistently show improvements closer to 20 percent.

""If you talk to real engineering leaders, I don't remember a single conversation where somebody vibe coded themselves to 2x or 5x or 10x productivity on serious engineering production,"" Filev said. ""The typical number you would hear would be about 20 percent.""

The problem, according to Filev, lies not with the AI models themselves but with how developers interact with them. The standard approach of typing requests into a chat interface and hoping for usable code works well for simple tasks but falls apart on complex enterprise projects.

Zencoder's internal engineering team claims to have cracked a different approach. Filev said the company now operates at roughly twice the velocity it achieved 12 months ago, not primarily because AI models improved, but because the team restructured its development processes.

""We had to change our process and use a variety of different best practices,"" he said.

Inside the four pillars that power Zencoder's AI orchestration platform

Zenflow organizes its approach around four core capabilities that Zencoder argues any serious AI orchestration platform must support.

Structured workflows replace ad-hoc prompting with repeatable sequences (plan, implement, test, review) that agents follow consistently. Filev drew parallels to his experience building Wrike, noting that individual to-do lists rarely scale across organizations, while defined workflows create predictable outcomes.

Spec-driven development requires AI agents to first generate a technical specification, then create a step-by-step plan, and only then write code. The approach became so effective that frontier AI labs including Anthropic and OpenAI have since trained their models to follow it automatically. The specification anchors agents to clear requirements, preventing what Zencoder calls ""iteration drift,"" or the tendency for AI-generated code to gradually diverge from the original intent.

Multi-agent verification deploys different AI models to critique each other's work. Because AI models from the same family tend to share blind spots, Zencoder routes verification tasks across model providers, asking Claude to review code written by OpenAI's models, or vice versa.

""Think of it as a second opinion from a doctor,"" Filev told VentureBeat. ""With the right pipeline, we see results on par with what you'd expect from Claude 5 or GPT-6. You're getting the benefit of a next-generation model today.""

Parallel execution lets developers run multiple AI agents simultaneously in isolated sandboxes, preventing them from interfering with each other's work. The interface provides a command center for monitoring this fleet, a significant departure from the current practice of managing multiple terminal windows.

How verification solves AI coding's biggest reliability problem

Zencoder's emphasis on verification addresses one of the most persistent criticisms of AI-generated code: its tendency to produce ""slop,"" or code that appears correct but fails in production or degrades over successive iterations.

The company's internal research found that developers who skip verification often fall into what Filev called a ""death loop."" An AI agent completes a task successfully, but the developer, reluctant to review unfamiliar code, moves on without understanding what was written. When subsequent tasks fail, the developer lacks the context to fix problems manually and instead keeps prompting the AI for solutions.

""They literally spend more than a day in that death loop,"" Filev said. ""That's why the productivity is not 2x, because they were running at 3x first, and then they wasted the whole day.""

The multi-agent verification approach also gives Zencoder an unusual competitive advantage over the frontier AI labs themselves. While Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google each optimize their own models, Zencoder can mix and match across providers to reduce bias.

""This is a rare situation where we have an edge on the frontier labs,"" Filev said. ""Most of the time they have an edge on us, but this is a rare case.""

Zencoder faces steep competition from AI giants and well-funded startups

Zencoder enters the AI orchestration market at a moment of intense competition. The company has positioned itself as a model-agnostic platform, supporting major providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini. In September, Zencoder expanded its platform to let developers use command-line coding agents from any provider within its interface.

That strategy reflects a pragmatic acknowledgment that developers increasingly maintain relationships with multiple AI providers rather than committing exclusively to one. Zencoder's universal platform approach lets it serve as the orchestration layer regardless of which underlying models a company prefers.

The company also emphasizes enterprise readiness, touting SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and ISO 42001 certifications along with GDPR compliance. These credentials matter for regulated industries like financial services and healthcare, where compliance requirements can block adoption of consumer-oriented AI tools.

But Zencoder faces formidable competition from multiple directions. Cursor and Windsurf have built dedicated AI-first code editors with devoted user bases. GitHub Copilot benefits from Microsoft's distribution muscle and deep integration with the world's largest code repository. And the frontier AI labs continue expanding their own coding capabilities.

Filev dismissed concerns about competition from the AI labs, arguing that smaller players like Zencoder can move faster on user experience innovation.

""I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion, and they're smart and moving fast, so I'm sure they will catch up fairly quickly,"" he said. ""That's why I said in the next six to 12 months, you're going to see a lot of this propagating through the whole space.""

The case for adopting AI orchestration now instead of waiting for better models

Technical executives weighing AI coding investments face a difficult timing question: Should they adopt orchestration tools now, or wait for frontier AI labs to build these capabilities natively into their models?

Filev argued that waiting carries significant competitive risk.

""Right now, everybody is under pressure to deliver more in less time, and everybody expects engineering leaders to deliver results from AI,"" he said. ""As a founder and CEO, I do not expect 20 percent from my VP of engineering. I expect 2x.""

He also questioned whether the major AI labs will prioritize orchestration capabilities when their core business remains model development.

""In the ideal world, frontier labs should be building the best-ever models and competing with each other, and Zencoders and Cursors need to build the best-ever UI and UX application layer on top of those models,"" Filev said. ""I don't see a world where OpenAI will offer you our code verifier, or vice versa.""

Zenflow launches as a free desktop application, with updated plugins available for Visual Studio Code and JetBrains integrated development environments. The product supports what Zencoder calls ""dynamic workflows,"" meaning the system automatically adjusts process complexity based on whether a human is actively monitoring and on the difficulty of the task at hand.

Zencoder said internal testing showed that replacing standard prompting with Zenflow's orchestration layer improved code correctness by approximately 20 percent on average.

What Zencoder's bet on orchestration reveals about the future of AI coding

Zencoder frames Zenflow as the first product in what it expects to become a significant new software category. The company believes every vendor focused on AI coding will eventually arrive at similar conclusions about the need for orchestration tools.

""I think the next six to 12 months will be all about orchestration,"" Filev predicted. ""A lot of organizations will finally reach that 2x. Not 10x yet, but at least the 2x they were promised a year ago.""

Rather than competing head-to-head with frontier AI labs on model quality, Zencoder is betting that the application layer (the software that helps developers actually use these models effectively) will determine winners and losers.

It is, Filev suggested, a familiar pattern from technology history.

""This is very similar to what I observed when I started Wrike,"" he said. ""As work went digital, people relied on email and spreadsheets to manage everything, and neither could keep up.""

The same dynamic, he argued, now applies to AI coding. Chat interfaces were designed for conversation, not for orchestrating complex engineering workflows. Whether Zencoder can establish itself as the essential layer between developers and AI models before the giants build their own solutions remains an open question.

But Filev seems comfortable with the race. The last time he spotted a gap between how people worked and the tools they had to work with, he built a company worth over a billion dollars.",https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/hCrfjXJOZJtvGggguzyQk/77b7b582d2e5725acbeb633ff25f8152/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_a_retro_desktop_computer_screen_with_a__c249085b-3fdb-4462-bdea-a029b200a558.webp?w=800&q=75,N,,2025-12-16 16:04:49.368042

In my theoretical research, I’ve found that price discrimination with competing firms can maximize consumer surplus.","This week’s newsletter originally appeared on Truth on the Market, a website full of scholarly commentary on law, economics, and more. Since it’s about a favorite topic of Economic Forces, I thought it would be of interest to readers.

On a Thursday in early September, more than 40 strangers logged into Instacart to buy eggs and test a hypothesis. They all selected the same store, the same brand, and the same pickup option. The only difference was the price they were offered: $3.99 for some, $4.79 for others.

We are, of course, supposed to not only be shocked by this, but also outraged. The Groundwork Collaborative, which organized the study, warned that companies like Instacart are jeopardizing trust in markets.

The New York Times ran it as the hook for a larger piece on algorithmic pricing: “the notion of a single price, offered to all customers for a predictable period, is breaking down.” The Times piece ends with Groundwork Executive Director Lindsay Owens saying: “This isn’t about managing scarcity or efficient markets… [It’s about] pushing to figure out the maximum amount you are willing to pay and squeeze it out of you.”

Both pieces blur together several distinct ideas: that prices vary, that prices are set by algorithms, that algorithms use your personal data, and that all of this harms consumers. But these are not the same thing.

Importantly, the study actually found no evidence that Instacart based prices on individual characteristics. As the Times piece correctly notes: “The Groundwork study found no evidence that Instacart was basing different prices on customers’ individual characteristics like income, ZIP code or shopping history.” Yet Groundwork uses the findings to call for Federal Trade Commission (FTC) action against “price discrimination not justified by differences in cost or distribution.” The Times frames the study as evidence of a trend toward algorithmic price discrimination.

To see why this leap fails, consider that there are at least four distinct reasons you might see different prices for the same product.

Four Reasons You Might See Different Prices

Randomized pricing experiments (A/B testing)

Some shoppers randomly see $3.99 for eggs; others see $4.79. The purpose is to learn how price-sensitive the market is across different product categories. This is standard A/B testing, the same methodology that virtually every online company uses to improve its products.

Netflix tests different thumbnail images. Retailers test prices. Random YouTubers, even tiny ones, test thumbnail placements. Over on Substack, I can A/B test article titles.

In the case of pricing, the randomization means the prices are not based on any individual characteristics. You get $4.79 for eggs because a random number generator assigned you to that treatment group, not because an algorithm profiled you.

Why would a company do this? When I teach my students about monopoly pricing, I draw the demand curve and assume the monopolist knows that curve and picks the optimal price. But real companies don’t see the demand curve. They want to learn how quantity demanded changes with price. Randomized experiments are how you learn.

Strategic randomization

Even without learning motives, firms might randomize prices as a competitive strategy. The intuition: if you always charge $5, your competitor charges $4.99 and steals your customers. If you always charge $4.99, they charge $4.98. In the jargon of game theory, no pure strategy equilibrium survives.

Instead, sellers randomize. Each seller picks one probability distribution over prices—not tailored to individuals, just one strategy for the whole market. Different customers end up paying different prices, but not because anyone profiled them. They just happened to show up when the price was high or low.

In practice, it can be hard to tell strategic randomization from price discrimination. A “sale” could be a random price variation, or it could be targeting price-sensitive shoppers who wait for discounts.

Dynamic pricing

Prices adjust over time in response to supply and demand. Uber’s surge pricing is the standard example: when demand spikes after a concert, prices rise to attract more drivers. Airlines do this. Hotels do this. The prices adjust based on observed market conditions, not based on individual profiles.

It’s not always easy to tell what is true dynamic pricing. Is an early-bird discount reflecting lower costs, lower demand for food services, or a strategic targeting of older people or people who are more flexible in terms of time? In practice, it can be both, but we can conceptually separate the ideas.

Price discrimination

Actual price discrimination is charging different prices for goods that are identical from the seller’s perspective, based on consumers’ willingness to pay. Senior discounts, student pricing, and coupons are all forms of price discrimination. The fear driving the Instacart coverage is that algorithms will profile you and charge you the maximum you’ll pay, which is an extreme version of price discrimination. This is the one that everyone seems worried about (I’ll say more on that later).

Again, it may not always be possible to tell these apart in practice. But we should be clear that these four phenomena have different causes, different welfare implications, and require different policy responses, if any.

The Narrative vs The Evidence

This brings us back to Instacart. The company says its pricing tests are “short term, randomized,” “never based on personal or behavioral characteristics,” and “never change in real time, including in response to supply and demand.” That’s a description of A/B testing. I’m not saying we should necessarily believe what they say, but the Groundwork study—despite its framing—found no evidence to the contrary.

The evidence, which is always subject to revision, points to category one. The narrative assumes category four. After reporting that the study found no evidence of personalized pricing, the article pivots: “But there is little doubt that Instacart and other online sellers have the ability to do so.” A volunteer speculates: “If they know how you shop, even on other items, they can use all that information to say, ‘We’re going to tailor the price to you… We’re going to get the maximum amount of money out of you that you’re prepared to pay and drain your pocketbook.’”

The article then notes that “Companies including Delta Air Lines, Amazon and Home Depot have been accused of experimenting with such personalized pricing, only to retreat after consumer backlash.” And it cautions that frequent price changes “could make it easier for companies to adopt personalized pricing strategies in the future.”

This is a story about something that might happen, not something that did happen. The study found randomized A/B testing. The narrative is about algorithmic profiling.

Would Banning Price Experiments Help Consumers?

Grant for a moment that A/B testing itself could be a concern. The implicit assumption in the discourse is that banning price experiments would help consumers. Stop the randomization, get stable prices, and consumers win.

But which stable price would Instacart use?

Let me pose a question that I posed on Twitter. For what classes of downward-sloping demand curves would consumers prefer the stable price to randomized prices around the same average?

The answer: none.

The intuition is that when prices are high, you buy less and limit your losses. When prices are low, you buy more and capture gains. The gains from low-price periods outweigh the losses from high-price periods.

The intuition that price stability being good helps consumers implicitly sneaks in an assumption about risk aversion that isn’t part of standard consumer-surplus analysis. Maybe you want to make that argument. Fine. But you should be aware that you’re making an argument that contradicts basic consumer theory.

Why Price Discrimination Isn’t Always Bad

So, the Instacart study found A/B testing, and I gave a simple (silly) counterexample where banning A/B testing wouldn’t help consumers anyway. That’s not the only thing at play, but we can’t just assume our intuition about constant pricing will ultimately help consumers.

Here’s what I find strange about the whole episode: we know companies engage in price discrimination. Senior discounts, student pricing, coupons, and loyalty programs are all price discrimination, out in the open, every day.

Spotify charges students $5.99 and everyone else $11.99 for the same service. Amazon Prime costs $6.99 per month if you’re on Medicaid, $14.99 if you’re not. Airlines have turned price discrimination into an art form. If Groundwork wanted to document price discrimination, they could walk into any grocery store and photograph the signs, or just open any app on their phone.

And even if they had found true personalized pricing (which they did not), the framing would still be overblown. Price discrimination sounds bad. The word “discrimination” does a lot of work there. It’s almost as scary as “algorithm.” Alexander MacKay of the University of Virginia, quoted in the Times, made this point: “Many pricing strategies resulted in higher costs for less price-sensitive, and therefore potentially higher-income, consumers, while lower-income consumers paid less.” Sure, that’s discrimination, but is it bad for consumers?

Remember the basics of monopoly theory. A monopolist charging a single price faces a tradeoff: lower the price to sell more units, or keep the price high and sell fewer. The monopolist leaves some transactions on the table; consumers who would pay more than the cost of production but less than the monopolist’s chosen price. This generates the standard deadweight loss from monopoly, and it’s why antitrust cares about market power in the first place.

The ability to use price discrimination changes the calculus. If the monopolist can charge different prices to different consumers, it can sell to those marginal buyers without lowering the price for everyone else. Output expands. The transactions that were left on the table now happen. In the extreme case of perfect price discrimination (charging everyone exactly their willingness to pay), the monopolist produces the efficient quantity.

People may worry that consumers don’t get the benefits of that output expansion. But that’s just the textbook case with a single seller. With competition, the results can be even better for consumers. In my theoretical research, I’ve found that price discrimination with competing firms can maximize consumer surplus. Competition forces firms to fight over price-sensitive consumers, while still serving the broader market.

Whether price discrimination helps or hurts consumers is an empirical question with a long literature. The answer varies by context. The empirical work is mixed but hardly supports blanket opposition. What you don’t find is evidence that price discrimination is systematically bad for consumers.

The Real Question

There are legitimate questions about algorithmic pricing that are only going to become more important. How do algorithms affect competitive dynamics? When does price variation reflect learning versus extraction? How much transparency should consumers have about how prices are set?

But the Instacart study doesn’t begin to touch these questions. It found that a company runs A/B tests on prices, something that’s been standard practice in retail for decades, just done now with digital tools. The innovation is speed and scale, not the basic practice.

Economics is not just an intuition pump. When someone says “this feels unfair,” we need to ask: compared to what? Compared to everyone paying the lowest price? That’s not happening. That’s not a plausible counterfactual. Compared to everyone paying the same price? Consumer-surplus theory says randomization around the same average price actually benefits consumers.

Price theory exists to cut through exactly this kind of confusion. Let’s use the tools we have.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dWtd!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f9f23ad-e9a5-41b3-9d1d-10a5012357b0_2752x1536.jpeg",N,,2025-12-16 15:03:03.315112

PMI readings from Germany, France and the U.K. were a bit of concern with the services sector activity showing a slowdown in the month of December.

Data from the U.S. Labor Department showed non-farm payroll employment climbed by 64,000 jobs in November after tumbling by 105,000 jobs in October. Economists had expected employment to rise by 50,000 jobs.

Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November from 4.4% in September. The unemployment rate was expected to tick up to 4.5%.

Although the data has increased the likelihood the Federal Reserve continuing to cut interest rates in the near future, the report has also raised concerns about the strength of the world's largest economy.

The pan European Stoxx 600 fell 0.47%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 ended down by 0.68%, Germany's DAX closed lower by 0.68% and France's CAC 40 drifted lower by 0.23%. Switzerland's SMI gained 0.15%.

Among other markets in Europe, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkiye closed weak.

Belgium, Czech Republic, Ireland and Russia ended higher.

In the UK market, Babcock International, BP, Informa, Metlen Energy & Metals, Shell and Polar Capital Technology Trust lost 2.4 to 3.6%.

Rolls-Royce Holdings ended on a weak note despite announcing plans to launch a £200 million interim share buyback program starting January 2, 2026.

Centrica shares declined after the company sold Spirit Energy's 15% stake in the Cygnus gas field to Serica Energy for 98 million pounds sterling.

Glencore, Auto Trader Group, Melrose Industries, BAE Systems and Haleon also ended notably lower.

EasyJet climbed 3.2%. Endeavour Mining, JD Sports Fashion, Fresnillo, Convatec Group, St. James's Place, 3i Group, Assoicated British Foods, Legal & General and Marks & Spencer also posted strong gains.

In the German market, Zalando rallied about 4%. Merck, Gea Group and Adidas gained 1 to 2%.

Rheinmetall tumbled 4.7%. Bayer, Fresenius, Commerzbank, SAP, MTU Aero Engines, BMW and Porsche Automobil lost 1 to 3%.

In the French market, Bureau Veritas climbed 2.3%. Saint Gobain, LVMH and Accor gained 1.2 to 2%.

Kering gained about 1.5%. The stock attracted attention after the company sold a majority stake in its Fifth Avenue property to Ardian for $690 million, while retaining 40% ownership.

Renault, Thales, Airbus, EssilorLuxottica, TotalEnergies, STMicroElectronics, Schneider Electric, ArcelorMittal and Publicis Groupe lost 1 to 2%.

The U.K. unemployment rate rose slightly in the three months to October, data from the Office for National Statistics showed.

The jobless rate climbed to 5.1% in the three months to October from 5% in the preceding period.

In the three months to October, average earnings excluding bonuses grew 4.6% from the prior year, which was slightly faster than the forecast of 4.5%.

In November, payroll employees decreased by 171,000 or 0.6 percent from the prior year. Compared to last month, employment grew 38,000 to 30.3 million.

Including bonuses, average earnings advanced 4.7% in the August to October, data showed.

Data from S&P Global showed the UK S&P Global Composite PMI picked up to 52.1 in December from November's 51.2 and surpassing market forecasts of 51.6.

The Services PMI came in at 52.1 compared to 51.3 a month earlier, while the manufacturing PMI score was 51.2 in December, up from 50.2 in November.

Data from S&P Global showed the HCOB Flash Germany Composite PMI fell to 51.5 in December, the lowest in four months, compared to 52.4 in November and below forecasts of 52.4.

Private sector activity slowed due to sluggishness in underlying demand. The Services PMI for December came in at 52.6 compared to 53.1 a month earlier, while the manufacturing PMI was at 47.7, compared to 48.2 a month earlier.

The HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite PMI fell to 51.9 in December, its lowest level in three months, down from 52.8 in November. Private sector PMI came in at 52.6, compared ot 53.6, while manufacturing PMI was 49.2 in the month, as against 59.6 in the previous month.

The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for the Euro Area climbed by 8.7 points from the prior month to 33.7 in December, the highest reading in five months.

Data from Eurostat showed the Eurozone's trade surplus widened to €18.4 billion in October 2025 from €7.1 billion a year earlier.

According to flash survey results from S&P Global, France's headline HCOB composite output index posted 50.1 in December, down from 50.4 in November. However, a reading above the threshold 50.0 indicates expansion.

He noted that, unlike Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) , Oracle is not currently earning its cost of capital on its massive AI investments.
“If AI monetization gets pushed out… to 2030 or whenever, then Oracle will have fundamental financial problems,” Chanos warned.","Legendary short-seller Jim Chanos is sounding the alarm on the AI infrastructure boom, warning that a critical accounting oversight regarding Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips creates a “massive financial risk” for the sector's aggressive spenders.

Depreciation Trap

In a recent podcast interview, Chanos argued that data center operators, specifically Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) and “neocloud” provider CoreWeave Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) , are overstating their future profitability by relying on unrealistic depreciation schedules for their artificial intelligence (AI) hardware.

The core of Chanos' bearish thesis is the estimated lifespan of the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering the AI revolution.

While hyperscalers and neoclouds typically depreciate these expensive assets over six years, Chanos contends that the relentless pace of Nvidia's innovation renders them obsolete much faster.

He noted that rental rates for Nvidia's “Hopper” chips have already plummeted roughly 28% year-over-year as newer models enter the market. If the useful economic life of a chip is closer to three or four years rather than six, companies must drastically increase their annual depreciation expenses, which would crush reported earnings.

“If the chips last for three years, you have to depreciate a third of what you spend,” Chanos explained. “That's the bet you have to make if you're a CoreWeave investor.”

Benzinga reached out to Nvidia for comment on Chanos’ claims regarding GPU depreciation schedules and the useful life of its chips, but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Oracle's ‘Fundamental' Problem

Chanos singled out Oracle as the most vulnerable among the tech giants. He noted that, unlike Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) , Oracle is not currently earning its cost of capital on its massive AI investments.

He described the company's aggressive spending spree as a “bet the company” strategy that leaves little room for error.

“If AI monetization gets pushed out… to 2030 or whenever, then Oracle will have fundamental financial problems,” Chanos warned.

Worse Than 1999

The investor views the current cycle as potentially riskier than the Dotcom bubble. In the late 1990s, the companies buying telecom equipment were profitable giants like General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) .

Today, the primary customers driving demand for compute—startups like OpenAI and Anthropic—are burning cash.

If venture capital funding dries up or sentiment shifts, Chanos predicts the order books for companies like CoreWeave could evaporate quickly, leaving them with massive debts and obsolete hardware.

NVDA Outperforms The Market In 2025

While NVDA’s shares have advanced by 27.46% year-to-date, the Nasdaq 10 has delivered 19.51% returns in the same period.

On Monday, Nvidia’s shares closed 0.73% higher at $176.29 apiece. The stock has advanced by 21.84% over the last six months and dropped 5.53% in the last month.

It maintains a weaker price trend over the short and medium terms but a strong trend in the long term, with a poor value ranking. Additional performance details, as per Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings, are available here.

The new model, dubbed GPT Image 1.5, is available starting Tuesday to all ChatGPT users and via the API. It’s the latest escalation in the competition with Google’s Gemini after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month declared a “code red” in a leaked internal memo. The memo detailed OpenAI’s plans to regain its position as the AI leader after Google had begun to take market share following the release of Gemini 3, its latest flagship model, and Nano Banana Pro, the newest version of Google’s viral image generator — both of which have topped the LMArena leaderboard across multiple benchmarks.

Google maintains its lead even after OpenAI responded to its success last week with the launch of GPT-5.2, pitching it as its most advanced model yet for developers and everyday professional use. OpenAI had reportedly been planning to release a new image generator in early January, accelerating those plans with this week’s announcement. Its last image model release was GPT Image 1 in April.

GPT Image 1.5 arrives as image and video generators advance beyond prototypes and gain more production-ready capabilities. Like Nano Banana Pro, ChatGPT Image offers post-production features, providing more granular edit controls to maintain visual consistency, like facial likeness, lighting, composition, and color tone across edits.

Most GenAI image tools are bad at iteration, so this would be a huge step up. Asked for a specific change, like “adjust the facial expression” or “make lighting colder,” models will often reinterpret the entire image, leading to a lack of consistency.

The update isn’t just about new features. ChatGPT images will also now be accessible via a dedicated entry point in the ChatGPT sidebar that works “more like a creative studio,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in a blog post Tuesday.

“The new image viewing and editing screens make it easier to create images that match your vision or get inspiration from trending prompts and preset filters,” Simo wrote.

On top of the new image generator, OpenAI is introducing new ways to improve the ChatGPT experience with more visual elements. The plan is to make search queries display more visuals with clear sources, which could be helpful for tasks like converting measurements or checking sports scores, per Simo.

“When you’re creating, you should be able to see and shape the thing you’re making. When visuals tell a story better than words alone, ChatGPT should include them,” Simo wrote. “When you need a quick answer or the next step lives in another tool, it should be right there. As we do this, we can keep closing the distance between what’s in your mind and your ability to bring it to life.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/skating-3.png?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-12-16 15:03:18.334886

According to UBS, NVIDIA commands 71.2% of the cloud accelerator location share, which includes GPUs and other types of ASICs. The study also included AMD, and other ASICs. For the AMD front, the situation is entirely different as the data shows AMD only captures 5.8% of the cloud accelerator location share. The remaining portion is split between ASICs designed by the likes of AWS, Meta, Broadcom, MediaTek, and many others, which command 22.3%.

For NVIDIA, the company has managed to penetrate its GPUs in 258 datacenter locations, serving as cloud GPU providers. This is a significant number considering that some of these customers are ordering tens and even hundreds of thousands of GPUs at once, especially as the demand expands. NVIDIA is still the backbone of the entire AI infrastructure, and even its older GPUs, which include A100 and H100, are capturing a significant part of the GPU cloud market share. As ""Blackwell"" SKUs, designed for a million GPU scale systems, are scaled, and we enter the ""Rubin"" era, NVIDIA's lead may only expand. At the same time, AMD sits at 5.8% with its Instinct MI GPUs. These are a little rarer as they are only present at 21 datacenter locations out of the 359 in total. This makes AMD's solutions a rarity in cloud offerings, but that situation is slowly changing as more hyperscalers adopt AMD accelerators. The total addressable market is also expanding, which means that the room for some market share exchange between AMD and NVIDIA is also possible. For custom ASIC designs, the market is massive. UBS estimates that 22.3% of the datacenter locations awe powered by custom designs. This is likely driven by Google's TPUs and AWS Trainium chips, which power today's best AI models.

If this market becomes a trillion dollars market, 5.8% is really significant. The question is if AMD will manage to increase this percentage with Helios, or if ASICs will win the race of becoming the alternative to CUDA.

As for Nvidia, 70% of a trillion dollars market are enough to buy a country or a US state.

On Tuesday, the company announced its “new flagship image generation model,” GPT Image 1.5, which it said has a better ability to follow instructions, edit photos in specific ways, and generate results up to four times more quickly. It’s available today to all users.

The new model will be able to better “match your intent,” the company wrote in a blog post, particularly when modifying an existing photo. The changes include “more useful photo edits, more believable clothing and hairstyle try-ons, alongside stylistic filters and conceptual transformations that retain the essence of the original image.” A new dedicated Images tab in the ChatGPT sidebar will include preset filters and trending prompts and ideas, per the company.

OpenAI is positioning the new model and features as especially useful tools for enterprise, as part of its push to turn a profit under pressure from investors. And the image generation competition is heating up among AI labs, particularly after the viral success of Google’s Nano Banana.

It’s “a shift from novelty image generation to practical, high-fidelity visual creation,” the company said in a release, “turning ChatGPT into a fast, flexible creative studio for everyday edits, expressive transformations, and real-world use.” A section of the blog post also focused on how the image generation tools could be useful for work and product images.

Why it matters: Users have been marveling at the image advances in Google's Nano Banana, putting the pressure on OpenAI to show real progress to keep up.

Driving the news: The new ChatGPT Images is designed for both editing images and generating them.

OpenAI says the tool offers precise edits while keeping details intact, and generates images up to four times faster.

The update will appear in a new ChatGPT sidebar for all users, and in the API as GPT Image 1.5.

What they're saying: The original ChatGPT interface wasn't designed for creating images, Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, said in a blog post Tuesday.

""The new image viewing and editing screens make it easier to create images that match your vision or get inspiration from trending prompts and preset filters,"" Simo says.

""The model adheres to your intent more reliably — down to the small details — changing only what you ask for while keeping elements like lighting, composition, and people's appearance consistent across inputs, outputs, and subsequent edits,"" OpenAI said in a separate blog post.

Nano Banana has been integrated into Adobe Firefly and Photoshop since its release.

But ChatGPT Images' integration into ChatGPT (still the most popular chatbot in the world), could pose another big threat to Adobe, the once undisputed king of photo editing.

OpenAI teased the release of ChatGPT Images in a post on X with a yearbook-style image of CEO Sam Altman, presumably created with the new tool, and the words ""Most likely to launch a new image model.""

Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE: LLY) is a prominent player in the pharmaceutical industry, known for its innovative treatments and strong market presence. The company has made significant strides in the obesity therapeutics market, which has been a key driver of its recent success. On December 16, 2025, Daiwa upgraded Eli Lilly's stock from a Neutral to a Buy rating, with the stock price at $1,062.71 at the time of the upgrade.

Bank of America has also shown confidence in Eli Lilly's potential, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. Analyst Jason Gerberry slightly adjusted the price target from $1,286 to $1,268, even though the stock was trading around $1,055. This adjustment reflects a strategic outlook rather than a lack of confidence, as Gerberry sees ""room for stock upside"" due to Eli Lilly's successful launch of key obesity treatments.

Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that Steve Cahillane will serve as CEO starting Jan. 1. Once Kraft Heinz becomes two companies – which is expected to happen in the second half of next year – Cahillane will become the CEO of what is currently called Global Taste Elevation Co. That company will house some of Kraft Heinz’s biggest sellers, including Kraft Mac & Cheese, Philadelphia cream cheese and Heinz.

“Like millions of people around the world, I have a deeply personal connection to the Kraft Heinz brands, dating back to my childhood,” Cahillane said in a statement. “I’ve devoted my entire career to building brands, and the opportunity to do the same with Kraft Heinz’s iconic portfolio is a dream come true.”

The remaining company, dubbed North American Grocery Co., will include slower-selling brands like Maxwell House, Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. Kraft Heinz hasn’t yet named a CEO of that company.

Kraft Heinz said Carlos Abrams-Rivera, who has been its CEO since January 2024, will serve as an adviser to the company until March 2026.

Kraft Heinz announced in September that it would split into two companies a decade after a merger of the brands created one of the biggest food manufacturers on the planet.

Kraft Heinz said the separation would make it more agile and able to focus resources on products with the most growth potential.

Kraft Heinz and other packaged food companies have struggled as consumers shift away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that they sell, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid. The push to remove artificial flavors and dyes added further costs.

Big food companies have also had trouble distinguishing their products from cheaper store brands.

Cahillane presided over a similar breakup at Kellogg Co. in 2023. He served as CEO of Kellanova — which housed popular brands like Cheez-Its, Pringles and Pop-Tarts — until it was acquired last year by M&M’s maker Mars Inc. The remaining company, cereal maker WK Kellogg Co., was acquired by Italian confectioner Ferrero in July.

Before joining Kellogg in 2017, Cahillane had executive roles at The Nature’s Bounty Co., Coca-Cola Co. and AB InBev.

Kraft Heinz board Chairman Miguel Patricio said Cahillane is “uniquely qualified” to lead the company.

“His track record and experience in the industry are unparalleled and will be invaluable as we embark on this next chapter,” Patricio said in a statement.

In our Case of the Week, the Federal Circuit reviewed cross-appeals from an inter partes review of IBM’s U.S. Patent No. 7,631,346, and affirmed on all counts. The ’346 patent is directed to systems and methods for single sign-on operations, permitting a computer user to create and log into several accounts using a single set of login credentials. IBM has asserted the ’346 patent against Zynga, Airbnb, and other online services using third-party sign-in options like, “Sign in with Facebook.” In this appeal, the Court affirmed the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decision that certain broader claims of the ’346 patent are unpatentable, and also affirmed the Board’s decision that claims directed to certain narrower applications were not shown to be unpatentable.

The IPR in this case was petitioned by Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. d/b/a Rakuten Rewards, and joined by Zillow following institution. Claim 1 was treated as representative of the broader claims held invalid, and recited a “second system” (e.g. a website like Zillow’s) receiving from a “first system” (e.g. a social media network like Facebook) “an identifier associated with the user,” and using that identifier to create an account for the user, permitting them to access “protected resources” on the second system. Claim 5 was treated as representative of the claims that were upheld, and recited the additional requirement that when the second system determines it needs more user information, it sends a request to the first system and receives the additional information from the first system. As relevant to the appeal, the Board construed “protected resources” as requiring a Uniform Resource locator (URL)—e.g. an “http://” web address—or more broadly, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

Rakuten’s petition alleged that all claims were anticipated by a published Japanese patent application referred to as “Sunada,” and also asserted several obviousness grounds based on Sunada and other references. Rakuten abandoned its anticipation theory in view of the Board’s claim constructions, but continued to assert for obviousness purposes that Sunada’s disclosure of “web applications” met the “protected resources” limitation, which the Board ultimately agreed with. On appeal, IBM argued that because the Board repeatedly stated Sunada “suggests” the presence of URLs or URIs by referring to “web applications,” it was in fact applying an obviousness theory that had not been raised in Rakuten’s petition. For its part, Zillow argued that IBM was not permitted to second-guess decisions related to institution, citing 35 U.S.C. § 314(d) (providing that institution decisions are unreviewable). The Court rejected Zillow’s argument, explaining that it was of course permitted to review whether the Board adhered to the petition, which was not a review of the institution decision. The Court also rejected IBM’s argument, explaining that the Board never proposed Sunada be “modified” in any way to accommodate URLs or URIs. Instead, the Board had simply found that a person of ordinary skill would reasonably understand Sunada to disclose URL or URI-associated resources with its disclosure of “web applications,” and that finding was supported by substantial evidence, so the Court affirmed the decision of unpatentability.

Meanwhile, in its cross-appeal, Zillow argued that the upheld claim 5 was nearly identical to another claim 14 the Board had found invalid over Sunada, with the only difference being that claim 14 recited receiving the additional user information from a “fourth system” instead of from the “first system.” Zillow argued that both rulings could not be correct, and the Federal Circuit allowed that it “almost has a point.” However, the “fourth system” in the ’346 patent was understood to refer to the user’s own device, not the system from which the first round of user information was supplied. The Court found this “makes all the difference,” as Sunada taught querying the user herself for additional information, but not the first system. Accordingly, the Court also affirmed the board’s decision that claim 5 and others were not shown to be unpatentable.

Coda Development s.r.o. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Appeal No. 2023-1880 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 8, 2025)

Following a $64 million jury verdict against Goodyear in a trade secret and inventorship case concerning self-inflating tire technology, the Federal Circuit affirmed judgment as a matter of law for Goodyear, finding no misappropriation and denying correction of inventorship. In finding no misappropriation, the Court explained that the alleged trade secrets were either not defined with sufficient particularity, not kept secret, or not actually used by Goodyear, and thus each failed to satisfy one or more of the showings necessary for misappropriation. The denial of Coda’s correction of inventorship claim was also proper because Coda’s sole basis for reversal depended on overturning the district court’s JMOL on the trade secret claims, which the Federal Circuit affirmed. Separately, the Court found that the district court did not improperly disregard jury findings, because the jury never compared the scope of the alleged trade secrets and the patent claims, and the district court correctly concluded that differences in scope meant the trade secret evidence was insufficient to establish sole inventorship.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15786_584.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:05:00.420318

Many of the verbal and written responses to the FDA proposed addressing the problems by decoupling inspections from the review of drug approval applications.

A spokesperson for the Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group that represents generic and biosimilar manufacturers, told BioSpace that off-patent drugmakers undergo inspections by both the FDA and state-level authorities.","When the FDA asked manufacturers about the biggest regulatory hurdles to reshoring drug production this year, the branded medicine industry spoke with one voice. Leading drugmakers including AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson and Merck told the FDA that pre-approval inspections are among their biggest challenges—and shared a vision for how the agency can alleviate the problem of complete response letters (CRLs) tied to these inspections.

The FDA consulted with the industry about manufacturing challenges, first in person and then in writing, as part of the development of its PreCheck program. While the agency designed the program to support the construction of new facilities in the U.S., drugmakers used the consultation to call for changes to the pre-approval inspection (PAI) process for existing production plants.

Currently, a manufacturing facility undergoes an FDA inspection when it is used to make a medicine that has been submitted for approval. Kevin Fitzpatrick, senior vice president for quality assurance at AbbVie, cited an example to explain the challenges created by that model.

“We brought on a new U.S. manufacturing facility two years ago and the PAI for that facility was weeks prior to our PDUFA date,” Fitzpatrick said at the FDA’s PreCheck meeting in September. “At that point, we’re under a lot of pressure. Any questions or comments or observations that come up [during the PAI] are very difficult to resolve in that time frame.”

Other attendees made similar points. Miguelina Matthews, head of quality intelligence, advocacy and pharmacopoeia affairs at Sanofi, told the FDA that the unpredictability of inspections is a factor that can lead to CRLs. Drugmakers reiterated the concerns in their written feedback to the FDA.

Many of the verbal and written responses to the FDA proposed addressing the problems by decoupling inspections from the review of drug approval applications. Rather than only inspect sites when they are included in filings for approval, the drugmakers said the FDA could check whether plants are compliant before authorization applications are filed to give companies time to fix issues before they cause CRLs.

Aligning Inspection Timings

Establishing clearer inspection timelines is one of the ways the PreCheck program could benefit the industry, Guggenheim Securities analysts said in a note to investors. Under the current process, manufacturers can lack the forewarning they require to ensure a production run is active when the FDA visits. Karen Wolfrom, global head of regulatory affairs at Lonza, told the FDA the alignment problem has a particular impact on contract manufacturers because they commonly make batches of different products for different clients at different times.

Lonza and a client will predict the point in the approval review process that the FDA will inspect a site. “In the meantime, we have other important medicines that are coming into the suite. Do we delay them going into the suite so that we can keep it open and idle to do an inspection for this particular product? There’s that dance,” Wolfrom said at the September meeting. “It’s terrible to have a submission delayed because we have to be in active manufacturing at the time.”

Aligning manufacturing runs with FDA inspections is particularly challenging when a company only needs a small quantity of drug product—for example, because it is targeting a rare disease. Christopher Shilling, chief regulatory officer at Forge Biologics, told BioSpace that gene therapy clients may only need a few batches. That means “jumping through hoops” to align inspections with the manufacturing of those batches, he said.

The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), a trade group that represents Forge and other cell and gene therapy companies, used its written feedback to the FDA to add to the calls for decoupling inspections from approval timelines.

ARM paired the request with the suggestion that the FDA inspect different parts of a facility, such as a vector suite and cleanroom, as they become ready rather than waiting to inspect the entire facility at once. The trade group said the move to phased or modular inspections could help identify issues earlier. Johnson & Johnson proposed a similar idea in its written feedback to the FDA.

The Generic Industry Weighs In

While branded drugmakers led the calls for changes to PAIs, the generics industry has its own inspection challenges. A spokesperson for the Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group that represents generic and biosimilar manufacturers, told BioSpace that off-patent drugmakers undergo inspections by both the FDA and state-level authorities. Manufacturers must assign staff to host inspectors and manage document requests for each of these inspections.

Cooperation between the FDA and state authorities could reduce this redundancy, the spokesperson said. They added that the mutual recognition agreements that allow the FDA to use the inspections of certain overseas regulatory agencies provide a potential model for how agencies within the U.S. could share workloads to reduce burdens on their own teams and the companies they inspect.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/e00a46b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/724x407+0+37/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F84%2Fd2%2Fb29afb5f4aadad17fc4b4b917390%2Fistock-1212554542.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 17:03:00.182804

Mixed Bag For Rest Of U.S. Markets Vanguard isn't as cautious on all U.S. asset classes.
Looking For Gains Beyond S&P 500 On the other hand, Vanguard is somewhat bullish on overseas markets.","Given Vanguard's enormous influence on the S&P 500, its view on the market holds lots of weight. And its just-released outlook may concern some investors.

The giant ETF and mutual fund company is forecasting U.S. stocks will rise just 3.5% to 5.5% annually over the next 10 years. That's an enormous disappointment as it's well below the S&P 500's long-term average annual return of roughly 10%.

It's also anemic next to Vanguard's expected annual inflation of 1.5% to 2.5%. And it's not much better than Vanguard's U.S. bond return forecast of 3.8% to 4.8% annually in the next decade.

And it gets worse. Vanguard thinks U.S. growth stocks will only return 2.3% to 4.3% annually in the next decade — putting them among the worst performers. That's in stark contrast with recent years where growth stocks have led the way. A large portion of this year's roughly 17% return by the S&P 500 is due to megacap growth stocks.

""Even at current stretched valuations, rising earnings growth could provide momentum for stocks in the near term,"" Vanguard said. ""However, our conviction is growing stronger that long-term prospects for U.S. equities are subdued.""

Mixed Bag For Rest Of U.S. Markets

Vanguard isn't as cautious on all U.S. asset classes. The asset manager thinks U.S. value stocks could be the sleeper winners with a 5.8% to 7.8% annualized gain in the next 10 years.

And the firm is calling for U.S. small caps, largely left behind in the ongoing rally, to gain 5.1% to 7.1% annually over the next decade.

Looking For Gains Beyond S&P 500

On the other hand, Vanguard is somewhat bullish on overseas markets.

It's looking for 5.2% to 7.2% annual returns the next 10 years from developed markets other than the U.S. And globally, minus the U.S., Vanguard expects annualized gains of 4.9% to 6.9%.

With all that said, Vanguard knows stocks can be unpredictable and subject to many factors.

""It is important to recognize that valuations tend to be poor predictors of performance over the short or even intermediate term and should not serve as a primary reason for changing portfolio allocations,"" Vanguard said.

Vanguard's Guarded Outlook

Annualized returns for next decade

Asset class Expected return U.S. stocks 3.5%-5.5% Global ex-U.S. stocks 4.9%-6.9% Developed markets ex-U.S. stocks 5.2%-7.2% Emerging markets stocks 3.5%-5.5% U.S. value 5.8%-7.8% U.S. growth 2.3%-4.3% U.S. large-cap 3.4%-5.4% U.S. small-cap 5.1%-7.1% U.S. REITs 3.2%-5.2%

The new target represents significant upside from Southwest’s current price of $41.72, which is trading near its 52-week high of $42.20 after gaining 9.36% in the past week.

The upgrade comes as Southwest implements significant changes to its commercial strategy, moving away from its traditional ""one size fits all"" pricing model toward more diverse offerings including basic fares, assigned seating, extra legroom options, and bag fees. Barclays noted that Southwest’s average segment passenger fare had trailed competitors by 20-30% through mid-2025. InvestingPro data shows Southwest has delivered strong returns of 31.04% over the past six months, suggesting investors are optimistic about these strategic shifts.

With assigned seats and extra legroom options scheduled to launch late next month, Barclays expects Southwest to see ""material improvement in relative revenue generation"" and begin closing the fare gap with competitors, particularly in early 2026 as these new features are fully implemented.

Barclays projects Southwest’s earnings per share to exceed $4 in 2026 and rise above $6 in 2027, with revised estimates 60% and 70% above current consensus respectively. The firm specifically forecasts $4.50 EPS in 2026 and $6.10 for 2027. These projections represent substantial growth from the current FY2025 EPS forecast of $0.97, explaining Southwest’s elevated P/E ratio of 62.75.

Southwest experienced earnings volatility throughout 2025, which Barclays attributes to the pace of commercial changes, weaker travel demand, and government-related disruptions. Despite these challenges, InvestingPro identifies Southwest as a prominent player in the Passenger Airlines industry with several additional insights available. For deeper analysis, including Southwest’s comprehensive Pro Research Report, visit InvestingPro.

In other recent news, Southwest Airlines updated its 2025 earnings expectations, projecting earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of approximately $500 million, down from its previous forecast of $600 million to $800 million. This revision is attributed to lower revenue from a government shutdown and increased fuel costs. Southwest Airlines also announced plans to open a new crew base at Austin Bergstrom International Airport in March 2026, creating over 2,000 jobs by mid-2027. In another development, Southwest has entered into a partnership with German carrier Condor to offer transatlantic connections starting January 19, 2026. UBS maintained a Neutral rating and a $43.00 price target for Southwest Airlines, noting the company’s confidence in meeting its 2026 and 2027 initiative targets. BMO Capital initiated coverage on the airline with a Market Perform rating and a $43.00 price target, highlighting concerns over margin pressures and load factors. These developments reflect a mix of strategic expansions and financial adjustments for the airline.

Expanding into video analysis With the newly released Molmo 2, the focus is video.
The original Molmo, released last September, could analyze static images with precision rivaling closed-source competitors.
And unlike some commercial systems, Molmo 2 doesn’t process live video streams.","How many penguins are in this wildlife video? Can you track the orange ball in the cat video? Which teams are playing, and who scored? Give me step-by-step instructions from this cooking video?

Those are examples of queries that can be fielded by Molmo 2, a new family of open-source AI vision models from the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) that can watch, track, analyze and answer questions about videos: describing what’s happening, and pinpointing exactly where and when.

Ai2 cites benchmark tests showing Molmo 2 beating open-source models on short video analysis and tracking, and surpassing closed systems like Google’s Gemini 3 on video tracking, while approaching their performance on other image and video tasks.

In a series of demos for reporters recently at the Ai2 offices in Seattle, researchers showed how Molmo 2 could analyze a variety of short video clips in different ways.

In a soccer clip, researchers asked what defensive mistake led to a goal. The model analyzed the sequence and pointed to a failure to clear the ball effectively.

In a baseball clip, the AI identified the teams (Angels and Mariners), the player who scored (#55), and explained how it knew the home team by reading uniforms and stadium branding.

Given a cooking video, the model returned a structured recipe with ingredients and step-by-step instructions, including timing pulled from on-screen text.

Asked to count how many flips a dancer performed, the model didn’t just say “five” — it returned timestamps and pixel coordinates for each one.

In a tracking demo, the model followed four penguins as they moved around the frame, maintaining a consistent ID for each bird even when they overlapped.

When asked to “track the car that passes the #13 car in the end,” the model watched an entire racing clip first, understood the query, then went back and identified the correct vehicle. It tracked cars that went in and out of frame.

Big year for Ai2

Molmo 2, announced Tuesday morning, caps a year of major milestones for the Seattle-based nonprofit, which has developed a loyal following in business and scientific circles by building fully open AI systems. Its approach contrasts sharply with the closed or partially open approaches of industry giants like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Meta.

Founded in 2014 by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Ai2 this year landed $152 million from the NSF and Nvidia, partnered on an AI cancer research initiative led by Seattle’s Fred Hutch, and released Olmo 3, a text model rivaling Meta, DeepSeek and others.

Ai2 has seen more than 21 million downloads of its models this year and nearly 3 billion queries across its systems, said Ali Farhadi, the Ai2 CEO, during the media briefing last week at the institute’s new headquarters on the northern shore of Seattle’s Lake Union.

As a nonprofit, Ai2 isn’t trying to compete commercially with the tech giants — it’s aiming to advance the state of the art and make those advances freely available.

The institute has released open models for text (OLMo), images (the original Molmo), and now video — building toward what he described as a unified model that reasons across all modalities.

“We’re basically building models that are competitive with the best things out there,” Farhadi said — but in a completely open manner, for a succession of different media and situations.

In addition to Molmo 2, Ai2 on Monday released Bolmo, an experimental text model that processes language at the character level rather than in word fragments — a technical shift that improves handling of spelling, rare words, and multilingual text.

Expanding into video analysis

With the newly released Molmo 2, the focus is video. To be clear: the model analyzes video, it doesn’t generate video — think understanding footage rather than creating it.

The original Molmo, released last September, could analyze static images with precision rivaling closed-source competitors. It introduced a “pointing” capability that let it identify specific objects within a frame. Molmo 2 brings that same approach to video and multi-image understanding.

The concept isn’t new. Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s GPT-4o, and Meta’s Perception LM can all process video. But in line with Ai2’s broader mission as a nonprofit institute, Molmo 2 is fully open, with its model weights, training code, and training data all publicly released.

That’s different from “open weight” models that release the final product but not the original recipe, and a stark contrast to closed systems from Google, OpenAI and others.

The distinction is not just an academic principle. Ai2’s approach means developers can trace a model’s behavior back to its training data, customize it for specific uses, and avoid being locked into a vendor’s ecosystem.

Ai2 also emphasizes efficiency. For example, Meta’s Perception LM was trained on 72.5 million videos. Molmo 2 used about 9 million, relying on high-quality human annotations.

The result, Ai2 claims, is a smaller, more efficient model that outperforms their own much larger model from last year, and comes close to matching commercial systems from Google and OpenAI, while being simple enough to run on a single machine.

When the original Molmo introduced its pointing capability last year — allowing the model to identify specific objects in an image — competing models quickly adopted the feature.

“We know they adopted our data because they perform exactly as well as we do,” said Ranjay Krishna, who leads Ai2’s computer vision team. Krishna is also a University of Washington assistant professor, and several of his graduate students also work on the project.

Farhadi frames the competitive dynamic differently than most in the industry.

“If you do real open source, I would actually change the word competition to collaboration,” he said. “Because there is no need to compete. Everything is out there. You don’t need to reverse engineer. You don’t need to rebuild it. Just grab it, build on top of it, do the next thing. And we love it when people do that.”

A work in progress

At the same time, Molmo 2 has some clear constraints. The tracking capability — following objects across frames — currently tops out at about 10 items. Ask it to track a crowd or a busy highway, and the model can’t keep up.

“This is a very, very new capability, and it’s one that’s so experimental that we’re starting out very small,” Krishna said. “There’s no technological limit to this, it just requires more data, more examples of really crowded scenes.”

Long-form video also remains a challenge. The model performs well on short clips, but analyzing longer footage requires compute that Ai2 isn’t yet willing to spend. In the playground launching alongside Molmo 2, uploaded videos are limited to 15 seconds.

And unlike some commercial systems, Molmo 2 doesn’t process live video streams. It analyzes recordings after the fact. Krishna said the team is exploring streaming capabilities for applications like robotics, where a model would need to respond to observations in real time, but that work is still early.

“There are methods that people have come up with in terms of processing videos over time, streaming videos,” Krishna said. “Those are directions we’re looking into next.”",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/allen-institute-for-ai-rivals-go.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 15:03:26.537529

The company says it has the answer with its new Nemotron 3 family of open models.

Developers and engineers can use the new models to create domain-specific AI agents or applications without having to build a foundation model from scratch. Nvidia is also releasing most of its training data and its reinforcement learning (RL) libraries for use by anyone looking to build AI agents.

“This is Nvidia’s response to DeepSeek disrupting the AI market,” said Wyatt Mayham of Northwest AI Consulting. “They’re offering a ‘business-ready’ open alternative with enterprise support and hardware optimization.”

Introducing Nemotron 3 Nano, Super, and Ultra

Nemotron 3 features what Nvidia calls a “breakthrough hybrid latent mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture”. The model comes in three sizes:

Nano: The smallest and most “compute-cost-efficient,” intended for targeted, highly-efficient tasks like quick information retrieval, software debugging, content summarization, and AI assistant workflows. The 30-billion-parameter model activates 3 billion parameters at a time for speed and has a 1-million-token context window, allowing it to remember and connect information over multi-step tasks.

Super: An advanced, high-accuracy reasoning model with roughly 100 billion parameters, up to 10 billion of which are active per token. It is intended for applications that require many collaborating agents to tackle complex tasks, such as deep research and strategy planning, with low latency.

Ultra: A large reasoning engine intended for complex AI applications. It has 500 billion parameters, with up to 50 billion active per token.

Nemotron 3 Nano is now available on Hugging Face and through other inference service providers and enterprise AI and data infrastructure platforms. It will soon be made available on AWS via Amazon Bedrock and will be supported on Google Cloud, CoreWeave, Microsoft Foundry, and other public infrastructures. It is also offered as a pre-built Nvidia NIM microservice.

Nemotron 3 Super and Ultra are expected to be available in the first half of 2026.

Positioned as an infrastructure layer

The strategic positioning here is fundamentally different from that of the API providers, experts note.

“Nvidia isn’t trying to compete with OpenAI or Anthropic’s hosted services — they’re positioning themselves as the infrastructure layer for enterprises that want to build and own their own AI agents,” said Mayham.

Brian Jackson, principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, agreed that the Nemotron models aren’t intended as a ready-baked product. “They are more like a meal kit that a developer can start working with,” he said, “and make desired modifications along the way to get the exact flavor they want.”

Hybrid architecture enhances performance

So far, Nemotron 3 seems to be exhibiting impressive gains in efficiency and performance; according to third-party benchmarking company Artificial Analysis, Nano is the most efficient among those of its size, and leads in accuracy.

Nvidia says Nano’s hybrid Mamba-Transformer MoE architecture, which integrates three architectures into a single backbone, supports this efficiency. Mamba layers offer efficient sequence modeling, transformer layers provide precision reasoning, and MoE routing gives scalable compute efficiency. The company says this design delivers a 4X higher token throughput compared to Nemotron 2 Nano while reducing reasoning-token generation by up to 60%.

“Throughput is the critical metric for agentic AI,” said Mayham. “When you’re orchestrating dozens of concurrent agents, inference costs scale dramatically. Higher throughput means lower cost per token and more responsive real-time agent behavior.”

The 60% reduction in reasoning-token generation addresses the “verbosity problem,” where chain-of-thought (CoT) models generate excessive internal reasoning before producing useful output, he noted. “For developers building multi-agent systems, this translates directly to lower latency and reduced compute costs.”

The upcoming Nemotron 3 Super, Nvidia says, excels at applications that require many collaborating agents to achieve complex tasks with low latency, while Nemotron 3 Ultra will serve as an advanced reasoning engine for AI workflows that demand deep research and strategic planning.

Mayham explained that these as-yet-unreleased models feature latent MoE, which projects tokens into a smaller, latent, dimension before expert routing, “theoretically” enabling 4X more experts at the same inference cost because it reduces communication overhead between GPUs.

The hybrid architecture behind Nemotron 3 that combines Mamba-2 layers, sparse transformers, and MoE routing is “genuinely novel in its combination,” Mayham said, although each technique exists individually elsewhere.

Ultimately, Nemotron pricing is “attractive,” he said; open weights are free to download and run locally. Third-party API pricing on DeepInfra starts at $0.06/million input tokens for Nemotron 3 Nano, which is “significantly cheaper” than GPT-4o, he noted.

Differentiator is openness

To underscore its commitment to open source, Nvidia is revealing some of Nemotron 3’s inner workings, releasing a dataset with real-world telemetry for safety evaluations, and 3 trillion tokens of Nemotron 3’s pretraining, post-training, and RL datasets.

In addition, Nvidia is open-sourcing its NeMo Gym and NeMo RL libraries, which provide Nemotron 3’s training environments and post-training foundation, and NeMo Evaluator, to help builders validate model safety and performance. All are now available on GitHub and Hugging Face. Of these, Mayham noted, NeMo Gym might be the most “strategically significant” piece of this release.

Pre-training teaches models to predict tokens, not to complete domain-specific tasks, and traditional RL from human feedback (RLHF) doesn’t scale for complex agentic behaviors, Mayham explained. NeMo Gym enables RL with verifiable rewards — essentially computational verification of task completion rather than subjective human ratings. That is, did the code pass tests? Is the math correct? Were the tools called properly?

This gives developers building domain-specific agents the infrastructure to train models on their own workflows without having to understand the full RL training loop.

“The idea is that NeMo Gym will speed up the setup and execution of RL jobs for models,” explained Jason Andersen, VP and principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. “The important distinction is NeMo Gym decouples the RL environment from the training itself, so it can easily set up and create multiple training instances (or ‘gyms’).”

Mayham called this “unprecedented openness” the real differentiator of the Nemotron 3 release. “No major competitor offers that level of completeness,” he said. “For enterprises, this means full control over customization, on premises deployment, and cost optimization that closed providers simply can’t match.”

But there is a tradeoff in capability, Mayham pointed out: Claude and GPT-4o still outperform Nemotron 3 on specialized tasks like coding benchmarks. However, Nemotron 3 seems to be targeting a different buyer: Enterprises that need deployment flexibility and don’t want vendor lock-in.

“The value proposition for enterprises isn’t raw capability, it’s the combination of open weights, training data, deployment flexibility, and Nvidia ecosystem integration that closed providers can’t match,” he said.",https://www.infoworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4106756-0-08249700-1765858417-Nvidia-page.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-12-16 12:04:00.776792

Shares of the company have lost about 75% of their value from the peak of $97.77 in 2017.

They are down about 12% since the announcement of the split in September and were trading up about 1% before the market opened.

Steve Cahillane

Cahillane had led Kellogg through its separation in 2023 and was CEO at Kellanova, the global snacking business, until Mars announced it was acquiring the company for about $36 billion last year.

The deal went through earlier this month after the European Commission cleared it.

Cahillane has also worked with Coca-Cola and AB InBev.

He said, “I have devoted by entire career to building brands, and the opportunity to do the same with Kraft Heinz’s iconic portfolio is a dream come true.”

Cahillane would serve as CEO of the sauces and spreads unit after the split, which aims to reduce operational complexity and improve focus on each business as high inflation and economic uncertainty hobble demand.

Jefferies analyst Scott Marks said in a note, “This move further fans investor speculation about Taste Elevation (the sauces unit) being a potential deal target.”

The sauces and spreads business had sales of about $15.4 billion in 2024, while the other company, which would consist of processed foods and ready-meal brands, had about $10.4 billion in annual sales.

Kraft Heinz had in October cut its annual sales and profit targets as budget-conscious consumers continued to prefer cheaper private label brands.

According to Deutsche Börse Commodities' ""Investment Barometer 2025,"" gold is shedding its image as a safe-haven asset solely for older investors.
Or is it worth buying Gold?
The Decoupling from Bond Yields Perhaps the most striking feature of this surge is the metal's resilience against movements in the bond market.
Rising bond yields typically increase the opportunity cost of holding gold, yet prices continue to reach record levels.","The traditional rules governing financial markets appear to be suspended. In a typical environment, non-yielding precious metals like gold struggle when bond yields rise. Yet, the current rally is completely disregarding this historical relationship, propelling prices to successive peaks. What powerful forces are driving this insatiable demand, which is easily shrugging off even contradictory economic signals?

A pivotal shift underpinning this bull run is a demographic change among buyers. According to Deutsche Börse Commodities' ""Investment Barometer 2025,"" gold is shedding its image as a safe-haven asset solely for older investors. It has now become the most favored investment class for those aged 25 to 34, with approximately 53% of this cohort considering an allocation. This broadens the demand base significantly, reducing reliance on purely institutional flows and contributing to the asset's impressive momentum, evidenced by a 30-day performance exceeding 7%.

Mixed Data Fails to Derail the Rally

The latest trading session was dominated by the release of delayed US nonfarm payrolls data, which painted a mixed picture. While November showed an unexpectedly solid job gain of 64,000, October's figures were dramatically revised down to a loss of 105,000 positions. This discrepancy initially sparked volatility, but market participants swiftly interpreted the numbers as favorable for gold. The brief uncertainty gave way to a fresh wave of buying, pushing the price up by 0.24% to a new 52-week high of $4,346.10 per ounce, decisively breaking through previous all-time highs.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Gold?

The Decoupling from Bond Yields

Perhaps the most striking feature of this surge is the metal's resilience against movements in the bond market. Despite yields on 10-year US Treasuries climbing back above the 4% threshold, the upward trajectory for gold remains firmly intact. Rising bond yields typically increase the opportunity cost of holding gold, yet prices continue to reach record levels. This suggests a fundamental decoupling, indicating that investors may be prioritizing concerns over long-term currency stability and store of value over short-term interest rate advantages. Every price dip is now being viewed as a buying opportunity.

Institutional Bullishness Points to $5,000

On the institutional side, optimism remains robust. Global bank Société Générale maintains the maximum allowable gold allocation of 10% in its multi-asset portfolios and sees considerable room for further gains. Their analysts project a climb to $5,000 per fine ounce by the end of 2026. The primary catalyst for this forecast is the anticipated continued monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve. Should interest rates fall by an additional 50 basis points by April 2026 as expected, it would provide fundamental support for the uptrend, even from today's record-breaking starting point.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2408331__.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 11:12:41.875953

Developed through Lafiagi Sugar Company Limited (LASUCO), the complex is designed as a fully integrated operation covering sugarcane cultivation, milling, refining and by-product processing.
Kabiru Rabiu, group executive director of BUA Group, said the facility would be the largest of its kind in Nigeria once completed.
The minister described LASUCO as a landmark investment within Nigeria’s sugar sector, noting its status as the largest greenfield sugar project undertaken by a major industry player.
Once operational, the Lafiagi facility is expected to produce about 220,000 metric tonnes of refined sugar annually.","NIGERIA – BUA Foods Plc is nearing completion of what is expected to become Nigeria’s largest integrated sugar production facility, marking a major step in the country’s efforts to deepen local manufacturing and reduce dependence on sugar imports.

The project, located in Lafiagi, Kwara State, is approximately 80 per cent complete, according to company officials. Developed through Lafiagi Sugar Company Limited (LASUCO), the complex is designed as a fully integrated operation covering sugarcane cultivation, milling, refining and by-product processing.

Kabiru Rabiu, group executive director of BUA Group, said the facility would be the largest of its kind in Nigeria once completed. Speaking during an inspection tour by senior government officials, Rabiu stated that the plant will have a sugarcane crushing capacity of 10,000 tonnes per day.

He added that the complex will generate 35 megawatts of electricity from bagasse and produce 20 million litres of industrial ethanol annually.

Rabiu acknowledged that the project had faced delays but said construction activities have gained momentum. He noted that development of the sugarcane plantation and supporting infrastructure is progressing alongside the industrial components of the project.

LASUCO is being developed on approximately 20,000 hectares of land and includes extensive supporting infrastructure.

In addition to sugar milling and refining facilities, the project incorporates an ethanol plant, irrigation systems, a dedicated power station and an airstrip. Housing, healthcare and educational facilities are also being constructed to serve workers and surrounding communities.

John Owan Enoh, minister of state for industry highlighted the scale of infrastructure already in place at the site. He referenced road networks, landing facilities and worker accommodation as indicators of readiness for full-scale operations, adding that continued progress toward completion remains critical.

The minister described LASUCO as a landmark investment within Nigeria’s sugar sector, noting its status as the largest greenfield sugar project undertaken by a major industry player. He emphasized the importance of completing the facility to support national industrial and agricultural objectives.

Once operational, the Lafiagi facility is expected to produce about 220,000 metric tonnes of refined sugar annually. The project’s power generation and ethanol output are also expected to support adjacent industries and contribute to energy and industrial inputs.

The development is central to Nigeria’s strategy to conserve foreign exchange, stabilise sugar supply and create employment across the agricultural and industrial value chain.

BUA Foods has indicated that construction will continue at an accelerated pace as it works toward completing the facility, reinforcing its long-term commitment to domestic sugar production and large-scale manufacturing in Nigeria.",https://www.foodbusinessmea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bua-Group2.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:05:07.693979

Since entering the solar industry in 1995, Li Zhenguo has been dedicated to the research and development of monocrystalline silicon and related products. The low-carbon technologies he championed have been widely adopted across the industry. Under his leadership, LONGi has grown from a start-up into a global PV technology leader, achieving breakthroughs in areas such as wafer and cell/module efficiency improvements, green hydrogen production, and integrated ""PV + storage"" systems.

Li Zhenguo stated that this honor belongs not only to him personally but also to all his colleagues and partners who have tirelessly worked for LONGi and the global energy transition. He highlighted that LONGi has always been committed to reducing photovoltaic costs, enhancing conversion efficiency, and promoting the large-scale application of renewable energy.

Today, the company is extending these efforts into deep decarbonization areas such as green hydrogen, green methanol, and green ammonia. ""Without these extraordinary LONGi people, there would be no LONGi today"", he said.

Against the backdrop of the global accelerated push towards net-zero emissions, Li Zhenguo reaffirmed LONGi's commitment to scientific development, responsible innovation, and long-term industrial collaboration. The award not only recognizes his personal vision but also underscores LONGi's steadfast resolve to build a greener, more resilient world.

At the ceremony, Eric Luo, Vice President of LONGi, accepted the ""Corporate Impact Award"" on behalf of the company, stating, ""At LONGi, we believe the meaning of technology is to improve life."" In recent years, while driving PV technological innovation, LONGi has continued to expand its global manufacturing footprint, striving to bring clean energy to more regions.

In Mozambique, LONGi collaborated with partners on a philanthropic PV project for a maternal and child hospital. By donating high-efficiency BC (Back-Contact) PV modules and constructing a rooftop PV system, the project not only provided the hospital with stable, clean electricity but also ensured medical water supply through a PV-powered water pump system. Since its operation, the hospital has safely delivered 150 newborns. The introduction of solar power has significantly reduced operational costs and enhanced the reliability of medical services.

These two major awards represent high recognition not only for the industry contributions of Li Zhenguo, founder and CTO of LONGi, but also a comprehensive affirmation of LONGi's technological innovation, global impact, and sustainable development practices. In the global journey of energy transition, LONGi will continue to serve as a leader, enabling solar energy to illuminate a more inclusive and sustainable future.

Recognising that 33% of guests are unlikely to return to a hotel after an under-par coffee experience, the L’OR solution offers a complete, quality coffee offering beyond the machine itself.","L’OR, the globally renowned coffee brand from manufacturer JDE Peet’s UK & Ireland, has unveiled a new bean-to-cup barista style coffee solution targeting the hotel sector.

The new product, specifically designed to deliver a premium coffee experience across core high footfall hotel touchpoints, is available in both elegant counter and convenient self-serve formats.

The package offers a complete branded coffee experience, featuring a wide café-style menu using L’OR high quality responsibly-sourced coffee beans, elegant accessories, and sophisticated point-of-sale materials to elevate every moment, from check-in to check-out.

Hannah Morris, head of out of home at JDE Peet’s UK & Ireland, says that all the insight it has gathered on the challenges facing hotel businesses show that it’s a product which can add real value to the market.

“We’ve already got the L’OR capsule machines for rooms. And we know that bean-to-cup is [around] a third of all coffee cups in the out-of-home industry.

“So this is huge opportunity for us. We’ve launched L’OR beans in the retail side of the business. We’ve got great quality beans that consumers know and love. It just felt like a natural next step to move into the out-of-home market and offer that to consumers there as well.

“Our bespoke research revealed that 72% of consumers consider coffee quality important, and 77% associate recognised brands with that quality. Furthermore, 60% of guests are more likely to buy coffee if it’s from a known brand, a sentiment even stronger among Gen Z.

“As a household name synonymous with premium coffee, L’OR is uniquely positioned to elevate the hotel coffee experience, ensuring every guest experience is consistently high quality,” she adds.

This commitment has been further underscored by a significant £10m media investment in the UK, supporting the L’OR brand and driving consumer awareness and demand for its hotel partners.

The L’OR solution is available in two distinct options – the L’OR Barista Style Self-Serve Coffee Solution and the L’OR Barista Style Countertop Coffee Solution.

Morris insists it is the perfect product for hotel cafés, bars, and restaurants, empowering staff to craft a wide array of L’OR hot beverages with consistency and delivering a served coffee that exudes quality.

Recognising that 33% of guests are unlikely to return to a hotel after an under-par coffee experience, the L’OR solution offers a complete, quality coffee offering beyond the machine itself.

The package includes high-quality L’OR beans, branded point-of-sale materials and accessories, ingredients, installation, maintenance and servicing, in addition to staff training, making the solution ideal for businesses seeking to elevate their coffee service.

“The easiest thing for hotels is to capture returning guests, rather than trying to convince a new one to come,” continues Morris.

“If you haven’t got the right coffee then that’s a third of them that aren’t going to come back – so I think that’s really key. And then the 24/7 access. Everyone is so fast-paced nowadays, and consumers are wanting that convenience, even in a hotel when you’ve got more leisure time.”

L’OR will initially target the hotel sector with the launch, but it believes the solution will work just as well for the care home and education markets. “We are focusing today on hotels, but we have a sales team that covers all of our different sectors,” says Morris.

When it comes to machine maintenance for operators, the company’s distributors use their trained engineers for servicing, with JDE providing additional support if required.

Operators can now also download the JDE Peet’s Insights Guide from the company’s website for more information on how it can help businesses to tap into the coffee opportunity in their hotels.",https://www.cateringinsight.com/cloud/2025/11/17/3WwOAqDg-cropped-feature-image.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:05:12.726880

ID26,Kraft Heinz,2025-12-16 14:01:29+00:00,Just Food,Kraft Heinz hires ex-Kellanova chief as new CEO - Just Food,Simon Harvey,,,,,https://www.just-food.com/news/kraft-heinz-hires-ex-kellanova-chief-as-new-ceo/,"Kraft Heinz has appointed former Kellanova chief Steve Cahillane as group CEO ahead of next year’s targeted business split.
He had been due to take the CEO position at Kraft Heinz’s new grocery unit.
“I look forward to taking on the role of chair as we usher in an exciting new era for the company, with Steve Cahillane at the helm.” Before Kellanova, Cahillane was CEO of Kellogg prior to the business separation.
“Steve is uniquely qualified to lead this organisation into the future and we are delighted he will be taking on the role of CEO,” Patricio said.
He added: “On behalf of the board and everyone at Kraft Heinz, we are incredibly grateful to Carlos for his many contributions to the company, serving not only as CEO but in other critical leadership roles.","Kraft Heinz has appointed former Kellanova chief Steve Cahillane as group CEO ahead of next year’s targeted business split.

Cahillane will take up the position, and a seat on the board, on 1 January but will then become CEO of Kraft Heinz’s Global Taste Elevation Co. when the separation unfolds, scheduled for the first half of 2026.

A search for a CEO to head up the other half of the new business – North American Grocery Co. – is due to start, the Kraft mac & cheese and Maxwell House coffee brand owner said in a statement.

Meanwhile, current group CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera, who took the hot seat on 1 January 2023, will relinquish his position at the start of the new year but will remain as an adviser until 6 March. He had been due to take the CEO position at Kraft Heinz’s new grocery unit.

As part of the shake-up, Miguel Patricio, who was CEO from mid-2019 until being succeeded by Abrams-Rivera, will be replaced as board chair by John Cahill.

Cahillane has been freed up since Mars’ takeover of Kellanova was cleared by European competition authorities last week, the final hurdle following previous clearance in the US. He held the president and CEO roles at Kellanova, which itself was the subject of a business split in 2022-23 from what was the breakfast cereal and snacks giant Kellogg Co.

“I am honoured to be joining Kraft Heinz as CEO at such a pivotal and exciting time,” Cahillane said. “I’m confident the planned separation will accelerate the company’s ability to compete and win in today’s environment and unlock the immense opportunity in front of us.”

Kraft Heinz said it reached a “severance separation agreement” with Abrams-Rivera today (16 December), whereby he will no longer serve as CEO or a member of the board.

From 1 January, Patricio will “resign” from the company and “step down” as executive board chair but will remain as a “non-employee director”.

Current vice chairman Cahill will assume the board leadership role from the same date.

Cahill said: “I want to express the board’s deep gratitude to Miguel for stepping in to help prepare the company and leadership team for the proposed separation.

“I look forward to taking on the role of chair as we usher in an exciting new era for the company, with Steve Cahillane at the helm.”

Before Kellanova, Cahillane was CEO of Kellogg prior to the business separation. He also previously headed up The Nature’s Bounty Co. and has also served as an executive at The Coca-Cola Co. and AB lnBev during his career.

“Steve is uniquely qualified to lead this organisation into the future and we are delighted he will be taking on the role of CEO,” Patricio said.

He added: “On behalf of the board and everyone at Kraft Heinz, we are incredibly grateful to Carlos for his many contributions to the company, serving not only as CEO but in other critical leadership roles.

“Carlos helped transform the company into a more agile and innovative organisation and laid the groundwork for the upcoming separation.”

Challenges remain at Kraft Heinz, however, before the business split is completed next year.

In October, the company painted a more bearish outlook for the year’s sales and profits as it reported a third-quarter decline in volumes. The previously predicted 1.5% to 3.5% drop in organic sales was adjusted to a decrease of 3% to 3.5%.

Elsewhere, adjusted operating income in constant currency terms was forecast to fall 10% to 12% instead of the prior outlook for a 5-10% decrease. And adjusted EPS was outlined in the $2.50 to $2.57 range, compared to former guidance of $2.51 to $2.67.",https://www.just-food.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/09/Kraft-Mac-Cheese-e1756903475396.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 10:13:29.343185

While year-to-date deal volumes are comparable to 2024, deal value has declined, with average transaction size down about 55 percent.
M&A interest skewed toward premium resorts and digital gaming assets, as investors pursued differentiated demand drivers and high-margin experiences.
The largest H&L deals in the second half of 2025 involved digital platforms—underscoring the sector’s convergence with entertainment and international capital flows.
Future dealmaking is expected to center on acquiring properties and capabilities that support an evolved ecosystem strategy where AI, loyalty, and experiential design converge to nurture growth, deepen customer relationships, and unlock lasting advantage.","Following several years of post-pandemic normalization, the hospitality industry has shifted from expansion to optimization, according to PwC’s U.S. Deals 2026 Outlook. Deal activity has remained steady but more selective, with strategic buyers accounting for the majority of transactions. These buyers are looking for differentiated assets that extend digital capabilities, reinforce brand strength, and unlock new experiential value.

Third-quarter deal volume in 2025 rose about 40 percent over the second quarter, fueled in part by improving financial conditions and greater clarity around trade and macro risks.

While year-to-date deal volumes are comparable to 2024, deal value has declined, with average transaction size down about 55 percent. The gap reflects uneven recovery across the hospitality and leisure subsegments: strength in luxury, softness in economy, and a still-recovering corporate and international travel base.

“Hospitality and leisure are no longer defined by venues or categories, but by the seamless delivery of interconnected experiences to value-focused consumers,” Jonathan Shing, U.S. hospitality & leisure deals leader at PWC, said in a statement.

Investments

Private equity remains cautious, contributing just 10 percent of disclosed deal value year to date—a drop from more than 50 percent in 2024. The few notable private-equity deals this year have focused on luxury resort acquisitions. The reason for this is likely related to the same issues affecting other sectors. High interest rates—combined with the asset-heavy nature of the sector and persistent valuation gaps—which have raised the bar for expected returns and made it more difficult for PE buyers to justify deals outside of top-tier assets.

Strategic transactions have filled the gap, with that value up about 7 percent year over year. Cross-border investment has also held steady, signaling continued international appetite for US-based assets despite geopolitical headwinds. Meanwhile, gaming has become a hotspot for activity: All three of the largest H&L deals in the second half of 2025 involved digital gaming assets and foreign counterparties.

Back-end transformation is gaining traction alongside guest-facing innovation. Operators and investors are targeting back-office modernization—including finance, HR, logistics and event tech—to boost efficiency and scalability. At the same time, platforms that elevate personalization, loyalty, and digital engagement are reshaping the front-end experience. The common thread: building end-to-end digital infrastructure that blends AI, operational excellence, and experience-led monetization.

Dealmaking in Late 2025

Corporate buyers sharpened focus on ecosystem fit. With less competition from private equity, corporate acquirers concentrated on properties that expand loyalty ecosystems, enhance personalization capabilities, or deepen cross-channel customer engagement.

Luxury and digital segments led activity. M&A interest skewed toward premium resorts and digital gaming assets, as investors pursued differentiated demand drivers and high-margin experiences.

Gaming attracted strategic interest. The largest H&L deals in the second half of 2025 involved digital platforms—underscoring the sector’s convergence with entertainment and international capital flows.

Cross-border activity remained steady. Deal volume from international buyers held flat year over year, despite geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Infrastructure and integration gained focus. Investments targeted both guest-facing innovation and back-office systems, including loyalty integration, event logistics, and AI-driven personalization engines.

Customer data emerged as a value lever. Buyers placed increasing emphasis on unified customer identity, loyalty ecosystems, and personalized engagement as part of their dealmaking.

3Q25 deal volume was 40 percent higher than 1Q and 2Q averages, indicating that optimism and activity returned to the hospitality and leisure M&A market amid greater clarity on trade and macroeconomic conditions.

What’s Next

Traditional M&A will continue to drive H&L deal volume, but the biggest bets in 2026 are likely to center on creating connected ecosystems and scaling AI-driven platforms. Data governance, however, remains one of the constraints preventing organizations from fully capitalizing on AI opportunities. Winning assets will blend brand equity with data fluency, omnichannel research, and embedded personalization. As AI moves from experimentation to scaled deployment, the sector is entering a new phase of competitive differentiation.

Key Developments to Watch

AI shifts from tool to teammate. Agentic AI use cases are accelerating across H&L. In travel, AI assistants are rebooking itineraries in real time. In hospitality, predictive analytics and digital concierges are enhancing service and efficiency. In gaming, adaptive platforms are redefining personalization. Rather than replacing workers, the most valuable use cases empower staff to deliver better, more human experiences.

The brand becomes a competitive moat. In a world blending digital and physical experiences, trusted brands offer more than familiarity—they offer strategic insulation. Investors are seeking assets where loyalty, recognition, and content ecosystems drive monetization and margin.

Data quality is the new constraint. As AI deployment scales, data governance is separating leaders from laggards. M&A strategies increasingly hinge on the ability to unify, activate, and protect customer data across platforms and regions.

Experience platforms are the new perimeter. Buyers are investing in full-stack platforms that combine content, loyalty, booking, and analytics. The goal: create seamless, end-to-end guest journeys that blur traditional sector lines.

Loyalty becomes an asset class. Engagement is now a quantifiable enterprise value. Dealmakers are assigning real valuation to loyalty ecosystems and their ability to drive cross-brand conversion, retention, and upsell.

Discipline defines value creation. With capital costs still elevated, deal success will depend on post-close clarity. Day One integration plans should prioritize data readiness, customer identity unification, and loyalty platform integration to accelerate value capture.

The Bottom Line

Improving capital market conditions and strong sector fundamentals are setting the stage for renewed M&A activity in hospitality and leisure. As travel demand stabilizes and AI adoption picks up pace, investors are focusing on experience-led platforms that deliver both value and differentiation. Future dealmaking is expected to center on acquiring properties and capabilities that support an evolved ecosystem strategy where AI, loyalty, and experiential design converge to nurture growth, deepen customer relationships, and unlock lasting advantage.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud1/media/image/hotelmanagement/1584396168/Hotel%20transaction%20handshake%20business.jpg?VersionId=XkEwIxzYfnF0GNjZW_dOrh6uaMiW3Cfd,N,,2025-12-16 10:13:12.964530

Speaking to ynet, Quint said the transaction had already been approved by the Israel Land Authority’s management and that the Israel Land Council had authorized the 51% land discount.
According to the plan, Nvidia will build a unique, large-scale campus unlike any previously seen in Israel, modeled in part on the company’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California.
The development agreement will include special conditions reflecting the project’s scale and complexity.
In such a case, the company would return the land free of liens or third-party claims, and the Israel Land Authority would refund the amount paid, minus usage fees for the period the land was held.","The land allocation agreement for Nvidia’s new campus in Kiryat Tivon is expected to be signed within the next day or two, Israel Land Authority Director Yaakov Yanki Quint said Monday evening, after receiving approval from Israel’s defense and foreign ministers.

The approvals were required under Israel’s Land Law because Nvidia is a foreign-controlled company. The deal will allow the global technology giant to establish a new development campus on state land, allocated without a public tender and at a 51% discount.

Speaking to ynet, Quint said the transaction had already been approved by the Israel Land Authority’s management and that the Israel Land Council had authorized the 51% land discount. He said the authority would publish payment vouchers and technical specifications on Tuesday.

“We are completing the deal with Nvidia. This is major news for Israel in general and for the north in particular,” Quint said. Nvidia has not yet responded to requests for comment.

Last month, Kiryat Tivon emerged as the leading candidate in the competition to host Nvidia’s new campus, following a meeting at the Israel Land Authority attended by senior officials from the Planning Administration, the Transportation Ministry, the Israel Electric Corp. and Nvidia representatives. The meeting concluded with a decision to move forward with a land allocation exempt from a tender process.

According to the plan, Nvidia will build a unique, large-scale campus unlike any previously seen in Israel, modeled in part on the company’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California. The project is expected to span approximately 160,000 square meters and employ about 8,000 workers.

The proposed 51% land discount is valued at tens of millions of shekels. Officials cited the significant economic impact on northern Israel, noting that thousands of employees would work directly at the campus and that hundreds of additional businesses are expected to benefit from providing services to the site.

The development agreement will include special conditions reflecting the project’s scale and complexity. One provision sets a seven-year development period, acknowledging the extensive construction involved. If additional time is required, Nvidia will be able to request an extension, and subject to meeting the agreement’s terms, may receive up to three additional years without extra payment. The clause is intended to accommodate the project’s distinctive architectural design and coordination with Nvidia’s overseas headquarters.

Another condition allows Nvidia to withdraw from the agreement if the required zoning plan is not approved. In such a case, the company would return the land free of liens or third-party claims, and the Israel Land Authority would refund the amount paid, minus usage fees for the period the land was held.

The planned site is located in the “Kiryat Tivon Employment Campus” area on the western edge of the town, near Highway 6, the Emek Interchange and the Jezreel Valley railway line. The plan covers about 90 dunams and includes employment and commercial areas, leisure and tourism facilities, roads and open public spaces.

The project also includes 12,000 square meters of commercial and employment space in buildings ranging from seven to 10 stories. A public transportation terminal is planned within the complex to serve routes from the north, east and west.

Officials said Nvidia made clear it requires a larger site than the currently approved plan allows and would not proceed without sufficient expansion. As a result, the authority recommended allocating additional land through a separate planning authorization agreement.

Dozens of municipalities competed to attract Nvidia, offering extensive incentives. Among the leading contenders were Yokneam, where Nvidia already operates offices and expansion plans exist, and Haifa, which proposed the Matam High-Tech Park. Other bidders included Migdal HaEmek, Afula, Harish and Netanya.

Nvidia’s Israeli development center is already the company’s second largest worldwide after the United States, employing more than 5,000 people. The scale of the planned construction suggests Nvidia intends to double or even triple its workforce in Israel in the coming years.",https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/07/04/HJsXjwHrge/HJsXjwHrge_0_0_3000_1688_0_large.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 12:04:10.666108

The consultation notes that “It is important to emphasise that the FCA’s responsibilities in relation to the register will be limited strictly to AML/CTF compliance.","There are a lot of acronyms here, so we’ve included a glossary at the end of this article.

Why change?

A review in 2022 by HM Treasury of the UK’s AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulatory and supervisory regime concluded that while there had been iterative improvement to the regime, structural reform may be needed. The 2023 consultation set out four models for reform:

1) OPBAS+ - increased powers to the Office for Professional Body AML Supervision (OPBAS). Created in 2018, OPBAS aims to improve consistency and effectiveness of professional body supervision, including the sharing of information between the PBSs and law enforcement agencies;

2) PBS consolidation – the current 22 PBSs to be reduced to a small number;

3) Single Professional Services Supervisor (SPSS) – single public body granted responsibility for all AML/CTF supervision for the legal and accountancy sectors, trust or company service providers (TCSPs), and potentially other sectors, such as estate agency and letting agency businesses, who are regulated under the Money Laundering Regulations (MLRs);

4)Single AML Supervisor (SAS) – one public body holds responsibility for all AML/CTF supervision. The FCA, Gambling Commission, and the PBSs would continue to supervise relevant firms only for non-AML/CTF purposes.

Respondents from the legal and accountancy sectors were, overall, more supportive of OPBAS+ - due to the continuity this option could bring, the ability to build upon the improvements that OPBAS and the PBSs had made over the previous five years, and because of concerns about the feasibility of implementing other options.

In the end, the UK government favoured model 3, a Single Professional Services Supervisor (SPSS) i.e. the FCA. This was because:

1)The move will bring professional services in line with all other sectors in scope of the MLRs, already overseen by public bodies;

2) It simplifies the highly complex regulatory regime;

3) It provides greater consistency for firms;

4) It allows increased information and intelligence-sharing between supervisors and law enforcement to identify and respond to non-compliance; and

5) There can be a more robust approach to enforcement action where required.

Who and what will move?

Those firms carrying out activities within scope of the MLRs as legal services providers, accountancy service providers (ASPs) and TCSPs will now be supervised by the FCA. In other words, all firms currently supervised for AML/CTF matters by a PBS (such as the SRA and ICAEW), and all ASPs and TCSPs supervised by HMRC will be supervised by the FCA.

OPBAS’ existing function will no longer be needed once PBSs cease in their AML/CTF supervisory function.

The scale of the task is significant – in its AML report for 2025, the SRA confirmed it supervises 5,569 firms for AML compliance. The SRA reportedly currently has 30 full-time staff dedicated solely to AML regulation. The ICAEW is the largest accountancy PBS, supervising around 10,000 firms.

The move means approximately an additional 60,000 entities will fall under the FCA’s supervisory remit, in addition to the c.17,000 it already supervises. As of around March 2025, the FCA’s total supervisory remit, including firms outside the scope of the MLRs, extended to around 42,000 firms.

The professions’ response

The news brought with it many unknowns.

A concern mirrored across the professions is the loss of sector specific expertise with the new model.

The SRA responded to the government consultation by saying it wanted to be the consolidated legal sector supervisor. In responding to the news of the FCA as SPSS, former Chief Executive of the SRA, Paul Philip, highlighted that the SRA has 280 employed solicitors and is better placed to deal with law firms. Part of the SRA’s argument to become the consolidated legal sector supervisor was its better understanding of the practice of law. And there is much still to do in the sector: in its 2025 AML report, the SRA reported carrying out 935 proactive AML engagements with firms during the reporting period (an increase from 545 proactive engagements in the last reporting year). Almost a third (270) of firms the SRA engaged with were not compliant.

In 2023, the ICAEW warned that the model now selected by the Government would give rise to a high risk of losing the expertise and knowledge needed to effectively perform supervision.

HM Treasury’s intention is that the FCA will build specific expertise in the particularities of each sector it supervises. This will of course be no quick task, not least because of the significant increase in supervisory population, and gives rise to concerns as to what this means for the intervening period. Such concerns will not have been quelled by the Government’s recent consultation (see below), within which it concedes that implementation will, “inevitably take several years and during this time, the UK’s ML/TF defences may come under threat if the appropriate safeguards are not in place.”

The How

This is of course the big question: how will the FCA undertake this mammoth new role?

The government has now published its consultation on Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Terrorist-Financing (AML/CTF) Supervision Reform: Duties, Powers, and Accountability and with it some further clarity as to how this will all work in practice.

The government has made clear that its primary goal is, “to ensure effective AML/CTF supervision for professional services firms.”

Some of the key proposals/considerations set out include:

1)The FCA registering all relevant professional services firms that are carrying out activity within scope of the MLRs (as it already does for financial services firms);

2) The FCA carrying out “gatekeeping” checks as assurance that these firms are well-placed to comply effectively with AML/CTF obligations;

3) The FCA identifying and acting against firms that are improperly operating without registration (“policing the perimeter”) – currently PSBs don’t have a power through the MLRs to bring relevant persons within AML/CTF supervision;

4)The FCA receiving and processing applications for registration and publishing a register of notified professional services firms in scope of the MLRs;

5) Amending regulation 58 under the MLRs (the “fit and proper” test) to ensure the FCA’s gatekeeping powers are harmonised across the professions;

6)Consideration of information-sharing arrangements between the FCA and professional bodies, to help all parties identify firms operating without due supervision and to minimise burdens on firms from registering with multiple supervisors;

7)All firms which carry out legal services in scope of the MLRs should be required to register with the FCA, even if they are not currently registered with an AML/CTF supervisor;

8) The FCA be provided with the powers necessary to carry out effective interventions across its population and to gather up-to-date information on risk from relevant authorities to inform this;

9)The FCA to be provided with a broadened toolkit to enable it to intervene in the most appropriate way – this may include tools such as the power of directions (said to support early remediation, promote compliance and help maintain confidence in the supervisory regime) and the ability to appoint or require firms to appoint a skilled person (similar to the powers the FCA has under regulations 74A, 74B and 74C in relation to crypto asset firms);

10) Extension of the information gathering and inspection powers in the MLRs to the new sectors within FCA supervision;

11) Responsibility for AML/CTF guidance for legal, accountancy, and TCSPs to be transferred to the FCA; the FCA should seek to minimise disruption and excess burden on firms, including considering how existing Legal Sector Affinity Group (LSAG) and Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB) guidance could be incorporated into the new arrangements;

12)The MLRs to be amended to require the National Crime Agency to share Suspicious Activity Reports with the FCA and other public sector supervisors, where these have been submitted by or relate to firms within their supervisory population;

13) All decisions of the FCA in relation to their AML/CTF supervision of professional services firms to be appealable to the tribunal regime, as other FCA decisions currently are;

14)Day-to-day costs of AML/CTF supervision of professional services firms by the FCA will be recovered through fees charged to the firms it supervises (the FCA intends to consult on how it proposes to do this in due course);

15) The FCA, HMRC and PBSs may require additional powers to ensure a smooth transition while reducing scope for duplication;

16)The FCA will work closely with OPBAS and the existing PBSs to ensure the knowledge of professional services sectors is retained and embedded into its supervisory model;

17)The intention is for firms already supervised by PBSs or HMRC to not need to complete a re-registration process but that firms or individuals may be required to confirm certain details – potentially on an annual basis – as they already are, and it is proposed that the FCA undertakes fit and proper checks in respect of the professional services firms, recognising that these may not have been conducted previously to the same depth as those typically applied by the FCA;

18)The details of how information on supervised firms will be provided to the FCA by existing supervisors will be determined by the FCA, HMRC and existing PBSs;

19) A proposal for a legislative requirement to be placed on the FCA and existing bodies to work together to agree an information-sharing regime that minimises requests of firms whilst ensuring that all bodies have the necessary information to meet their objectives effectively;

20) While recognising that some firms may experience a degree of dual regulation with requirements to register and interact with both their professional body or regulator for non-AML/CTF related matters and the FCA for AML/CTF related matters, the FCA will determine in conjunction with existing professional bodies and regulators how best to limit duplication for those firms to which this may apply. This could involve the creation of a single registration gateway, managed by an appropriate body, through which relevant data is shared with both the FCA and professional bodies – helping to reduce duplication for firms that continue to interact with both. Or it could include structured information-sharing arrangements between the FCA and professional bodies to minimise the burden on firms of providing the same information to multiple organisations;

21)The FCA could have the power (in relation to professional services firms) to impose civil penalties, suspensions, prohibitions and public censures, and to initiate criminal proceedings for breaches of the MLRs, in line with existing FCA and HMRC powers. It is said this should support more dissuasive action against non-compliance with the MLRs; and

22)The FCA will continue to be operationally independent of HM Treasury and political control. It will remain accountable to HM Treasury and Parliament.

What next?

The consultation seeks views on whether the proposed powers, duties, and accountability mechanisms for the FCA are sufficient and appropriate to achieve the primary aim of AML/CTF supervision reform, i.e. supervisory effectiveness. The deadline for responses is on 24 December. And so, the New Year will bring further clarity on the new regime.

Some of the big-ticket issues have been left to the FCA to determine, such as information sharing and how best to minimise duplication for regulated firms. Much uncertainty therefore remains.

The dual regulation aspect generally is one part of the move which will self-evidently require careful thought and management. The SRA Code of Conduct for Firms, for example, specifically provides at paragraph 3.11 for Firms to keep up to date and follow the law and regulation governing the way they work, which of course includes the MLRs. We have seen in the context of drink driving convictions the tensions that can arise with dual outcomes, with fairness and proportionality considerations in mind, resulting in the SRA’s policy statement that it will no longer impose a financial penalty for misconduct relating to convictions for drink driving because, in most cases where a sanction is required, a letter of warning or rebuke will be appropriate. This followed concerns amongst the public and the profession that SRA-imposed fines could be excessive in light of previous penalties imposed as part of the criminal process (and one particular matter where a solicitor was fined over £13k by the SRA for driving while under the influence of alcohol (a figure 31 times higher than the penalty imposed by the court)). Depending on the changes introduced, should separate action by the SRA and FCA be permitted in respect of the same MLR breach(es), there is scope for similar tensions in the future under this new AML supervisory regime. The SRA makes clear in its Enforcement Strategy that its actions are not designed to ‘punish’ for past misdemeanors and that while sanctions it imposes may be punitive, such sanctions do not have that primary purpose. As the SRA and FCA navigate the new regime and any cross-over in their regulatory remits, how best to stay on the right side of this line will need to be carefully considered.

The consultation notes that “It is important to emphasise that the FCA’s responsibilities in relation to the register will be limited strictly to AML/CTF compliance. The FCA will not have any remit over broader professional standards or qualifications, which will remain the responsibility of any relevant professional bodies.” It will be important that the design and operation of the new regime gives effect to this express aim, and that the respective roles and remits of the professional bodies and the FCA are well understood and respected.

1This requirement also appears at paragraph 7.1 of the Code of Conduct for Solicitors, RELs, RFLs, and RSLs.

But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. We regret to report that long term Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 16% in three years, versus a market return of about 87%.

It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that.

We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.

While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

During the three years that the share price fell, Albertsons Companies' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 17% each year. In comparison the 6% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have previously priced some of the drop in.

This free interactive report on Albertsons Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Albertsons Companies, it has a TSR of -9.2% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

Investors in Albertsons Companies had a tough year, with a total loss of 10% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 13%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 11% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Albertsons Companies that you should be aware of.

Lee will lead corporate development at OpenAI, and OpenAI is hoping he will be “a senior leader with broad visibility across the company who is empowered to move quickly,” an OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters.

Monday’s announcement comes on the heels of two more major recruitments to the business side of OpenAI that were announced this month.

Just last week, OpenAI announced that Slack CEO Denise Dresser would be joining the company as its new chief revenue officer. The week prior to that, Torben Severson, chief of staff to CEO of Amazon’s global retail operations, announced that he had joined OpenAI as vice president and head of global business development.

Could the fact that OpenAI went for a top corporate development executive at competitor Google perhaps signal that the company will have a 2026 full of acquisitions? Though only time will tell if that will be for sure be the case, the signs are already pointing towards steadily accelerating dealmaking at the company.

2025 has already been an unusually active year for acquisitions and dealmaking for OpenAI. The company has counted at least five major acquisitions in this year alone, and that’s not counting the acqui-hires. Earlier this month, the company agreed to acquire the startup Neptune, whose product offerings help AI companies with training models. In October OpenAI acquired both Software Applications Incorporated, and personal investing startup Roi. In September, OpenAI’s web of acquisitions got a hold of software experimentation company Statsig in a $1.1 billion deal, and in May the company bought former Apple chief designer Jony Ive’s AI devices startup io in a $6.4 billion deal.

And then there are all the strategic partnerships that OpenAI counted this year, including an unprecedented $100 billion investment from Nvidia (that it turns out has not yet been fully finalized). The company’s web of dealmaking has been so tightly woven this year that it sparked widespread worries of circular dealmaking and of catastrophic consequences if indeed a feared AI bubble burst.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2525055249-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 09:01:33.696528

The ticket covers J&J’s investigational combination of Tecvayli plus Darzalex for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

The voucher award was prompted by findings from the Phase III MajesTEC-3 study, which the pharma presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology earlier this month. Results showed an 83% improvement in progression-free survival in patients treated with the combination at a median of 34.5 months, compared to controls receiving standard therapies.

Overall survival likewise leaned strongly in favor of Tecvayli plus Darzalex, hitting 83.3% at 36 months versus 65% in controls.

“Within hours of the trial results being published, FDA leaders read the study, consulted with internal experts, and the following day contacted the company to discuss a national priority voucher,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a prepared statement on Monday. This proactive award, he added, is part of the agency’s mission to accelerate promising therapies.

“When a treatment demonstrates outstanding trial results, we have a duty to patients to move swiftly,” Makary said.

J&J is the 16th company to be awarded the national priority voucher since the program was announced in June. The vouchers are granted to companies whose products align with certain federal priorities, including addressing key medical needs, boosting domestic manufacturing and lowering drug prices in line with President Donald Trump’s Most Favored Nation scheme.

Companies can use the priority voucher to drastically shorten drug review times from the usual 10–12 months to 1–2 months.

The first batch of vouchers were handed out in October and included Sanofi’s type 1 diabetes drug Tzield, Regeneron’s investigational gene therapy DB-OTO for hereditary deafness and Revolution Medicines’ oral cancer drug RMC-6236 for pancreatic cancer.

For profitable, mature businesses like Kroger, the Price to Earnings ratio is a practical way to gauge valuation because it links what investors pay today with the profits the company is actually generating. In general, companies with faster, more reliable earnings growth and lower risk can justify higher PE ratios, while slower growth or higher uncertainty should translate into a lower, more conservative multiple.

Kroger currently trades on a PE of about 50.77x, which is more than double both the Consumer Retailing industry average of roughly 22.91x and the broader peer group at around 20.50x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework refines this comparison by estimating what Kroger’s PE should be, given its specific mix of earnings growth, profit margins, size, industry positioning and risk profile. In Kroger’s case, that Fair Ratio is 37.48x, meaning the stock is priced well above what these fundamentals would typically support.

Because the actual PE is materially higher than the Fair Ratio, the multiple based view points to Kroger looking expensive relative to its own fundamentals rather than just versus peers.

Result: OVERVALUED

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kroger Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply the stories investors tell about a company, backed up by their own assumptions for future revenue, earnings, margins, and ultimately fair value.

A Narrative links three things together: the business story, the financial forecast, and a resulting fair value, so you can see how your view on Kroger’s e commerce growth, cost control, and competitive position directly flows into a valuation you are willing to pay.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, Narratives are an easy, accessible tool used by millions of investors to map their perspective into numbers, compare that Fair Value to today’s Price, and quickly decide how Kroger fits into their portfolio.

Because Narratives are updated dynamically as new earnings, news, and risks emerge, you can see in real time how a more bullish Kroger view that justifies a higher fair value differs from a more cautious stance that anchors closer to a lower fair value, and then choose which version of the story you actually believe.

Spark’s Take on KHC Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, KHC is a Neutral.

Kraft Heinz’s overall stock score reflects significant financial and operational challenges. The company’s declining revenues and profitability, coupled with a negative P/E ratio, weigh heavily on the score. Technical analysis indicates bearish momentum, and while the earnings call suggests some strategic initiatives, the outlook remains cautious due to global consumer sentiment and inflationary pressures. The high dividend yield provides some support but is overshadowed by the broader financial struggles.

If we like a client and their various programmes we commit significant across the board capacity to ensure relevance.
Looking ahead to 2026, Gale outlined the company’s expectations and strategy for navigating market cycles.","In a recent Reinsurance News interview, Jonathan Gale, Chief Underwriting Officer (CUO) at AXA XL Re, shared his insights on market dynamics, challenges, and opportunities for 2026.

Gale oversees underwriting strategy and risk selection across all major classes, ensuring that the company remains a valued partner to strategic clients and brokers, and maintains a balanced gross and net portfolio whilst constantly thinking about how to build a business for the future.

When asked about expectations for the crucial 1/1 renewals, Gale noted that, “2026, and probably 2027, are expected to be what we term a ‘transition market’ (the period between hard and soft) where the portfolio as a whole, and all major classes except Cyber, are expected to be rate adequate.”

He continued: “That said, rate adequacy is reducing quite quickly, principally due to an elevated loss trend, with inflation staying higher for longer in most major economies, and not helped by a moderating rate environment in Property and short tail Specialty.”

On specific classes, Gale explained: “Property continues to offer the best opportunity with adequacy reducing but from elevated levels in 2023-2025. Specialty rate adequacy is moderating due to increased competition in both the primary and reinsurance market despite well-publicised loss activity both in 2025 and in prior years. Casualty rate adequacy is holding due to loss trend broadly offsetting underlying rate increases, particularly in bodily injury-exposed classes in the US”.

Reflecting on the challenges and opportunities at the end of 2025, Gale noted “Managing a transitioning market is both our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity,” We believe the alpha in our business comes from the right gross and net product mix; and working with the right clients. If we like a client and their various programmes we commit significant across the board capacity to ensure relevance.

He emphasised that underwriters must have sufficient gross capacity to remain relevant, deliver excellent service, and secure the desired capacity on best in class cedants. Gale explained how the company relies on comprehensive data and analytics to achieve this:

“We leverage all available data and analytics, coordinating cross functional teams; underwriting, actuarial, and finance in order to plan at the treaty level.

Looking ahead to 2026, Gale outlined the company’s expectations and strategy for navigating market cycles. “The expectations we hold for January will be consistent throughout 2026.

He emphasised the importance of a disciplined underwriting philosophy: “Our ingrained underwriting philosophy, detailed renewal planning to treaty level and validated, predictive pricing metrics such as rate adequacy and loss ratio, gives our underwriters complete confidence to transact business.”

Gale also highlighted the advantages of operating cohesively across geographies, noting that, “Operating as one reinsurance company, regardless of geography, allows for the efficient deployment of capacity and ensures we offer consistency to our clients and brokers wherever they access us.”

He concluded by underscoring the company’s strengths in security, data and analytics and expertise: “Our AA- security, our best in-class data and analytics, and most of all our people provide us confidence to navigate and thrive in whatever market conditions we face.”",https://www.reinsurancene.ws/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jon-gale-axa-xl-re.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 07:58:56.439161

meaningful benchmark.""
Clarifying the Pleading Standards for Imprudence: The pleading standard in ERISA cases is particularly important given the costs of defending ERISA class actions and the high number of cases that settle.","On December 9, 2025, the Solicitor General (""SG""), on behalf of the United States Department of Labor (""DOL"") and the United States Department of Justice (""DOJ""), filed briefs with the Supreme Court in two high-profile ERISA class action cases: Pizarro v. The Home Depot, Inc. and Parker-Hannifin Corp. v. Johnson. Both cases involve legal issues—on which lower courts have disagreed—regarding the burden on plaintiffs in cases alleging breaches of ERISA's fiduciary duties.

The SG asked the Court to review both cases and resolve them by adopting legal standards that are more favorable to ERISA plan fiduciaries. The SG's recommendation substantially increases the likelihood that the Court will agree to hear the cases and shows an increasing willingness by DOL to take action to help curb abusive ERISA litigation targeting plan sponsors, which has driven up the costs of administering plans.

1. Pizarro v. The Home Depot: Burden of Proof on Loss Causation

A key issue in ERISA litigation is which party has the burden of proving that a fiduciary breach resulted in a loss to a plan. In Pizarro, the Eleventh Circuit held that a plaintiff has the burden of proof to show that a fiduciary breach caused a loss to a plan. By contrast, the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits have held that once a plaintiff proves a breach and loss, the burden shifts to the fiduciary defendant to prove that the loss was not caused by the breach.

The SG's brief argues the Eleventh Circuit's view—that plaintiffs have the burden of proving loss causation—is correct. The SG explained that this was a reversal of the government's position in earlier cases, but that ""[f]ollowing the change in Administration . . . the government has reviewed its position and concluded that the . . . better [view] . . . leav[es] the burden of proving causation on ERISA plaintiffs.""

2. Parker-Hannifin Corp. v. Johnson: Pleading ""Meaningful Benchmarks""

Another key issue in ERISA litigation is what a plaintiff must plead at the beginning of a case to allow a court to infer that a breach of fiduciary duty may have occurred. In the context of challenges to plan investment options, the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have held that a plaintiff must allege a ""meaningful benchmark"" that a challenged investment underperformed. Under this standard, a plaintiff must plead facts showing that ""benchmark"" funds share similar strategies, risk profiles, and objectives as the challenged fund. This standard is often described as an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison. Many courts have also applied a ""meaningful benchmark"" requirement for challenges to plan recordkeeping fees.

In Parker-Hannifin, the Sixth Circuit split from the majority of other courts by holding that while ""[a] meaningful benchmark may sometimes be one part of an imprudence pleading, . . . is it not required"" and that, in any event, a broad ""market index"" can serve as an ""inherently . . . meaningful benchmark."" The SG's brief argues that the Sixth Circuit erred by not requiring the plaintiff to plead a ""meaningful benchmark"" and by concluding that a broad market index was a sound basis for comparison. The SG explained that permitting comparisons to a broad market index without an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison subjects fiduciaries to improper hindsight bias and fails to screen out meritless lawsuits.

Implications for Plan Sponsors

A Supreme Court decision that adopts the SG's position in one or both cases would help address some aspects of recent ERISA litigation that have driven up the costs of administering plans:

1. Solidifying the Burden of Proof: The practice of shifting the burden of proof to defendants to disprove loss causation can make defending ERISA cases more time-consuming and expensive, and also encourages plaintiffs to pursue cases in which there is little to no loss caused by a fiduciary breach. The SG's position, if adopted by the Court, would help address both of these issues by requiring plaintiffs to prove loss causation.

2. Clarifying the Pleading Standards for Imprudence: The pleading standard in ERISA cases is particularly important given the costs of defending ERISA class actions and the high number of cases that settle. Plaintiffs often base lawsuits on flawed comparisons, which may be allowed to proceed if there is no requirement that the comparisons are a ""meaningful benchmark."" The SG's position, if adopted by the Court, would help discourage meritless lawsuits and increase the likelihood that they are dismissed before costly discovery expenses are incurred.

Following the Supreme Court's decision earlier this year in Cunningham v. Cornell University, Congress and DOL both appear concerned that it has become too easy for plaintiffs to plead claims that survive a motion to dismiss. In addition to these amicus briefs, Representative Randy Fine (R-Fl. 6th) recently introduced the ERISA Litigation Reform Act (H.R. 6084) (""ELRA"") which would require plaintiffs to plead and allege that certain ERISA prohibited transactions were not used by defendants. Plan sponsors and service providers will want to watch these legislative and judicial developments as they could provide a path for courts to more quickly identify and dismiss meritless claims.

We will continue to monitor these petitions as the Court considers whether to add them to its docket. If you have any questions, please contact your regular Groom attorney.

ID28,Levi Strauss,2025-12-16 09:37:12+00:00,Jewish Insider,New York City Comptroller Brad Lander Archives - Jewish Insider,Matthew Kassel,,,,,https://jewishinsider.com/tag/new-york-city-comptroller-brad-lander/,"The hotly anticipated primary matchup between outgoing New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) was widely expected to be a bellwether race that would test the strength of pro-Israel sentiment within the Democratic Party.
But nearly a week after announcing his challenge, Lander, the progressive New York City comptroller, is so far tiptoeing around such differences, even as they are arguably the driving contrast in the primary.
Like Lander, he has frequently confronted the Trump administration on a range of issues including its immigration agenda.
Despite differences over Israel, Goldman is also endorsed by J Street, a progressive Israel advocacy group that has long been close to Lander.
“We are also grateful for our years-long friendship with Brad Lander, who is a vocal leader for our values.","The hotly anticipated primary matchup between outgoing New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) was widely expected to be a bellwether race that would test the strength of pro-Israel sentiment within the Democratic Party.

Featuring two prominent Jewish New Yorkers with sharply opposing views on the Middle East, the race notably pits Lander, an outspoken critic of Israel and its war in Gaza, against Goldman, a more moderate incumbent viewed as a strong defender of the Jewish state.

But nearly a week after announcing his challenge, Lander, the progressive New York City comptroller, is so far tiptoeing around such differences, even as they are arguably the driving contrast in the primary. Instead, he has more actively emphasized a message that is casting Goldman as ineffective in countering President Donald Trump — declaring it is “time for fighters” and “not folders” in Congress.

His top surrogates — including a range of vocal Israel critics including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City — have made no mention of Middle East policy in their statements endorsing his campaign to represent New York’s 10th Congressional District, which covers Lower Manhattan and a swath of northwest Brooklyn.

“We need more fighters in Washington now more than ever, and Brad is a fighter,” Warren said last week, adding that Lander has “the grit to not just win this race, but deliver for working families.”

Such comments, however, have failed to note that Goldman, who was elected to Congress in 2022, is recognized as a leading Trump antagonist, having served as the top prosecutor in the president’s first impeachment case. Like Lander, he has frequently confronted the Trump administration on a range of issues including its immigration agenda. Last week, for instance, Goldman seized the spotlight during a fiery House hearing in which he clashed with Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary — accusing her of illegally deporting asylum seekers in a grilling that drew headlines and social media virality.

Warren’s team did not respond to a request for comment when asked why she was not satisfied with Goldman’s record opposing Trump and his administration’s policies.

The early effort by Lander and some of his allies to employ rhetoric focused largely on fighting Trump has obscured how Israel is the clearest dividing line in the race — raising questions about Lander’s strategy as he seeks to shape a narrative Goldman’s supporters have dismissed as a misdirection. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), in a statement last week, countered that her colleague is one of the “best members” she has “ever served with” and said he “is exactly the right fighter for this moment.”

With opposition to Trump likely a major motivating force for midterm voters, Lander is now facing scrutiny over his attacks targeting a two-term incumbent who has long staked his reputation on effectively battling the president. Meanwhile, in the wake of Israel’s recent ceasefire with Hamas, it remains to be seen if Gaza will continue to be an animating issue heading into the June primary election that is already shaping up to be a heated and expensive race.

Goldman, a Levi Strauss heir whose estimated net worth is up to $250 million, spent nearly $5 million of his own money during his first primary bid three years ago, when he narrowly prevailed in a crowded field of progressive rivals who split the vote. Lander has also targeted Goldman’s personal wealth, saying that the “oligarchy” should not “be able to buy a seat in Congress.”

Even as Lander, a former longtime city councilman from Brooklyn, touts high-profile support from the Senate, House progressives have for their part so far stayed on the sidelines.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an Israel critic who backed Lander’s comptroller bid in 2021 and called him a “talented hero” after his arrest by federal agents at an immigration courthouse last June, said she is “not weighing into that race right now,” echoing other like-minded lawmakers who also declined to take sides in the looming primary.

While Lander has long identified as a progressive Zionist, he has been outspoken in criticizing Israel’s conduct in Gaza, accusing the country of war crimes and ethnic cleansing. He has additionally called for conditioning U.S. aid to Israel, a measure Goldman has rejected.

“What Lander is counting on now is the sentiment of the moment, which is further to the left and more anti-Israel,” Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic consultant in New York City, told Jewish Insider in a recent interview.

In a speech before the mayoral election, where he rose to prominence as a top surrogate for Mamdani after losing his own primary bid, Lander advocated for building a “coalition of anti-Zionists and liberal Zionists,” seeking to unify opposing factions to end “the horrors in Gaza.”

Goldman, for his part, chose not to endorse Mamdani, citing concerns about his approach to Israel and rising antisemitism, but he has said he looks forward to working with the mayor-elect on promoting his affordability agenda.

“What Lander is counting on now is the sentiment of the moment, which is further to the left and more anti-Israel,” Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic consultant in New York City, told Jewish Insider in a recent interview.

Still, in the days after launching his campaign, Lander has sent mixed signals about how he plans to highlight differences with his opponent on Israel.

In his campaign announcement video released last Wednesday, for example, he took a thinly veiled jab at Goldman in vowing not to do “AIPAC’s bidding,” referring to the increasingly demonized pro-Israel group, but did not mention the incumbent by name.

Lander told The New York Daily News in an interview last week that he views contrasts over Gaza as ancillary to their approaches to confronting the Trump administration, drawing raised eyebrows from observers who noted that hitting Goldman on his strongest issue avoids addressing a more salient tension over Middle East policy.

“On this issue, we have some disagreements,” he said of Israel, “but the core rationale is because it’s time for fighters not folders,” Lander elaborated on his approach to the race.

One Jewish community leader supportive of Goldman expressed frustration at the logic behind Lander’s challenge. “I’m just pissed that there’s not a single thing they can point to what Goldman isn’t doing right other than being pro-Israel,” he told JI, speaking on the condition of anonymity to address a sensitive subject.

During a campaign kickoff event in Brooklyn last week, Lander accused Goldman of failing to hold Israel accountable for its behavior in Gaza, saying “only I, of the two of us, recognize that Netanyahu’s leveling of schools and hospitals and the destruction of Gaza was a war crime,” in reference to the Israeli prime minister. He also reiterated that New Yorkers “don’t want elected officials who do AIPAC bidding in a district that recognizes that our safety and our freedom is bound up together.”

Lauren Hitt, a spokesperson for Lander’s campaign, disputed criticism that he is avoiding Israel as a top issue. “Brad literally called out AIPAC in his launch video, so safe to say he will continue to spend quite a bit of time discussing Israel in this race,” she said in a statement to JI on Friday.

On Friday, Lander also said on social media that, if he were a member of Congress, he would introduce a resolution censuring Rep. Randy Fine (R-FL) over his recent incendiary comments calling for Muslims to be “destroyed.” Lander, without directly citing his opponent, also noted he would “not have voted with Republicans” to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) over incendiary comments against Israel during the Israel-Hamas war in 2023, as Goldman himself had done.

Hours later, Goldman also denounced Fine in an X post for remarks assailing Muslims as “barbarians,” calling the statement “despicable and unacceptable” and saying he “must apologize and retract this tweet immediately.”

Lauren Hitt, a spokesperson for Lander’s campaign, disputed criticism that he is avoiding Israel as a top issue. “Brad literally called out AIPAC in his launch video, so safe to say he will continue to spend quite a bit of time discussing Israel in this race,” she said in a statement to JI on Friday.

“Brad will also speak to the other issues concerning NY-10 voters, including affordability — another topic where the heir to the Levi Strauss fortune is out of step with the district’s experience. NY-10 voters don’t need a representative that’s palling around with Don[ald Trump] Jr. in the Bahamas, they need someone who understands and represents their views,” Hitt added, referring to an October social media post in which Trump’s son sarcastically thanked Goldman for his “kind words” about the president’s ceasefire and hostage deal during the government shutdown.

For now, it is unclear how AIPAC and pro-Israel groups more broadly are assessing the matchup — and if they will choose to engage in the primary. A spokesperson for AIPAC declined to weigh in.

In 2022, AIPAC disclosed after Goldman had won his primary that its super PAC, United Democracy Project, had quietly contributed at least $350,000 to a separate group established near the end of the race to fund a series of attack ads against Yuh-Line Niou, a far-left rival who had drawn controversy for voicing alignment with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel.

One pro-Israel consultant, who was granted anonymity to address a sensitive topic, suggested “AIPAC’s involvement in the race would probably be a negative against Goldman.” Mamdani, an ally of Lander who has long been a fierce critic of Israel, performed well in the district — where Goldman’s views on Israel have faced backlash from left-wing voters.

Democratic Majority for Israel, which is backing Goldman, had been wary of a one-on-one contest with Lander, whom polling has shown is a strong opponent, according to a person familiar with the group’s discussions. Lander’s early consolidation of progressive support helped to push two other rivals on the left not to run in the race, effectively clearing the field for the outgoing comptroller. A spokesperson for DMFI did not respond to requests for comment regarding its plans.

Goldman, meanwhile, said in an interview with a local news outlet last week he welcomes Lander’s challenge but is “not really thinking about” the race “right now.” A campaign spokesperson said that he is “focused on stopping” Trump and “will deal with Brad and other challengers in the new year,” when he is “planning to roll out a flood of” endorsements from fellow House members.

Despite differences over Israel, Goldman is also endorsed by J Street, a progressive Israel advocacy group that has long been close to Lander. A spokesperson for J Street told JI in a statement the group is “proud” to back Goldman and “we deeply value his pro-Israel, pro-peace and pro-democracy leadership.”

“Dan has a progressive record,” said Chris Coffey, a Democratic strategist. “It’s not always as far left on Israel as Brad, for sure, and that is one of the things that differentiates them on policy.” Israel, he added, “could be a defining issue in this race,” regardless of Lander’s messaging efforts to prioritize Trump.

“We are also grateful for our years-long friendship with Brad Lander, who is a vocal leader for our values. We know that the issue of peace is close to both of their hearts,” the spokesperson continued. “Ultimately, it is up to the district to determine who they want to represent them in Congress, and we are glad to see two J Street-aligned voices in this race.”

A top J Street official, speaking on background to address the primary, confirmed the group will not be engaging materially in the race as it is satisfied with both candidates’ records. “I expect our donor base will give to both,” the official told JI. “There’s definitely a split of opinion on this race, to say the least.”

“Dan has a progressive record,” said Chris Coffey, a Democratic strategist. “It’s not always as far left on Israel as Brad, for sure, and that is one of the things that differentiates them on policy.” Israel, he added, “could be a defining issue in this race,” regardless of Lander’s messaging efforts to prioritize Trump.

Lander, for his part, could also face backlash from far-left activists in the district who have bristled at his identification as a progressive Zionist and have taken issue with his investments in an Israeli arms producer as comptroller, even as he chose to cease holdings of Israel bonds during his four years in office.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is focused largely on winning back the House in next year’s midterms, declined to comment on the primary, though it has traditionally backed incumbents.

Locally, a political advocacy group in the district called Brooklyn BridgeBuilders, which is dedicated to fighting antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment, is planning to support Goldman and is currently in the process of formalizing its strategy, according to Ramon Maislen, its CEO.

“The decision to challenge a highly effective liberal Jewish incumbent is incredibly fraught,” Maislen, a Jewish community activist who lives in Park Slope, told JI. “Dan is someone who has been unwavering in taking on Trump, defending our democracy and standing with the Jewish community.”",https://image.jewishinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/18185448/cropped-ji-initials-large-white-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-16 07:59:26.650565

Trading volume reached 163 million shares, nearly 15% below its three-month average of 191 million shares.

How the markets moved today

Monday’s move followed premarket reports of stronger H200 demand from China and fresh coverage of Nvidia’s Nemotron 3 open-source AI models. Investors are watching how AI infrastructure spending holds up against valuation and policy risks. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.16% to 6,816, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) fell 0.59% to 23,057. Within Semiconductors, industry peers Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) lost 1.52% and 0.79%, respectively, as traders weighed AI server demand against rising competitive pressures.

What this means for investors

Today, the market received welcome news that demand for H200 chips to be sold to China might be robust enough to increase output for this chip, now that U.S. export approvals have been secured. Monday also saw news that Nvidia plans to acquire the AI software firm SchedMD, which supplies software that can help AI data centers operate more efficiently. Investors are hoping these new items might help reinforce Nvidia's AI leadership and could start to reverse the 17% pullback the stock has seen recently.

Earlier this year, Nvidia's Q3 2026 results featured overall revenue growth of 62% with data center revenue growing even faster at 66%, year over year.

'This was the victory of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova and their leaders.
The shared path of Romanians on both sides of the Prut within the European Union is therefore wide open,' the Custodian of the Crown believes.
HM Margareta also pointed out that 'unfortunately, 2025 was also a year of trials, with greater difficulties than in the previous year,' recalling the continuation of the war in Ukraine.
One of the first journeys my father undertook after being exiled by the communists was to the United States, to campaign for the freedom of Romanians.","The elections in Romania and the Republic of Moldova, the war in Ukraine, the need to preserve European unity and to maintain strong ties between Europe and its North American allies, Canada and the United States, were the constants of the address delivered by the Custodian of the Romanian Crown, Margareta, at the Royal Evening dedicated to the Diplomatic Corps.

In her speech at the event held on Monday evening in the State Dining Room of the Royal Palace, Her Majesty brings to mind that 'this year we have also gone through profound political changes, such as the elections in May in Romania and the parliamentary elections in September in the Republic of Moldova.'

'Both were regarded, and rightly so, as decisive tests, not only for our political class but also for the foundations of our democratic system. And, broadly speaking, these tests were passed successfully. As I underlined last year, what happened in Romania during the elections of 2024 and 2025 was not something new. People feel that, although they have the right to vote, they do not have the power to change their destiny. For this reason, they feel drawn to political currents that promise a complete break with the past and offer supposed solutions that involve no cost. But even people who are not attracted by such political currents want to see new faces and to experience new forms of governance. From this point of view, what happened in Romania happened in most European countries,' said HM Margareta.

However, the Custodian of the Crown added that, on a closer look at the end of this year, there are several positive aspects of recent political events that deserve to be mentioned.

'The first is that our democratic institutions remain strong. No matter how many criticisms people levelled at the courts and electoral oversight commissions, the elections took place, the votes were counted and the final count was accepted as correct. As you will recall, given the passions generated by the elections, none of these achievements was guaranteed or self-evident at the time. The second positive outcome, worth mentioning, is that Romania's electoral process served as a warning to an entire continent about the scale of the danger posed by foreign interference in elections and by electoral manipulation through the involvement of social media platforms. What happened in Romania in the most recent electoral processes is now being studied by governments around the world. We failed to anticipate the undermining of our electoral system, but we succeeded in removing it,' HM Margareta said.

According to Her Majesty, a significant shared victory for our countries was represented by the elections in the Republic of Moldova, which ensured the continuation of the country's European path and vocation, despite a similar foreign-funded campaign aimed at destabilising the country and discrediting its electoral process.

'This was the victory of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova and their leaders. But it was also a victory for all Romanians, for the Government of Romania, steadfast in its determination to support the economy of the sister country, and for the authorities in Chisinau, who were not discouraged by aggression and intimidation. The shared path of Romanians on both sides of the Prut within the European Union is therefore wide open,' the Custodian of the Crown believes.

HM Margareta also pointed out that 'unfortunately, 2025 was also a year of trials, with greater difficulties than in the previous year,' recalling the continuation of the war in Ukraine.

'Russia's invasion of Ukraine has continued uninterruptedly. I am proud that my country has remained firm in its support for Ukraine and has increased its military and humanitarian assistance. Let us bear in mind, however, that the sacrifices of recent years are likely to be followed by even greater sacrifices in the years ahead. The war in Ukraine has lasted almost as long as the First World War and its traces will remain for a long time to come. Regardless of what happens, whether there is an armistice or whether fighting continues, the reconstruction of Ukraine will be a huge undertaking, requiring sacrifices from all European nations. And these sacrifices will be impossible without European unity and without maintaining strong ties between Europe and our close North American allies, Canada and the United States,' said the Custodian of the Crown.

HM Margareta said that 'the time has come to carry out an ‘audit' of transatlantic relations.'

'As we know, this year has been dominated by debates on this subject, with divergent opinions and strong passions crossing the Atlantic. This is neither surprising nor necessarily a bad thing. More than eight decades after the end of the Second World War and more than three decades after the end of the Cold War in Europe, the time has come to conduct an ‘audit' of transatlantic relations. No one questions the fact that Europeans should contribute more to their own security measures. The surprise, therefore, is not that the United States is now asking Europe to recalibrate its defence measures. The surprise is that Americans were so patient with generations of previous European leaders who ignored such requests from Washington. If we want others to take our security and defence seriously, we must be the first to take them seriously,' the Custodian of the Crown said.

At the same time, in her speech, Her Majesty underlined that greater efforts must be made 'to remind our allies in the USA and Canada that our transatlantic ties are deeper than economic exchanges or financial contributions to NATO.'

'Throughout his life, and despite many shattered hopes and disappointments, King Mihai never lost his confidence in the commitment of the United States to the freedom of Europe. One of the first journeys my father undertook after being exiled by the communists was to the United States, to campaign for the freedom of Romanians. And although Romanians had to endure four decades under communist dictatorship, King Mihai continued to believe that Romania would only prosper when anchored in the strong bond between European nations and the USA. The generation of leaders of King Mihai's time is no longer with us. But it is the duty of the current generation to revive the spirit of transatlantic cooperation, reminding our American allies that they have no stronger or more reliable partners than the Europeans. It is true that it will not be easy to convince Washington of this. But it is necessary work, and one that the Romanian Royal Family, together with the Government and the diplomats of our country, remains determined to see through to the end,' HM Margareta underscored.

The Custodian of the Crown welcomed 'the proclamation of His Holiness Pope Leo XIV' and 'his subsequent public actions,' stressing that faith represents 'the necessary bond that links our nations.'

'The courageous journeys of the Sovereign Pontiff to areas of conflict and danger and his open support for the dignity of citizens and nations have been among the most encouraging and uplifting developments of this year. As we have recently seen at the consecration of our National Cathedral, faith remains the moral compass, the necessary bond that links our nations. Even in a time when cynicism is fashionable, unwavering faith in humanity and in certain moral principles remains indispensable. Soon, we will celebrate the birth of Our Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour. But regardless of our religion or belief, let us never forget that what unites us is far more important than what divides us. These two key spiritual events of the year are powerful proof of this truth,' said HM Margareta.

She also pledged to ensure historical continuity in devotion to the interests and objectives of the nation.

'One of the fundamental duties of the Royal Family is to ensure historical continuity in devotion to the interests and objectives of the nation, so we will continue without hesitation to do what we have always done: to maintain national confidence and to strengthen Romania's international standing. We do this not only out of pride, but also out of necessity. Despite all the problems and difficulties, Romania has never been more secure and more prosperous than it is today. Romanians have never been freer to travel and to fulfil their aspirations and pursuits than they are today. Could all of these be done better? Of course. But we can only improve this condition if we have confidence in our current situation. We commit to continuing to do all this, both at home and abroad, with your support and friendship. My entire family wishes you and all your loved ones a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year,' Her Majesty the Custodian of the Crown concluded in her address at the Royal Evening for the Diplomatic Corps.

In the moving annual total ending June 2025, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) value in Asia Pacific grew 4%, supported by 2.8% volume growth and 1.2% price increases.
The first is shifting market dynamics, as Asia Pacific moves away from reliance on a single growth engine.
While China remains the largest contributor to regional GDP growth, India and parts of Southeast Asia are expected to increase in economic significance, creating a more multi-market growth environment.
These brands are often moving faster in innovation and adapting more closely to local consumer needs compared with multinational competitors.","Singapore – Asia Pacific is on track to overtake North America as the world’s largest consumer market by 2035, driven by accelerating e-commerce adoption, growing use of AI, and the rise of local brands, according to a joint report by Bain & Company and NielsenIQ (NIQ).

Private consumption in the region is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7% to reach $36 trillion by the end of the next decade, the report said. This comes as global private consumption is projected to nearly double, from about $65 trillion in 2025 to between $110 trillion and $120 trillion by 2035.

The shift highlights changing consumption patterns across Asia Pacific, with spending growth becoming more fragmented across markets and channels. These changes are expected to shape consumer dynamics in 2026 and beyond.

In the moving annual total ending June 2025, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) value in Asia Pacific grew 4%, supported by 2.8% volume growth and 1.2% price increases. This contrasts with growth in North America and Western Europe, which has been largely driven by price inflation. While the region remains a key growth engine for global consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies, performance continues to vary widely by market.

NIQ data shows that India continues to gain momentum, with FMCG value growth accelerating from 7.2% in 2024 to 13.7% in the first half of 2025. Southeast Asia, however, saw growth ease to 1.8%, down from 3.5% a year earlier. China showed early signs of recovery, with FMCG growth rising from 2.8% in 2024 to 4.7% in the first half of 2025, driven largely by online sales. South Korea’s performance also remained supported by continued e-commerce expansion.

According to the report, these uneven growth patterns underscore the need for more localised market strategies.

Looking ahead to 2026, Bain and NIQ identified six forces expected to shape the region’s consumer landscape. The first is shifting market dynamics, as Asia Pacific moves away from reliance on a single growth engine. While China remains the largest contributor to regional GDP growth, India and parts of Southeast Asia are expected to increase in economic significance, creating a more multi-market growth environment.

The report also pointed to diverging consumer preferences across markets. Pricing behaviour is not uniform, with signs of premiumisation in markets such as India and Indonesia, while China shows increasing polarisation between value and premium segments.

Channel complexity is also increasing, with online sales remaining the primary growth driver. E-commerce accounts for about 40% of FMCG sales in both China and South Korea, while social commerce and quick commerce are expanding rapidly. A NIQ survey found that 39% of Asia-Pacific consumers already use generative AI when shopping online, with a further 40% indicating a willingness to adopt it.

Another trend highlighted is the rise of local and regional brands. Domestic players are gaining share across most developing markets in the region, with the exception of India. These brands are often moving faster in innovation and adapting more closely to local consumer needs compared with multinational competitors.

The report also cited scalable agility as an emerging differentiator, as CPG companies seek to replicate successful practices across markets to improve speed and cost efficiency. In addition, AI is increasingly being embedded across the value chain, from product development to marketing, sales and supply chains, as companies look to support faster and more data-driven decision-making.

“In China, India, Indonesia and Thailand, where adoption is higher than the regional average, over 50% of consumers are already using generative AI to help with their online shopping. As Asia Pacific consumers continuously look for more convenience and affordability, we expect generative AI to play a bigger part in empowering the shopper,” said Craig Houliston, Asia Pacific regional consulting and insights lead at NIQ.

To sustain growth, Bain and NIQ said CPG companies will need to clearly define the role of each market—whether as a growth driver, profit centre or testing ground—and align investments accordingly. The report also highlighted the importance of building channel-specific business models and strengthening in-market decision-making, while scaling AI adoption using reliable data and consumer insights.

“The APAC region is complex in nature. Consumer behaviours and channel dynamics are fragmenting faster than ever,” added Elle Yang, partner at Bain & Company. “Winning in this environment means having the courage to localise – adapting faster to market signals while building models that can scale across borders.”",https://marketech-apac.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/APAC-NiQ-and-Bain-consumer-growth-report.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 10:14:20.580315

Visibility surrounding government healthcare policies has improved and investors are allocating more assets to the sector. Expectations of future healthcare earnings are rising, flanked by an extensive innovation pipeline and the emergence of new market segments, and yet healthcare stocks still trade at a discount to the world market. A re-rating is under way and gaining momentum. At today’s levels, there are still attractive entry points for building up exposure to healthcare sector.

The sector’s momentum is supported by the following five key developments:

1. Policy clarity is drawing investors back to the sector

The drug price agreement between the US administration and Pfizer announced at the end of September and subsequent deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in November were clearly a turning point. These announcements finally created a predictable framework with respect to drug pricing and reimbursement policies, reducing the uncertainty that had been hanging over the sector like a dark cloud and improving planning visibility.

Investors responded quickly to this development: Healthcare has been one of the strongest performers in the global stock market so far this quarter (+9%); biopharma has outperformed the overall market by about 14 percentage points and an additional USD 8 bn in capital was invested in healthcare ETFs worldwide during the past three months alone. Institutionals and generalist investors are returning to the healthcare sector.

2. Re-rating has begun – still more catch-up potential

Healthcare valuations are drifting back toward historical averages, but the sector is still valued at a discount of about 13% to global stocks. The outlook for healthcare companies is bright: Estimated average profit growth for biopharmaceuticals and life science tools during the period from 2024 to 2027 is approx. 15%, which is more than double the historical growth rate of about 7% per year.

3. Powerful growth drivers and high M&A capacity in the biopharma space

Looking ahead to 2026, biopharma stocks stand to benefit from multiple structural trends: Novel treatment classifications in oncology, advancements in treating obesity and diabetes, and therapeutic innovations in cardiovascular care are creating additional market volume. Demand for bioprocessing solutions is growing, too, driven by onshoring activity and new production platforms. The biopharma industry is also sitting on a cash pile of more than USD 180 bn that it can spend on M&A to offset lost revenues in the wake of patent expirations or close strategic gaps in R&D pipelines.

4. From glucose sensors to pulsed field ablation – rapid growth in medtech

Medtech remains a key growth driver, driven by strong levels of demand in established market segments and the recent emergence of new billion-dollar markets. Robot-assisted surgical systems, glucose monitoring devices and structural heart disease treatment are areas that continue to show double-digit growth rates: We project that the addressable market for continuous glucose monitoring solutions will expand from USD 11.7 bn in 2024 to more than USD 21 bn by 2029. New technologies such as pulsed field ablation are rapidly making inroads in clinical care settings and AI-supported smart glasses are gaining ground – EssilorLuxottica’s organic sales growth rate has more than doubled this year, driven by precisely this product category. Medtech valuations are also still attractive: Large-cap medtech stocks are trading at 18.3 times 12-month forward earnings, which represents a discount of about 18% vs the S&P 500.

5. Emerging markets are ramping up their innovation skills and market clout

Emerging markets are steadily becoming innovation powerhouses in their own right. China is in the midst of a significant transformation from an out-licensing partner to a global pharmaceutical player: Chinese companies are bringing a growing number of first-in-class drugs to the market on their own, for example bispecific antibodies in oncology or novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) platforms. In India, a rapidly growing middle class and huge government spending on healthcare infrastructure stand out as growth drivers. Chronic disease management is a fast-growing market in this country; private hospital chains are steadily expanding and specialty pharmaceuticals has become a relevant market segment. As a result of these developments, new healthcare ecosystems are emerging in which the newly industrialized countries are no longer simply a part of Western companies’ drug manufacturing and cost structures, but rather the originators of top-quality specialty drugs and global therapy platforms.

Conclusion

The healthcare sector is entering 2026 with strong structural growth drivers and improved earnings visibility. Innovation remains the key factor here, supported by well-filled pipelines, new therapy platforms and tech-enhanced solutions.

Attention is also drawn to the significant divergence in sector performance as measured by the MSCI World Healthcare Index: In the first half of 2025, the performance gap between the best- and worst-performing stocks was quite conspicuous at +72% and -38%. This gap reflects the widening segmentation within the healthcare sector universe, which is an attractive environment for active managers, who can generate significant alpha through diligent stock selection.

After the recent phase of policy uncertainty, healthcare is now back in its historical sweet spot of innovation, growth and high operational visibility, from where it has regularly delivered tangible value.

Hankin currently serves as chief underwriting officer (CUO) of QBE International, a role he has held since March 2021. He joined QBE European Operations as deputy CUO in July 2020 and became part of the group CUO team in March 2020.

In his new position, Hankin will lead QBE’s global reinsurance arm, which writes across multiple lines and geographies as part of the group’s capital and risk management strategy. He will initially continue as CUO of QBE International while the firm recruits a successor, with an announcement on that appointment to follow.

Hankin’s move follows Killourhy’s transition from QBE Re to the group CFO role after leading the reinsurance business since 2022.

The leadership handover comes at a point where the re/insurance group is managing softer conditions in some segments while seeking to retain underwriting discipline. Killourhy has previously framed the strategy around a more focused client set and selective use of capacity, positioning the platform for earnings resilience as market pricing and catastrophe activity evolve.

Hankin’s broader career spans more than 30 years in underwriting and senior leadership across six major insurance organizations, including RSA, AXA, Zurich, AIG and Aviva. His experience covers underwriting leadership, P&L management, risk and governance, and strategic planning, and he holds an MBA from Cass Business School.

He is also the current chair of the Association of British Insurers’ (ABI) commercial committee, a role that connects him with a broad cross-section of the UK and international commercial insurance market. That external perspective is expected to inform his work with QBE Re as cedents and brokers assess capacity, structures and pricing across treaty programs.

QBE Re and structured reinsurance solutions

Hankin will also be stepping into the role as QBE Re builds out targeted capabilities in areas such as structured reinsurance. The company recently created a global head of structured reinsurance position, highlighting quota share arrangements, loss portfolio transfers and adverse development covers as a key growth focus amid mid-2025 market conditions that favored buyers looking for capital-efficient solutions.

His underwriting background and portfolio responsibilities at QBE International are likely to be relevant as the reinsurer balances growth opportunities with risk appetite and capital deployment.

“I’m pleased to recognize the strength of our internal talent pool and Nick’s leadership skills with this appointment,” Harris said, adding that Hankin “combines technical excellence with strategic vision and proven execution capability.”

Harris added that QBE Re has taken on a larger role within the group’s global portfolio. “QBE Re plays an increasingly important role for the business and I’m confident Nick and the QBE Re team will continue to deliver for our cedants and partners through engagement and the strength of our global franchise,” he said.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/079/0383_639014686173871562.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 01:22:44.845650

IBM has released CUGA (Configurable Generalist Agent) as an open-source AI agent, aimed at automating complex enterprise workflows through multi-agent orchestration, API integration, and code generation. Licensed under Apache 2.0, CUGA can be freely used, modified, and deployed in enterprise environments without restrictive licensing barriers.

Benchmark results position CUGA among the most capable AI agents currently available. The agent achieved a 61.7 percent success rate on the WebArena benchmark for web-based tasks and a 48.2 percent scenario completion rate on AppWorld, which evaluates API-driven workflows. IBM researchers describe these figures as top-tier performance for AI agents, even though they remain far from human reliability.

CUGA is built specifically for enterprise use, featuring intent detection through a chat layer, structured task planning, a dynamic task ledger that enables re-planning, delegation to specialised agents, secure sandboxed code execution, and policy-compliant response generation. The system integrates with Langflow, a low-code agent design platform, and supports open models including gpt-oss-120b and Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-fp8.

In a research paper, IBM authors stated: “Our vision for IBM CUGA is to develop a generalist agent that can be adapted and configured by knowledge workers to perform routine or complex aspects of their work in a safe and trustworthy manner.”

IBM acknowledges broader industry challenges.

Looking beyond the headlines and exploring the machinery behind Eli Lilly's artificial intelligence strategy, shows the company didn't simply stumble into a trillion-dollar valuation - it carefully engineered its way up there. The more one observes, the clearer it becomes that Lilly is not just using AI; it is functioning as an AI factory, a fully integrated environment where compute, data, models, digital twins, workflows and people coordinate with almost mechanical precision.

See Also: Traditional M365 Data Protection No Longer Enough

Part 1 of this two-part blog dealt with how Eli Lilly's $1-trillion valuation signals the emergence of AI-native enterprises, showcasing how deeply integrated AI strategy, infrastructure and culture can redefine competitive advantage. Part 2 explores the company's AI factory as a blueprint for future enterprise architecture, showing how deeply integrated, scientifically grounded AI infrastructure is reshaping research and development, clinical ops, manufacturing and workforce models, and offering a wake-up call to CIOs on what real AI transformation demands.

Learnings From Use Cases

Lilly's AI fabric isn't built on abstractions or slogans but on several hundred use cases grounded in real science, operations, bottlenecks and economic outcomes.

Consider drug discovery. We often view it as a straightforward process: target identification, hit discovery, lead optimization and preclinical studies. But in reality, it is a complex maze full of uncertainties. Traditional R&D is a slow, probabilistic journey. AI transforms that by enabling companies to view biology as an information system.

AI use cases at Eli Lilly:

Generate molecules from scratch;

Design proteins with specific structural constraints;

Predict absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties long before wet-lab testing;

Simulate binding affinities;

Explore reaction pathways;

Optimize chemical synthesis routes;

Map disease pathways;

Design enzyme candidates.

This is no longer hypothetical. These are real workflows occurring in AI-native labs today, workflows that enable enterprises, including Lilly to reduce years of uncertainty to months or even weeks of guided experimentation.

The strength of these use cases does not come from replacing the scientist but from empowering the scientist with the ability to explore - on a large scale - the unseen landscape of biology. AI becomes a telescope for the molecular universe.

The use cases go beyond R&D. The same Klover.ai document explains how AI now transforms clinical operations: protocol creation, cohort simulation, patient stratification, site selection, adverse event prediction and monitoring, safety-signal detection and documentation automation. Clinical trials, which once faced chronic delays, inefficiencies and unpredictable outcomes, have now become well-organized systems.

Some use cases seem almost science-fictional but are becoming very real include digital twins of bioreactors, production suites, supply chains and even entire manufacturing sites. Lilly uses digital twins not just as visual dashboards but as predictive engines. In bioprocessing, AI-based twins can forecast cell growth trajectories, reaction yields, impurity profiles and batch variability. They can suggest adjustments to parameters before deviations occur - a level of predictive control that was previously unavailable.

This is where AI shifts from being just an assistant to becoming a copilot for the whole enterprise.

AI in Data Fabric

The most fascinating part of Lilly's AI maturity lies in the connective tissue, the data fabric. While reading through the Klover.ai foundational stack, it becomes clear that companies attempting to ""do AI"" without a coherent data architecture are setting themselves up for disappointment. The stack outlined in document emphasizes raw data ingestion, structured experiment datasets, curated domain-specific data layers and vectorized representations for model training.

Lilly's manufacturing data fabric, built on systems, such as Databricks and HiveMQ, exemplifies that principle. The company does not just collect data; it orchestrates it. Every sensor, reactor, QC instrument, document and clinical note contributes to an environment optimized for AI reasoning.

Lilly does not experience the ""pilot graveyard"" common in enterprise AI. When one's data and compute environments are built for scale, AI is no longer just a demonstration; it transforms into an operational model.

Lilly's operating model extends into the workforce. What impressed me in Thomas Fuchs' philosophy, and what aligns strongly with the Klover.ai view of internal adoption, is the emphasis on collaboration over disruption. Transformation often fails because of resistance from the organization and not because the technology is weak. Lilly avoided that trap by embedding AI into the workflow of the biologist, the clinician, the quality engineer and the supply chain manager. AI isn't thrown over the fence. It is co-developed.

This is a profound cultural shift: the employee doesn't fear AI because the company has not positioned AI as a threat. Instead, it has positioned AI as a tool for amplification.

Looking at all of this, a CIO will notice a pattern emerging. It's the architecture of what is referred to as the AI factory, which has several key characteristics:

Compute treated as capex;

Data treated as raw material;

Models treated as proprietary IP;

Digital twins treated as operational command centers;

AI copilots embedded across every functional role;

Workflows redesigned, not automated.

This is not the language of IT modernization. This is the language of industrial engineering.

For CIOs, the uncomfortable truth is that most enterprises will not make this leap. Not for the lack of intelligence or budget, but because they lack conviction. They will keep buying tools. They will keep outsourcing intelligence. They will keep dabbling. Five years from now, they will realize that companies, such as Lilly, didn't win because they adopted AI early, but because they rebuilt their companies around AI entirely.

The trillion-dollar milestone was merely the visible sign. The real foundation is the AI infrastructure beneath. CIOs need to realize that the companies leading the next decade won't be those with the most AI projects, but those with the most robust AI architecture.

Lilly built theirs in plain sight. The question now is: who will make the next one?",https://ismg-cdn.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/blogs/eli-lilly-marks-ai-native-enterprises-arrival-part-2-image_medium-1-p-4000.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 05:58:43.415882

The move marks Nvidia’s latest push to further open-source technology amid the ongoing AI race. On Monday, Nvidia also debuted its Nemotron 3 family of open-source AI models, adding to the recent rollout of “the world’s first industry-scale” open-source software for the development of self-driving vehicles.

Nvidia did not disclose how much it paid for SchedMD, which is based in Utah and operates as a software development company.

Why Is SchedMD Important?

SchedMD is the brain behind Slurm, the open-source software used to manage AI workloads and high-performance computing. Slurm is used by developers to build foundational generative AI models, including for training and inference — the task of using a trained AI model to respond to queries or make predictions based on new data.

SchedMD attracts various types of customers, including cloud capacity providers, manufacturers, AI companies, and research labs. These customers come from various sectors, including healthcare and life sciences, autonomous driving, energy, manufacturing, government, and financial services.

Nvidia to Keep SchedMD’s Software Open-Source

Nvidia has assured that it will keep Slurm open-source and vendor-neutral — it will continue to make the software compatible with various types of hardware and software systems. The chipmaker added that it will also ensure that the software remains widely available to its existing community of users.

“Nvidia will accelerate SchedMD’s access to new systems — allowing users of Nvidia’s accelerated computing platform to optimize workloads across their entire compute infrastructure — while also supporting a diverse hardware and software ecosystem, so customers can run heterogeneous clusters with the latest Slurm innovations,” the chipmaker explained in a blog post.

Similarly, Danny Auble, CEO of SchedMD, noted that Slurm will benefit from Nvidia’s advanced know-how and investment in accelerated computing capabilities.

Is NVDA a Good Stock to Buy Now?

On Wall Street, Nvidia’s shares continue to enjoy a Strong Buy consensus rating from analysts based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell issued over the past three months.

In addition, the average NVDA price target of $258.45 implies about 46% upside from the current trading levels.

The European Commission recently signalled a renewed interest in minority shareholdings by (i) finding that structural links (minority shareholdings) between competitors and related information flows facilitated collusion between Delivery Hero and Glovo, two competing undertakings in the European online food delivery sector and (ii) requiring Prosus to divest the majority of its 27.4% shareholding in Delivery Hero SE to obtain approval for the acquisition of Just Eat Takeaway by its parent company. Both recent cases demonstrate how minority stakes in competitors can give rise to antitrust concerns and why it is wise to:

put in place clear guardrails to avoid any coordination with minority shareholders in the same or related sector and avoid the exchange of commercially sensitive information beyond what is required from an investor perspective (e.g., set up Chinese walls, avoid cross-directorships); and

carefully consider your minority holdings when engaging in M&A, particularly in concentrated markets and/or when it concerns leading players that closely compete.

In a recent judgment rejecting an appeal lodged by Michelin contesting the validity of a dawn raid conducted by the European Commission at its premises in 2024, the EU General Court considered whether unilateral public statements made by companies in earnings calls or other public announcements could amount to anticompetitive price signalling and rise to the level of coordination among competitors in violation of Article 101TFEU. The European Commission picked up the allegedly problematic public communications through a systematic algorithmic analysis that focused on companies’ public statements about forward-looking strategic business decisions and about how competitors might react to their own behavior containing phrases such as “we want to send a signal”, “we have plan to”, “the strategy is to focus on”, “we strive to stick to”, “we will do our best to”, “we are able to”, and “[it is] not our intention to go for”.

While the Court stressed that it was only reviewing at this stage whether the Commission had sufficient evidence to conduct a dawn raid at Michelin’s premises (and not considering whether the conduct actually amounted to an infringement), it noted that it was at least plausible that the unilateral public statements by competitors that the Commission had observed could have as their object to send a signal to their competitors. That, the Court concluded, constituted reasonable grounds to support the Commission’s suspicions relating to coordination and a potential violation of Article 101 TFEU.

In the current enforcement climate, companies should therefore refrain from (or at least be very careful with) any public statements on future pricing intentions, particularly if they are active in a concentrated market. While the investigation is still ongoing, the European Commission is likely to scrutinize to what extent financial regulatory requirements called for the observed level of disclosure in earnings calls.

The attached client alert provides a summary of these developments, along with practical guidance on risk mitigation. We are happy to discuss these developments and their impact on your business.

1. Minority Shareholdings: Risk of Antitrust Scrutiny

Background. On June 2, 2025, the European Commission fined Delivery Hero and Glovo c. 330M EUR for a cartel in the online food delivery sector. This marks the first sanction by the European Commission for anticompetitive collusion facilitated by a minority shareholding.

Delivery Hero had acquired a 15% minority non-controlling stake in competitor Glovo in 2018, progressively increasing its stake before acquiring full control in 2022. During this time, Delivery Hero’s representation on Glovo’s Board of directors – and the associated access to Glovo’s sensitive information and strategic decision-making process – enabled the two firms to exchange sensitive information, allocate geographic markets, and strike a no-poach deals. Each of these three practices constitutes anticompetitive collusion between rivals.

Key risk areas. This ground-breaking decision sets out the following three key risk areas surrounding minority cross-shareholding between firms active in the same sector:

Enhanced information access: Delivery Hero’s representatives on Glovo’s Board of directors shared Glovo’s commercially sensitive data (e.g., on its strategies, pricing, and operations) with Delivery Hero’s management. This exceeded typical investor disclosure requirements as Glovo’s commercially sensitive information was widely disseminated within Delivery Hero.

Undue decision-making influence: Delivery Hero used its position as a Glovo shareholder (and associated voting power and approval rights) to influence Glovo’s business strategy and align it with its own business strategy. Delivery Hero did this by: (i) exercising (or threatening to exercise) its power of approval over specific Glovo strategic business decisions and (ii) influencing the position of Glovo’s other shareholders or Board members (e.g., to allocate markets between the two competitors, so that only Delivery Hero or Glovo is active in any EEA country).

Coordination platform: Delivery Hero used its rights as a minority shareholder (i.e., a representation on the Board with access to commercially sensitive information) to create structural ties between its and Glovo’s staff at different levels and across various functions. These staff ties led to mutual invitations to each other’s general meetings and to dedicated knowledge-sharing between specialised staff, i.e., a platform for further exchanges of commercially sensitive information between the two competitors.

Practical guidance. To minimize the risk of collusion resulting from minority shareholdings, we recommend implementing the following best practices:

Implement formal information barriers within the context of the minority stake;

Limit cross-directorship (i.e.,the representative on the target’s Board should not also be on the minority shareholder’s own Board);

Implement strict clean team rules covering both the negotiations for acquiring a minority stake and the subsequent exercise of shareholder rights (i.e., the minority shareholder’s representative on the target’s Board should not report out on the target’s commercially sensitive information);

Set out clear minority investor protocols in shareholders’ agreements that limit the minority shareholder’s access to the target’s commercial information to only what is needed for the effective exercise of shareholding rights; and

Appoint Board representatives with appropriate compliance training.

In conclusion, it is critical to avoid the sharing of commercially sensitive information beyond investor needs as this could be sufficient for an antitrust infringement. Companies must also put in place safeguards to minimize the risk of coordination with minority shareholders in the same or related sector – especially where the alignment of financial interests in case of significant minority stakes increases the incentives to align commercial strategies. The European Commission often seizes employees’ texts and instant messages over apps (e.g., WhatsApp), so even such informal exchanges can become the foundation of an antitrust case.

2. Public Communications: Risk of Attracting Dawn Raids

Background. In January 2024, the European Commission dawn raided several tire manufactures, including Michelin, for suspected anticompetitive price signalling through earnings calls.

Key risk area. The European Commission deployed a systematic algorithmic analysis to monitor several hundred thousand earnings calls across multiple sectors, utilising search terms designed to identify suspicious statements about competitors’ behaviour and companies’ future market intentions. For instance, the European Commission identified potentially collusive statements beginning with “we want to send a signal”, “we have a plan to”, “the strategy is to focus on”, “we strive to stick to”, “we are able to” and “[it is] not our intention to go for”. The European Commission then conducted a qualitative analysis of the potentially collusive statements to check if their context corroborated a theory of anticompetitive price signalling between competitors (e.g., looking at the timing and content of the public statements made in the same period by competitors).

EU General Court’s key findings. Michelin appealed against the European Commission’s inspection, claiming, among others, that public earnings calls are a standard, even mandatory practice and therefore do not justify a dawn raid. The EU General Court in rejecting Michelin’s appeal, clarified that even unilateral public statements (such as statements made in earnings calls) may be the basis of anticompetitive collusion between competing firms (although it did not at this stage take a position on whether the statements observed actually amounted to collusion or violation of Article 101 TFEU).

To conduct a dawn raid, the European Commission only needs indicia justifying a reasonable suspicion that firms have colluded in violation of competition law.

The EU General Court rejected arguments that the public statements were (i) “commonplace” or standard industry practice, or that (ii) financial transparency obligations justified such communications (e.g., replying to questions in earnings calls).

Implications. Practical guidance. The European Commission has now developed sophisticated surveillance systems to detect and analyse linguistic patterns indicating coordination. To minimize the risk of collusion resulting from public statements (such as earnings calls), we recommend implementing the following best practices:

Avoid making (even unilateral) public statements expressing future pricing intentions, even reactively, in particular when operating in concentrated markets;

Limit statements in earnings calls to what is necessary and strictly required under securities and other financial regulatory rules;

Implement strict guidelines on do’s and don’t’s for financial disclosures;

Do not take a position on competitors’ behavior in any public statements, but instead focus on the company’s own experience and developments; and

Use neutral answers to reply to questions raised in public, rather than disclosing concrete anticipated strategies or price levels.

Given the European Commission’s increasing sophistication in its efforts to unearth collusive parallel conduct by firms, public statements made by companies containing potentially competitively sensitive information will likely remain a focal area of enforcement.",https://www.clearygottlieb.com/-/media/images/social-thumbnail/alert-memos/2025/antitrust-risks-resulting-from-noncontrolling-minority-shareholdings-and-public-statements-on-future.jpg?h=837&w=1600&hash=23774ECB8083923FC7B696905F5C699C,N,,2025-12-16 05:58:46.595544

For established consumer staples companies like Kraft Heinz, the price to sales ratio is a useful way to value the business because sales tend to be more stable than earnings and are less affected by accounting adjustments or one off items.

In general, a higher multiple is justified when investors expect stronger growth and see lower risk, while slower growth or higher uncertainty usually warrants a lower, more conservative multiple. Kraft Heinz currently trades at about 1.15x sales, which is above the broader Food industry average of roughly 0.65x but below the peer group average of around 1.93x. This suggests the market is assigning it a middle of the road valuation relative to comparable names.

Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Kraft Heinz is 1.38x. This is a proprietary estimate of what its price to sales multiple should be after factoring in its growth outlook, profitability, risk profile, industry, and market cap. This can be more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison, which can overlook important company specific traits. With the current 1.15x multiple sitting below the 1.38x Fair Ratio by a reasonable margin, the shares appear modestly undervalued on this metric.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kraft Heinz Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you turn your view of Kraft Heinz into a story backed by numbers. It does this by linking your assumptions for future revenue, margins, and earnings to a financial forecast, a fair value estimate, and a clear indication of whether the stock looks attractive or not based on how that fair value compares to the current share price. All of this then updates automatically as new news or earnings arrive. For example, a bullish investor might build a Narrative that leans into emerging market growth, product innovation, and digital initiatives to justify a fair value closer to the high analyst target near 51 dollars. A more cautious investor might focus on weak core market volumes, margin pressure, and guidance cuts to anchor their Narrative near the low end around 27 dollars. This illustrates how different perspectives translate into different fair values and can help you quickly see how today’s price compares to your own view of Kraft Heinz.

For investors seeking asset preservation, appreciation, and risk diversification, gold is undoubtedly an indispensable core holding both now and in the future.","Against the backdrop of heightened volatility in global financial markets, the allure of gold as a traditional safe-haven asset is once again shining brightly. Analysts at Société Générale explicitly stated that gold prices will continue to perform strongly throughout 2026, not only surpassing the performance of U.S. bonds but also significantly outperforming the U.S. dollar. This forms the core rationale for the bank's decision to maintain its highest allocation ratio, while strongly recommending that investors actively purchase this precious metal during price pullbacks to capitalize on long-term upward opportunities.

Gold Allocation in Multi-Asset Portfolios: Prudent Adjustments to Address Market Challenges

As the new year approaches, market analysts at Société Générale announced in their latest report that they will maintain a 10% allocation to gold within multi-asset investment portfolios. This decision reflects the bank's steadfast confidence in gold. At the same time, they have made significant adjustments to their exposure to other fixed-income assets: reducing holdings of U.S. inflation-linked bonds to zero and halving corporate bond holdings to retain only 5%. This strategic realignment aims to optimize portfolio structure amidst a weak overall performance of fixed-income assets and a declining dollar undermining dollar-denominated asset returns, achieving more balanced risk diversification and return potential.

Theme of Expanding Asset Price Performance: Gold Leading the Rise Across Multiple Asset Classes

Analysts emphasized in the report that fixed-income assets faced severe challenges over the past year, with a weakening dollar further eroding the common currency returns of related assets. However, Société Générale's multi-asset management platform achieved outstanding performance through balanced allocation. This success was driven by their precise grasp of the theme of expanding asset price performance, which was evident not only in the robust rebound across various equity markets but also prominently in the exceptional performance of alternative assets like gold. Looking ahead, as U.S. interest rates gradually decline, this expansion theme is expected to continue evolving, providing strong support for tangible assets such as gold.

Reaffirming Bold Price Forecast: Gold to Reach $5,000 by End of 2026

Analysts at Société Générale have reiterated their aggressive forecast for gold prices, predicting that the price per ounce of gold will reach $5,000 by the end of 2026. This target stands out particularly in the current market environment, especially given that the spot price of gold is already nearing historical highs around $4,300. This projection is not speculative but based on a comprehensive assessment of global central banks' diversification needs, rising investor risk aversion, and expectations of accommodative monetary policies.

Surging Retail Investor Enthusiasm: Buying on Pullbacks Becomes Optimal Strategy

Retail investors are increasingly diversifying their asset allocations, pouring into the gold market through bullion, coins, and gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts specifically noted that non-allied central banks will continue accelerating their diversification away from dollar-denominated assets, while gold itself can provide effective protection against various risks, including the possibility of the Federal Reserve adopting a more dovish stance following leadership changes. Therefore, they strongly recommend that investors decisively buy on price pullbacks to lock in long-term appreciation potential.

Expectations of Dovish Fed Policies: Supporting the Bullish Case for Gold

Societe Generale maintains a strongly bullish view on gold, primarily driven by an optimistic outlook on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. They anticipate that the Fed will implement more aggressive easing measures. Although inflationary pressures are expected to ease next year, potential risks in the U.S. labor market are gradually emerging, further reinforcing the necessity for easing. Despite the recent drop in the federal funds rate from 5.5% to 4%, the real interest rate adjusted for inflation remains relatively high, indicating that overall monetary conditions are still tight. Economists at the bank predict an additional 50 basis points of rate cuts by April next year, which aligns broadly with current market consensus. If this trajectory materializes, it will bring the policy rate closer to neutral levels and gradually ease financial conditions.

Dual Mandate and Political Considerations: Interest Rate Policy Will Be Strongly Anchored

On a deeper level, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate—balancing inflation control with employment stability—alongside political pressure to manage food prices before elections, will serve as a strong anchor for policy rates throughout 2026. These dynamics will reinforce caution against further tightening while significantly raising the likelihood of additional easing if economic growth faces stronger headwinds. Overall, these factors collectively establish a solid foundation for the continued upward trajectory of gold prices.

The Portfolio Diversification Value of Gold: Unique Advantages Beyond Capital Appreciation

In addition to significant anticipated capital appreciation, Societe Generale highly values the intrinsic worth of gold as a portfolio diversification tool. Currently, the correlation between the U.S. stock market and bonds remains higher than historical averages, implying reduced risk dispersion among traditional assets. In this environment, gold’s low-correlation characteristics are particularly valuable, effectively reducing overall portfolio volatility and enhancing long-term risk-adjusted returns.

Conclusion: A New Era for Gold Has Arrived—Investors Should Act Early

In summary, Societe Generale’s latest perspectives inject strong confidence into the gold market. Driven by expectations of Federal Reserve easing, central bank gold purchasing demand, and global uncertainties, gold is not only set to maintain its status as the ultimate safe-haven asset but also has the potential for a breakthrough rally by 2026. Although prices are currently elevated, any pullback presents an excellent opportunity for allocation. For investors seeking asset preservation, appreciation, and risk diversification, gold is undoubtedly an indispensable core holding both now and in the future.

The market remains long oil, long liquidity, long assets and suppliers -- and short demand growth,"" bunker trader Monjasa CEO Anders Østergaard told Platts, part of S&P Global Energy.
""We expect 2026 to be a relatively slow and competitive year where players will need to adjust their commercial expectations.""
The International Energy Agency has forecast global bunker demand could flatline at around 5 million b/d by 2030, despite an above-trend growth of 140,000 b/d in 2024 mainly due to ship diversions.
""This will affect [fuel] consumption of the vessels,"" said Guido Cardullo, head of marine at bunker supplier Fratelli Cosulich.","Global conventional bunker markets are set to endure lackluster growth in the coming year, with potential downside from the resumption of Red Sea traffic and peaking consumption of 0.5% sulfur fuel oil, currently the most used grade.

Geopolitical conflicts have prompted ships to sail longer distances and resulted in healthy ton-mile demand growth in recent years, but some energy analysts anticipate the positive effects on marine energy demand being offset by improvements in energy efficiency.

The world's consumption of oil-based marine fuels is expected to fall from 11,891 petajoules in 2024 to 11,787 Pj this year before recovering to 11,813 Pj in 2026, according to classification society DNV's latest long-term energy outlook.

""Our base case is for a muted demand environment next year. The market remains long oil, long liquidity, long assets and suppliers -- and short demand growth,"" bunker trader Monjasa CEO Anders Østergaard told Platts, part of S&P Global Energy.

""We expect 2026 to be a relatively slow and competitive year where players will need to adjust their commercial expectations.""

The International Energy Agency has forecast global bunker demand could flatline at around 5 million b/d by 2030, despite an above-trend growth of 140,000 b/d in 2024 mainly due to ship diversions.

With Yemen-based Houthi militants attacking merchant shipping since the Gaza war broke out in October 2023, vessel operators have been diverting their ships from the Suez Canal to take the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope due to safety concerns.

IMF PortWatch data shows ship transits via the Bab al-Mandab Strait have remained half of the pre-war level after the Iran-backed rebel group paused their attacks as part of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire in October 2025, even as many shipping companies are planning to return to the Red Sea if safety concerns can be addressed.

""This will affect [fuel] consumption of the vessels,"" said Guido Cardullo, head of marine at bunker supplier Fratelli Cosulich. ""The closing of the Suez Canal was positive in terms of volume consumed.""

'Peak VLSFO'

Cardullo, like many other industry participants, is predicting a slower-than-expected marine energy transition to alternative fuels due to the delay of International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework, originally designed to place a cost on greenhouse gas emissions from bunker use from 2028.

But the UN agency has lowered sulfur limits of marine fuels to 0.5% to 0.1% in the Mediterranean since May 2025, while similar rules will take effect in Canadian Arctic and Norwegian waters from March 2026.

The Emission Control Area regulations have resulted in a switch from very low sulfur fuel oil with 0.5% limits to 0.1%S marine gasoil in most cases, but a growing number of shipping companies are ramping up scrubber installations to consume cheaper 0.5%S high sulfur fuel oil or opting for LNG or biofuels for decarbonization benefits, according to consultancy 2050 Marne Energy owner Adrian Tolson.

""We have seen peak VLSFO ... it has become a distressed product due to oversupply,"" Tolson said.

The premium of Platts Bunkerworld Marine Fuel 0.5% Sulfur Index for VLSFO to Platts BW380 Index for HSFO averaged $65.60/metric ton in the first 11 months of 2025, compared with $98.90/mt for the whole of 2024 and $120.90/mt for 2023.

DNV data showed the number of scrubber-fitted ships grew from 5,469 in 2023 to 6,168 in 2024, and is expected to reach 6,712 by the end of 2025.

Rotterdam recorded 2.1 million mt of VLSFO sales and 2.6 million mt of HSFO in January-September 2025, putting Europe's largest marine refueling hub on track to see lower deliveries of the 0.5%S grade for the second consecutive year.

Based on its test results, fuel surveyor VPS said the share of VLSFO in the Mediterranean ECA's bunker mix dropped to 30% in May-October 2025 from 53% in November 2024-April 2025, MGO increased to 30% from 16%, HSFO to 29% from 28%, ultra low sulfur fuel oil with 0.1% limits to 8% from 2%, and biofuels to 4% from 1%.

""The supply chain needs to adapt for VLSFO as a secondary/tertiary demand product,"" Tolson said.

Trade patterns

Singapore, the world's largest bunker port -- which recorded all-time high sales of 54.9 million mt in 2024, reported a 1.7% year-over-year gain to 46.4 million mt in the first 10 months of 2025.

Ship diversions from the Red Sea have benefitted bunker sales in Singapore and African ports in recent quarters at the expense of refueling ports in Egypt, the East Mediterranean and the Middle East, but the demand patterns could be reversed if vessels return to the waterway, several bunker industry participants said.

""The diversion of ships over the past two years boosted demand in places like Port Louis and the Canaries ... If Red Sea transit returns to normal, we're likely to see traditional hubs such as Fujairah naturally pick up again,"" said Philip Wang Balke, senior trader at bunker trading house Integr8 Fuels.

Monjasa's Østergaard sees downside for bunker volumes in Singapore, West Africa and South Africa if Red Sea traffic normalizes, but stressed that a general weak demand picture tends to hurt suppliers at major ports more.

""These conditions will hit major flow ports harder than smaller regional ports, simply because the large hubs -- Singapore included -- are most exposed to the competitive pressure created when too many suppliers chase limited incremental demand,"" the CEO added.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-15 21:01:02.036945

About the MajesTEC-3 Study

MajesTEC-3 is an ongoing, Phase 3 randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of teclistamab plus daratumumab versus investigator’s choice of daratumumab and dexamethasone with either pomalidomide or bortezomib in patients with relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. The primary endpoint is PFS and secondary endpoints include complete response or better, overall response rate, minimal residual disease negativity, overall survival, time to worsening of symptoms (MySIm-Q), and safety. The MajesTEC-3 study is a part of the MajesTEC clinical program, which includes exploring the potential of TECVAYLI as a combination regimen.

About TECVAYLI

TECVAYLI® (teclistamab-cqyv) is a first-in-class, bispecific T-cell engager antibody therapy that uses innovative science to activate the immune system by binding to the CD3 receptor expressed on the surface of T-cells and to the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and some healthy B-lineage cells. TECVAYLI® received accelerated approval from the U.S. FDA in October 2022 as an off-the-shelf (or ready-to-use) antibody that is administered as a subcutaneous treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody.4

In February 2024, the U.S. FDA approved the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for TECVAYLI® for a reduced dosing frequency of 1.5 mg/kg every two weeks in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have achieved and maintained a CR or better for a minimum of six months. Since FDA approval, more than 20,800 patients have been treated worldwide with TECVAYLI®.

The European Commission (EC) granted TECVAYLI® conditional marketing authorization in August 2022 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with RRMM who have received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody, and have demonstrated disease progression since the last therapy. In August 2023, the EC granted the approval of a Type II variation application for TECVAYLI®, providing the option for a reduced dosing frequency of 1.5 mg/kg every two weeks (Q2W) in patients who have achieved a complete response or better for a minimum of six months.

Canceling a subscription, the lawsuit said, would take navigating through as many as 23 screens and 32 actions.","(WHTM) — Pennsylvania joined 20 other states, the District of Columbia and the Federal Trade Commission in a federal lawsuit accusing Uber of deceptive subscription practices.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, said the ride-sharing company falsely promoted its Uber One subscription. It also said Uber improperly used negative option marketing tactics, which is when a company automatically renews a subscription until a customer cancels it.

Uber offers a subscription, which acts as a single plan for Uber and Uber Eats, for $9.99 a month or $96 a year, with the promise to save on rides and food deliveries. However, the lawsuit said that the claim was false and did not account for the cost of the membership.

It also alleged Uber offered customers free trials and billed them before the stated billing date. Canceling a subscription, the lawsuit said, would take navigating through as many as 23 screens and 32 actions.

“Uber’s stance as an industry giant does not give them the right to fool and harm consumers,” said Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday in a statement. “Riders should know exactly what they are signing up for, and subscriptions should be easy to cancel.”

Sunday said his office found the alleged practices affected Pennsylvanians who rely on ride-share services.

However, Uber disputed the lawsuit as “misguided” and “wrong” in a statement.

“If this lawsuit were to succeed, it would upend how virtually every modern subscription service operates,” the company said. “Uber One’s sign-up and cancellation processes are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law. Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less.”

Pennsylvania is seeking relief through the state’s Consumer Protection Act and the U.S. Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act. This includes restitution, penalties, and an injunction against Uber.

The Attorney General’s Office encouraged consumers who think they may have been a victim of Uber’s alleged practices to file a complaint with the office.

A trial is scheduled for February 2027.

Recovery to 2019 levels, after taking inflation into account, still seems elusive, however.

American Airlines

American CFO Devon May on Dec. 3 at a Goldman Sachs conference reiterated what the company's executives have said earlier this year, that the carrier is on track to regain the market share of corporate demand lost during its controversial 2023-24 sales and distribution strategy. As American heads into 2026, ""we're not talking about regaining lost share,"" May said. ""We're talking about gaining more incremental share.""

May noted that the airline is ""somewhere around our historical fair share,"" but that there were plenty of years when it had been above that. ""We have a real opportunity to get back above where we were just prior to the sales and distribution change,"" he said.

As for margins, the profile is ""probably exactly the same as it was previously,"" May added. ""Maybe it's a little better in some areas and a little worse than others, but for the most part, it's very similar to what it was previously.""

Factors May noted that could drive an increase in corporate share include American's ""nice growth "" this year in Philadelphia, where it did ""exceptionally well,"" growth in New York after shuffling LaGuardia routes and frequencies and upgauging planes, and ""meaningful"" growth in Chicago.

The carrier also will continue to roll out new product enhancements, May said.

Delta Air Lines

Delta CEO Ed Bastian on Dec. 3 at a Morgan Stanley conference said of the carrier's corporate share, ""The gap we've seen this year is the greatest we've ever seen in terms of our share—well over 30 percent of corporate travel comes on Delta, yet we only have a little over 20 percent share of seats in the market,"" he said. ""Despite others saying that they're going for it, they're certainly not taking it out of us.""

Still, Bastian added that while pricing has been strong the past couple of years, helping corporate revenue to recover from the pandemic, ""volume is where we still have opportunities."" He added that corporate volume is at or slightly under where it was in 2019.

The economy, in terms of nominal gross domestic product, has grown about 25 percent since then, ""so there's maybe a 30 percent gap between volume of travel versus where we were in 2019 to where we are today,"" Bastian said. ""And I think we will continue to chip away at that. I don't think we'll ever get that full 30 percent back, but I know we're going to continue to make progress.""

United Airlines

United chief commercial officer Andrew Nocella discussed competitive pricing and corporate demand on Dec. 4 at The BTN Group's The Beat Live conference.

""All of our businesses are just so different than they were in 2019. That's painful for all of us, but I know every one of us sees the inflationary impact on our cost structures,"" Nocella said. ""United is no different—we see significant cost pressures. We've done our best to craft an appropriate level of discounts or incentives, whether it's agency or corporations, that kind of make sense in this new cost world. We think it's fair and balanced, but I know it's different than it used to be.""

When asked about United's corporate strategy and who is filling premium-class seats, Nocella said that ""I wish you all were filling it at the same rate that you were in 2019, but you're not. I think you all know that. The world has changed, and … you know how your business travel policies have changed.""

The premium leisure space has ""accelerated a lot,"" Nocella said, and United now fills what once were corporate seats with premium leisure seats. ""I think that's actually worked pretty well for us.""

As for AI, Nocella said he worries that businesses will be ""dramatically smaller from a headcount point of view, and you won't travel as much because a computer doesn't travel.""

Still, though smaller, the corporate market remains ""incredibly important,"" Nocella added. ""I hope that internal meetings once again go out on the road. That's one of the key differences between where we were and where we are today. … It's so much better to be in person. I think the value to United is [it's] still a large segment of our business, not as big as it used to be, [but] I like to think it's going to recover.""",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTN/uploadedImages/2015_Site_Maintenance/BTN_Link_PreviewLogo.png?n=3260&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-12-15 18:03:48.040039

The round included backing from Link’s founding investors Samsara BioCapital and Sheatree Capital, plus Bristol Myers Squibb and Kyowa Kirin, among others.

Since its 2022 founding, the California biotech has raised a total of $92 million in seed and series A cash, according to the release.

Link touts “logic-gating technology” designed to enable higher precision for the safer deployment of CAR-T compared to current therapeutics.

“We recognized that for most cancer types, particularly solid tumors, the promise of CAR-T therapies is limited by a dearth of cancer-specific targets and abundant expression of most solid tumor targets in normal vital tissue,” Link co-founder Robbie Majzner, M.D., associate professor at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, said in the release.

""Link is advancing a technology that we developed while at Stanford University that allows for logic-gated CAR-T cell control,” the former Stanford instructor Majzner continued, referring to his work conducted with fellow co-founder Crystal Mackall, M.D., professor of pediatrics and medicine at Stanford.

“The Link-based CAR activates and kills target cells only when a combination of antigens is co-localized on the tumor, thereby bypassing normal tissues that express only one of those targets,” Majzner explained. “We believe this approach will enable potent CAR-T therapies to attack a wide range of tumors while sparing healthy tissue.”

The platform's safety features are designed to create novel “clean” target pairs and enable next-gen CAR-Ts for both solid and liquid cancers.

Link's lead program, coded LNK001, is currently in preclinical development for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with the biotech anticipating phase 1 dosing to start sometime next year, according to the release.

The biotech’s second program, which takes aim at colorectal cancer, is slated for in-human testing in 2027.

Eli Lilly could extend its lead in its core therapeutic area with the launch of two new products next year.

Eli Lilly's shares look attractive even at current levels.

10 stocks we like better than Eli Lilly ›

Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) recently made history. It became the first healthcare stock to reach a market cap of $1 trillion. Although it has since dipped below that, the company's performance over the past few years has been phenomenal, and there could be more of that in store next year. How will 2026 unfold for Eli Lilly? Let's look at two potential developments to watch out for.

1. A pair of new launches in weight management

Eli Lilly has now firmly established itself as the leader in the market for anti-obesity drugs. However, it could solidify its position next year with a pair of new launches. First, there is orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 medicine that performed well in phase 3 studies across weight management and Type 2 diabetes this year. Not only did orforglipron induce significant weight loss and declines in A1C levels, but the therapy also outperformed competing medicines in head-to-head clinical trials, positioning it as the best-in-class in its niche.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »

Orforglipron has also been the recipient of a new voucher, introduced this year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that allows for much shorter approval times for medicines -- between one and two months, compared to the usual 10 to 12 months. So, orforglipron could earn regulatory approvals early next year -- hopefully in the first quarter.

Then there is retatrutide. This medicine is still undergoing phase 3 studies, but it could reach the market by the end of next year. Retatrutide's differentiator is that it mimics the action of three different gut hormones, an approach not yet seen in the weight loss industry. This triple hormonal pathway approach could lead to even more significant efficacy than Eli Lilly's current main growth driver, tirzepatide.

In a late-stage study, retatrutide led to a mean weight loss of 28.7% at the highest dose. These are efficacy numbers not seen in the industry until now. Eli Lilly is hoping to address an underserved corner of the market with retatrutide: people with high body mass indexes who aren't eligible for surgery and for whom existing anti-obesity therapies would not be sufficient.

Here's why all that is important. The FDA's new voucher, which allows for a one- to two-month review, prioritizes drugs that target public health concerns. Obesity certainly fills the bill. That's why orforglipron was chosen as part of this program. Retatrutide could, too, considering the patients it targets. If Eli Lilly releases more positive data for the medicine within the first half of 2026 -- and gets this new voucher for retatrutide -- it could launch it by the end of the year.

2. There could be a stock split on the horizon

Here's another bold prediction for Eli Lilly next year: I believe the company will announce a stock split. It has been a while since it did so; the last time was in the late 1990s. However, Eli Lilly's shares have skyrocketed since. The stock price is currently around $1,000. Stock splits don't improve a company's underlying operations, but besides reducing an expensive-looking stock price, companies also resort to this move when management has confidence in the business' medium-term prospects.

That should be the case here. Eli Lilly has been firing on all cylinders. Revenue and earnings growth have been phenomenal, and with exciting pipeline candidates like orforglipron and retatrutide, the pharmaceutical giant should be able to maintain that pace over the next few years. And if it does so, its share price will become even more expensive. So, the time may be right for Eli Lilly to announce a stock split, which it could do sometime in 2026.

Is the stock a buy?

One argument against investing in Eli Lilly is that competition in its core therapeutic area is expected to intensify. However, hardly any company has produced mid- or late-stage clinical trial results that match those of Eli Lilly's candidates. Additionally, the pharmaceutical giant offers attractive programs and approved medicines in other areas. That includes Kisunla in Alzheimer's disease, Verzenio in cancer, and Omvoh and Taltz in immunology.

Some might also point out that its shares look expensive. Eli Lilly is trading at 32 times forward earnings, which is much higher than the 17.8 average for healthcare stocks. Even so, Eli Lilly is growing its revenue and earnings at a pace that justifies its premium. The company remains attractive at current levels and could deliver market-beating returns over the next five years.

In today’s Pharmaceutical Executive Daily, Eli Lilly reports positive topline Phase III results for retatrutide, the FDA expands Amgen’s Uplizna label into generalized myasthenia gravis subtypes, and a new analysis explores whether pharmaceutical manufacturing is truly moving back onshore.

Eli Lilly has announced positive topline results from a Phase III trial of retatrutide, its investigational triple-hormone receptor agonist for obesity and metabolic disease. The study met its primary endpoints, reinforcing retatrutide’s potential as a next-generation therapy in an increasingly competitive cardiometabolic landscape.

In regulatory news, the FDA has approved an expanded indication for Amgen’s Uplizna to treat adults with generalized myasthenia gravis who are anti–acetylcholine receptor or anti-MuSK antibody positive. The decision broadens treatment options for patients across multiple disease subtypes and strengthens Uplizna’s position in rare neuromuscular disorders.

Meanwhile, a new industry analysis examines whether pharmaceutical manufacturing is truly returning to domestic markets, citing persistent challenges including cost pressures, workforce shortages, and complex supply chains. While policy incentives have accelerated select investments, the report suggests widespread reshoring remains uneven and highly product dependent.

The suit alleges that Uber One does not provide the advertised savings, is unclear about when billing will occur, and is extremely difficult to drop.

So, consumers often waited until the last minute, usually after Uber One had billed them.
Ellison says Uber is in violation of multiple Minnesota state laws, in addition to federal law.","(KNSI) – Uber and the state of Minnesota are again locking horns, this time over the popular ride-sharing app’s subscription cancellation policy.

Attorney General Keith Ellison joined a lawsuit on Monday along with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and a bipartisan group of states, saying that Uber violates the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act, or ROSCA. The suit alleges that Uber One does not provide the advertised savings, is unclear about when billing will occur, and is extremely difficult to drop.

Ellison says, “Uber deliberately made their Uber One cancellation process long, confusing, and frustrating in the hopes that consumers would give up and let Uber keep taking their hard-earned money. Far too many Minnesotans have lost money to zombie subscriptions they either thought they canceled or didn’t realize they signed up for in the first place, and that’s unacceptable. I’m suing Uber to stop these predatory business practices and force them to do right by the people of Minnesota.”

The suit alleges Uber bills customers before their free trial period is over and, if someone tries to cancel the subscription in the middle of the trial, the service is cut off at that exact moment, not the end of the test period. So, consumers often waited until the last minute, usually after Uber One had billed them.

Ellison also points out the difficult process of canceling the subscription, including scrolling to the bottom of one menu, then navigating to the bottom of two more pages, answering a survey, and being presented with the option to pause the membership rather than cancel it.

Ellison says Uber is in violation of multiple Minnesota state laws, in addition to federal law. The suit was filed in United States District Court in Oakland, California.

Broadcom shares fell about 5% on Monday following an 11% slump on Friday, leaving them 17% below their record high reached on Wednesday.","In at least one corner of the artificial intelligence market, sentiment has turned decidedly negative.

Broadcom , CoreWeave and Oracle , three companies intimately tied to the AI infrastructure buildout, all had another rough day on Wall Street on Monday after selling off sharply last week.

While the three stocks are all still solidly up for the year — CoreWeave held its market debut in March — the most recent trend suggests that investors are concerned about whether the returns on investment will ever justify the level of spending taking place.

""It definitely requires the ROI to be there to keep funding this AI investment,"" Matt Witheiler, head of late-stage growth at Wellington Management, told CNBC's ""Money Movers"" on Monday. ""From what we've seen so far that ROI is there.""

Witheiler said the bullish side of the story is that, ""every single AI company on the planet is saying if you give me more compute I can make more revenue.""

Still, the market was displeased last week with quarterly earnings reports from chipmaker Broadcom and cloud infrastructure supplier Oracle, even though both companies beat on revenue and issued forecasts showing that AI demand is soaring.

Oracle, which is now heavily reliant on the debt markets to fund its data center development, provided scant details about how it will continue to finance its commitments. The company said it would ramp up capital expenditures in the current fiscal year to $50 billion from an earlier forecast of $35 billion because of new contracts from the likes of Meta and Nvidia.

It's also ratcheting up leases. As of Nov. 30, Oracle had $248 billion in lease commitments for data centers and cloud capacity commitments that will run for 15 to 19 years. That's up 148% from the end of August.

Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said he expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, driven by both custom chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.

However, as the company spends heavily on more parts to produce server racks, investors are going to have to stomach a hit to profits. CFO Kirsten Spears said on Broadcom's earnings call that ""gross margins will be lower"" for some of the company's AI chip systems.

Broadcom shares fell about 5% on Monday following an 11% slump on Friday, leaving them 17% below their record high reached on Wednesday.

Oracle dropped about 2.5% on Monday and is now down 17% in the past three trading days. The company has lost 46% of its value since Sept. 10, when the stock had its best day since 1992 following disclosure of a massive AI backlog.

Venture capitalist Tomasz Tunguz, who focuses on enterprise software and AI, wrote in a Monday blog that Oracle's recent fundraising binge has left it with a debt-to-equity ratio of 500%, ""dwarfing its cloud computing peers."" Amazon , Microsoft , Meta and Google all have ratios between 7% and 23%, he wrote.

Tunguz, founder of Theory Ventures, said the other company with a notably high ratio, at 120%, is CoreWeave, which provides cloud computing services built largely around Nvidia's graphics processing units.

CoreWeave shares fell about 6% on Monday after dropping 11% last week. The company has lost 60% of its value from its high in June.

Within this new ecosystem, FMGI will lease Alquist A1X printers, financed and serviced by Hugg & Hall, to execute large-scale 3D-printed projects nationwide. With this model, Alquist can sell, lease and rent its proprietary equipment and training methods to the broader construction industry, expanding access to 3DCP at scale.

“For the first time ever in our industry we have the right partners in place to scale 3DCP at a massive level,” said Patrick Callahan, CEO of Alquist in a statement. “For years, 3DCP has been an emerging idea. Now, it’s a proven solution being deployed by some of the nation’s largest companies.”

The projects, which vary in size, scope and regional application, will apply Alquist’s robotic 3D printing system to deliver structural walls and infrastructure elements more efficiently and sustainably than traditional construction methods.

Shares of global pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) jumped 3% in the afternoon session after the stock benefited as investors rotated capital out of the volatile technology sector and into defensive names.

As tech giants like Oracle and Broadcom faced scrutiny over rising costs and shrinking margins, Wall Street sought safer alternatives. Adding to the momentum, the company recently announced highly positive Phase 3 trial results for its next-generation weight loss candidate, retatrutide. Investors viewed the successful trial as a strong validation of Lilly's deepening pipeline dominance in the massive and rapidly expanding cardiometabolic health market.

After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $1,060, up 3.2% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Eli Lilly’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 10 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock gained 3.4% on the news that the company announced highly positive Phase 3 trial results for its next-generation weight loss candidate, retatrutide.

The triple agonist drug, which activates three hormone receptors (GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon), met all primary and key secondary endpoints in patients with obesity and knee osteoarthritis. The headline data showed that the highest dose of retatrutide led to an average weight loss of up to $28.7% over 68 weeks, a result that significantly exceeded the efficacy of its existing blockbuster, Zepbound.

Furthermore, the trial demonstrated substantial improvements in pain and physical function. Investors viewed the successful trial as a strong validation of Lilly's deepening pipeline dominance in the massive and rapidly expanding cardiometabolic health market, reinforcing the stock's premium valuation.

Eli Lilly is up 36.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $1,060 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $1,110 from November 2025.

The sheer demand for computational power, primarily manifested in the urgent need for data centers, is the “one critical piece” fueling this expansion.
Witheiler points to a Federal Reserve that is either stabilizing or cutting interest rates, which generally creates a more conducive environment for public market listings.
Furthermore, the public market itself has shown significant resilience, with a 17% year-to-date increase.
The financial infrastructure, including debt financing for massive data center builds and a reawakening IPO market, is adapting to support this growth.","“Every single AI company on the planet is saying if you give me more compute, I can make more revenue.” This assertion by Matt Witheiler, Head of Late-Stage Growth at Wellington Management, cuts directly to the core of the current artificial intelligence boom, framing the debate around an “AI bubble” not as a question of existence, but of sustainability. His commentary on CNBC’s Money Movers provided a sharp, grounded perspective for founders, VCs, and AI professionals navigating this transformative period.

Witheiler, representing a firm managing over a trillion dollars in assets, engaged in a candid discussion with CNBC hosts Carl Quintanilla and Sara Eisen about the underlying mechanics of AI’s explosive growth and the financial conditions necessary to sustain it. The conversation centered on whether the current enthusiasm constitutes a bubble, the role of debt financing, and the readiness of the IPO market for the next wave of AI innovators.

The prevailing sentiment, Witheiler argues, suggests that the AI boom is undeniably real. The sheer demand for computational power, primarily manifested in the urgent need for data centers, is the “one critical piece” fueling this expansion. This intense demand is a tangible reality, not speculative froth. The question of a bubble, therefore, becomes academic in the face of such fundamental infrastructure requirements. It’s not about if a bubble exists, but when the insatiable demand for compute might abate, and if the return on investment (ROI) can continue to justify the massive capital expenditure.

Crucially, this cycle is distinct from previous tech booms due to its reliance on debt financing for infrastructure. While equity often fuels early-stage innovation, the colossal scale of data center construction and custom chip development necessitates significant debt. This model, Witheiler contends, is currently viable because the ROI is demonstrably present. Both consumers and enterprises are actively deriving substantial value from AI applications, translating into a willingness to pay for these services. This end-user demand provides a critical feedback loop, validating the continued investment in the underlying compute infrastructure.

Examining the public versus private markets, Witheiler acknowledges the recent volatility seen in some public tech stocks, like Oracle, which despite its AI involvement, has corrected significantly from its highs. He clarifies that his expertise lies primarily in the private markets, where he observes a broader and perhaps less scrutinized enthusiasm. He suggests that while public markets might be discerning between “pockets of winners and other pockets of losers,” the private sector exhibits a more widespread belief in the long-term viability and impact of AI. This doesn’t negate the reality of AI innovation, but highlights differing valuation approaches and investor appetites across market types.

The conversation naturally segued into the much-anticipated IPO pipeline for AI companies. Witheiler’s outlook is optimistic, asserting that the question for many prominent AI firms—such as Anthropic and OpenAI, along with other high-growth tech companies like SpaceX—is not if they will go public, but when. He anticipates a robust IPO calendar extending into 2026, driven by a confluence of factors that make public offerings increasingly attractive.

Going public offers a dual benefit for these capital-intensive companies. Firstly, it provides a powerful mechanism for capital raising, essential for funding the ongoing build-out of data centers and the development of proprietary, custom chips that are becoming increasingly vital for competitive advantage in the AI space. This capital infusion allows companies to scale their operations and maintain their technological edge. Secondly, IPOs provide much-needed liquidity for early employees, founders, and private investors. These stakeholders, who have often held illiquid private shares for years, require an exit strategy. The current volume of secondary and exit opportunities in the private markets is insufficient to meet these needs, making public listings a critical path for unlocking value.

Several favorable market conditions are converging to support this anticipated IPO surge. Witheiler points to a Federal Reserve that is either stabilizing or cutting interest rates, which generally creates a more conducive environment for public market listings. Furthermore, the public market itself has shown significant resilience, with a 17% year-to-date increase. This renewed investor confidence is crucial. IPO volumes have already seen an 18% increase this year, with total proceeds up a staggering 89%, and the average IPO performing well, up 30%. These metrics indicate a receptive market ready to absorb new offerings.

The current AI boom, while undeniably a period of intense investment and rapid innovation, appears to be grounded in a tangible demand for compute and a clear, albeit evolving, path to monetization. The financial infrastructure, including debt financing for massive data center builds and a reawakening IPO market, is adapting to support this growth. For industry leaders, understanding these underlying financial currents, from the relentless demand for compute to the strategic role of public listings, is paramount for navigating the future of AI.",https://www.startuphub.ai/wp-content/uploads/wellington-managements-matt-1024x576.webp,N,,2025-12-15 17:05:50.682534

MJ And how did that inform your current solo exhibition at Praise Shadows?
The PES exhibition and mural emphasized communal care as a survival strategy.
MJ It’s inspiring to hear that you always knew.
HM It’s that moral consciousness.","Helina Metaferia is an architect, and she is building a house for her truth. She is always constructing something, whether it’s a collage or a performance, an exhibition or a workshop. Her ability to move seamlessly across mediums in service of her message is one of her most striking qualities and clearly bestowed upon her by ancestors, including her late mother. The translation of her ideas through different materials is bolstered by careful archival research and continuous community engagement.

In addition to Syntropy, a solo exhibition at Praise Shadows Gallery in Boston, Massachusetts, Metaferia recently debuted two monumental murals at Project for Empty Space and Edison Properties in downtown Newark, New Jersey. The portraits of area residents are a continuation of her By Way of Revolution (2019–) series. They are a celebratory and powerful addition to the history of activism in the city.

MJ Congratulations on your new public works in Newark. Were these your first murals?

HM No, I was a mural painter for years in Washington, DC, after graduating undergrad. Back then, I was standing on scaffolding and painting in the scorching sun for weeks to months. Thank goodness there are other methods now. The recent murals in Newark include photoprinting with hand-painted elements on parachute cloth. The original collages were made by hand, then photographed and reproduced to become several stories tall.

MJ How did the project come about?

HM I was invited by the City of Newark and Project for Empty Space (PES) to produce murals in two locations, one on the side of PES and another downtown. I was a PES artist in residence, so directors Rebecca Jampol and Jasmine Wahi knew my work well. They received a grant to commission public artworks and invited me as the inaugural artist.

MJ Who did you choose as subjects?

HM Cousins Karla Cruz and Nashel Brantley, who came to my By Way of Revolution workshop at PES. I facilitate socially engaged workshops for BIPOC femmes around the country, where we engage in performance-as-protest embodiment exercises, and, afterward, people volunteer to be photographed in power poses. We selected Nashel and Karla for murals, as they were third-generation Newark residents with multicultural backgrounds. Family photographs adorn the tops of the headdresses, and archives of revolutionary movements that they identify with were scanned from the Newark Public Library and also visible in the crowns. Protest buttons from the library archives and community-sourced slogans surround the figures.

MJ So it connects to your residency and recent solo exhibition at PES?

HM Yes, my time at PES was spent researching Newark protest history. It also served as an expansion of my practice into new forms. My exhibition at PES, When Civilizations Heal,included collages, assemblage, sculptures, and an experimental film. My practice is shifting into objects that conjure both the regal and the mundane: iconic structures like thrones and crowns with archives etched into them, and assemblages of found objects and archival documents. It’s a celebration of things that femmes use, wear, or carry, as much as it is of our bodies and our personal and collective histories. With all of my interdisciplinary work, the emphasis is on placemaking, so that women-identifying people of color feel that they have a space for reclamation.

MJ And how did that inform your current solo exhibition at Praise Shadows?

HM I often work collaboratively in community- and coalition-building across institutions and platforms. Some of the work that I developed in Newark traveled to my show Syntropy at Praise Shadows in Boston, where PES curator Jasmine Wahi joined me in conversation at the opening. The PES exhibition and mural emphasized communal care as a survival strategy. Since the only figure in my Praise Shadows show is a self-portrait, it feels as if the emphasis here is on the politics of personal care, and the exhibition feels a lot more autobiographical.

MJ I am glad to see you putting yourself in the work. A storyline we share is the loss of our moms.

HM The mom thing took me a long time to get through. I cried every day for one year after she passed, months after I got my MFA, and I made a bunch of art about it. It felt weird to put it in public space, but I needed to grieve in that way. She is the activist of my life.

MJ So far I have not been able to make any work about it.

HM Everyone deals with it differently.

MJ Yeah, and it feels like a global collective mourning is happening now, so the personal grieving is just collapsing into that.

HM I found peace connecting to my mother in a spiritual sense because she was such a warrior, and she was so dedicated to service. That spiritual connection is what I pull from in my life and in my work, and service is how I deal with the pains of the world.

MJ That’s really beautiful. You mentioned you’ve found some new directions in your work. Can you speak to that?

HM There are more painted elements in my work now. I started out as a painter, but as an Ethiopian American woman, I got tired of having to cite the white, male canon in academic spaces. I tried to cite Ethiopian ritualistic traditions, but it was discouraged in the graduate-school environment. One professor crossed out an artist statement with the words metaphysics, spirituality, and healing, and said, “You’re never allowed to use those words again to describe your work.”

MJ Oh, my gosh! I’m so glad you eventually found María Magdalena Campos Pons, your mentor!

HM Absolutely. I connected to performance in graduate school because ritual could be embedded in its time-based form, and it shared a feminist, political lineage with collage. And if I wanted to talk about feminism and figuration, I could use my body. I understood white gaze and fetishization, but I was willing to take on that battle over the struggles of painting so that I could address the content that I was interested in. Since I was a young girl, I’ve been making art about the same thing, mostly influenced by growing up in a feminist household; I just have more tools in my toolbox to talk about it. And now, I am ready to return to painting.

MJ It’s inspiring to hear that you always knew.

HM My parents moved to this country for freedom of expression as academics and activists, so a value I grew up with is if you have a platform, use it to make a statement that can better the world. Otherwise, why be here? Why not do something else? I love creativity for creativity’s sake, but there has to be something behind it to help push the needle forward.

MJ That reminds me of an interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates in which he said his ancestors worked for things they didn’t see realized, but they did it anyway. He said he just has to keep pushing forward even if he can’t see it in his lifetime. At the end, Ezra Klein asked him what we’re supposed to do to fix broken parts of our society, and Coates essentially said: I know exactly what I’m supposed to do, and I am doing it. I can’t tell you what you’re supposed to do.

HM It’s that moral consciousness. In Amharic, my first name translates to conscience or humanity. I sometimes wonder if that’s why I feel so drawn to truth-telling work. A lot of people are sitting around waiting for someone to tell them what to do. Decentralized movements are about the many, and everyone has a part to play. People are frustrated with our current political situation, particularly the lack of leadership. Instead of looking for a spearhead, what happens when we organize and do things in pods and communities? I have more trust on the local level.

MJ I agree one hundred percent.

HM In my By Way of Revolution series in particular, I’m asking probing questions like: What is a revolution? What is change? How can we get there? I don’t have answers, but I’m conscious of having this conversation through the work over many years. Art can be an intermediary for very difficult conversations. It creates a somatic experience so people can be more in their bodies and be curious.",https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bomb-images/_1200x630_fit_center-center_82_none/Helina-Metaferia-Enthroned-1.jpg?mtime=1764879649,N,,2025-12-15 15:03:59.874629

In Silicon Valley’s relative absence, Chinese models have dominated the open source space with high profile releases from DeepSeek and Alibaba.
At the company’s GTC conference held in D.C. back in October, Huang also warned attendees of China’s open source dominance.
Briski believes that a reliable and consistent roadmap of new model releases can help Nvidia achieve this open model edge.
The last time they put out an open model was over five years ago.”","It seems that chips dominance isn’t enough for Nvidia. The tech giant wants its products to be present at every level of the AI development ecosystem, and its got its eyes on open-source AI models.

Nvidia released its latest Nemotron 3 family of open models on Monday, only months after announcing the first iteration at the company’s GTC event in March. The company press release claims they possess “leading accuracy for building agentic AI applications.”

Open-source AI is often preferred by some users, like firms or governments, for its ability to be customized to the hyper-specific needs of the industry, and for being more private by giving organizations the ability to run the data on their own internal servers instead of the AI company’s.

American tech giants had largely drawn back from the world of open source models as the companies increasingly opted for proprietary options that they can arguably make more money out of. Largely the only exception to this has been Meta which is also reportedly eyeing a shift to proprietary. Even OpenAI, which purports to be an “open” organization unveiled only its first open source model in five years this past August with the release of gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b.

In Silicon Valley’s relative absence, Chinese models have dominated the open source space with high profile releases from DeepSeek and Alibaba. It’s all part of China’s strategy to achieve global AI dominance: an “AI for all” approach would prove broader reach and greater influence on the global industry, especially at a time when Beijing believes that it can produce AI chips powerful enough to become a sizable competitor to Nvidia’s offerings.

From the looks of it, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is worried about this. He has taken almost every opportunity the past few months to urge Washington to take this possibility seriously. At the company’s GTC conference held in D.C. back in October, Huang also warned attendees of China’s open source dominance. He argued that because China is a huge creator of open source software, if Americans retreat completely from China they might risk being “ill-prepared” for when Chinese software “permeates the world.”

Despite not being a big consumer-facing creator of AI models—aside from its AI face generator StyleGAN back in the pre-ChatGPT days—Nvidia seems to be taking matters into its own hands with this China situation. Company executives made it clear that it’s not proprietary models they are trying to compete with. But when it comes to open source, they want to be a bigger player as fellow American tech giants might be conceding and shifting focus.

Nvidia sees Nemotron as a tool to drive further reliance worldwide on its hardware empire. By giving out this open model to developers worldwide, it is hoping to ensure that any new models built will be best aligned with its silicon rather than the rapidly emerging industry in China.

“When we’re the best development platform, again, people are going to choose us, choose our platform, choose our GPU, in order to be able to not just build today, but also build for tomorrow,” Nvidia’s vice president of generative AI software for enterprise Kari Briski said at a press briefing ahead of the release.

Briski believes that a reliable and consistent roadmap of new model releases can help Nvidia achieve this open model edge.

“We recognize that people developing AI applications can’t rely on a model when there’s only been just one model release and no road map,” Briski said, adding that Nvidia will be investing in building that reliability and consistency and is already eyeing new models. “GPT-oss is a fantastic model, OpenAI is a great partner we love them. The last time they put out an open model was over five years ago.”",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/nvidia-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 14:02:59.781190

In an exclusive interview ahead of the official announcement, Nephrodite co-founder and CEO Nikhil Shah described the first-of-its-kind system as a “healthy alternative” to dialysis centers and at-home options.
“Dialysis sustains life, but at tremendous cost to a patient’s freedom and physiology,” Nguyen said in a statement shared with MassDevice.
“Holly represents a complete rethinking of kidney replacement, with a continuously functioning implant capable of matching the body’s natural rhythm.
Because we’re a continuous device, we’re acting differently than intermittent dialysis every other day.","The FDA has granted Breakthrough Device Designation to Nephrodite’s Holly implantable continuous dialysis system.

In an exclusive interview ahead of the official announcement, Nephrodite co-founder and CEO Nikhil Shah described the first-of-its-kind system as a “healthy alternative” to dialysis centers and at-home options.

The Atlanta-based device developer hopes to start its first-in-human study as soon as late 2027 and follow with a first regulatory approval as soon as early 2028, he said.

Shah — a former urologic oncology surgeon — founded the company in 2020 with Dr. Hiep “Bob” Nguyen, a pediatric urologist who serves as Nephrodite’s SVP of Science and Technology.

“Dialysis sustains life, but at tremendous cost to a patient’s freedom and physiology,” Nguyen said in a statement shared with MassDevice. “Holly represents a complete rethinking of kidney replacement, with a continuously functioning implant capable of matching the body’s natural rhythm. It’s both a scientific milestone and a human one.”

The novel Holly system is designed for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), of which there are more than 850,000 in the U.S. at a cost of more than $50 billion per year, Nephrodite says.

“We think at a minimum, we’re a bridge to transplant,” Shah said. “We can keep patients on the transplant list, keep them healthy. Because we’re a continuous device, we’re acting differently than intermittent dialysis every other day. But there are patients that aren’t transplant candidates, and because we’re an implantable device, we think this could be a standalone device as well for a lot of patients.”

Nephrodite designed the Holly system to continuously filter waste, balance fluids and manage electrolytes without dialysis center visits. The company says its proprietary platform includes advanced hemofiltration technology, intelligent sensors, machine learning algorithms and secure remote monitoring for physician oversight and individualized therapy.

Just days ago, the company announced successful animal study results at the University of Michigan’s Conrad Jobst Vascular Research Laboratories, showing the system worked in a sheep without blood clotting, hemolysis or device leakage.

“Our animal studies have completely mimicked everything that we’ve seen on the bench,” Shah said.

Nephrodite is now preparing for a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) study next year ahead of regulatory submissions for first-in-human clinical trials.

Through the FDA’s Breakthrough Devices Program, the company will get enhanced guidance from agency staff, expedited regulatory review and eligibility for the FDA’s Total Product Life Cycle (TPLC) Advisory Program (TAP) pilot to accelerate patient access.

The company is also seeking investors through a Series A priced equity funding round after previously raising an amount that Shah described as in “the low seven figures.”

“We have a healthy runway right now,” he said. “… We were staying under the radar. We wanted to come out and announce what we were doing when we had something really meaningful.”",https://wtwh-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/massdevice/2025/12/12143540/Holly-by-Nephodite-image_kidney-replacement-1024x839-1.png,N,,2025-12-15 16:02:16.781241

Blarcamesine is designed to activate sigma-1 receptor proteins, which contribute to the health and survival of nerve cells. The company had hoped to show that blarcamesine, through sigma-1 activation, can support the function of nerve cells and protect them from damage due to inflammation, and subsequently slow cognitive and functional declines in patients with Alzheimer's.

Anavex had proposed restricting treatment with blarcamesine to patients with early Alzheimer's without certain mutations in the SIGMAR1 gene that encodes the sigma-1 receptor.

In its marketing authorization application to the EMA, Anavex submitted results from a clinical trial of 462 patients with early Alzheimer's disease, who received either blarcamesine or a placebo. Anavex also submitted subgroup analyses in patients who did not have SIGMAR1 mutations.

However, in the study, blarcamesine did not slow clinical decline compared to placebo on both cognitive measures that Anavex had set as primary endpoints — the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL). The trial also had methodological issues, the EMA said, and thus ""it was not possible to reach a positive conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the medicine.""

Additionally, the EMA said the data collection did not allow sufficient characterization of the drug's safety profile.

Les syndiqués ont entériné l'entente de principe lors de deux votes tenus dimanche

L'offre acceptée prévoit une augmentation salariale de 17,5 % sur cinq ans, soit 2,5 % en 2025, 4,5 % en 2026, 3,25 % en 2027 et 2028, ainsi que 4 % en 2029. Les travailleurs profiteront également d'un montant forfaitaire de 2,5 % pour l'année 2025.

Ses membres n'ont débrayé qu'une seule journée, le 1er novembre. Il s'agissait alors de leur première journée de grève en près de 40 ans.

Publicité

Les syndiqués s'apprêtaient à débrayer de nouveau, les samedi et dimanche 15 et 16 novembre, alors qu'une entente de principe est survenue in extremis, le vendredi précédent, pour renouveler la convention collective.

Dans leur cas, le litige portait sur les salaires, les horaires et la conciliation travail-famille.

Comme il s'agit du premier syndicat à avoir conclu une entente de principe avec la STM, et surtout du plus important, la coutume veut que ce soit lui qui ait tracé la voie aux autres en matière salariale.

Le deuxième syndicat à avoir conclu une entente de principe, celui des 1300 employés administratifs et techniques — qui est aussi une section locale du SCFP — a déjà entériné son entente de principe dans une proportion de 75 %.

Une entente qui respecte le cadre financier

La directrice générale de la STM, Marie-Claude Léonard, a déjà indiqué que son cadre financier était fixé et qu'il fallait le respecter. Ainsi, pour parvenir à obtenir des augmentations de salaire plus généreuses, les syndiqués devaient trouver des moyens pour les financer à même leurs autres conditions de travail.

D'ailleurs, lorsque l'entente de principe était intervenue avec les chauffeurs d'autobus, elle avait indiqué que celle-ci comporte des compromis de toutes parts et respecte le cadre financier établi.

Parmi les autres gains listés par le syndicat, il y a la création d’une banque de temps cumulé, l’ajout de temps de battement sur les lignes courtes, le paiement de l’amplitude et plus de flexibilité pour la conciliation travail-vie personnelle.

Publicité

La STM est confrontée à une situation financière difficile. Mme Léonard a déjà dit devoir dégager des économies de 56 millions de dollars en 2026.

Malgré l'entente conclue, M. Therrien a dénoncé le manque de financement pour le transport en commun dans la province.

Le nœud du problème, c’est le sous-financement.

Global investment bank Morgan Stanley has warned that investors may be underestimating how rapidly artificial intelligence could disrupt e-commerce and food-delivery platforms, as large language models begin to handle product discovery, price comparison and ordering directly.

In a recent note, the analysts said the rise of so-called “agentic AI” could weaken platform loyalty, redirect customer traffic and put pressure on commission-based business models that currently dominate online commerce and food delivery.

Instacart–ChatGPT move seen as early signal

The warning comes after Instacart became the first grocery company to enable shopping within ChatGPT, allowing users to search for products and place orders through the AI interface. Morgan Stanley said the feature, expected to roll out more widely in the coming weeks, raises a fundamental question: will consumers bypass retailer and delivery apps altogether?

If AI tools become the primary interface for shopping decisions, traditional platforms could lose their direct relationship with customers — a shift that may have long-term implications for valuations.

E-commerce firms yet to face full scrutiny

While AI disruption has been widely debated in areas such as classifieds and price-comparison websites, Morgan Stanley said similar risks in e-commerce platforms such as Allegro, HelloFresh, Ocado and Zalando have received far less attention.

The same applies to food-delivery companies, including Delivery Hero, talabat, Prosus and Jahez, despite their heavy dependence on app-based traffic and user stickiness.

“The core threat is the same,” the analysts noted. “AI could redirect traffic, increase price transparency and weaken platform loyalty.”

Food delivery models could face margin pressure

For food-delivery platforms, AI agents could eventually select restaurants, compare delivery fees and place orders on behalf of users. Morgan Stanley warned this could compress take-rates, reduce brand differentiation and shift bargaining power away from platforms towards AI ecosystems.

Several large delivery operators, the analysts said, “have yet to face the same degree of debate” despite these structural risks.

Stock calls already reflecting AI concerns

The report noted that AI-related disruption is already influencing investment decisions. MONY, for instance, was recently downgraded partly due to concerns that AI could erode comparison-site economics. HelloFresh, already facing competitive pressure, may also see substitution risks as AI reshapes how consumers plan meals and shop for ingredients.

More disclosures expected through 2026

Morgan Stanley expects AI-related disclosures to rise through 2026, as companies seek to reassure investors about how they plan to avoid being disintermediated.

“This type of news flow will accelerate debate around what companies are doing to prepare,” the analysts said, signalling that AI strategy may soon become a central factor in evaluating digital commerce and delivery firms.

We have seen obviously, Open AI just rake in fundraising, but they are burning cash at a high rate.
So that's really going to be the test, I think for Open AI.
Uh good morning Brian, thank you for having me on.
It's not just Open AI is likely going to have to raise more money next year at a higher valuation.","All right, let's get to our opening mid round table. uh here with some hot takes on our winner Open AI, Tom SA7's report research founder, uh Ivana Delaveska, Spear Invest uh founder and CIO alongside Morning Brief and markets catalyst anchor, Julie Heman. Julie, I want to start with you here. You and I uh go back to uh with Sarah uh over at next door uh with uh when she was the CEO CEO. But uh, you know, looking forward now, it is amazing just to see like one, of course, how much bigger that business is, but of course to see her at this very pivotal time.

Yeah, this pivotal time when, you know, as you and I talked about earlier, she may be very good at fundraising. We have seen obviously, Open AI just rake in fundraising, but they are burning cash at a high rate. So now the next challenge for them is, even as they continue to raise funds, right? Either in the private markets or eventually in the public markets, they are also going to need to ramp up that revenue so that they will not be reliant on fundraising alone in order to fund their business. So that's really going to be the test, I think for Open AI. maybe not in 2026, maybe they can still ride this fun raising raising wave for a while yet, but at some point they are going to need to ramp up the revenue as well in order to help fund everything they're talking about and to help sort of prove that there is a return on investment for these large language language models and for what uh Chat JPT in particular can provide.

Tom Lee, get over to you here. Uh how important is Open AI next year continuing to not only secure the money it needs, but secure that money from investors willing to pay an even higher valuation. How important is that to the AI landscape?

Uh good morning Brian, thank you for having me on. Uh one word, critical. It's absolutely critical not just to the tech sector but to the entire S&P 500 because if all of a sudden we hear even a whisper about Open AI having funding challenges with all of the money they have promised and committed to and all of the stock gains throughout the tech ecosystem that that has produced this year, then we are talking about air starting to come out of a very big balloon. And if you combine that with what we're seeing from Gemini where there is legitimate competition for chat GPT now, unlike they have seen since they burst onto the scene three and a half years ago. It's a major, major issue not just for the tech industry and the tech sector, but for frankly every sector in the market.

Ivana, not just, uh oh good to see you uh here. It's not just Open AI is likely going to have to raise more money next year at a higher valuation. It's an thropic and many companies out there building models like it. Do you think we have reached peak growth rates for AI companies like this?

Well, that's a great question. I think we still don't know the answer to. I don't think the growth rates are peak anywhere anywhere close to being uh being peak. I think we're going to continue to see growth. I think the bigger question to Julie's point is whether we're going to be seeing the returns on invested capital. I think that's what investors are really focused on right now because you see these numbers and user growth, but if that's all funded by capital rather than that's not really really returning, I think that's going to be something that people are really closely watching. We believe that ultimately the returns will be there, especially as we see this next wave of infrastructure put in place. You're going to be able to start seeing some of these AI agent come at a relatively low cost. I think that's really the key that we are looking out for in the next 12 to 16 months. But we do believe, so we believe we're going to see the returns. The market is not so sure. So that's why we are at this uh at this in interesting point in time.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bJszpO4jXdMZ2Nej7vQv_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/978bc240-d9cc-11f0-bb3c-932266c645fa,N,,2025-12-15 14:03:05.664187

In late October, SpectraWAVE secured an FDA clearance for its AI-powered, pressure-wire-free angiogram software dubbed X1-FFR.
The Massachusetts-based company, which counts about 70 employees, also markets the HyperVue catheter-based imaging system.
“Philips shares our deep conviction that the convergence of intravascular imaging, coronary physiology and AI can fundamentally improve how every patient with coronary disease is treated,” SpectraWAVE CEO Eman Namati said in a statement.
“The acquisition of SpectraWAVE’s next-generation technologies for coronary intravascular imaging and physiological assessment mark a significant step in expanding our portfolio with breakthrough, AI-powered technologies that help clinicians decide, guide, treat and confirm treatment in one setting,” said Philips image-guided therapy business leader, Bert van Meurs.","Philips has claimed the cardiac artificial intelligence developer SpectraWAVE in a bid to expand the capabilities of its real-time imaging platform with rapid scans of the heart’s arteries.

“We are doubling down on image-guided therapy and expanding our portfolio in the coronary intervention segment with the addition of SpectraWAVE’s AI-powered innovations in high-definition intravascular imaging and angio-based physiological assessment, enabling us to deliver better care for more people,” Philips CEO Roy Jakobs said in a statement.

In late October, SpectraWAVE secured an FDA clearance for its AI-powered, pressure-wire-free angiogram software dubbed X1-FFR. The program provides clinicians with real-time readouts of the flow of blood through the coronaries and automatically highlights and follows the targeted vessel from the X-ray feed to aid clinicians in finding the right spots for stent placements and other interventions.

The Massachusetts-based company, which counts about 70 employees, also markets the HyperVue catheter-based imaging system. That tech combines optical coherence tomography and near-infrared spectroscopy to visualize calcium and plaque buildups from within the arteries themselves. HyperVue scored its own 510(k) clearances in 2023.

“Philips shares our deep conviction that the convergence of intravascular imaging, coronary physiology and AI can fundamentally improve how every patient with coronary disease is treated,” SpectraWAVE CEO Eman Namati said in a statement. “This partnership allows us to integrate and scale HyperVue and X1-FFR into the world’s leading image-guided therapy ecosystem, expanding choice for clinicians and supporting more consistent, high-quality care for the millions of patients who depend on coronary intervention each year.”

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Philips said it aims to integrate SpectraWAVE’s portfolio with its Eagle Eye Platinum and IntraSight tech for intravascular ultrasound as well as its overarching Azurion image-guided intervention system for the cath lab.

Philips also said X1-FFR will complement its OmniWire iFR hardware for measuring coronary blood pressure by adding a tool to provide guidance in cases where guidewires can’t reach or can’t be used.

“The acquisition of SpectraWAVE’s next-generation technologies for coronary intravascular imaging and physiological assessment mark a significant step in expanding our portfolio with breakthrough, AI-powered technologies that help clinicians decide, guide, treat and confirm treatment in one setting,” said Philips image-guided therapy business leader, Bert van Meurs.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 7.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $4.33 per share, indicating a change of +10.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $11.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.3%. This estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.23 indicates a change of +7.4% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/d2f7ed3d1940141716bfd200f5c94c6b,N,,2025-12-15 13:03:43.098160

Nvidia stock rose Monday.

Nvidia is considering adding production capacity for H200 chips as orders are exceeding current output levels, Reuters reported. Chinese internet companies such as Alibaba (BABA) and TikTok parent ByteDance have expressed interest in buying the chips, the report said. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) produces the chips for Nvidia.

On Dec. 8, Trump announced that his administration would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 processors to ""approved customers"" in China. The H200 is an older processor from the Hopper series and is less capable than Nvidia's current-generation Blackwell graphics processing units.

The U.S. Department of Commerce first must finalize Trump's policy and China also must agree to imports of the processors.

Even so, he defended the decision to allow China to access H200 chips, which he called a “lagging” technology and no longer state-of-the-art.
“What you see is China’s not taking them because they want to prop up and subsidize Huawei,” Sacks said.
Last week, as officials weighed the decision, Huang told reporters in Washington that he had no clue if China would accept H200 chips.
Beijing has yet to publicly agree to allow imports of Nvidia’s H200 products.","China has figured out the US strategy for allowing it to buy Nvidia Corp.’s H200 and is rejecting the AI chip in favor of domestically developed semiconductors, White House AI czar David Sacks said, citing news reports.

President Donald Trump said on Monday he would allow shipments of Nvidia’s H200 to China, part of an administration effort backed by Sacks to challenge Chinese tech champions like Huawei Technologies Co. by bringing American competition to their home market. On Friday, Sacks signaled that he was uncertain about whether that approach would work.

“They’re rejecting our chips,” Sacks said in an interview on Bloomberg Tech, citing an unspecified news article he had seen that day. “Apparently they don’t want them, and I think the reason for that is they want semiconductor independence.”

In a social media post Saturday, Sacks said he was referring to a Financial Times report that China was poised to limit access to the chips via a local approval process where Chinese buyers would need to justify their purchases.

Sacks’ comments raise questions about whether Nvidia will be able to recover revenue from China, a data center market it has removed entirely from its forecasts but that Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang has put at $50 billion this year. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimate annual H200 revenue in China to be a $10 billion opportunity — but only if the nation accepts the US firm’s chips.

In a statement from a spokesperson, Nvidia said it continues to work with the administration on H200 licenses for vetted customers. “While we do not yet have results to report, it’s clear that three years of overbroad export controls fueled America’s foreign competitors and cost US taxpayers billions of dollars,” the company said.

Liu Pengyu, a Chinese embassy spokesperson, said that cooperation on technology and the economy is in the common interest of China and the US. “We hope the US will work with China to take concrete actions to maintain the stability and smooth functioning of global supply chains,” he said in a statement.

China is weighing a package of incentives worth as much as $70 billion to support its local chipmaking industry, Bloomberg reported Friday, underscoring Beijing’s resolve to reduce its reliance on foreign chipmakers such as Nvidia. It suggests the government will continue to support companies like Huawei and Cambricon Technologies Corp. even with the H200 cleared by the US for export to China.

The H200, which was introduced in 2023 and began shipping to customers last year, is part of the Hopper generation of Nvidia’s chips, second-best to the Blackwell line and two generations behind the upcoming Rubin series. An 18-month lag behind the latest Nvidia chips was part of the Trump administration’s justification for the decision.

Sacks, a venture capitalist who joined the administration in January, identified China’s desire to prop up and subsidize Huawei as a key reason for its H200 reluctance. Even so, he defended the decision to allow China to access H200 chips, which he called a “lagging” technology and no longer state-of-the-art.

“What you see is China’s not taking them because they want to prop up and subsidize Huawei,” Sacks said. “That was part of our calculation, of selling not the best but lagging chips to China, is that you can take market share away from Huawei, but I think the Chinese government has figured that out, and that’s why they’re not allowing them.”

The H200 decision was motivated by an assessment that Huawei — Nvidia’s Chinese archrival — offers AI systems with comparable horsepower, including its Cloud Matrix 384 platform, which links hundreds of processors together to compensate for lower performance in individual chips. Some US officials saw the H200 as compromise from Nvidia’s earlier push to export a version of the Blackwell chip to China, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Last week, as officials weighed the decision, Huang told reporters in Washington that he had no clue if China would accept H200 chips. On Monday, Trump said in a Truth Social post that President Xi Jinping of China responded positively to the possibility of H200 export approvals.

Beijing has yet to publicly agree to allow imports of Nvidia’s H200 products. It also has yet to publicly reject them, despite the recent US policy change. Earlier this year, China shunned the H20, a significantly less capable chip Trump allowed this summer.

So, at the end of this first block of games, it’s the ideal time to take stock of each side’s form so far…

Toulouse (33 points)

Stade Toulousain have run hot since the opening match of the campaign, a no-internationals 29-19 win over Stade Bordelais on 12 October. In the first seven matches, they have scored 294 points, including 44 tries to top AXA Elite 1 table on points difference.

For the record, second-placed Romagnat — unsurprisingly — have the next most potent attack, with 232 points from seven, including 35 touchdowns. The latter have the best defence in the league, with Toulouse slipping down to third, but with an attack as potent as that, they can afford to be marginally more porous in defence.

It’s not as if Toulouse are conceding many — just 92 points across their seven games to date, compared to Romagnat’s miserly 54.

All seems set fair for Toulouse, then, to maintain their course to the top of the table at the end of the campaign. Their next big challenge is on 1 February when, a week after they host Montpellier as the league resumes, they head to their nearest rivals.

Romagnat (33 points)

Seven wins in seven. It can’t get much better than that for Romagnat, who have been boosted by improved resources this season, and made some canny signings to improve their squad.

Just points difference — 24 of them to be precise — separates the Auvergne side from leaders Toulouse at the end of the opening block of matches. Romagnat averaged more than 33 points per game, and conceded just seven across 80 minutes in that seven-match winning streak.

Romagnat will return to action with a trip to Bobigny on 25 January. Then, in a league that already looks like a two-horse race, it’s the big one, at home to Toulouse to sign off the first-half of the season. That match — and the return fixture on the final weekend of the season — should decide first and second in the table.

Stade Bordelais (25 points)

A gap, then, to third-placed Stade Bordelais, defending back-to-back-to-back Elite 1 champions. Franco-Canadian coach François Ratier was handed one last win in charge in his final match before he settles in his new office at Marcoussis, ready to take charge of the France national team.

With his CV, it’s no surprise France were keen to hire Ratier, who guided the Lionnes to two titles of their three consecutive titles since joining from Toronto Arrows in 2023. But it’s undoubtedly a blow to the club side, who have benefited from his nous, organisation and work ethic.

The champions’ season opened with defeats against the top two, but they then got into their groove and strung together four wins in four, nilling hosts Montpellier in a clear statement in front of Canal Plus’ cameras.

Ratier’s last match in charge was a routine 22-3 home victory over Lyon in which Joanna Grisez scored her seventh try of the season. But what happens next — they’re at Grenoble, then host Toulon in their first two outings in 2026 — matters most now.

Blagnac (17 points)

Blagnac have played at each of the top three sides in their last five matches of the season so far, losing 36-3 at Romagnat, 33-12 at Stade Bordelais, and 52-22 rout at neighbours Toulouse.

They’ve offset those defeats with wins over Bobigny, Toulon and Lille — and signed off 2025 by overtaking Montpellier to take fourth at Christmas with a hard-fought win at home.

A post shared by Les Lionnes (@lionnesdebordeaux)

More importantly, they’ve got the three most difficult away days of their campaign out of the way early on. Things, Blagnac will hope, can only get better, as they head towards the business end of the season — with matches at Lyon and at home against Grenoble restarting their campaign in 2026. Expect to see them around and about the post-season play-off places later.

Montpellier (15 points)

After three wins in their opening three games, at Grenoble, at home to Toulon and away at Bobigny, the first block of the season then turned rather sour for Montpellier, who have since endured defeats at home to Romagnat, at Lille, and at home against Stade Bordelais.

Blagnac away less than two weeks before Christmas did not give Montpellier — the second most successful team in domestic history in France, behind Toulouse, and the most successful in the 21st century — much in the way of festive cheer as they lost a tense encounter 12-10.

They need to end their losing streak sooner rather than later, if they’re to recover and regain fourth place from the side that beat them last time out. Next up, however, they entertain unbeaten Toulouse at the end of January.

Grenoble (14 points)

The Women’s Rugby World Cup was hard on Grenoble’s internationals. Back-row forwards Léa Champon and Téani Feleu returned to France with injuries, while captain Manaé Feleu and hooker Elisa Riffoneau were both feeling the after-effects of the long, physically and mentally draining, spell with Les Bleues.

So a club at the start of a long rebuild under a new president, who arrived this summer, didn’t get off to the fastest of starts, losing three of their first five.

But at the end of November they gave second-placed Romagnat a run for their money, losing 17-10 in dismal conditions, and evened up their season’s win-loss tally with a 20-5 win on the road at bottom-of-the-table Lille in their last match of the year.

They’re the first to host a post-Ratier Stade Bordelais in the new year. A victory isn’t out of the equation. But Grenoble are in the early months of a three-year rebuild, with a target of winning the league by 2028. No one’s seriously expecting too much out of this season. Top four would be welcome, but would exceed expectations.

Bobigny (11 points)

Three away days in their opening four games, and a surprise loss at home to a resurgent Montpellier. Bobigny’s season got off to a slow start. But a couple of wins on the bounce, against Grenoble at home and on the road at Toulon signalled something of a turnaround.

Manager Clémence Gueucier was on the shortlist for the France job. But now that role has gone elsewhere, she’ll focus fully on getting the best out of her charges. Bobigny are one of several teams in the mix to claim the last top-four slot, two places better than they managed last season.

A post shared by Gloria Média (@gloriamediafr)

Unfortunately, for Bobigny, they ended 2025 hosting a rampant Toulouse side, and lost 51-10. Next up, they host Romagnat, one place below the leaders on points difference only. They have to burst the Auvergne side’s unbeaten bubble to avoid falling off the back of the chasing pack.

Lyon (8 points)

Lyon scored their first win of the season at home to Lille on the sixth weekend of the season, having opened their campaign with a promising 12-12 draw at home against Bobigny.

The club, promoted to the top flight in 2019, has set a target of a title by 2028. Right now, they’re well off the pace, but stark results don’t tell the whole story. A 38-6 loss at Toulouse, for example, doesn’t explain the four-try impact of the hosts’ bench in the final 20, or the fact that the visitors’ six points was a below-expectations return for some promising attacks off solid defence.

A last-minute Toulon try condemned Lyon to a 20-18 loss on the south coast. They lost a tight derby at Grenoble by just four points.

Ambitions are clear. Lyon want to turn the Big Four into a Big Five. A win over Lille suggested they were, maybe, up and running — but they screeched to a halt again with a 22-3 defeat at Stade Bordelais in their last outing of 2025, leaving themselves with work to do if they’re to challenge the top four at the business end of the campaign.

Their return to action at the end of January promises to be tough. They’re at home to Blagnac first up, then travel to Montpellier, before hosting leaders Toulouse.

Toulon (5 points)

Rugby Club Toulon Provence Méditerranée knew their debut season in the top flight of women’s rugby in France was never going to be easy. One hard-fought win over Lyon in early November — courtesy of a last-minute Marie Soko try — and six defeats in their first seven outings merely proves the preseason suspicions of the club’s staff were correct.

They’ve done a lot right. Recruiting veteran Scottish international Chloe Rollie and Italians Sofia Stefan and Beatrice Veronese for their first campaign at the highest level, bringing in a mental health coach to help players deal with the expected problems of stepping up a level, and seeking tactical and practical support from brother club, Top 14 side Toulon all makes sense.

All this has just got to translate into wins and points. They failed to trouble the scoreboard in their last outing of the year, losing 41-0 at Romagnat. Their next match, on January 25, is a potentially decisive relegation battle, at home against Lille.

Lille (4 points)

The early season fixture list was cruel on Lille, with trips to Romagnat, Toulouse, and Blagnac, and a home game against Stade Bordelaise fixed for the first four weeks of the season. And the results were hard to take. They shipped 209 points in those four games, and scored just 18 in reply.

So, the hard-fought 6-5 win over Montpellier that followed — all 11 points were scored in the first half — looked like it could be something of a turning point. And they backed it up with an improved performance in defeat at Lyon, where they conceded just 24 points and scored 15.

Lille narrowly avoided relegation to Elite 2 last season, and their relatively modest ambitions extend to repeating that trick again this time around. But a 20-5 loss at home to Grenoble in their last outing of 2025 leaves them stuck to the bottom of the table, with a crucial trip to the side just above them in the table when AXA Elite 1 rugby returns at the end of January.",https://eu-cdn.rugbypass.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Elite-Fem-e1746546935607-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:05:25.787283

JAB, which holds a controlling stake in Coty, is exploring a reset that would begin with Nabi stepping down, according to The Financial Times. The report cited people familiar with the discussions.

The potential overhaul comes as Coty continues to grapple with pressures across its portfolio. While its prestige fragrance division has remained relatively resilient, the company has struggled to reignite growth in mass beauty, where competition from digitally native brands has intensified. Coty’s share price has fallen around 73% over the past two years, and slipped a further 3% on the back of the report.

In September, Coty launched a strategic review of its consumer beauty division, home to brands including Rimmel and Max Factor, and began exploring a potential sale as it looks to cut debt and sharpen its focus on higher-margin fragrance and prestige categories.

Further uncertainty surrounds Coty’s long-term licensing portfolio. The company is set to lose its Gucci fragrance and beauty licence in 2028 after Gucci owner Kering agreed to sell its beauty business to L’Oréal. It has also been reported that Nabi had previously turned down substantial financial offers from L’Oréal to end the Gucci licence early.

Nabi joined Coty as CEO in September 2020 from her role as founder and CEO of Orveda, a luxury vegan skincare brand. Prior to this her career spanned 20 years at L'Oreal.

Analysts cautioned that leadership change alone may not be enough to reverse Coty’s fortunes.

(ADBE): Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","Adobe Systems (ADBE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this software maker have returned +7.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Adobe belongs, has lost 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Adobe is expected to post earnings of $5.73 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.7%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.5 points to a change of +12.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.46 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Adobe.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

In the case of Adobe, the consensus sales estimate of $6.29 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10%. The $25.95 billion and $28.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.2% and +9.2%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Adobe reported revenues of $6.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.5%. EPS of $5.5 for the same period compares with $4.81 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.5%. The EPS surprise was +2.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Adobe is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Adobe. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The £16.6 billion fashion group is among several parties currently in discussions with advisers to the 145-year-old shoe chain, according to Sky News, which has been exploring new financing options to support its next phase of growth.

Russell & Bromley confirmed earlier this year that it had appointed Interpath to advise on raising new capital, amid efforts to accelerate its five-year turnaround strategy, known internally as ‘Re Boot’. The premium footwear retailer operates 37 stores across the UK and employs more than 450 people.

Founded in 1880 with the opening of its first store in Eastbourne, Russell & Bromley remains under family ownership and is now led by fifth-generation chief executive Andrew Bromley. In recent years, the brand has been working to modernise its positioning and appeal to a younger customer, appointing Daniel Beadsworth-Shaw as its first Creative Director as well as actress and singer Billie Piper as the face of the brand.

In a statement issued in October, Bromley said: ""We are currently exploring opportunities to help take Russell & Bromley into the next phase of our ‘Re Boot’ vision.

But what exactly is fueling their productivity and engagement in 2025? From a national obsession with salads and healthy bowls, to regional favorites you might not expect, Uber for Business data sheds light on what’s been ordered to office desks across the country.

Keep reading for a taste of the findings.

America runs on salad

No matter the coast, timezone, or industry, one trend rose above the rest: Americans are opting for healthier lunch options. Looking at Uber for Business meal program orders, over half (55%) of U.S. states and Puerto Rico are ordering healthy bowls and salads more than anything else—helping to fight off the midday slump.

More specifically, workers love ordering from sweetgreen. It was the most-ordered-from spot in cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and Washington, DC—and topped the charts in states like Colorado, Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Other popular lunch spots include Chipotle and Panera Bread.

Big cities, big cravings

Every city has its quirks—and workday meal orders are no exception. Some of the most surprising popular food items that made it into the top 5 for major markets include:

San Francisco: A city fueled by Karl the Fog, artificial intelligence … and apparently garlic naan, the unofficial carb of the tech set.

Boston: Beantown is stirring things up with a workday love affair for stir-fry.

Miami: In Miami, the egg sandwich reigns supreme—proof that sometimes a good breakfast also makes a great lunch.

New York City: The city that never sleeps runs on Diet Coke.

Los Angeles: LA’s wellness era lives on. The goop Kitchen Teriyaki Bowl is its lunchtime crown jewel.

Dallas: Everything is bigger in Texas, including their caffeine intake. Two of Dallas’ top ordered items are cold brew and lattes.

Chicago: Who says the Midwest can’t claim a Mexican favorite? Chicago’s top pick, the burrito, begs to differ.

These choices are a glimpse into each city’s unique culture and cravings, showcasing just how personal (and fun) workplace food routines can be.

Employee meals are having a moment—here’s who’s driving it

It’s not just what employees are ordering; it’s how companies are supporting them. Over the past year, more organizations than ever leaned into Uber for Business meal programs, with demand for the offering growing 40% year on year. Organizations are using meal programs to build culture, support in-office routines, and show appreciation for teams.

While meal programs are gaining traction across sectors, some industries are tapping into them more than others.

At the weekend, the Trump administration agreed to remove curbs on Belarusian potash fertilizers, a key source of revenue for the nation before Western restrictions stifled their flow. But the reaction in shares of global producers was muted, suggesting the move won’t be enough to unleash a flood of extra supply.

Global Potash Market Shrugs Off US Move to End Belarus Sanctions Back to video

Article content

Article content

That’s because Belarusian exports still face hurdles. European Union sanctions remain in force, meaning the country — which doesn’t have seaports of its own — must continue to rely on Russia’s Baltic terminals and rail exports to China.

Article content

Potash is Belarus’ only abundant mineral resource. State-owned Belaruskali, Russia’s Uralkali PJSC and North American producers Nutrien Ltd. and Mosaic Co. are the four largest global suppliers.

Article content

The US decision to lift sanctions followed talks between President Donald Trump’s special envoy for Belarus and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who ordered the release of 123 political prisoners as part of the agreement.

Article content

The deal opens the way for a potential resumption of US dollar transactions for Belaruskali, reviving trade between two giants of the fertilizer industry. But while Belarus will no doubt seek to re-enter the US market, much depends on the movement of product.

Article content

“From a US import perspective, there’s still question marks from a logistical point of view, given Belarus’ reliance on Russian ports,” said Paul Joules, an agriculture analyst at Rabobank Australia.

High-Cost Routes

Potash exports from Belarus were at 88% of pre-sanctions levels last year as the producer used higher-cost shipping lanes through Russia, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

Now, any increase in sales to America may force Belarus to scale back in other markets, damping price impacts, according to Allan Pickett, head of fertilizer analysis at S&P Global Energy.

“Because they have largely regained global market share, it means if they supply more to the US they will probably supply less elsewhere,” Pickett said. “The balance does not change significantly, and therefore the impact on global prices is low.”",,N,,2025-12-15 10:02:56.175649

Why Nemotron Matters for Nvidia’s Stack Nvidia likes to remind the market that frontier models do not live on hardware alone.
On an industry analyst call, Nvidia VP of Generative AI Software for Enterprise, Kari Briski, framed the motivation very simply.
Nemotron 3’s selling point is that it provides deeper reasoning at a much better tokens-to-accuracy ratio than previous open models.
What Nemotron Signals for Nvidia’s AI Strategy The right way to view Nemotron 3, then, is as another turn of Nvidia’s flywheel rather than a single knockout punch.","For most people, and it’s completely understandable, Nvidia is still shorthand for GPUs and AI chips. The company’s silicon dominates the AI data center conversation and headlines.

But Nvidia’s real “moat,” and I use that word purposefully, is the combination of its silicon offerings with an increasingly deep software stack. Stated a bit differently, Nvidia has built an end-to-end AI platform that includes:

CUDA — the company’s foundational GPU programming platform

cuDNN — specialized GPU-accelerated libraries for deep learning

NeMo — a higher-level framework for training and deploying large language and multimodal models

Now, the Nemotron family of open models turns raw compute into usable intelligence. This is a big deal. Nemotron 3 is the latest expression of that strategy, and it matters as much for Nvidia’s long-term AI position as any new GPU launch.

Why Nemotron Matters for Nvidia’s Stack

Nvidia likes to remind the market that frontier models do not live on hardware alone. In its recent blog on OpenAI’s GPT-5.2, the company stressed that leading models depend on “world-class accelerators, advanced networking, and a fully optimized software stack.”

Nvidia’s GB200 and Blackwell may get the glamour shots, but it’s software that makes tens of thousands of GPUs behave like a single, coherent AI supercomputer.

Nemotron sits right in that layer, between infrastructure and applications. It started as a way to seed the open-source ecosystem with strong, reasonably efficient models.

On an industry analyst call, Nvidia VP of Generative AI Software for Enterprise, Kari Briski, framed the motivation very simply.

Open models accelerate innovation because they let “researchers everywhere build on shared knowledge” and allow anyone, not just big tech, to fine-tune systems for their own domains.

In 2025, Nvidia was the top contributor of open models and datasets on Hugging Face, with roughly 650 models and 250 datasets. This point is relevant because it shows Nvidia is not just selling GPUs: it is actively seeding the open ecosystem with high-quality building blocks, which draws researchers, startups, and enterprises into its software orbit and makes Nvidia’s platform the default place where new AI work gets done.

In that sense, Nemotron is evolving into a brand that organizes those contributions into a roadmap rather than a grab bag. The Nemotron 3 announcement establishes the point where that roadmap becomes much more ambitious. Briski described it as “the most efficient family of open models with leading accuracy for building agentic AI applications.”

The flagship announcement is Nemotron 3 Nano, a roughly 30-plus-billion-parameter mixture-of-experts model with only about 3–4 billion parameters active per token. That architecture gives it the compute footprint of a “tiny” model while allowing it to compete on reasoning quality with much larger, dense systems.

Under the hood, Nemotron 3 combines three ideas that have become central to modern reasoning models.

First is a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture that combines attention layers with state-space sequence modeling to reduce memory and compute, especially for long context.

Second is a mixture-of-experts layout that activates only a small subset of parameters for each token.

Third is a context window that spans approximately one million tokens, enabling the model to operate across entire codebases, long technical specifications, and multi-day conversations in a single pass.

What Nemotron Means for Data Centers

Because the new scaling law is no longer just “more GPUs, bigger pre-train.” Briski notes that there are now three levers: “pretraining, post-training, and what we call long thinking.”

Long thinking means test-time compute and self-reflection, often with multiple agents collaborating.

That drives token usage, and, by extension, inference cost, through the roof.

Nemotron 3’s selling point is that it provides deeper reasoning at a much better tokens-to-accuracy ratio than previous open models.

There’s more to the story. Nvidia is releasing Nemotron 3 together with the exact reinforcement learning (RL) “gyms,” data, and libraries it used internally.

Briski emphasized that “Nvidia is the first to release open state-of-the-art…RL environments alongside our open models, libraries, and data.”

Ten initial gym environments cover topics such as competitive coding, math, and practical scheduling.

They let enterprises replicate Nvidia’s own training loop — simulate agents in realistic environments, score their behavior, and feed that back into the model.

For teams that might otherwise spend months building custom RL infrastructure, that is a significant accelerator.

On the data side, Nemotron 3 rides on what Nvidia calls a shift from “big data” to “smart and improved data.”

The company is releasing new pre-training bodies that are synthetically cleaned and rewritten, representing more than 10 trillion tokens of higher-quality text, plus an 18-million-example instruction-tuning set built from permissively licensed models.

Nvidia claims more than a million H100 hours went into generating and curating this data.

The result, according to Briski, is a 40% increase in an independent “intelligence index” score from Nemotron Nano 2 to Nemotron 3, with particular gains in instruction-following and conciseness.

Nemotron also comes packaged in what Nvidia calls “blueprints.” These are reference agent stacks for deep research assistants, video search and summarization, and highly optimized enterprise retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines that show how the models, embeddings, multimodal ingestion, and retrieval components fit together.

For a CIO, that matters more than a benchmark chart. It turns Nemotron from a research artifact into a template you can deploy across your own data, on your own clusters, or your favorite cloud.

All of this lines up neatly with Nvidia’s full-stack pitch. The company already powers the bulk of frontier model training, from OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 to video generators like Runway Gen-4.5, on platforms ranging from Hopper to GB200 and Blackwell.

Its GPUs lead every MLPerf Training category, and Blackwell systems are now available as standard options on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Oracle, and others.

Nemotron 3 provides that infrastructure with a “house model” and toolchain that are tightly tuned to Nvidia silicon, networking, and compilers.

Competitive Implications

So, does Nemotron 3 keep Nvidia safely in front of AMD and the rest of the pack?

It certainly strengthens the company’s position. On the hardware side, AMD has emerged as a major player in AI silicon over the past few years. Its Instinct MI300 and newer MI350 series accelerators, backed by the ROCm open software stack, now run LLMs such as Llama-3 at leading cloud providers and, on some workloads, deliver competitive or better inference economics.

Moreover, AMD is also rolling out full-rack Helios and MI450-class systems to challenge Nvidia’s rack-scale offerings.

Where Nemotron 3 differentiates Nvidia is in the depth and openness of the model-plus-tool ecosystem that runs on its chips.

Of course, AMD has ROCm, strong compiler work, and growing model support. Still, it does not yet offer an equivalent, integrated package of open models, RL gyms, curated data, and deployment blueprints under a single brand.

For enterprises trying to build “systems of models” and agentic workflows, that kind of dogmatic but open toolkit is extremely attractive.

It reduces time-to-value and subtly locks you into Nvidia’s way of doing things.

However, Nemotron 3 is not a permanent moat. The architectures it uses — hybrid Mamba-Transformer layers, mixture-of-experts, long context, and RL-driven reasoning — are increasingly well understood in the broader research community.

Of course, nothing prevents AMD or others from training similar open models and tuning them for their own accelerators. Furthermore, because Nemotron is open-weight, in theory, it can run on non-Nvidia hardware, such as ROCm and other mature stacks, even if you lose some of Nvidia’s end-to-end optimization.

What Nemotron Signals for Nvidia’s AI Strategy

The right way to view Nemotron 3, then, is as another turn of Nvidia’s flywheel rather than a single knockout punch. It makes the company’s GPUs more valuable by giving developers efficient, transparent models designed for agentic AI.

It makes its software platform more compelling by bundling the libraries, RL environments, and data needed to specialize those models.

Also, it aligns Nvidia even more closely with the open-source AI community, which now drives much of the innovation in tools and agents.

But will that be enough to keep Nvidia ahead as the AI data center market explodes? In the near term, I believe the answer is yes.

Nemotron 3 raises the bar for what “open” and “enterprise-ready” look like in model land, and it does so in a way that plays to Nvidia’s strengths.

Over the longer term, its real impact may be cultural rather than technical.

By committing to a Nemotron roadmap, putting its own training recipes in the open, and treating models as libraries you version and ship, Nvidia is trying to define how serious AI software should be built.

What Act 4 looks like The broader retail media landscape is fragmenting under its own weight.","Act 2 was expanding formats and objectives.

Act 3, the one Instacart is in now, is about becoming infrastructure for an entire ecosystem.

Miller was promoted to general manager of advertising at Instacart in July this year, but she’s been architecting this trajectory for over four years. Before Instacart, she spent more than a decade at Google, leading the full-stack redesign of Google Ads (then AdWords) before moving to YouTube, where she directed product for the ads advertiser experience. At YouTube, she established goal-based buying across awareness, consideration, and action—scaling offerings like TrueView for Reach and introducing SMB-friendly creation tools.

That ad-tech pedigree matters. Instacart has been first to market repeatedly—self-serve platforms, incrementality measurement, powering other retailers’ ad networks. Now, competitors are studying what Instacart built and replicating it with bigger budgets. Miller faces the classic innovator’s dilemma: how do you stay ahead when your playbook becomes industry standard?

Acts 1 and 2: Building the Foundation

When Miller joined Instacart in 2021, the company was coming off the pandemic with massive attention from users, brands, and retailers. The natural starting point had been sponsored products—the basic unit of retail media advertising. But even there, Instacart differentiated early.

“One of the first areas where we tried to differentiate ourselves from other retail media networks is not just looking at attributed sales, but really looking at causal, random control and exposed groups to understand the total incrementality of Instacart sponsored products,” Miller explains.

This was 2021, when most retail media networks were still pitching brands on basic attribution. Instacart was already proving incremental lift with proper test design. The platform was also self-serve from day one—an unusual approach at a time when most retailers typically started with direct sales and insertion orders before building self-service capabilities.

Act 2 brought display and video formats, marrying what Miller calls “inspiration with shoppability.” The company shifted to marketing objective-based buying, allowing brands to optimize explicitly toward goals like driving new-to-brand sales or total sales, rather than just managing individual cost-per-click bids.

Act 3: The Ecosystem Play

When the company launched Carrot Ads in March 2022, powering retail media networks on other e-commerce sites, it was years before other retailers announced similar platform ambitions. Now, Miller is doubling down on the company’s third act revolving around becoming the infrastructure other commerce players can plug into.

Carrot Ads now powers retail media networks on 240-plus e-commerce sites, including Thrive Market, Hy-Vee, and Uber Eats’ grocery experience.

This platform strategy is suddenly everywhere. Amazon announced its Amazon Retail Ads Service earlier this year, signing partnerships with several retailers, including Macy’s. Best Buy’s Lisa Valentino recently outlined a vision of Best Buy as an open platform for data collaboration and audience extension. But Instacart has been executing this model for longer.

The pitch to brands is straightforward: buy once, activate everywhere. Log into Instacart ads, launch a campaign, and it serves across the Instacart marketplace plus those 240 Carrot Ads sites. For emerging brands with limited distribution, ads extend automatically as soon as their products hit shelves in new locations. For large brands managing dozens of retail relationships, it’s consolidated buying with consistent measurement.

“This helps smaller brands with limited distribution get all of that opportunity they possibly can,” Miller notes. “And for large brands, it’s so much easier to have a single place to buy and measure and have consistent measurement.”

And the pitch to retailers is not just a plug-and-play ad server, but the opportunity for retailers to tap into Instacart’s national advertiser demand. This is a significant benefit for retailers looking to grow their ad revenue after the initial ‘easy money’ of ad spend migrating from trade and shopper marketing funds is exhausted. Retailers can tap into this new advertiser demand “on day zero,” according to Miller.

“Carrot Ads has really been a key part of changing the conversation with retailers and helping show that they have options,” Miller says. “They have options to share in ad revenue, and they have options to participate in retail media without investing all of that upfront cost in sales teams, R&D and bespoke tech,“ while adding that retailers can maintain their own supplier relationships through direct sales.

Beyond e-commerce sites, Instacart has built full end-to-end integrations with platforms like Trade Desk and TikTok, allowing advertisers to use Instacart’s purchase-based audiences for targeting and closed-loop measurement directly within those platforms. Miller describes it as meeting brands and agencies where they already are, rather than forcing them to adopt yet another buying interface.

Not On The Menu: Black Box Algorithms

Retail media is drowning in AI announcements. Every optimization feature gets rebranded, every algorithm becomes “agentic,” and platforms are racing toward full automation. Mark Zuckerberg recently described a future where advertisers provide Meta “no creative, no targeting, no measurement”—just objectives and bank account access.

A few weeks ago, Amazon announced its unified campaign manager with Performance+ and Brand+ capabilities that move advertisers toward less control in exchange for AI-driven optimization (I covered this in a separate post for The Drum). The advertising community is divided on whether these algorithmic systems are overall a good idea. Some see efficiency and scale. Others see a trust deficit waiting to get worse—platforms grading their own homework with even less visibility into what’s actually happening.

So I asked Miller: where does Instacart stand?

She didn’t dismiss automation, but she immediately emphasized trust and choice. When Instacart rolled out optimized bidding, they A/B tested it with clients first, kept manual controls available, and never forced adoption. “Choice and trust is really key,” Miller said. “We’re not forcing this.”

Even as Instacart builds conversational AI shopping experiences, Miller insists on following consumer behavior rather than rushing ahead. “We don’t want to rush to the conclusion of this is how ads work here,” she said.

In-Store Retail Media: A Physical Hedge

While much of retail media fixates on digital inventory, Miller sees physical stores as increasingly critical—particularly as AI shopping agents threaten to intercept purchase intent before shoppers ever reach retailer websites.

Caper carts, Instacart’s smart shopping carts with screens, are now deployed in nearly 100 cities. Wakefern recently announced that nearly 20 percent of its member stores will have Caper carts with ads enabled, joining Schnucks, McKeever’s, and others.

“It literally has all of those same benefits of an online closed-loop experience in the aisles of the grocery store, which you essentially don’t get with any other technology,” Miller says. The carts have loyalty card information, real-time basket data, and location signals. They can recommend products based on what the shopper just added to their cart or what they bought previously.

Building ads for shopping carts required experimentation. Miller’s team tested different approaches and found that shoppable display ads—promoting specific items with timely offers based on signals like aisle location—drove strong engagement and physical add-to-cart behavior.

She’s keeping cards close on what’s next for in-store capabilities, but emphasizes the trajectory is promising. “We’re still early, but Caper has a pretty great trajectory,” she notes.

What Act 4 looks like

The broader retail media landscape is fragmenting under its own weight. More than 200 retail media networks now compete for advertiser attention while brands struggle to manage relationships with an average of five to seven platforms. Growth is decelerating—15.6% in 2025 versus 25.1% in 2024, according to IAB data.

Miller believes simplification is the answer, but not the kind that removes advertiser control. She’s building for a future where brands can buy in one place and activate across an entire ecosystem, but where they maintain transparency into results and choice in how their campaigns run.

Unlike executives rushing toward full automation, Miller is doing this with Google-bred discipline: test, measure, prove, scale. She’s layering new AI capabilities on proven machine learning foundations. The company has built conversational shopping experiences, but waiting to see what consumers actually want before forcing ads into them.",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-user-assets-prod/s3/images/original/instacart.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-12-15 10:02:30.318720

Walt Disney’s deal with Open AI looks to the future of what happens when anyone’s intellectual property by big media companies clashes with sharply rising and needy artificial intelligence (AI) technology platforms.

Some analysts believe the deal was a good idea -- to settle with one of the major players starting up AI technologies like Open AI that are desperate to access approved, fully copyrighted products to avoid seemingly nonstop legal hassles.

That said, Disney has placed some major restrictions on this 200 character-licensing deal to OpenAI for its text-to-video Sora platform. Users can create only short-form videos, no actor likeness or voices, and there are content filters (for political, violence, adult-video, and other issues).

There is history here. IP issues have been around for decades -- for example, the introduction of VHS tapes, then DVDs, and most recently in the early 2000s with mobile video.

One analyst says it's sort of a surrender by Disney -- a kind of ""if you can’t beat 'em, join 'em"" way of thinking.

Not so, says Bob Iger, CEO of Disney. It looks to the future of where content is going with digital technologies. He says this follows its breakthrough move to place Disney TV and movie content on Apple iTunes app back in 2005.

Disney is moving to accelerate what some analysts believe has been a slowdown in monetization of its long-time legendary characters.

In what he says is another obvious trend, Kevin Mayer, ex-senior executive of Walt Disney and now co-founder/co-CEO of Candle Media, believes it’s all about serving the next generation of entertainment users.

On CNBC, he refers to young millennials and Gen Xers who are increasingly fascinated by creating their own short-form videos coming from TikTok and other social media platforms -- including that of rising YouTube short-form videos.

Climbing on this bandwagon, Iger says OpenAI short-form AI content will be curated and placed on its Disney+ platform in some form with this deal.

Most important is the next step -- the effort around monetization. In other words, advertising dollars.

This is what Disney knows a lot about - - -- something OpenAI, and other big AI-focused companies like Anthropic, Perplexity, and others are considering: to build platforms with ad-supported options for those still relatively newbie AI platforms -- OpenAI’s original ChatCPT, Google Gemini and xAI’s Grok platforms.

All this is headed in that direction. Think about what Google Gemini is up to now to synthesize all Google search ad engagement activities into AI.

Some believe that Disney seems to be getting pulled into this race, somewhat against its will.

But considering the wherewithal Disney has in monetizing its IP now. Being the first major media company to make such a deal gives it a head start over competitors.

OpenAI-backed Chai Discovery has secured $130 million in funding to boost how life-saving medicines are created.

According to the Bloomberg report, the deal, which values the company at $1.3 billion, comes three months after the startup’s last funding round and brings its total financing to $225 million. The Series B financing was co-led by Oak HC/FT and General Catalyst. Investors including Thrive Capital, Menlo Ventures, and OpenAI also participated in the round.

Chai Discovery’s Chai-2 platform has achieved a 16% success rate in creating functional antibodies from scratch—over 100 times better than anything that came before. The implications are staggering: diseases that have stumped researchers for decades could finally meet their match.

The numbers and big pharma

Chai-2’s approach has designed 20 antibodies for 52 different targets in under two weeks, with at least one successful match for half of all targets tested.

Data from last month shows AI-native companies now achieve 80-90% Phase I success rates (where initial human testing begins) versus the 40-65% rates of conventional approaches. Development timelines that once stretched over a decade are compressing to three to six years. The economic change is equally good: the AI pharmaceutical market surged from $1.8 billion in 2023 to a projected $13.1 billion by 2034.

Four weeks ago, the Chai-2 platform successfully designed functional antibodies against six challenging GPCRs, including targets that have frustrated researchers for years.

Diseases and doctors

Chai-2’s AI system generates complete antibody designs, predicting exactly how they’ll bind to disease targets before any lab testing begins.

This means researchers can design therapeutic antibodies with a reasonable level of confidence before spending months in expensive lab work. Think of it as having a crystal ball that shows exactly how a potential drug will behave in the human body—before making it.

Over 86% of designed antibodies show strong developability profiles comparable to existing therapeutic drugs. This addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in drug development: ensuring designed molecules can actually become safe, effective medicines that reach patients battling cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other devastating conditions.

The funding momentum tells the story of an industry transformation. After venture capital peaked at $1.8 billion across 40+ deals in 2021, this year saw fewer than 20 deals worth about half that amount—making Chai Discovery’s massive raise even more significant.

The race

Naturally, every sector has competition.

Companies like AstraZeneca, Bayer, GSK, Roche, and Moderna are investing billions in AI/ML to boost R&D productivity, while AI-leveraged drug development has become an $18 billion industry.

With Chai-2 now available and potential partners able to reach out directly for access, thousands of researchers worldwide have access to technology that could design treatments for diseases like multiple myeloma, autoimmune disorders, and cancer targets.",https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2025/12/Dollars-14-Envato.jpeg,N,,2025-12-15 11:06:14.383973

What’s Weighing on ServiceNow Stock

KeyBanc analyst Jackson Ader warned that wider use of AI could start to reduce demand for traditional SaaS products like ServiceNow’s. The concern is not about ServiceNow’s current execution, but about a tougher business environment. He set a price target of $775 on NOW, indicating 10% downside from current levels.

KeyBanc said IT back-office hiring is slowing, and demand for new workers has yet to bottom. Since ServiceNow’s software is closely linked to workflow and staffing needs, weaker hiring could slow growth.

The firm also pointed to rising AI competition. ServiceNow’s AI Agent Orchestrator may struggle to stand out as Microsoft’s (MSFT) Agent 365 gains traction with large companies. In addition, KeyBanc flagged ongoing government budget scrutiny, which could weigh on demand from public-sector customers.

Is Adobe Losing Its Edge in the AI Race?

For Adobe, the concern is less about slowing demand and more about competition coming from all sides. KeyBanc said it sees limited room for outperformance in 2026, as Adobe battles traditional rivals, AI-native startups, and large language model developers at the same time.

The firm said Adobe’s recent results were solid, but its outlook left little room for surprise. Management guided for flat growth in new recurring revenue in 2026, while profit margins are expected to shrink. Despite the results, the stock barely moved, which KeyBanc views as a sign that competition is already weighing on shares.

As part of the downgrade, KeyBanc set a price target of $310 on Adobe shares, indicating 13% downside from current levels.

The agreement follows two years of collaboration between BBVA and OpenAI, and involves joint investments and shared objectives.
OpenAI will support BBVA’s AI strategy to improve customer experiences and optimise the bank’s operations.
Also, the partnership allows BBVA to access OpenAI’s latest AI models and expertise, and work closely with its engineering, research, and development teams.

Under the partnership, both organisations will develop AI-driven solutions for customer service, internal operations, and employee productivity.

The agreement follows two years of collaboration between BBVA and OpenAI, and involves joint investments and shared objectives.

OpenAI will support BBVA’s AI strategy to improve customer experiences and optimise the bank’s operations.

Also, the partnership allows BBVA to access OpenAI’s latest AI models and expertise, and work closely with its engineering, research, and development teams.

BBVA chairman Carlos Torres Vila said: “We were pioneers in the digital and mobile transformation, and we are now entering the AI era with even greater ambition.

“Our alliance with OpenAI accelerates the native integration of artificial intelligence across the bank to create a smarter, more proactive, and completely personalised banking experience, anticipating the needs of every client.”

The collaboration will focus on creating an intelligent conversational assistant designed to assist customers with their daily financial activities.

OpenAI and BBVA plan to set a new standard for customer engagement and develop additional tools to help relationship managers provide personalised support.

They will develop systems to streamline risk analysis and transform operational processes, such as software development and routine employee tasks.

Also, a digital “alter ego” will be created, which can learn from employees’ work habits, remember ongoing projects, and carry out tasks with oversight.

BBVA will extend the use of ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce of more than 120,000 employees, following an initial phase involving 11,000 staff.

In the initial phase, the technology showed consistent usage, with 80% of participants accessing the assistant daily and reporting an average weekly time saving of three hours on routine activities.

BBVA is also working on integrating its products and services directly into ChatGPT, allowing users to interact with the bank through OpenAI’s platform.

The Spanish bank has already demonstrated a ChatGPT-integrated app for its digital banks in Italy and Germany.

The agreement aims to establish a new industry benchmark for AI-driven transformation in financial services, BBVA stated.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said: “BBVA is a strong example of how a large financial institution can adopt artificial intelligence with real ambition and speed.

“With the expansion of our work together, BBVA will embed our AI at the core of its products and operations to enhance the overall banking experience for their customers.”",https://www.retailbankerinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/15-Dec-BBVA.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 06:59:11.204155

Preliminary Pricing Supplement dated December 12, 2025

Unlike ordinary debt securities, the Notes do not pay interest and do not guarantee the return of the full principal amount at maturity. Instead, as described below, the Notes will be automatically redeemed for the Redemption Premium if the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Initial Underlier Value. If not automatically redeemed, the Notes offer leveraged exposure to potential appreciation of the Underlier from the Initial Underlier Value to the Final Underlier Value. Investors should be willing to forgo dividend payments and, if the Notes are not automatically redeemed and the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value, be willing to lose a significant portion or all of their investment at maturity.

consent to u.k. bail-in power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-10 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

PS- 5

·You understand and accept that, if the Notes are automatically redeemed, you will not participate in any appreciation of the Underlier, which may be significant, and that your potential return on the Notes is limited to the Redemption Premium.

·You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of your principal amount if the Notes are not automatically redeemed and the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Underlier.

·You anticipate that, if the Notes are not automatically redeemed, the Final Underlier Value will be greater than the Initial Underlier Value.

·You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Underlier.

·You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of the Underlier, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to the Underlier.

·You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be automatically redeemed and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield.

·You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Underlier.

·You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not automatically redeemed.

·You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

·You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

·You seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

·You seek an investment that, if the Notes are automatically redeemed, participates in the full appreciation of the Underlier rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Redemption Premium.

·You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes in the event that the Notes are not automatically redeemed and the Final Underlier Value falls below the Barrier Value.

·You do not anticipate that, if the Notes are not automatically redeemed, the Final Underlier Value will be greater than the Initial Underlier Value.

·You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Underlier.

·You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to, the Underlier.

·You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be automatically redeemed.

·You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Underlier.

·You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not automatically redeemed.

·You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings.

·You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

·You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the appropriateness of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement, the prospectus and the prospectus supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the Notes for investment.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE upon an automatic REDEMPTION

The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an automatic redemption. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption:

§Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value: $100.00*

*The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of $100.00 has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent a likely actual Initial Underlier Value. The actual Initial Underlier Value will be equal to the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Initial Valuation Date.

For information regarding recent values of the Underlier, please see “Information Regarding the Underlier” in this pricing supplement.

Example 1: The Notes are automatically redeemed on the Observation Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Initial Underlier Value, the Notes are automatically redeemed on the Redemption Settlement Date. You will receive on the Redemption Settlement Date a cash payment of $1,150.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note, which is equal to your principal amount plus a return equal to the Redemption Premium. No further amounts will be payable on the Notes after they have been automatically redeemed.

Example 2: The Notes are not automatically redeemed on the Observation Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Observation Date is less than the Initial Underlier Value, the Notes are not automatically redeemed on the Redemption Settlement Date.

If the Closing Value of the Underlier is below the Initial Underlier Value on the Observation Date, the Notes will not be automatically redeemed and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment at maturity. See “Hypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at Maturity” below.

Hypothetical EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE at Maturity

The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

§Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value: $100.00*

§Hypothetical Barrier Value: $75.00 (75.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

§You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT automatically redeemed.

*The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of $100.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of $75.00 have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial Underlier Value or Barrier Value. The actual Initial Underlier Value will be equal to the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Barrier Value will be equal to 75.00% of the Initial Underlier Value.

For information regarding recent values of the Underlier, please see “Information Regarding the Underlier” in this pricing supplement.

Final Underlier Value Underlier Return Payment at Maturity per $1,000 Principal Amount Note $200.00 100.00% $2,805.00 $190.00 90.00% $2,624.50 $180.00 80.00% $2,444.00 $170.00 70.00% $2,263.50 $160.00 60.00% $2,083.00 $150.00 50.00% $1,902.50 $140.00 40.00% $1,722.00 $130.00 30.00% $1,541.50 $120.00 20.00% $1,361.00 $110.00 10.00% $1,180.50 $105.00 5.00% $1,090.25 $100.00 0.00% $1,000.00 $95.00 -5.00% $1,000.00 $90.00 -10.00% $1,000.00 $80.00 -20.00% $1,000.00 $75.00 -25.00% $1,000.00 $74.99 -25.01% $749.90 $70.00 -30.00% $700.00 $60.00 -40.00% $600.00 $50.00 -50.00% $500.00 $40.00 -60.00% $400.00 $30.00 -70.00% $300.00 $20.00 -80.00% $200.00 $10.00 -90.00% $100.00 $0.00 -100.00% $0.00

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated:

Example 1: The value of the Underlier increases from an Initial Underlier Value of $100.00 to a Final Underlier Value of $110.00.

Because the Final Underlier Value is greater than the Initial Underlier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,180.50 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Underlier Return × Upside Leverage Factor)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 10.00% × 1.805)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 18.05%) = $1,180.50

PS- 8

Example 2: The value of the Underlier decreases from an Initial Underlier Value of $100.00 to a Final Underlier Value of $95.00.

Because the Final Underlier Value is less than or equal to the Initial Underlier Value but greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold.

Example 3: The value of the Underlier decreases from an Initial Underlier Value of $100.00 to a Final Underlier Value of $50.00.

Because the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $500.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Underlier Return)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × -50.00%) = $500.00

Example 3 demonstrates that, if the Notes are not automatically redeemed, and if the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Underlier from the Initial Underlier Value.

If the Notes are not automatically redeemed, you may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC.

Selected Risk Considerations

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Underlier. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

·Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss—The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not automatically redeemed, and if the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Underlier from the Initial Underlier Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

·No Interest Payments—As a holder of the Notes, you will not receive interest payments.

·If the Notes Are Automatically Redeemed, Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited to the Redemption Premium—If the Notes are automatically redeemed, your return on the Notes will be limited to the Redemption Premium and will not be based on the amount of any appreciation in the value of the Underlier, which may be significant. In addition, if the Notes are automatically redeemed, you will not benefit from the Upside Leverage Factor, which only applies to the payment at maturity if the Final Underlier Value is greater than the Initial Underlier Value.

·Automatic Redemption and Reinvestment Risk—While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be automatically redeemed prior to maturity for a term that could be as short as approximately one year. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are automatically redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after an automatic redemption. The automatic redemption feature of the Notes may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

·Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Underlier on the Dates Specified—Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the Underlier determined at any other time.

·Contingent Repayment of the Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Automatic Redemption—You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any automatic redemption. If you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of the Underlier has increased from the Initial Underlier Value. See “—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

·The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk—Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The Redemption Premium is determined based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Underlier. The Redemption Premium is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Underlier been lower. As volatility of the Underlier increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that the Final Underlier Value will be less than the Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher Redemption Premium reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the Redemption Premium been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

·Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Underlier—The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the Underlier. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the Underlier would have.

·The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain— There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the Notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described below under “Tax Considerations.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the Notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

PS- 10

Risks Relating to the Issuer

·Credit of Issuer—The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

·You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier

·There Are Risks Associated with Single Equities—The price of the Underlier can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Underlier and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuer of the Underlier.

·Anti-dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-dilution Adjustments—The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the Underlier. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the Underlier. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect the market price of, and any amounts payable on, the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·Reorganization or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated— Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of the Underlier, the Calculation Agent may replace the Underlier with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of the Underlier upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent or may make other changes to the terms of the Notes to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the Calculation Agent to replace the Underlier, to accelerate the Notes or to otherwise adjust the terms of the Notes could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the Notes than if the Calculation Agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs—Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or the Underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

PS- 11

·Historical Performance of the Underlier Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Underlier Over the Term of the Notes—The value of the Underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of the Underlier is not an indication of the future performance of the Underlier over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Underlier over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of the Underlier.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

·We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Underlier. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

·Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

·Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe market prices of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Underlier;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

PS- 12

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

·The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes—The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

·The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes—Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

Tax Considerations

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the Underlier. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes. This gain or loss on your Notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your Notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of Notes at the original issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.

Growth of 0.5 percent against the market trend in strategically important regular life insurance premiums

BarmeniaGothaer is the industry leader with an AA+ in the Assekurata sustainability rating for insurance groups

Cologne/Wuppertal, 15 December 2025 – BarmeniaGothaer Co-CEOs Dr. Andreas Eurich and Oliver Schoeller, together with the other members of the executive management team, presented the preliminary figures for the current financial year at today’s virtual press conference.

“2025 was a year of growing together into one organization for us. We wanted to build on the momentum created by the swift merger of the two predecessor companies to continue shaping market developments and to offer our employees new perspectives. Despite geopolitical tensions and the weak economy in Germany, we achieved this objective very successfully,” said Eurich. Co-CEO Schoeller emphasized: “Our above-average premium growth and significantly improved financial strength demonstrate that our plan to combine the complementary market strengths of Barmenia and Gothaer is working.”

The Group anticipates premium income growth of 7.9 percent[2] to an estimated € 9.27 billion in 2025 – a growth of 0.5 percentage points above market.[3] This strong development is primarily being driven by the property & casualty and health insurance segments. The expected growth of 8.9 and 8.8 percent respectively in these segments is well above market (market growth rate: 7.7 percent and 8.0 percent respectively).[4] 3.8 percent growth is anticipated in the life insurance segment (market growth rate: 7.0 percent).[5]

The Group further consolidated its equity base in 2025 and a year-end figure in the region of € 2.07 billion is expected (previous year: € 1.99 billion). The Group’s Solvency II ratio (excluding transitional measures on technical provisions) is expected to rise from 189.3 percent in 2024 to 201.1 percent. Consolidated net profit should increase from € 19 million to in the region of € 101 million.

S&P confirms ‘A’ rating and ‘positive’ outlook

Against this backdrop, rating agency S&P Global Ratings (S&P) confirmed the ratings of Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherung AG, Gothaer Krankenversicherung AG and Gothaer Lebensversicherung AG in June 2025. All three companies have retained their 'A’ rating and the outlook remains ‘positive’. In its report, S&P assumes that competitiveness will improve due to an even more diverse product portfolio, a more extensive network of sales channels and a broader customer base. S&P also recognized the very robust financial risk profile, which is underpinned by a very solid equity base, and emphasized the improved resilience across all insurance lines as a result of the diversified positioning. S&P’s positive outlook has opened up an opportunity to improve the current rating by a further increment to ‘A+’ within the next 12 to 24 months.[6]

Property and casualty: well above market premium growth and stronger profitability

Total gross premiums written by Barmenia Allgemeine Versicherungs-AG and Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherung AG are expected to rise by 9.4 percent to € 3.32 billion. This represents overall growth of 1.7 percentage points above market for the two property insurers.[7]The growth drivers are the mobility and private client business segments, where growth of 15 and 12 percent respectively is expected. 5.9 percent growth is anticipated in the corporate client segment. The combined ratio of Gothaer Allgemeine and Barmenia Allgemeine will fall by 2.1 and 5.0 percentage points to 91.2 and 95.6 percent respectively. “I am delighted that we have continued to outpace the market and significantly improve our profitability in the property and casualty insurance segment. Given the current claims inflation situation, this is a reflection of our disciplined underwriting and our sustainable approach to cost and claims management,” said Thomas Bischof, Board Member for Composite Insurance at BarmeniaGothaer.

Health: above-market growth in premium income

Growth in total gross premiums written by Barmenia Krankenversicherung AG and Gothaer Krankenversicherung AG was 0.8 percent higher than market growth, increasing by 8.8 percent to € 3.82 billion.[8]Premium growth was driven by the comprehensive insurance segment, where gross premiums written were up 9.7 percent. 6.3 percent growth is anticipated in the supplementary insurance segment (including company health insurance). The number of policyholders had risen to 3.2 million in October 2025 – an increase of around 34,000 since October 2024.

“It is great news that our growth will outpace the market in our first full financial year together. I am particularly proud of the expansion of our comprehensive insurance client base, with nearly 9,000 new policyholders. This represents another significant increase on the previous year and the strongest expansion of our policyholder base in more than 15 years,” explained Christian Ritz, Board Member for Health Insurance at BarmeniaGothaer.

Life: growth in current premiums bucks the market trend

Gross premiums written by Gothaer Lebensversicherung AG in 2025 are expected to rise by 4.1 percent to € 1.44 billion (market growth rate: 7.0 percent).[9]Contrary to the market trend, the life insurer expects growth of 0.5 percent in strategically significant regular premiums (market: -0.6 percent).[10]Single premium business is expected to grow by 16.2 percent. The willingness of customers to recommend the company to others has also developed very positively. According to the latest KUBUS study, Gothaer Leben ranks among the top three life insurance companies with regard to the NPS.

“Our growth in regular premiums running against the market trend is testimony to our excellent positioning and innovative strength. The high willingness to recommend us shows that we have been very successful in continuing to focus on our customers during the merger of the two life insurance companies,” said Alina vom Bruck, Board Member for Life Insurance at BarmeniaGothaer.

AA+ for BarmeniaGothaer in the Assekurata sustainability rating

In its first Assekurata sustainability rating for insurance groups, BarmeniaGothaer achieved an AA+ (very good) rating. This is the best result ever achieved by an insurance group, making BarmeniaGothaer the industry leader. The Assekurata rating involved the analysis of Barmenia Krankenversicherung AG, Barmenia Allgemeine Versicherungs-AG, Gothaer Lebensversicherung AG, Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherung AG and Gothaer Krankenversicherung AG. In its rating process, Assekurata not only assesses how an insurance company deals with sustainability-related risks for its own business activities (outside-in perspective), but also, and in particular, the extent to which it provides effective external sustainability impetus and thus has an impact on the environment and society (inside-out perspective). The parameters of framework, business operations, product management/risk transfer and capital investment were examined for this purpose. “I am delighted that our comprehensive range of sustainability activities are also rated so positively by a neutral third party. The rating highlights the importance of this topic within our organization and creates transparency and guidance for our employees, our insurance agents and our clients. Above all, however, it shows that our approach of being sustainable in everything we do is working,” explained Harald Epple, CFO and Board Member for Sustainability.

Outlook

“In a geopolitical and economic environment that remains volatile, our recently adopted ‘TogetherStrong’ strategy provides essential guidance. We prioritize a strong market focus through trusted and enduring customer relationships – both in private and corporate client business – and specifically leverage the strengths we possess as a sustainably operating mutual insurance association. At the same time, we are making targeted investments in modern technologies and artificial intelligence to further optimize our processes and successfully tackle future challenges,” said Schoeller. “On this basis, we are consistently driving forward our integration and systematically leveraging synergies in order to further strengthen our market position. Our ambition remains unchanged. We want to create an exceptional company that is perceived as a reliable partner in the market,” added Eurich.","https://mnd-assets.mynewsdesk.com/image/upload/ar_16:9,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto:good,w_1782/hqrulw9cyfq26honq5pu6w",N,,2025-12-15 08:02:04.731603

See also: Walmart and Amazon drive retail transformation with AI Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?","Walmart’s December 9 transfer to Nasdaq wasn’t just a symbolic gesture. The US$905 billion retailer is making its boldest claim yet: that it’s no longer a traditional discount chain, but a tech-powered enterprise using AI to fundamentally rewire its retail operations.

But beyond the marketing spin and the parade of AI announcements, what’s genuinely transforming at the world’s largest retailer – and where are the gaps between ambition and execution?

The Agentic AI pivot: Purpose-built, not off-the-shelf

Walmart’s AI strategy diverges sharply from competitors chasing generic large language models. According to CTO Hari Vasudev, the company is deploying what it calls “purpose-built agentic AI” – specialised tools trained on Walmart’s proprietary retail data rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.

“Our approach to agentic AI at Walmart is surgical,” Vasudev wrote in a May 2025 blog post. “Extensive early testing proved that, for us, agents work best when deployed for highly specific tasks, to produce outputs that can then be stitched together to orchestrate and solve complex workflows.”

This translates to tangible applications, the company says: Walmart’s “Trend-to-Product” system cuts fashion production timelines by 18 weeks. Its GenAI Customer Support Assistant now routes and resolves issues autonomously without human intervention.

Developer productivity tools handle test generation and error resolution in CI/CD pipelines. Meanwhile, the company’s retail-specific LLM “Wallaby” – trained on decades of Walmart transaction data – powers everything from item comparison to personalised shopping journey completion.

The infrastructure underpinning this? Element, Walmart’s proprietary MLOps platform, designed to avoid vendor lock-in and optimise GPU use in multiple cloud providers. It’s an in-house “factory” that gives Walmart speed and flexibility competitors wrestling with third-party platforms can’t match.

Real numbers: Where AI delivers measurable impact

Walmart has been unusually transparent about specific ROI metrics, offering a rare glimpse into enterprise AI economics:

Data operations: GenAI improved over 850 million product catalogue data points – a task that would have required 100 times the headcount using manual processes, according to CEO Doug McMillon’s August 2024 earnings call.

Supply chain efficiency: AI-powered route optimisation eliminated 30 million unnecessary delivery miles and avoided 94 million pounds (42,000 tons) of CO2 emissions. The company won the prestigious Franz Edelman Award in 2023 for this technology – and has since commercialised it as a SaaS product for other businesses.

Store operations: Digital twin technology predicts refrigeration failures up to two weeks in advance, auto-generating work orders complete with visual models, wiring diagrams, and required parts. Sam’s Club’s AI-powered exit technology has reduced member checkout times by 21%, with over 64% of members now using the friction-free system in all locations.

Customer experience: Dynamic delivery algorithms analyse traffic patterns, weather conditions, and order complexity to predict delivery times down to the minute, enabling 17-minute express deliveries in markets the company has tested.

The human cost: “AI will change every job”

McMillon hasn’t sugarcoated the workforce implications. Speaking at a Bentonville workforce conference in September 2025, he said: “It’s very clear that AI is going to change literally every job. Maybe there’s a job in the world that AI won’t change, but I haven’t thought of it.”

But Walmart positions this as a transformation not an elimination. McMillon expects total headcount to remain flat even as revenue grows – meaning jobs will shift, not disappear. White-collar roles face the earliest disruption through chatbots handling customer service and supply chain tracking, while store and warehouse workers will eventually see tasks absorbed by autonomous systems.

The company is investing heavily in re-skilling programmes. “We’ve got to create the opportunity for everybody to make it to the other side,” McMillon said at the Bentonville conference. Automation equipment operator Chance at Walmart’s Palestine, Texas, distribution centre described the shift: “It used to be 85% physical. Now it’s 85% mental. I’m solving problems with my mind, not just my body.”

The Nasdaq gambit: Repositioning for tech valuations

Walmart’s exchange transfer was explicitly framed around its AI transformation. CFO John David Rainey stated the move reflects the company “setting a new standard for omnichannel retail by integrating automation and AI.”

The subtext? Walmart wants the valuation multiples tech companies command. At a P/E ratio of 40.3x – higher than Amazon and Microsoft – the market is partially buying the transformation story. Potential inclusion in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index would drive passive fund investment regardless of AI execution.

Analysts are split on whether the premium is justified. Jefferies’ Corey Tarlowe argued the move signals Walmart is “less of a traditional retail corporation and more of a technology firm.” But sceptics note the company still derives revenue from razor-thin retail margins, not high-margin software or cloud services – despite commercialising tools like Route Optimisation.

Verdict: Genuine transformation with execution risk

Walmart’s AI strategy is neither pure hype nor guaranteed success. The company is making structural investments in proprietary infrastructure, deploying AI at genuine scale with published operational benefits, and acknowledging workforce implications most enterprises dodge.

But significant execution risks remain: managing fragmented agent ecosystems, preventing algorithmic bias at scale, competing against external shopping agents, and determining appropriate automation boundaries while maintaining accuracy.

The company’s candidness about challenges – “often, a co-pilot model, with humans and AI working as a team, is the most effective approach” – suggests leadership understands AI isn’t a silver bullet.

For enterprises watching Walmart’s playbook, the lesson is to build for specificity, not generality. Invest in proprietary data moats, plan for workforce transformation, not just cost reduction, and recognise that even with massive resources and technical talent, agentic AI remains early-stage technology with genuine limitations.

The question isn’t whether Walmart is using AI – it demonstrably is. It’s whether this surgical, infrastructure-heavy approach delivers sustainable competitive advantage, or if the company is automating itself into the same low-margin trap with shinier tools.

That answer won’t be clear for several years – but Walmart’s willingness to bet its US$905 billion in market cap on the transformation suggests leadership believes the former.

Continuous logging, real-time data tracing, and built-in lineage allow regulatory requirements and internal risk controls to be embedded directly into system architecture.","IBM has agreed to acquire Confluent in an $11 billion deal, marking a strategic move to build a unified technology stack that supports artificial intelligence and blockchain at scale. The acquisition signals that IBM is moving beyond traditional AI-focused mergers and acquisitions by adding a continuous processing layer for events, transactions, and signals. This layer is increasingly viewed as essential infrastructure rather than an optional enhancement, particularly as intelligent systems, tokenized assets, and blockchain-based solutions require real-time responsiveness to function effectively.

The relevance of this move is amplified by the rapid evolution of AI agents and the broader shift toward autonomous task execution. As enterprises adopt systems capable of acting independently, they require immediate access to contextual data. Similarly, digital assets demand instant clearing, monitoring, and control. In this environment, IBM appears to be positioning real-time data streaming as a foundational capability for future enterprise architectures.

Why Real-Time Context Matters for AI

The transaction highlights a critical limitation in most current enterprise AI deployments. Many organizations still depend on batch processing and delayed reporting, which can restrict the effectiveness of AI systems. For autonomous agents, delayed insights are insufficient, as these systems must continuously react to customer behavior, operational changes, and external signals as they happen.

Confluent addresses this gap by providing a streaming platform that aggregates events from multiple sources, including transactions, application logs, and operational systems, into a single data pipeline. These events become available to AI models with minimal latency, enabling decision-making and monitoring to occur closer to the actual moment of change rather than after reporting cycles conclude. This shift supports more responsive and adaptive AI-driven operations.

Strengthening IBM’s Enterprise AI Capabilities

For IBM, the acquisition enhances several strategic priorities at once. Real-time intelligence is significantly improved, as AI models can rely on continuous data streams instead of periodic exports, leading to more timely and accurate insights. This capability is particularly important for recommendation systems, predictive analytics, and operational optimization.

The deal also supports enterprise-grade orchestration of autonomous agents. When multiple agents must coordinate actions with each other and integrate with legacy systems, a shared and synchronized view of events is essential. A streaming platform provides this common timeline, ensuring consistent sequencing and coordination across complex environments.

In addition, governance and auditability are strengthened. Continuous logging, real-time data tracing, and built-in lineage allow regulatory requirements and internal risk controls to be embedded directly into system architecture. For IBM’s large enterprise clients, this means AI initiatives can scale without compromising transparency, verifiability, or reproducibility of decisions.

Implications for Blockchain and Web3 Adoption

The acquisition also carries significant implications for blockchain and Web3. One of the primary barriers to enterprise adoption of tokenized assets and stablecoins has been the disconnect between on-chain activity and off-chain business systems. While blockchains offer transparency and immutability, core enterprise functions such as accounting, payments, logistics, and compliance often operate on separate systems with different data structures and processing speeds.

By integrating Confluent’s streaming technology, IBM can offer a more standardized approach to bridging this gap. Blockchain events, including stablecoin transactions, token updates, and smart contract signals, can be streamed in real time alongside traditional enterprise data. This enables hybrid on-chain and off-chain models where settlement occurs on the blockchain while accounting, reporting, and risk management systems remain synchronized without delay.

Advancing Programmable Money and Risk Automation

This unified streaming layer also supports programmable money and real-time settlement. Compliance signals, transaction limits, rates, and settlement statuses can be updated as funds move, rather than after transactions are completed. Beyond payments, the same infrastructure benefits Web3 identity and asset provenance by logging changes to identity attributes, access rights, and asset states in real time.",https://www.cointrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ibm.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 08:01:56.321476

Strong growth, low inflation and improving debt metrics boost Côte d’Ivoire’s credit outlook as reforms and investment momentum strengthen.

S&P says Ivorian banks’ exposure to Senegalese debt is overstated, easing contagion fears but regional risks still warrant close monitoring.

Fitch Ratings has delivered a strong endorsement of Côte d’Ivoire’s political and economic trajectory, upgrading the sovereign rating from ‘BB-’ to ‘BB’ with a Stable Outlook. In its report, the agency noted that the country has effectively “moved beyond its history of election-related major civil unrest,” citing the largely peaceful 2025 presidential election and the continuation of President Alassane Ouattara’s reform agenda. This shift marks a decisive moment for a country where political tensions had long been considered a central weakness. Fitch emphasized that “political uncertainty [has] lifted,” reinforcing the perception that Côte d’Ivoire has entered a period of stability that supports macroeconomic management and fiscal planning.

The upgrade carries significant implications for the nation’s creditworthiness. Reduced political risk reassures investors that the government can implement multi-year economic programs without major disruption, improving predictability in an environment where stability is often a prerequisite for sustained investment flows. Fitch’s confidence in Côte d’Ivoire’s political environment also enhances the country’s standing in international capital markets, where sovereigns with a more secure governance outlook generally benefit from lower borrowing costs and greater access to long-term financing instruments. For Côte d’Ivoire, this is particularly important as it deploys its ambitious 2026–2030 National Development Plan.

Fitch’s decision was also propelled by the country’s robust economic performance. The agency projects GDP growth of 6.4% in 2025, rising to 6.6% by 2027, nearly double the median for countries in the ‘BB’ category. Growth is becoming increasingly broad-based, driven not only by construction and services but also by expanding contributions from hydrocarbons, mining, and agriculture. The Baleine oil field and the forthcoming Koné gold mine are expected to reinforce medium-term prospects.

At the same time, inflation has eased sharply, remaining anchored below 2% thanks to WAEMU’s euro-pegged monetary regime and the BCEAO’s prudent stance. Fiscal consolidation is progressing, with the deficit set to stabilize around 3% of GDP and debt gradually declining toward 56% of GDP by 2027. Proactive debt management, including Eurobond buybacks and diversification into new financing instruments such as Samurai bonds and sustainability-linked facilities, has strengthened investor confidence and reduced refinancing pressures.

External indicators have also improved markedly. Fitch noted that WAEMU reserves almost doubled to about USD 33 billion, representing six months of import cover, significantly bolstering the region’s capacity to absorb shocks. Côte d’Ivoire’s diversified export base—spanning cocoa, gold, oil, cashews, and rubber—has helped narrow the current account deficit and support a steady recovery in external financing inflows.

Concerns over Côte d’Ivoire’s exposure to regional financial stress, particularly in Senegal, have been addressed by additional analysis from S&P Global Ratings. The agency argues that Côte d’Ivoire’s vulnerability to Senegalese sovereign debt is “overstated.” While data from UMOA-Titres suggests that Ivorian banks held approximately XOF 1,800 billion of Senegalese government securities at the end of the third quarter of 2025, S&P notes that a significant portion of these holdings were purchased on behalf of non-resident financial institutions.

These investors relied on Ivorian banks as intermediaries, meaning the securities ultimately sit outside the Ivorian and WAEMU banking systems. As S&P emphasizes, Côte d’Ivoire’s “financial sector’s actual exposure to Senegal’s debt is lower than reported.” This reassessment reduces fears that stress in Senegal’s fiscal position—marked by a debt-to-GDP ratio revised upward to 119% in 2024—could spill over into the Ivorian banking sector.

S&P also warns that Senegal remains in a precarious position, with IMF negotiations ongoing and access to external financing constrained. A restructuring of Senegalese debt is not the base case, but if it were to occur, the agency expects authorities and the BCEAO to prioritize regional financial stability.

Such a process would likely focus on external debt rather than WAEMU-issued obligations. Even in a scenario of regional reprofiling, S&P believes the Ivorian banking system could “weather a restructuring of Senegal’s regionally issued debt,” helped by BCEAO’s support mechanisms and the possibility of a “flight to safety” that would channel regional investors toward higher-rated sovereigns such as Côte d’Ivoire itself.

Still, Fitch highlights that risks remain and warrant continued monitoring. Côte d’Ivoire’s governance indicators, while improving, lag the median for ‘BB’ countries. Security tensions in the Sahel, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso, pose potential spillover risks despite Ivorian investments in border protection and regional cooperation.

On the fiscal side, the consolidation path could be tested if revenue mobilization efforts fall short or if financing conditions tighten unexpectedly. Regionally, while exposure to Senegal appears overstated, elevated debt issuance across WAEMU and concentration risks mean that vigilance is needed to prevent credit stress from propagating through shared investors or cross-border banking links.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/ca300a84a633425fdb19c238e8eec878_S.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 06:59:16.951102

The investment bank cited the recent pullback in as providing a good entry point with valuation upside potential, despite maintaining its existing outlook on the business. According to InvestingPro data, current P/E ratio stands at 30.52, slightly above its Fair Value estimate.

Barclays highlighted momentum in Agilent’s core business outside of NASD/CDMO operations, pointing specifically to the null 3 upgrade cycle that is ""in full tilt"" and new product launches across the portfolio, including the ProiQ ms. This momentum is reflected in Agilent’s 6.73% revenue growth over the last twelve months.

The firm noted that new management at Agilent is bringing ""a more intense services/software focus"" and will continue to expand this margin-accretive business beyond instrument maintenance contracts.

According to Barclays, this services/software aspect is ""probably the most underappreciated"" part of Agilent’s business, and the investment bank expects it to become a much bigger focus across all tools companies moving forward.

In other recent news, Agilent has reported strong financial results that have caught the attention of several analyst firms. The company delivered a top-line beat in its fiscal year 2025 results, with earnings per share coming in one cent above consensus estimates. This performance led Stifel to raise its price target for Agilent from $151 to $170, maintaining a Buy rating. Similarly, UBS increased its price target to $180, noting Agilent’s core organic revenue growth of approximately 7.2%, which exceeded both their estimate and the company’s guidance.

Further supporting Agilent’s favorable outlook, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a price target of $170, citing the company’s differentiated growth profile. Morgan Stanley also initiated coverage with an Overweight rating and set a price target of $180, emphasizing the potential impact of Agilent’s new strategic initiatives and Ignite transformation. Additionally, Leerink Partners raised its price target to $165, praising the company’s strong fourth-quarter performance and its guidance for fiscal year 2026.

That’s just what our 49 2025 Impact Awards honorees have done, across the categories of community service/local impact, educational support/learning achievement, ethical sourcing/supply chain transparency, food security/nutritional leadership, philanthropic innovation/corporate giving, sustainability/resource conservation, and workforce development/employee support, with stellar results.

For example, as part of its aptly named Recipe for Change energy and emissions program, Albertsons Cos. is converting refrigeration systems to reduce climate impact while working to improve refrigerant leak rates, while Hy-Vee has introduced a series of new and enhanced financial, lifestyle and health care employee benefits, with the goal of promoting a culture of autonomy and ownership at every level and encouraging each employee to feel empowered to thrive.

Other worthy environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives include ALDI’s Impact Grant Program to address children’s health and wellness and reduce food insecurity, Publix’s work to advance eco-friendly seafood practices, Dollar General’s expansion of fresh produce access, and Raley’s redirection of 17.5 million pounds of food from landfills through its food rescue programs.

All of these endeavors, and the others detailed in the following pages, helped move the needle on some of the biggest ESG issues facing the retail industry, winning the spotlighted companies accolades for their conscientiousness from the business community and shoppers alike.

Then there’s the financial case for being a change maker. As Sandy Douglas, CEO of Providence, R.I.-based United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) – which received two Impact Awards this year – recently told PG Editorial Director and Associate Publisher Gina Acosta during the publication’s Grocery Impact event in November: “We have a simple rule that sustainability of any kind, whether it involves our people or planet or really any agenda, is about two things. First, it’s good for the planet, our people, our communities, and second, it’s good for our business, so that we don’t do anything that is not good for our business. The fact that it’s the right thing to do has a one-plus-one-equals-three effect.”

Political violence, in particular, has surged with unnerving efficiency.
With the national election approaching, violence takes on additional meaning.
The shooting of Osman Hadi should not be remembered merely as another entry in a growing list.
Whether this warning is heeded or quietly absorbed into the background noise will define not just the coming election, but the direction of public life in the years ahead.","Bangladesh has long demonstrated an exceptional ability to absorb violence into the rhythm of daily life. A murder briefly becomes breaking news, a shooting sparks momentary outrage, and then traffic resumes, shops reopen, and the national conversation moves on.

What is new, and far more unsettling, is how gunfire itself is being normalized, not as an aberration but as a recurring feature of public space. When bullets are fired in broad daylight at political actors in the heart of the capital, it is no longer merely a crime problem. It is a statement.

The shooting of Osman Hadi in Bijoynagar was not an isolated act of violence, nor was it particularly surprising in the current climate. A political spokesperson, an organizer, and a potential parliamentary candidate, he was attacked in one of the most crowded and surveilled areas of Dhaka. That he survived, at least for now, is attributed to medical intervention rather than any preventative security arrangement. The incident was both symbolic and instructive. It demonstrated that proximity to power no longer guarantees protection, and visibility no longer ensures deterrence.

Hadi’s shooting fits neatly into a grim statistical pattern. In the 11 months from January to November, more than 230 people were shot across the country, with over 80 fatalities. These numbers alone should have triggered national alarm.

Yet what is more revealing is who the victims are. They are not confined to criminal networks or marginalized spaces. They include traders, young men, local leaders, political organizers, and public figures. Violence has escaped its traditional boundaries and now roams freely across class and geography.

Political violence, in particular, has surged with unnerving efficiency. More than 850 incidents linked to political disputes have resulted in at least 129 deaths and nearly 7,000 injuries in the same eleven-month period. These are not spontaneous eruptions of anger. They are structured confrontations driven by control over territory, influence, committees, extortion routes and pre-election positioning. The election calendar, as always, has a way of sharpening rivalries and lowering thresholds for force.

What makes the attack on Osman Hadi especially telling is not only who he is, but where and when it happened. Bijoynagar is not a remote alley or a forgotten suburb. It is central, visible, and politically conscious. If such an attack can occur there, it sends a message far beyond the intended target. It tells potential candidates, activists, and voters alike that participation carries risk, and that intimidation no longer requires subtlety.

The broader law and order picture only reinforces this anxiety. November alone saw nearly 280 murder cases nationwide, alongside hundreds of robberies, kidnappings, and thousands of cases involving violence against women and children. Over 14,000 criminal cases were filed in a single month. Dhaka led the count, followed by other metropolitan areas, suggesting that urban density has become an advantage not for policing, but for crime.

Public shootings, unlike other forms of violence, produce a unique psychological effect. They are loud, immediate, and theatrical. A gunshot does not merely harm a victim; it asserts dominance. It announces that someone is willing to defy the state in public view. Each such incident erodes confidence not incrementally, but exponentially. People do not need to be victims themselves to feel unsafe; they only need to witness how casually violence is deployed.

Official responses remain familiar. The situation is described as manageable, improving, under control. Security plans have been divided into phases, meetings have been held, warnings issued. On paper, the architecture of order appears intact. On the street, however, the experience is different. A normal situation does not require constant affirmation, and stability does not announce itself through press briefings.

One of the most persistent undercurrents in this crisis is the circulation of firearms. Despite strict laws, guns have become disturbingly accessible. Weapons looted during periods of upheaval remain unrecovered, with hundreds still unaccounted for. These firearms have not remained idle. They have re-entered society, fueling murders, extortion, and political intimidation. Each unrecovered weapon represents a failure not only of enforcement but of accountability.

The timing of all this could not be more precarious. With the national election approaching, violence takes on additional meaning. An election is not merely a vote; it is a collective exercise in trust. When candidates are attacked and activists killed, that trust fractures. Voters may still want to participate, but participation under fear is a hollow exercise.

The political landscape adds further tension. A major party remains absent from the ballot yet present in influence and sentiment. Rival parties are navigating internal disputes, shifting alliances and competitive positioning. Old grievances resurface, new ambitions collide, and the street becomes the preferred arena for settling disputes that institutions fail to contain. Elections do not create these tensions, but they concentrate them.

Human rights monitoring adds another layer of concern. Alongside shootings, there has been a rise in mob violence, attacks on journalists, custodial deaths, assaults on minorities, and suppression of expression. This suggests not a single crisis, but a convergence of many. Violence is no longer purely instrumental; it has become expressive, a language used to communicate power, frustration, and impunity.

What is striking is that none of this is unforeseen. Analysts, criminologists, and election observers have been warning of precisely this trajectory. The consensus is clear: Without firm, early and visibly impartial action, the situation risks further deterioration. The challenge is not a lack of knowledge, but a lack of urgency.

The Election Commission occupies a pivotal position at this moment. Its authority extends beyond logistics into legitimacy. A decisive stance would send a signal that intimidation will not be tolerated, regardless of affiliation. Hesitation, on the other hand, invites testing. In an environment already thick with suspicion, perception matters almost as much as enforcement.

There is a quiet irony in all of this. Bangladesh has conducted elections under far harsher conditions in the past, with fewer resources and weaker institutions. What has changed is not capacity, but confidence. Citizens are less certain that rules will be applied evenly, that violence will be punished consistently, and that safety will not depend on political alignment.

Yet the public persists. Campaigns continue, markets function, people still express a desire to vote. This resilience is admirable, but it should not be mistaken for consent. Endurance is not the same as acceptance, and patience is not infinite.

The shooting of Osman Hadi should not be remembered merely as another entry in a growing list. It should be read as a warning. When political participation becomes a life-threatening act, democracy itself is placed on life support. Whether this warning is heeded or quietly absorbed into the background noise will define not just the coming election, but the direction of public life in the years ahead.

Bangladesh now stands at a familiar crossroads, though the stakes feel higher than usual. Either violence is confronted decisively and early, or it continues its steady march toward becoming an accepted instrument of politics. The bullets have already spoken. The question is whether institutions will respond loudly enough to be heard.",https://ecdn.dhakatribune.net/contents/cache/images/1200x630x1/uploads/media/2025/12/15/aeed7f79c49964097ed057945f1d5286-693f9eda2e848.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 04:00:24.649372

Add to this an FDA that is hemorrhaging institutional knowledge and a health secretary consistently communicating scientifically questionable positions and it’s been a rollercoaster of a year.

Still, the industry perseveres. Drugmakers continued to advance their investigational products, braving the turbulent drug development waters in the hopes of bringing an innovative therapy to the market. And while this effort often ends in failure—90% of investigational drugs flunk out in clinical trials—several companies, including uniQure, Roche and Novo Nordisk clinched key clinical victories in challenging and lucrative indications.

In this piece, BioSpace looks back at some of the biggest trial successes this year, reviewing not only the data but also their broader impact on the company and industry as a whole.

UniQure Scores Historic Huntington’s Win, Despite FDA Pushback

On Sept. 24, uniQure announced that its gene therapy slowed the progression of Huntington’s disease by 75% at the three-year mark. Aside from disease progression, AMT-130 also hit key secondary endpoints, improving functional capacity and lowering the concentrations of a key disease biomarker versus outside comparators.

The data exceeded analyst expectations and could pave the way for the first genetic treatment for the devastating neurodegenerative disorder—barring any regulatory roadblocks.

But that’s exactly what uniQure ran into in just five weeks later. Last month, despite having aligned with the FDA on the protocols and analytical models used in the pivotal study, uniQure revealed that the regulator “no longer agrees” that Phase I/II data for AMT-130 is “adequate to provide the primary evidence in support of a [biologics license application] submission.”

UniQure had been planning to file a BLA early in 2026, but following the FDA’s seeming reversal, the timeline for submission is now “unclear,” the biotech said in November.

In a Nov. 3 note, Stifel analysts called the FDA’s about-face “a shock,” adding that the decision could have far-reaching stock implications not just for uniQure but also for “other development stage companies in the gene therapy space.”

Elsewhere in the Huntington’s space, PTC therapeutics reported positive Huntington’s data in May from a Phase II study of its small-molecule drug PTC518, though analyst reaction has been mixed. While the drug elicited a 23% reduction in the huntingtin protein, William Blair in a May 5 note said that a link between the biomarker and functional remains to be proven. The analysts also flagged the lack of functional benefit in patients with later-stage disease.

Metsera’s Weight-Loss Win-Streak Sparks Big Pharma Tug-of-War

Rising obesity star Metsera captured the industry’s attention in September last year when it announced that its GLP-1 injectable MET-097i achieved 7.5% weight-loss at 36 days in an early study. This year, the New York biotech proved that its success wasn’t a fluke—and secured a nearly $10 billion buyout for its efforts.

Metsera kicked off 2025 with more data for MET-097i, this time from a Phase IIa trial involving 120 patients with overweight or obesity, but without type 2 diabetes. After 12 weekly doses, patients on the GLP-1 injection dropped 11.3% of their body weight versus placebo. Some patients lost as much as 20% of their weight, the biotech said at the time, adding that it did not observe any plateauing effect.

Metsera followed this up with another mid-stage data drop in late September, touting a 14.1% placebo-adjusted weight reduction with MET-097i at 28 weeks—findings that Leerink Partners in a Sept. 30 note called “very encouraging.” Eli Lilly’s blockbuster medicine, tirzepatide,“achieved about a 13% placebo-adjusted weight-loss” at a similar length of follow-up, the analysts noted.

Late-stage development for MET-097i is slated for late-stage development within the year.

Beyond MET-097i, Metsera’s ultra-long-acting amylin injectable MET-233i induced 8.4% weight-loss versus placebo at 36 days in a Phase I study that read out in June. Some patients on MET-233i saw a 10.2% reduction in body weight.

These results were enough to ignite one of the most high-profile—if not messiest—biopharma bidding war—in recent history. Pfizer in mid-September announced that it would acquire the biotech for $4.9 billion, setting the pharma up for an obesity comeback after suffering several failed assets. A month later, however, Novo Nordisk submitted a rival bid worth $8.5 billion.

This intrusion—which Metsera seemed to welcome, calling the offer “superior” to Pfizer’s—set off a very public back-and-forth between the companies, involving lawsuits from the New York pharma. Ultimately, Pfizer prevailed, upping its offer to $9.2 billion to definitively win Metsera’s hand in corporate marriage.

Novo Bounces Back With Phase II Amycretin Win

Despite losing out on Metsera , Novo Nordisk nevertheless notched a crucial victory last month as its oral amylin candidate amycretin demonstrated a “competitive” profile in a mid-stage diabetes study.

In a Phase II trial of nearly 450 patients with type 2 diabetes, Novo’s amylin pill led to 7.6% weight loss at 36 weeks as compared with placebo. The subcutaneous injection, meanwhile, cut 11.9% off patients’ body weight. BMO Capital Markets called this efficacy profile “competitive,” noting amycretin’s “potentially differentiated profile” in the increasingly crowded space of oral obesity treatments.

“Importantly, no weight loss plateau was observed in either administration route, suggesting the potential for additional weight loss at longer time points,” BMO added.

Amycretin also elicited a 1.5% decrease in blood glucose levels, as represented by HbA1c at the same time point. A subcutaneous formulation of the drug, meanwhile, elicited a 1.8% HbA1c drop.

Amycretin’s Phase II win helps deliver some vindication for Novo’s obesity franchise, which in recent months has been struggling both clinically and commercially. Its blockbuster drug Wegovy, for instance, has been ceding market share to Lilly’s Zepbound, despite breeching the market first. Novo has blamed compounders for Wegovy’s shaky commercial footing, but analysts are skeptical.

During the company’s first quarter earnings call in May, Peter Verdult of BNP Paribas floated a difficult theory: “Is it really only about the compounders or do we have to consider your nearest branded competitor doing a better job?”

The Danish pharma has also been struggling clinically. In December last year, its next-generation weight-loss therapy CagriSema delivered disappointing outcomes. The asset, which combines semaglutide with amylin analog cagrilintide, met its primary endpoint in the Phase III REDEFINE 1 study, but its 22.7% weight-reduction fell short of investor expectations—which Novo itself set—erasing some $72 billion off the company’s market cap.

Meanwhile, a day before the amycretin readout last month, Novo reported that semaglutide was unable to significantly slow Alzheimer’s disease progression in the Phase III EVOKE and EVOKE+ studies. While expectations for this program had not been high, the data drop still knocked some 10% off Novo’s shares in its aftermath.

BMS/BioNTech Eye PD-1/VEGF Leadership With Geographically Consistent Data

One of the most closely watched—not to mention most clinically promising—trends in cancer today is the rise of PD-1/VEGF inhibition.

Achieved through the use of bispecific antibodies that bind and block both receptors, the PD-1/VEGF approach rose to prominence in September last year, when Summit Therapeutics and its Chinese partner Akeso claimed victory over Merck’s mega-blockbuster Keytruda. In a late-stage non-small cell lung cancer trial, the partners’ ivonescimab achieved nearly 50% better progression-free survival than the cornerstone cancer therapy.

BioNTech jumped into the space a few months later, acquiring Biotheus for up to $950 million and gaining access to its PD-1/VEGF bispecific BNT327. This investment has paid off nicely for BioNTech. In September, the company reported data from a global Phase II trial showing that BNT327, which has since been named pumitamig, given alongside standard chemotherapy, elicited a 76.3% overall response rate (ORR) in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Disease control rate hit 100%.

In a Sept. 8 note, analysts at Truist Securities said that these data were “very reassuring” since they “confirmed the treatment effect seen in China.” Analysts were referring to a Phase II readout from pumitamig in March, which demonstrated a confirmed ORR of 85.4% in Chinese patients. Disease control rate in this trial was 97.9%.

Encouraged by these data, BioNTech has taken pumitamig into late-stage development in the same indication, for which it is running the Phase III ROSETTA-LUNG-01 trial. To establish the antibody’s efficacy across different patient populations, the study is enrolling across different geographies, including the U.S., China, Australia and Korea. ROSETTA-LUNG-01 is set to complete in March 2029.

Aside from performing well in the clinic, pumitamig has also helped BioNTech garner hefty support from the industry’s heavy hitters. In June, Bristol Myers Squibb put more than $11 billion on the line—including $3.5 billion upfront and up to $7.6 billion in milestones—for the right to co-develop and co-commercialize the asset.

Roche Makes Alzheimer’s Comeback With Mid-Stage Win

Neuroscience has classically been a challenging space for biopharma, and 2025 was no different. With many companies posting clinical failures in this space—Roche secured a key victory this year in one of the most intractable indications: Alzheimer’s disease.

At the 2025 Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) meeting earlier this month, the pharma presented data from its ongoing Phase I/II Brainshuttle AD study demonstrating that 92% of patients treated with its next-gen anti-amyloid antibody trontinemab achieved amyloid levels lower than 24-centiloid, a key threshold determining the presence of amyloid plaques on a PET scan. Trontinemab also showed a potential benefit on the tau accumulation in the brain.

As for safety, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities suggestive of brain swelling or bleeding occurred in fewer than 5% of treated patients.

These findings echo an earlier data drop during the 2025 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference (AAIC) in July. In a presentation at the meeting, Roche reported that 91% of trontinemab-treated patients tested negative on a PET scan for amyloid in the brain, while 72% achieved “deep clearance” of amyloid clumps.

Trontinemab represents an Alzheimer’s comeback for Roche. In late 2022, Roche’s gantenerumab, likewise an anti-amyloid antibody failed two Phase III studies, forcing the pharma to pull the plug on the program.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/f718636/2147483647/strip/true/crop/723x407+0+38/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8d%2F8e%2Fe10d9ef44d139846823367d7664c%2Faward.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 04:00:19.495304

Plug Power: Kaufen oder verkaufen?","Einen ordentlichen Abschied in das Wochenende hatte die Aktie der amerikanischen Plug Power geschafft. Die Notierungen sind um 0,3 % gestiegen. Aktuell erreichen sie sogar einen Kurs von 1,99 Euro. Damit steht die Aktie sehr kurz davor, die sehr kritische und prominente Marke von 2 Euro zu überwinden. Im Dollar-Bereich ist die Zahl 2 schon keine Grenze mehr. Es sieht jedenfalls nun deutlich besser aus, so die Meinung von Chartanalysten, als zuletzt.

Gibt es am Wochenende neue Impulse?

Die Frage, die Investoren am Wochenende bewegt: Wie weit kann der Aufwärtslauf noch gehen? Denn am Donnerstag noch war die Aktie mit ca. 1,88 Dollar gehandelt worden. Also deutlich unter der bedeutenden Marke. Die hohen Kursgewinne haben keinen richtigen wirtschaftlichen Hintergrund gehabt, womit durchaus noch etwas Misstrauen herrscht.

Plug Power Aktie Chart

Plug Power konnte damit „nur“ die wichtigen Trend-Indikatoren vom GD100 und GD200 überwinden bzw. verteidigen. Algorithmen werden sich dies ansehen und Schlüsse daraus ziehen. Aber weitere Signale gab es nicht. Immerhin bleibt aber der eine große Auftrag, der zwar nicht in der Königsklasse spielt, aber Aufmerksamkeit erzeugt.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Plug Power?

Die Rede ist von einer Kooperation mit der Nasa, der Weltraumbehörde in den USA. Die möchte Flüssigwasserstoff beziehen. Bei fast 3 Millionen Dollar liegt der Umsatz aus dem Auftrag. Nicht viel aus Sicht des Gesamtumsatzes, aber immerhin eine Botschaft.

Und die sieht noch immer gut aus.

Am Ende aber wird vor allem eine bedeutende Entwicklung zählen: Die außerordentliche Aktionärsversammlung von Mitte Januar ist auf den 29.1. verschoben worden. Dann wird darüber befunden, dass und wie die nächste Kapitalerhöhung stattfindet. Plug Power emittiert neue Aktien. Damit wird der alte Kurs ggf. verwässert. Neue Aktien jedoch gelten als gut für die Finanzierung des Konzerns.

AXA’s share price has lagged peers this year, but Berenberg analysts remain upbeat—citing the French insurer’s steady momentum and new expansion efforts as signs of solid potential for 2025.

What does this mean?

AXA is quietly gaining ground at home, with faster net inflows in its core French life insurance business and improving claims trends adding stability to results. The company’s big move in Italy—its recent Prima acquisition—could also drive fresh direct insurance growth regionally. Berenberg’s analysts expect AXA’s health insurance segment to stage a notable turnaround, predicting a €70 million bump in operating profit (after tax) in the second half of 2025. With AXA sticking to its financial targets and keeping risk exposure in check, Berenberg predicts earnings per share will climb 8% next year—right at the top end of management expectations. The bank highlights AXA’s undervalued share price versus rivals, bolstering its appeal as results season approaches.

Why should I care?

For markets: Consistency puts value back in focus.

Insurance stocks might have disappointed this year, but AXA’s underlying strength stands out. The insurer is forecast to deliver a 9% compound annual growth rate in earnings per share from 2023 to 2026, fueled by solid French inflows and the Prima-driven push in Italy. If these trends hold, AXA’s discounted share price could mark a turning point for sector sentiment.

Following an ambitious transformation under Tata Group, the airline invites passengers to take a second look at what flying with the airline feels like today.

Titled 'Change Is In The Air', the campaign showcases upgraded cabins across all classes, which means better meals, improved in-flight entertainment, warmer hospitality, and a full interior retrofit. Air India says that over 90% of its domestic flights will feature upgraded interiors by end-2026. The five 30-second spots are shot in a slice-of-life style, where passengers interact with these enhanced features.

A passenger in economy expresses her boredom, complaining about having to stare at the clouds for two hours as there's no seatback screen. Her seatmate points out the plethora of films on the airline's Vista Stream entertainment platform, which can be viewed on mobile phones.

The second film shifts to the business cabin, where a father-daughter duo share a tender moment. He gets sentimental when a flight attendant politely serves coffee and cake, watching his daughter sleep soundly.

Even the dreaded middle seat gets its redemption arc. A passenger's mood lifts instantly upon the arrival of his piping hot meal. ""Neither the middle seat nor the meal is a sandwich,"" he quipped.

In the fourth spot, an executive braces himself for a long chat with his boss. The punchline? Those new premium‑economy leather recliners are so comfortable, the boss ends up snoring. Relief for the staffer.

Even while working from the air, a passenger enjoys a fancy multi-course meal that resembles a fine dining spread.

The campaign launches as Air India faces ongoing turbulence, including a recent investigation into its aircraft flying without an airworthiness permit. Still, the ads have taken off online, drawing between 10 and 27 million views each on YouTube at the time of writing.

Digital signage plays a starring role. Until recently, H&M mostly limited its digital presence to a single iconic LED installation. Now, the Dubai Mall flagship integrates multiple floor-to-ceiling LED screens, following a concept similar to rival Zara.

One standout feature: a frosted glass LED wall at the entrance, designed more for ambience than product promotion – a bold move that elevates the store’s aesthetic.

""This is jacking up grocery costs across New York City, Long Island, and across the nation,"" Schumer said Sunday. He claims the pricing tactics could cost certain families as much as $1,200 more per year.

Schumer cited an investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, which found that some grocery prices differed by as much as 23% per item from one Instacart customer to the next.

The magazine says Instacart’s algorithmic pricing experiments were found to be happening through the platform at several of the nation’s biggest grocery retailers, including Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Target.

“Artificial intelligence will decide that shopper #1 pays $10 for those items, and shopper #2 pays $15 for the same exact item,” Schumer explained to reporters. “They're the exact same item at different prices for different consumers all decided by a robot. And the robot looks into, who can afford to pay more? Who can I rip off? Who's less knowledgeable about prices? It's gross,” Schumer said.

According to Consumer Reports, ""Instacart has disclosed its pricing experiments in corporate marketing and investor materials, noting that 'shoppers are not aware that they’re in an experiment.' But the company described the resulting price differences as small and 'negligible.'""

Schumer is calling for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. In response to the magazine's investigation, it says Instacart responded in part by saying it has now stopped its price experiments at two retailers where evidence of such experimentation was found, Costco and Target.

Nvidia plans FP64 comeback following Blackwell’s disappointing HPC results

While Nvidia Blackwell series GPUs have proven highly popular for AI workloads, the supercomputing community is disappointed by their lack of FP64 (double-precision) performance. In fact, Nvidia’s new B300 “Blackwell Ultra” chip practically ignores FP64 with its anaemic 1.2 teraflops of performance. For context, Nvidia’s A100 GPU (from 2020) delivers roughly eight times more FP64 performance than B300. The Hopper H200 delivers over 28x more FP64 performance.

Simply put, HPC customers want boosted performance metrics in the workloads that matter to them. Yes, AI can excel in lower-precision workloads. However, complex simulations require more accurate calculations. This is why FP64 is important for supercomputing workloads, as accuracy matters.

(Performance of recent Nvidia GPUs – via HPCWire)

Nvidia plans to fix its FP64 problem

With its B300 GPU, Nvidia has ignored customers seeking enhanced FP64 performance. However, Nvidia’s Dion Harris has confirmed that the company plans to add more FP64 capabilities to its future architectures.

NVIDIA’s recent focus has been on AI, which thrives on low-precision calculations. With its Hopper and Blackwell architectures, Nvidia delivered its most significant performance gains using lower-precision FP8 and FP4 Tensor operations. In other words, Nvidia boosted its performance using less accurate math.

We are definitely looking to bring some additional capabilities in our future gen architectures. We are very serious about making sure that we can deliver the required performance to power those simulation workloads, which we think will ultimately be a key driver to implementing…those AI-based approaches as well, because you need core simulation as a part of that work.

– Dion Harris, Nvidia’s senior director of HPC and AI hyperscale infrastructure solutions

When it comes to climate modelling, computational fluid dynamics, and material science, there is no replacement for raw FP64 power. If Nvidia fails to deliver increased FP64 throughput, scientists will need to find other ways to get the accurate results they want using Nvidia hardware. This includes FP64 emulation using tensor cores. Alternatively, they will find hardware from an alternative provider that delivers the FP64 performance they want.",https://media.overclock3d.net/2025/12/Nvidia.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 20:00:15.974874

A Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (No. 2023079368801) describes FINRA’s disciplinary action against Mr. Routie. Filed in December 2025, it states that the matter arose from FINRA’s investigation into whether he “borrowed money from customers.” As part of this investigation, FIRNA sent him a request to provide on-the-record testimony. Some weeks later, according to the letter, he indicated to FINRA via counsel that he had received the request but would not appear for the requested testimony.

FINRA found that Mr. Routie’s refusal violated FINRA Rule 8210. Under this rule, FINRA may require any person under its jurisdiction to “to provide information orally … and to testify at a location specified by FINRA staff, under oath or affirmation administered by a court reporter or a notary public if requested, with respect to any matter” connected with its investigation. The rule states further that persons under FINRA jurisdiction may not fail to provide the requested information. As the letter notes, violations of Rule 8210 are also considered violations of Rule 2010, under which persons associated with FINRA members must “observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade” while performing their business. As a result of these findings, FINRA barred Mr. Routie from associating with any FINRA member in all capacities.

In addition to describing the enforcement action against Mr. Routie, the Letter states that in July 2023, Ameriprise disclosed his resignation from the firm. More specifically, the firm disclosed to FINRA that he had filed his resignation “while under review for potential violations of company policy, including texting with a client.”

According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Richard Routie holds 18 years of securities industry experience. Most recently based in Orlando, Florida, he was last registered as a broker with Cetera Financial Specialists from 2023 until 2025. His registration history includes Ameriprise Financial Services, Chase Investment Services, Edward Jones, and PFS Investments. His credentials include the passage of six securities industry qualifying exams: the Securities Industry Essentials Examination, or SIE; the Uniform Combined State Law Examination, or Series 66; the Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination, or Series 63; the General Securities Representative Examination, or Series 7; the Investment Company Products/Variable Contracts Representative Examination, or Series 6; and the Investment Company Products/Variable Contracts Principal Examination, or Series 26.

That combination signals where the next stage of growth for brokers with a crypto angle is meant to come from.

Instead of filing a fresh license application from the US and waiting in line, Robinhood is buying its way into Indonesia’s regulatory perimeter. Buana Capital gives it a conventional securities license and a seat in the domestic stock market.

Pedagang Aset Kripto is already within the country’s current crypto regime as one of the supervised digital financial asset traders.

The company is also keeping majority owner Pieter Tanuri on as a strategic adviser, which means the foreign entrant arrives not just with paperwork but also with local relationships and context.

For a company that has already had long conversations with regulators in the UK and Europe, walking into Jakarta backed by a pair of approved entities and a local fixer is a deliberate choice, not a quirk of deal flow.

Buying a regulatory foothold in Indonesia

Indonesia is attractive because its core ingredients align almost perfectly with Robinhood’s design.

The country has a young population that lives on Android phones and treats the brokerage app as another social icon.

Equity investing has become part of everyday financial life for millions of people, helped by low minimums and highly online marketing. Crypto arrived on the same rails but moved even faster.

Penetration for digital assets now sits close to equity penetration, which is not a sentence you can write about many developed markets.

For an app that wants users to think of stocks and tokens as tiles on one dashboard, this is precisely the kind of market you want to wire in.

The rulebook has also moved in a direction that suits global brokers. For years, Indonesian crypto trading sat under Bappebti, the commodity futures regulator, which treated cryptocurrencies as any other asset.

Legislators then decided that the line between crypto and finance had blurred enough to warrant a more familiar framework and placed responsibility on Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, the financial services authority.

OJK has since drawn a clean map: one licensed crypto exchange, a central clearing and settlement house, a dedicated custodian, and a whitelist of assets that can trade on these venues.

It talks about digital assets using the same language it uses for other financial products, which means the expectations around segregation, custody, disclosure, and cybersecurity are the same as in the rest of the system.

Against that backdrop, buying a local broker and a local crypto trader is not just for speed. It is also a way to inherit teams that already live inside that system.

Robinhood still has to pass fit-and-proper checks and convince the OJK that it will not turn the retail market into a casino. Still, it no longer has to argue over whether its business model belongs within the perimeter at all.

The Indonesian licenses then sit neatly alongside the Bitstamp license in Singapore, which Robinhood picked up earlier in the year, to form a regional triangle: a crypto venue in a financial hub, a domestic brokerage, and a domestic crypto trader, all feeding into the same global app.

Once that plumbing is in place, the company can do what it already knows how to do: pipe US equities and options into a new audience, wrap them in a familiar mobile interface, and cross-sell between local and international markets.

Robinhood's Indonesia bet is a template, not an exception

Once you zoom out from Jakarta, the deal starts to look less like an isolated adventure and more like the draft of a playbook.

The countries that dominate crypto adoption charts these days are not your usual financial centers. India, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Brazil all sit near the top of grassroots usage rankings, with Nigeria, Indonesia, and the Philippines in the next bracket.

These are places where young populations live largely on mobile, where inflation or currency depreciation shapes how people think about savings, and where cross-border money is a normal part of family life.

That last point matters a lot to brokers because it makes stablecoins, dollar access, and FX rails more than just speculative tools.

In that environment, the old idea of “build first, license later” looks less attractive.

Regulators in these markets have already spent years dealing with local exchanges, peer-to-peer platforms, and the fallout from global blowups. They have learned, sometimes the hard way, what happens when platforms handle customer funds poorly or treat leverage as a marketing tool.

Most now keep a formal list of approved service providers and have no shortage of domestic players queuing up to join it.

For a foreign broker with shareholders watching the calendar, buying one of those companies beats waiting for a fresh application to crawl through the system.

You are still subject to local scrutiny, and you may inherit creaky back-office systems and legacy tech debt, but the core question of whether you belong in the market has already been answered.

The trade-offs are real. Small local shops often run on systems held together by habit and a few key staff. Hence, the buyer has to choose between slow, careful modernization and a faster rebuild that risks losing the institutional memory it just paid for.

Local relationships with banks, tax offices, and advertising regulators are often informal and personal, which makes staff retention more important than the headline customer count in an investor presentation.

Political sensitivities also loom large. Whenever a foreign broker arrives and starts pulling order flow, some part of the domestic industry will complain about capital leaving the country or young investors being targeted by outsiders, even when the foreign firm is operating under exactly the same rulebook.

The new map of crypto growth

What gives the Robinhood deal broader weight is what it says about the geography of crypto trading in the next few years.

For a long time, trading was concentrated in the US and a few Western European hubs. That era is fading as regulators in big economies tighten the screws and push more activity onshore.

The growth story now tilts toward countries that combine clear, if strict, licensing regimes with large pools of retail users who do not remember or do not know what finance looked like before smartphones.

Indonesia fits that profile neatly. So do Brazil, the Philippines, Nigeria, and Pakistan, though each has its own quirks.

For brokers and exchanges, this is less about chasing a single hot market and more about learning how to read a standard set of signals.

You watch for a regulator that has moved from blanket warnings to detailed supervision of digital assets. You look for mobile penetration that turns a new app into an overnight distribution channel.

You check adoption indexes and local exchange volumes to see whether people are already using crypto to solve daily problems rather than to punt on price.

When those boxes line up, the question is not whether someone will move in, but who will be first to find a willing license seller and stitch that license into a global stack.

Indonesia’s role in this story is to make that process concrete.

A US retail broker that grew up on meme stocks is now buying a small Jakarta broker and a local crypto trader, linking them to a Singapore crypto platform it already owns, and presenting the whole bundle through a single global app.

The deal shows how quickly a foreign firm can go from having zero standing in a market to sitting at the center of its retail investing experience, provided it is willing to pay for the right pieces of paper and do the integration work.

It also hints at what the next wave of press releases from Lagos, Karachi, or Manila will look like.

The names and acronyms will change, but the structure will feel familiar: local licenses, mobile-first users, and a foreign broker betting that this is where the real growth in crypto trading lives now.",https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/robinhood-indonesia_.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 16:00:49.558374

Underweighting U.S. large caps and overweighting defensive, mid-cap, and international equities led to underperformance during a momentum-driven rally favoring mega-cap tech.

I trimmed allocations to higher-beta equities and rotated into U.S. large caps, developed-market international equities, and short-term bonds for better risk-adjusted returns.

Overweights in real assets, particularly metals and mining, equities relative to bonds, and emerging-market debt provided positive contributions to returns.

Catherine Howard, a lawyer brought in to overhaul the rules governing development and building, will leave on Jan 1.

She is understood to have advised the Chancellor not to immediately push through radical reforms.

Labour has pledged to build 1.5 million new homes and is relaxing planning regulations to make this easier, and to encourage more infrastructure projects.

But there are disagreements in Government over how far to take the deregulation.

Some officials have warned that the proposals could damage EU relations and 30 Labour MPs have written to the Prime Minister to urge him to abandon some of his more radical reforms.

Recent months have been turbulent in Downing Street, with the departure of a number of senior communications staff.

Ms Howard’s contract comes to an end at the start of January, but it is understood she had been asked to stay indefinitely.

She will instead return to her role as a partner at Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer, the private law firm.

While in Government she is understood to have disagreed with Sir Keir Starmer’s announcement that he would fully adopt the recommendations of a review into speeding up the construction of nuclear power stations.

Ms Howard said: “Over the past four months I have thoroughly enjoyed my time as the Chancellor’s infrastructure and planning adviser, and in my time have had the ability to advise HM Treasury and help steer the important steps the Government is taking to improve the planning system to support economic growth.

“I look forward to continuing my engagement with HM Treasury and Government as I return to the private sector.”

Economy shrinks 0.1pc

Despite the push for growth being at the top of the Government’s agenda, figures released on Friday showed the economy shrank 0.1 per cent in the three months to October.

Ms Howard was appointed in September to advise the Chancellor on planning changes leading up to the Budget, in a move welcomed by senior government officials and some Labour MPs.

Chris Curtis, co-chairman of the Labour Growth Group, said at the time she would be an “exceptional addition” to the Treasury.

Mr Curtis told The Guardian: “Catherine has made a major contribution during her time at the Treasury, not least in ensuring the largest changes to planning in a generation will soon be passed into law. Her expertise has been a great asset to Government.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/12/14/TELEMMGLPICT000438294491_17657264785750_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnxsVzbFt55yT5iapkHrLYfykPd8sp5D6i9gcZuZ6PU4.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-12-14 16:00:40.631541

Its real impact is operational, not regulatory, marking a move toward unified GPU observability as AI deployments scale globally.","First look: Nvidia has rolled out a new GPU fleet management platform aimed at giving data center operators real-time visibility into sprawling AI infrastructure. The system pulls telemetry from globally distributed deployments into Nvidia's NGC cloud platform, surfacing everything from hardware health and energy efficiency to the physical location of GPUs currently in operation.

The software relies on a customer-managed agent installed within each environment. That agent collects detailed system data and sends it to a centralized dashboard hosted on NGC. From there, operators can examine performance at multiple layers: a global view of all deployed hardware, compute zones corresponding to individual on-premises or cloud sites, and granular, node-by-node breakdowns.

The resulting data not only provides inventory and usage summaries but can pinpoint where each GPU is physically operating – functionality that may discourage smuggling or unauthorized exports of restricted AI processors.

Nvidia emphasizes that the software is strictly a monitoring layer. It has no ability to disable GPUs or remotely alter their behavior, a design choice meant to head off concerns about backdoors or manufacturer-controlled kill switches. In practical terms, Nvidia can see if its chips appear in regions where they are not permitted, but it lacks any technical mechanism to deactivate them. The company says the platform is open source, installed and managed by customers, and fully auditable.

Telemetry within the system also supports performance analysis. The platform tracks power behavior, including short-lived load spikes, allowing operators to stay within power budgets while fine-tuning energy efficiency.

It also captures GPU utilization, memory bandwidth usage, and interconnect performance across multi-node clusters. Taken together, these signals can expose subtle inefficiencies, such as bandwidth saturation or degraded links that can quietly undermine performance during large-scale training or inference workloads.

Thermal management is another focal point. The monitoring agent detects heat concentration and airflow irregularities that can signal insufficient cooling in dense server configurations. Early detection of these thermal imbalances enables corrective action before throttling or component aging occurs, issues that can shorten hardware lifespan and reduce throughput in GPU-heavy racks.

The platform also checks for consistency across distributed systems. It verifies that servers are running identical software stacks, driver versions, and configuration settings.

While the new system extends Nvidia's data center management portfolio, it does not replace existing tools. Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM) remains available for local, low-level diagnostics, though it lacks centralized visualization and typically requires custom integration.

Nvidia's Base Command platform, meanwhile, operates at a different layer entirely, handling AI job scheduling, dataset organization, and workflow orchestration. Together, the three services form a complete system that spans every layer of GPU management: DCGM provides node-level telemetry, Base Command governs workloads, and the new fleet-monitoring software bridges them with fleet-scale visibility across on-premises and cloud deployments.

The opt-in nature of the platform means it is unlikely to function as a meaningful anti-smuggling control, since operators can simply decline to participate. Its real impact is operational, not regulatory, marking a move toward unified GPU observability as AI deployments scale globally.",https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2025/12/2025-12-14-image-3.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 18:00:06.263325

Divergent Moves by Major Investors

The institutional landscape shows notable repositioning. Several large funds adjusted their holdings downward in the second quarter. Liontrust sold 39,198 shares (-5.2%), reducing its position to 708,300 shares (valued at roughly $119.15 million). Holocene Advisors decreased its stake by 89,689 shares (-6.7%), now holding 1,243,607 shares (approx. $209.2 million).

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Masimo?

Conversely, other institutions increased their exposure. 4D Advisors boosted its position by 50%, acquiring shares to reach a total of 45,000. Geode Capital Management grew its holding by 6.2%, accumulating 896,418 shares. These contrasting moves highlight an active reassessment of the stock within major investment portfolios.

Analyst Ratings and Valuation Considerations

Market expert opinions remain divided. The current analyst consensus comprises four ""Buy"" ratings, three ""Hold"" recommendations, and one ""Sell"" call. The average price target stands at $189.40, with a range from $162.00 to $210.00. This suggests a potential upside from the recent trading price near $138.34.

However, the stock's price-to-sales ratio appears elevated relative to broader market benchmarks, introducing a note of valuation caution. The overall picture is therefore mixed: robust operational metrics are balanced against a valuation that already incorporates significant expectations.

Final Assessment

Masimo's confirmed 2025 targets provide a clear benchmark. For the shares to experience a positive re-rating, the company must successfully achieve its guided revenue and earnings ranges while continuing its momentum in contract wins and margin expansion. A failure to meet these operational milestones would likely prompt a thorough review of its current market valuation.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2407153_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 14:00:09.769089

For The Tribune

December is a big month for first-graders at Hayden Elementary School in Jennings County.

Every day of the month, teacher Corey Baughman, a Vallonia native, wears a different zany suit — emblazoned with festive snowmen, Santas, candy canes, mittens, the Grinch. “The kids are so excited to see the next one,” he says. This week, he appeared on Good Morning America to talk about his holiday tradition, saying he likes to “be the light in someone’s day.”

Baughman has a suit for every season, in fact. There’s a turkey suit for Thanksgiving, a red-and-white heart suit for Valentine’s Day, a shamrock suit for St. Patrick’s Day, a tulip suit for spring. To name just a few. There are 60 suits in all.

“I keep them in the basement,” Baughman says with a laugh. At 56 years old, he has been teaching first-graders at Hayden for more than three decades. The suit extravaganza started when he and his mom were doing some Christmas shopping at Macy’s years ago, and she spotted a bonkers holiday suit splashed with wreaths, bells, elves, and a fringe lampshade with legs. “I said, ‘Mom, those kids would go crazy for that.’”

Indeed they did. “They were so excited,” he says, that it became clear he needed more. He found oodles of suits for sale online from a company called OppoSuits. (“Why should suits be boring?” the site asks.) Now his wardrobe boasts a Star Wars suit, a Spider Man suit, a suit splattered with math equations.

It’s one of many projects Baughman has brought to his students over the years, all on his own dime. In another favorite project, the kids got to watch baby quail hatch from their eggs. “Oh, it’s unreal,” he says, describing the excitement when the students see the birds begin to poke their little heads out. “I mean, it’s just unreal to see the kids’ faces when the eggs start shaking in the incubator. It’s crazy.” The mere ordering of the eggs from Amazon gets the kids pumped: “They get excited just for the eggs!”

Baughman devotes himself to the students, writing individual notes to them before the first day of class, making personalized Valentine’s Day cards for each one of them, keeping in touch with them long after they leave his classroom. “Well, listen to this one,” he says, recounting a recent experience. “A month ago, I went to a wedding — and the couple had met in my first-grade classroom. Is that wild? It was so good for me because it was like a class reunion; a lot of my kids were there.”

Baughman, who lives in Vallonia where he grew up, says he knew he wanted to become a teacher from the time he was 16. “It’s a funny story,” he says, recalling a long-ago high-school summer when he served as a lifeguard at Starve Hollow Lake, a state recreation area that had a busy beach full of kids at the time. “I was low man on the totem pole when I was first hired,” he says. “We offered swim lessons, and nobody wanted the little kids. So I had to take them because I was low man. And it turned out, I just loved it.”

He got a bachelor’s and master’s degree in elementary education at Hanover College and has been teaching at Hayden ever since, entertaining students with his antics — including jumping into a swimming pool fully clothed, holding a sign saying, “Jump into first grade!” (And wearing a T-shirt proclaiming: “I’m the crazy teacher everyone warned you about.”)

To be sure, there are many challenges that come with the job, including a lack of resources for teachers, social hurdles for kids in the years after Covid, students whose families struggle financially. Baughman, who launched a program to make sure everyone gets a school breakfast, serves as a supportive and encouraging presence in the lives of the kids, inspiring them to channel their energy into interesting projects — like creating their own little world in a canning jar, filling it with favorite things, from smooth pebbles to toy trucks. Over the years, his students have also enjoyed an aviary filled with finches, as well the classroom’s own baby bunny. The rabbit was especially loved. “She was only supposed to last three to five years,” Baughman says. “She lasted 12.”

Despite the challenges — and the fact that Baughman is now eligible for his full pension — he’s not quite ready to retire. Not when there are so many suits to be worn.

As a result, several large Chinese technology firms have already approached the company about placing sizable orders. These include Alibaba Group (BABA) and ByteDance, according to Reuters sources. Demand has been strong enough that Nvidia is now reviewing whether it can add capacity without disrupting supply to U.S. customers.

At the same time, Nvidia said it is managing its supply chain to ensure licensed sales to China do not affect deliveries elsewhere. However, supply remains tight, since the company is focused on newer chip lines and has limited H200 output today.

China Balances Access With Local Goals

Meanwhile, China has not yet approved the import of the H200. Officials held emergency talks this week to assess whether allowing the chip into the country could slow the growth of local chip makers. Domestic alternatives still lag the H200 in performance.

Because of this gap, many Chinese cloud firms and enterprise buyers are pressing for approval. They argue that demand for advanced computing already exceeds what local suppliers can deliver. Still, officials are considering conditions, including proposals that would require buyers to also purchase a set share of domestic chips alongside any H200 orders.

For Nvidia, the situation presents both opportunities and limits. China remains one of the largest sources of demand for advanced computing. However, adding capacity is not simple, since the H200 is made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) on advanced nodes that are already in high demand from global customers.

Overall, the situation shows how strong global demand remains for Nvidia chips, even for models that are no longer the newest. It also highlights how trade policy is shifting toward managed access rather than outright bans, with cost and control built into each deal.

Is NVDA Stock a Buy?

On the Street, Nvidia continues to hold the analysts’ backing with a Strong Buy consensus. The average NVDA stock price target is $258.45, pointing to a 47.67% upside from the current price.

It means City sign off for 2025 in the WSL with ten wins and a six-point cushion at the league’s summit.

What happened

City were looking to end 2025 on a high in the WSL, but knew we’d be tested by a well-drilled Villa side, and the visitors had the better of the game in the early stages.

Rachel Daly was inches from tapping home a dangerous ball across the face of the City goal inside five minutes, before strong calls for a penalty were waved away after a tangle between Chastity Grant and Rebecca Knaak.

But City sprung into life midway through the half, with Sabrina D’Angelo palming away a vicious Shaw effort around 25 minutes.

There was nothing she could do about the opener though, with Miedema’s teasing ball across goal met by Shaw, who confidently side-footed into the far corner.

A goal created by the WSL’s all-time leading scorer and put away by the first player to score 100 for the Club.

But Shaw wasn’t done there, and she doubled her tally for the afternoon in typically emphatic fashion.

Picking up play from Yui Hasegawa, the Jamaican cut the ball back onto her right foot and curled an unstoppable drive through a crowd of bodies and into the far corner in first half stoppage time.

City continued to push for a third, with D’Angelo saving brilliantly from Lauren Hemp and Shaw inside 10 minutes of the restart before an offside flag denied Miedema when she put the ball home on the hour, but number three followed on the hour.

Miedema grabbed her second assist of the game with an exquisite ball in behind to Fujino, with the winger racing into the area and rifling home to put the game out of sight.

Villa pulled one back with 20 to play when Parker rose highest to head home from a corner, but City responded inside three minutes when Miedema was in the right place at the right time to tap home Fujino’s cross.

But on a special afternoon for the Jamaican, it was Shaw who had the final say as she raced through and confidently stroked home to complete her treble late on.

She then added a fourth and final goal to her tally in stoppage time, guiding home Grace Clinton’s effort through a crowd of bodies to make it six.

Shaw’s special century

There’d been a lot of talk about Shaw’s rapidly approaching 100-goal milestone, and the Jamaican achieved it in style.

She’s now on 12 for the season in the WSL and once again leads the scoring charts as she chases a third successive Golden Boot.

Casparij makes 100 appearances

Bunny wasn’t the only player celebrating a special milestone, as Kerstin Casparij became the latest City star to make a century of appearances.

The Dutch international has led the team admirably in the absence of Alex Greenwood, and was given a deservedly raucous reception by the City fans when her name was announced.

Ten in a row

City have now won ten WSL matches in a row, and are unbeaten in 13 in all competitions.

We go into the winter break with a six-point cushion on second-placed Chelsea as the league’s highest scorers.

A special way to end 2025 in the WSL!

AI image generators are getting way better at creating realistic fakes, partly thanks to a surprising new development: making image quality a little bit worse.
Some AI images still look that way, but there’s a new trend toward actual realism that tones down the gloss.
And it appears to be on the way — but it’s not coming as fast as the AI image models are improving.
By the way Google’s Pixel 10 cameras don’t just offer AI image editing tools — there’s a generative AI model baked right into the imaging pipeline.","This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on smartphones and digital imagery — real or otherwise — follow Allison Johnson. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

How it started

Remember the early days of AI image generation? Oh how we laughed when our prompts resulted in people with too many fingers, rubbery limbs, and other details easily pointing to fakes. But if you haven’t been keeping up, I regret to inform you that the joke is over. AI image generators are getting way better at creating realistic fakes, partly thanks to a surprising new development: making image quality a little bit worse.

If you can believe it, OpenAI debuted its image generation tool DALL-E a little less than five years ago. In its first iteration, it could only generate 256 x 256 pixel images; tiny thumbnails, basically. A year later, DALL-E 2 debuted as a huge leap forward. Images were 1024 x 1024, and surprisingly real-looking. But there were always tells.

In Casey Newton’s hands-on with DALL-E 2 just after it launched in beta, he included an image made from his prompt: “A shiba inu dog dressed as a firefighter.” It’s not bad, and it might fool you if you saw it at a glance. But the contours of the dog’s fur are fuzzy, the patch on its (adorable little) coat is just some nonsense scribbles, and there’s a weird, chunky collar tag hanging to the side of the dog’s neck that doesn’t belong there. The cinnamon rolls with eyes from the same article were easier to believe.

Midjourney and Stable Diffusion also came to prominence around this time, embraced by AI artists and people with, uh, less savory designs. New, better models emerged over the next couple of years, minimizing the flaws and adding the ability to render text somewhat more accurately. But most AI generated images still carried a certain look: a little too smooth and perfect, with a kind of glow you’d associate with a stylized portrait more than a candid photo. Some AI images still look that way, but there’s a new trend toward actual realism that tones down the gloss.

How it’s going

OpenAI is a relative newcomer in the tech world when you compare it to the likes of Google and Meta, but those established companies haven’t been standing still as AI ascends. In the latter half of 2025, Google released a new image model in its Gemini app called Nano Banana. It went viral when people started using it to make realistic figurines of themselves. My colleague Robert Hart tried out the trend and noticed something interesting: the model preserved his actual likeness more faithfully than other AI tools.

That’s the thing about AI images: they often tend toward a neutral, bland middle ground. Your request for an image of a table will look basically right, but it will also feel like the result of a computer averaging out every table it’s ever seen into something lacking any actual character. The things that make an image of a table look like the real thing — or a reproduction of your own facial features — are actually imperfections. I don’t mean the bizarre artifacts of AI trying to understand letters of the alphabet. I mean a little clutter, messiness, and lighting that’s less than ideal. And lately, that also means imitating the imperfections of our most popular cameras.

Google updated its image model less than a month ago, touting Nano Banana Pro as its most advanced and realistic model yet. It’s able to draw from real-world knowledge and render text better, but the thing I find most interesting is that it often mimics the look of a photo taken with a phone camera. Contrast (or lack thereof), perspective, aggressive sharpening, exposure choices — so many of the images this model generated for me bear the hallmarks of phone camera systems.

Whether you’re aware of it or not, you’re probably attuned to this look, too. The small sensors and lenses in our phones use multiframe processing to overcome their limitations compared to a bigger camera, and these photos are optimized for viewing on a smaller screen. Altogether, that means phone photos have a certain “look” compared to a more artistic representation of a scene — boosting shadows to reveal more details and cranking up sharpness to make subjects pop. Apparently, Google’s image generator has absorbed this style, too.

Google isn’t alone in offering a more realistic look to generated images. Adobe’s Firefly image generator has a control labeled “Visual Intensity” that lets you tone down the glowy AI look. The results look less pristine and more like they were captured with a real camera — maybe more of a professional camera than a phone camera, which makes sense given Adobe’s target audience of professionals. But even Meta’s AI generator has a slider for “Stylization,” which dials the realism up or down accordingly. Elsewhere, video generation tools like OpenAI’s Sora 2 and Google’s Veo 3 have been used to create viral clips mimicking the low-resolution, grainy visuals of security cameras. When the AI only has to be as good as a CCTV, it can be pretty convincing.

What happens next

There are a lot of good reasons to treat claims of AI’s infinite potential for improvement with skepticism. AI agents still struggle at buying you a pair of shoes. But the imaging models? They have vastly improved, and the evidence is in front of our eyes.

I recently spoke to Ben Sandofsky, one of the cofounders of the popular iPhone camera app Halide, about the AI-imitating-smartphones trend recently. He says that by embracing the strong processing tendencies and familiarity of phone camera photos, which already make our photos look a little untethered from reality, “Google might have sidestepped around the uncanny valley.” AI doesn’t have to make a scene look realistic — in a way, that’s a dead giveaway. It just has to mimic the way we record reality, with all its flaws, and use it as a kind of cheat code to make an image look believable. So how do we believe any photo that we see?

There’s the Sam Altman view, that real imagery and AI imagery will blend together in the future, and we’ll just be fine with that. I think he’s partially right, but I have a hard time believing that we won’t really care what’s real and what’s not. And in order to sort the two out for ourselves, we’re going to need some help. And it appears to be on the way — but it’s not coming as fast as the AI image models are improving.

The C2PA’s Content Credentials standard is gaining some much-needed momentum. On Google’s Pixel 10 series phones, every image taken with the camera gets a cryptographic signature identifying how it was made. This avoids the “implied truth effect,” as Pixel camera head Isaac Reynolds explained to me earlier this year. If you only label AI-generated images as AI, then we assume that everything without a label is real. Actually, though, the lack of a label only means that we don’t know where the image came from. So the Pixel camera labels both AI and non-AI images alike.

Labels are all well and good, but they’re not useful if you can’t see them. That’s starting to change, and earlier this year Google Photos added support for displaying Content Credentials. The company will also make Content Credentials easy to view in search results and ads when they’re present. That last part is the key, though — right now, most images captured with phone cameras today aren’t assigned credentials. For the system to work, hardware makers need to adopt the standard so that images are marked as AI or not at the point when they’re created. The platforms where images are shared need to get on board, too. Until that happens, we’re on our own — and it’s a better time than ever to trust nothing that you see.

By the way

Google’s Pixel 10 cameras don’t just offer AI image editing tools — there’s a generative AI model baked right into the imaging pipeline. It’s only used in a feature called Pro Res Zoom, and it aims to improve on what would otherwise be pretty crappy digital zoom image quality. It doesn’t work on people for now, which is a good thing in my book.

Traditional camera makers are adopting C2PA’s Content Credentials as well, albeit slowly, like the $9,000+ Leica M-11P.

Meanwhile, AI-powered editing tools in Photoshop like generative fill have become more powerful and popular with photographers. There’s a middle ground between fully AI-generated images and photos untouched by AI that’s getting trickier to define.

Summary

NVIDIA is the premier AI semiconductor holding, delivering superior risk-adjusted returns and a robust alpha that justifies its premium valuation.

NVDA's dominance is underpinned by its high R-squared (0.72), strong revenue elasticity, and lower sensitivity to sector and macro headwinds versus AMD.

AMD offers high convexity and asymmetric upside, trading at a discount (P/S 10.75x) and presenting a contrarian opportunity for risk-tolerant investors.

I recommend buying and holding NVDA for core AI exposure, with AMD as a high-volatility, value-rerating complement for aggressive portfolios.

Setting The Stage

In the high-paced world of semiconductors, two key players stand out: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), each of them competing for supremacy in

Quick Insights

NVDA generates roughly twice the annualized alpha of AMD (0.018 vs. 0.009), translating to about 24% versus 11% excess returns, with lower volatility and stronger market confidence.

AMD has higher SOX beta (1.68 vs. NVDA's 1.42) and greater negative sensitivity to interest rates, implying higher drawdowns but also greater upside in favorable environments.

NVDA should be the core AI semiconductor holding for long-term investors, while AMD offers high-volatility, high-convexity upside for those seeking value rerating and can tolerate greater risk.

🌎 The SEC is ""mobilizing"" to become the crypto capital of the globe, SEC Chair Paul Atkins told Fox News on Thursday.
The charters allow digital-asset companies to custody assets and offer banking services under a single federal standard, eliminating the need to navigate state-by-state regulations.","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fresh guidance urging retail investors to understand the risks and options before storing digital assets, just as federal regulators advance a historic shift toward integrating crypto into the traditional banking system.

The advisory comes amid a broader regulatory realignment that has seen the agency drop enforcement cases, approve tokenization pilots, and clear crypto firms for national bank charters.

The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Assistance released an investor bulletin outlining the mechanics of crypto asset custody and the trade-offs between self-managed wallets and third-party custodians.

The guidance defines custody as the method through which investors store and access private keys, the passcodes that authorize transactions and prove ownership of digital assets.

It warns that losing a private key results in permanent loss of access, while compromised keys can lead to theft with no recourse.

Curious about crypto wallets and how to store and access crypto assets? Check out our Crypto Asset Custody Basics Investor Bulletin. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) Hot Wallets, Cold Storage, and the Security Spectrum

The bulletin distinguishes between hot wallets, which remain connected to the internet for convenience, and cold wallets, which use physical devices like USB drives or paper backups to stay offline.

Hot wallets expose users to cyber threats but enable faster transactions, while cold wallets offer stronger protection against hacking at the cost of portability and ease of use.

The SEC notes that physical cold storage devices can be lost, damaged, or stolen, creating additional risks that may still result in permanent asset loss.

Investors choosing self-custody control their own private keys and bear full responsibility for security, backup procedures, and technical setup.

Those opting for third-party custodians must research how providers safeguard assets, whether they use hot or cold storage, and whether they engage in practices such as rehypothecation or asset commingling.

The bulletin urges investors to confirm whether custodians provide insurance, how they respond to bankruptcy or hacks, and what fees they charge for transactions and transfers.Regulatory Shift Accelerates as Crypto Enters the Banking System

The custody guidance arrives as the SEC pivots from enforcement-led oversight to policy development under Chair Paul Atkins, who told Fox News in August that the agency is “mobilizing” to make the US the global crypto capital.

Atkins said divisions across the SEC are now focused on building a regulatory framework that supports innovation while protecting investors, marking a sharp departure from the litigation-heavy approach that defined the previous administration.

That shift has already produced tangible results. The agency closed its multi-year investigation into Ondo Finance without charges this week, signaling greater tolerance for tokenized real-world assets.

🌎 The SEC is ""mobilizing"" to become the crypto capital of the globe, SEC Chair Paul Atkins told Fox News on Thursday. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews)

Days earlier, the SEC granted the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation a rare no-action letter allowing it to tokenize US Treasuries, ETFs, and Russell 1000 components starting in late 2026.

The DTCC said tokenized securities will carry the same ownership rights and investor protections as traditional instruments, bridging legacy infrastructure with blockchain-based settlement.

Meanwhile, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency conditionally approved five crypto firms, including Circle, Ripple, BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos, to launch or convert into national trust banks.

The charters allow digital-asset companies to custody assets and offer banking services under a single federal standard, eliminating the need to navigate state-by-state regulations.

Paxos received explicit permission to issue stablecoins under federal oversight, while Ripple’s charter excludes RLUSD issuance through the bank.

OCC head Jonathan Gould said the approvals ensure the federal banking system “keeps pace with the evolution of finance,” dismissing concerns from traditional banks that the agency lacks supervisory capacity for crypto-native firms.

He noted that the OCC has supervised a crypto-focused national trust bank for years and receives daily inquiries from existing banks about innovative product launches.

The regulatory momentum extends beyond custody and charters. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission launched a pilot program allowing Bitcoin, Ether, and USDC as collateral in derivatives markets, while the OCC found that nine major US banks imposed “inappropriate” restrictions on lawful crypto businesses between 2020 and 2023.

“When we talk about regulation in the taxi industry, we basically talk about the early industry problems coming from 100 years ago,” Cetin said.
Effects on drivers Taxi drivers in Las Vegas describe the first days of ride-sharing as strange and a bit tenuous.
The competitors are cutting into the pie of the Las Vegas transportation, according to Szcygielski, leaving fewer options for drivers.","In 1992, Mike Bailin was 29 years old working four jobs — busboy, cleaner at a gym, paper deliveryman and print shop assistant — while barely making ends meet. Then, he saw an ad in the classified section of the newspaper for a taxi driver job.

“It changed our whole life,” Bailin said, whose wife and four kids all went on to get advanced degrees. “I was supporting a family of six on what I was making as a cab driver.”

Today, Bailin, general manager for Yellow Checker Star Transportation, says his story is not as common. He said many of his drivers are part-time workers. Some might be working more hours to make up for lost revenue.

Since rideshares were introduced to Las Vegas in 2014, the taxicab industry in the city has lost its power to companies such as Lyft and Uber and cab rides have been cut in half. Economists say the decline is due to an overregulated industry that was unable to pivot when met with a newer, more nimble outside competitor.

Despite setbacks, cab drivers say they’ve managed to adjust in the face of a changing transportation landscape. Some of them are worried about what’s next — declining tourism and autonomous vehicles.

Industry regulation

Judd Cramer, a lecturer at Harvard University who has studied the effects of rideshare on cities, said companies such as Uber and Lyft were not bound by the rules that taxis had to follow.

“Uber and Lyft just came in and sidestepped the regulations,” Cramer said in an interview. Uber and Lyft were not legal at first, but Cramer said this was not a deterrent.

“The theory was, ‘We can offer such a good product to the consumer that even if it’s illegal, they’re going to lobby for these things to be legal,’” Cramer said. “Also, it will make a lot of money.”

On the other hand, taxi vehicles and companies were strictly regulated. Due to the violent “taxi wars” of the 1960s, Las Vegas established the Nevada Taxicab Authority (TCA) in 1969. The authority was seen as a necessary governing body to curb infighting among cab companies and drivers, car burnings, violence, poorly maintained cars and uninsured vehicles. According to Bailin, it was an attempt to ensure that “everyone’s playing by the same rules.”

Uber unofficially launched in Vegas in October 2014 but was subsequently shut down a month later from operating in the city by a court injunction. Thousands of people signed a petition to lift the order, with a letter urging then Gov. Brian Sandoval to allow Uber to operate in Nevada.

“Nevadans desperately want and need better, more innovative ways to move around their communities — Uber can help meet that need,” the petition read. “Regulators shouldn’t stand in the way of consumer choice and economic opportunity simply to enrich a deeply-entrenched taxi industry. Millions of riders have voted for Uber with their pocketbooks and hundreds of thousands of drivers are earning more than they ever could in a taxi by partnering with Uber.”

Efforts by the rideshare industry and its supporters paid off: In September 2015, the next year, Uber and Lyft were finally allowed to legally operate after Sandoval signed bills AB175 and AB176 into law.

Since then, annual taxi trips have declined from nearly 28 million in 2014 to a bit more than 13 million in 2024 — a decrease of 53 percent. Annual rideshare information from Uber and Lyft is not publicly available for Las Vegas, though national data shows that rideshares have swiftly surpassed taxis in terms of market size. Nationwide, the rideshare industry is projected to reach nearly $60 billion in revenue in 2025; in comparison, the taxi cab industry sits at around $22 billion, according to Statista.

Uber and Lyft are classified differently than taxicabs and are therefore less strictly regulated. Rideshare companies are monitored by the Nevada Transportation Authority, which regulates larger transportation networks such as buses and The Boring Co., home movers and tow cars as well as state passenger transportation laws across Nevada. The TCA is much smaller and only regulates Clark County.

According to Teri Williams, a spokesperson for the Taxicab Authority, Uber and Lyft are classified as “transportation network companies.” The key difference between taxis is that these companies use digital technology to connect riders to drivers or other monitored autonomous vehicle providers, like Zoox.

Compared to these companies, taxicabs are vehicles that use a taximeter, do not transport more than six passengers including the driver, Williams said an email to The Nevada Independent.

When asked about loosening the regulations, Williams said the efforts “would be a push that would have been made by the taxicab industry.” She emphasized that the taxicab authority was just a regulatory agency.

“If stakeholders believe changes should be made to the way that paid transportation services in Nevada are regulated, the appropriate way to enact those policy proposals is through the legislative process,” Williams said via email.

By the time that rideshares hit the Las Vegas market in the mid-2010s, Tamer Cetin, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley who has published studies on taxicab markets, said many of the regulations governing the taxi industry were outdated.

“When we talk about regulation in the taxi industry, we basically talk about the early industry problems coming from 100 years ago,” Cetin said. “They were natural monopolies; there were no other transportation services or products. It made sense to regulate these companies.”

Cetin said strict regulations such as those imposed by the TCA — designed to protect consumers and drivers alike — eventually became the industry’s downfall.

“Ride-sharing works because they are competitive. There is no regulation,” Cetin said.

Conversely, only a limited number of taxis are allowed on the road at any given time, regulated by the taxicab authorities that issue medallions, which must be purchased by the companies in order to operate.

In Las Vegas, there are 3,530 medallions held by 17 different companies — no company is permitted to own more than 50 percent of the medallions in the city. Prices for rides are regulated by the Taxicab Authority, and companies must perform background checks on their drivers as well as teach a Defensive Driving and Safety Course for new drivers.

Effects on drivers

Taxi drivers in Las Vegas describe the first days of ride-sharing as strange and a bit tenuous. When Uber and Lyft launched, the companies marketed themselves as a way for people to make money while “sharing” a ride together. Lyft’s original tagline was “your friend with a car.”

However, as the companies grew and began affecting the Las Vegas market, Bailin said it was clear that ride-sharing was just another term for a taxi service.

“At first I couldn’t believe it, I thought, ‘There’s no way, this seems crazy,’” Bailin said. “But I was wrong.”

Some cab drivers said that the industry was hit hard by rideshare, though they’ve made some adaptations to retain customers. Cab companies have adopted a shared calling service that dispatches the closest cab to customers regardless of what company was called first. Bailin said the industry has also partnered with Uber X to be added to the app. If a user calls an Uber, they might be picked up by a taxicab — the change is set to be launched next month.

They have also implemented flat-rate fees from the airport to the Strip to discourage drivers from “long-hauling,” or running up the meter by taking longer routes.

Despite the changes, ridership is still down. Henry Szcygielski, who is working part time after being a driver for 37 years, said the transition was hard.

“At first, they took a lot of business away. You were just sitting there and people were getting in an Uber,” Szcygielski said, talking about rideshare. “You have to work a little bit longer and another day or two to make ends meet.”

Lenny Rutkosky, another driver, said the market has been overloaded and oversaturated by rideshares, autonomous vehicles and alternative transportation projects.

“When I started, my biggest competition was limos. We’ve gone so far from that in 20 years,” he said.

Rutkosky said it was unfair that companies such as Uber and Lyft, The Boring Co. or driverless taxicab service Zoox are not regulated as strictly as the taxi industry despite being private transportation.

“My biggest competitor is non-regulation of other businesses here,” Rutkosky said.

The competitors are cutting into the pie of the Las Vegas transportation, according to Szcygielski, leaving fewer options for drivers. He said he could wait for two hours at the airport until he got a customer this summer.

Szcygielski said the ’90s were a golden age for cab drivers — they didn’t have to compete with other transportation alternatives, tips were good and drivers would get kickbacks for bringing customers to hotels or strip clubs.

“Back in the 90s and 2000s you could get 30, 35 trips now if you do 20 trips you’re lucky,” Szcygielski said in a follow-up text after an interview.

On the hiring end, Bailin said he often meets former Lyft and Uber drivers who switch to driving taxis because it’s difficult for them to support themselves. According to him, it can be hard for rideshare drivers to maintain the cost and upkeep of a vehicle without the support of an agency.

Drivers also don’t get benefits or vacation time and the pay isn’t as good as it was in the past. According to Gridwise Analytics, a company that analyzes the gig economy, workers in the transportation sector saw their wages decline roughly 3.9 percent to 5.5 percent in the past two years.

The future

Cramer said economics are all about “winners” and “losers.” In this case, he said the consumer is the one coming out on top, while workers and stakeholders in the taxi industry are the ones who might experience setbacks.

“This is kind of the market working its course, weeding out old methods and rewarding the consumer,” Cramer said. “If we still want to take a taxi or a limo, we can take it. We also have the ability to choose Uber and Lyft if we want to.”

However, he also said the introduction of driverless and autonomous vehicles could be a cause for concern for workers losing their jobs.

Rideshares are just one threat to the taxicab industry. The economy is another. Drivers said they are worried about the future of the industry, though many of them said they’re doing OK financially despite a decline in ridership. Szcygielski said the economic uncertainty of this year has made him nervous.

“This was the worst summer I’d seen since 9/11,” Szcygielski said. “Tourism is down big time.”

Others echoed similar sentiments, including Rutkosky, who said the high costs at casinos are a reason that ridership is down this year.

Autonomous vehicles and driverless cars could eliminate jobs for traditional taxicab companies and rideshares. Companies such as The Boring Co., which just got permission to bring its vehicles above ground, Zoox and potentially Waymo, another driverless taxi service that does not yet have a presence in Las Vegas, were mentioned as potential competitors.

“Who knows? In two or three years, every car could go driverless,” Szcygielski said.

Cramer said Las Vegas is quick to feel the effects of the economy, but resilient, and that it’s unlikely drivers who might be replaced by a driverless vehicle will be permanently displaced from the job market.

“I remember when Nevada had the highest unemployment rate during the financial crisis, but after COVID unemployment rates were at record lows,” Cramer said. “I think people were finding the jobs they were looking for.”",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2017/03/STRIP-TAXI-032017_02.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 06:59:40.801101

Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) operates as an intelligent climate and energy solutions provider.","Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) is one of the 10 Data Center Cooling Companies to Invest In. Wolfe Research maintained its Outperform rating on the stock on December 9 but slightly lowered the price target from $75 to $74. This downward target price adjustment was part of the Research firm’s 2026 outlook for the multi-industry group. Although 2025 was a tough year for the sector, the firm anticipates moderate growth in 2026. Revenue momentum in the second half of 2025 is driving the analysts’ optimism. Rate cuts are also supporting the analysts’ sentiment.

Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) issued a negative pre-announcement of its Q4 2025 earnings, which led to a downward target price adjustment by RBC Capital. On December 5, analysts at RBC Capital maintained an Outperform rating on the stock while lowering the target price from $75 to $70. Management said that the weak earnings are a result of the ongoing slowdown in its Americas residential HVAC segment. This segment alone makes up about 50% of CARR’s revenues. Following the company’s updated earnings outlook, RBC Capital also lowered its 2025 and 2026 estimates by 2% and 7%, respectively.

On December 4, an analyst at Wells Fargo also presented a similar stance on the stock. Analyst Joe O’Dea cut the price target for Carrier Global Corporation from $62.00 to $59.00 while maintaining an Equal Weight rating.

Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) operates as an intelligent climate and energy solutions provider. It focuses on offering unique, digitally-enabled lifecycle solutions. The company operates through Refrigeration and Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) segments. It sells its products under different brand names, including Carrier, NORESCO, Carrier Transicold, Toshiba, Bryant, Day & Night, and Riello.

Industry insiders are particularly eager for clarity on the RTX 50 Super series, a lineup that has been shrouded in rumors and conflicting leaks for months. With Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture already making waves in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing, the upcoming event could finally shed light on how the company plans to evolve its consumer-facing GPUs amid shifting market demands.

Speculation has swirled since mid-2025, with various reports suggesting delays and adjustments to the RTX 50 Super launch timeline. According to sources familiar with Nvidia’s roadmap, the Super variants—expected to offer enhanced memory configurations and performance tweaks—were initially rumored for a late-2025 debut but appear to have been pushed back. This shift aligns with broader industry challenges, including supply chain constraints and rising costs for advanced memory modules, which have forced Nvidia to recalibrate its release strategy.

At the heart of these discussions is the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026, scheduled for January 6-9, where Nvidia is set to hold a major press event. Analysts predict that rather than unveiling entirely new hardware, the company will focus on refinements to its existing Blackwell lineup, providing roadmap signals that could confirm or debunk the Super series’ arrival. This approach would allow Nvidia to address lingering questions about pricing, availability, and feature sets without rushing unpolished products to market.

Unpacking the RTX 50 Super Rumors

Drawing from hardware leaks and insider reports, the RTX 50 Super GPUs are anticipated to feature significant upgrades in video random access memory (VRAM), a critical factor for gamers and creators handling demanding workloads like 8K rendering or AI-enhanced video editing. For instance, posts on X (formerly Twitter) from users like Pirat_Nation have highlighted potential specs, including an RTX 5080 Super with 24GB of GDDR7 memory and an RTX 5070 Super boasting 18GB—substantial boosts over their non-Super counterparts. These details, while unconfirmed, suggest Nvidia is responding to criticisms of earlier models’ memory limitations.

Industry publications have echoed these sentiments. A report from TechPowerUp noted that widespread speculation has now coalesced around a CES 2026 reveal, with sources indicating a delay from an earlier 2025 timeline. This postponement, as detailed in the article, stems from production hurdles tied to next-generation memory chips, which are essential for the Super series’ promised performance leaps.

Further insights come from community discussions on platforms like Reddit, where threads in the r/nvidia subreddit have amassed hundreds of comments debating the implications. Users there point to Nvidia’s history of mid-cycle refreshes, such as the RTX 40 Super series announced at CES 2024, as a blueprint for what might unfold. However, the current environment is complicated by external factors, including a reported RAM pricing crisis that could inflate costs and affect consumer adoption.

Navigating Market Pressures and Competition

Nvidia’s dominance in the GPU sector faces increasing scrutiny from rivals like AMD and Intel, both of which are gearing up for their own CES showcases. AMD, for example, is expected to unveil refreshed Ryzen processors, potentially stealing some thunder from Nvidia’s AI-focused announcements. This competitive dynamic underscores why Nvidia might use CES 2026 to emphasize software integrations, such as advancements in DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology, rather than hardware alone.

Recent news coverage highlights these tensions. An article from Guru3D confirms that the RTX 50 Super lineup won’t hit shelves in 2025, pointing instead to early 2026 as the introduction window. The piece attributes this to Nvidia’s strategic pivot toward ensuring product maturity, especially in light of recent software updates like the restoration of 32-bit PhysX support for the base RTX 50 series, as reported in other outlets.

Moreover, leaks suggest that Nvidia is contemplating even further horizons, with whispers of an RTX 60 series potentially arriving in early 2027. A post on X from Tom’s Guide echoed this, noting skepticism around the timeline due to ongoing memory issues. Such forward-looking rumors indicate that CES 2026 could serve as a bridge, offering teasers for long-term plans while addressing immediate consumer expectations for the Super variants.

Technical Innovations on the Horizon

Delving deeper into the anticipated specs, the RTX 50 Super series is poised to leverage GDDR7 memory modules, which promise higher bandwidth and efficiency compared to previous generations. Industry leakers have speculated on configurations like a 12GB RTX 5060 Ti Super, aiming to make high-end gaming more accessible. These upgrades are not just about raw power; they’re designed to enhance AI-driven features, such as improved ray tracing and frame generation, which Nvidia has been pushing through its GeForce ecosystem.

A detailed analysis from Tom’s Guide outlines a narrowed release window, suggesting March to May 2026 as the most likely period for market availability following a CES announcement. The report emphasizes minimal increases in CUDA core counts—for example, a 4% bump for the RTX 5070 Super—focusing instead on VRAM expansions to handle emerging applications in content creation and machine learning.

Nvidia’s own communications, such as announcements at CES 2025 about FP4 support for generative AI and DLSS 4 for 3D workflows, provide context for these evolutions. Posts on X from official accounts like NVIDIA Studio have showcased how these technologies integrate with creative software, hinting that the Super series will build on this foundation to offer seamless enhancements for professionals.

Strategic Implications for Nvidia’s Ecosystem

Beyond hardware, CES 2026 is expected to highlight Nvidia’s broader software and service ecosystem, including NIM microservices and AI blueprints that could pair with the RTX 50 Super GPUs. This integration is crucial as the company seeks to maintain its edge in AI workloads, where Blackwell chips have already established a stronghold in data centers and workstations.

Coverage from NotebookCheck reinforces the likelihood of a CES 2026 launch, citing leaks that point to delays ensuring compatibility with upcoming standards. The article warns that without these Super models, Nvidia risks ceding ground to competitors in the mid-range segment, where affordability and performance balance are key.

Community sentiment on X reflects a mix of excitement and impatience, with users like 포시포시 sharing early leaks about VRAM boosts that could redefine value propositions. Such discussions underscore the high stakes: if Nvidia delivers on these rumors, it could solidify its position, but any further delays might erode consumer trust amid rising prices.

Broader Industry Ramifications

The ripple effects of Nvidia’s CES strategy extend to sectors like gaming, automotive tech, and home automation, all of which will be on display at the show. With Intel’s Panther Lake and AMD’s Gorgon Point CPUs vying for attention in the 2026 processor wars, Nvidia must articulate how its GPUs complement these advancements, particularly in AI PCs.

An overview from VideoCardz.com anticipates that Nvidia’s keynote will delve into roadmap signals, potentially confirming Super series details while teasing RTX 60 developments. This aligns with reports of a Q1 2027 launch for the next generation, as speculated in various leaks.

Furthermore, global supply chain issues, including the aforementioned RAM crisis, add layers of complexity. Analysts note that Nvidia’s ability to navigate these will determine the Super series’ success, with potential pricing premiums justified by features like enhanced PhysX support for legacy games.

Looking Ahead to CES Revelations

As CES 2026 approaches, the event’s role as a bellwether for consumer tech becomes even more pronounced. Nvidia’s press conference, led by CEO Jensen Huang, is likely to blend hardware teases with demonstrations of AI integrations, addressing the big questions surrounding the RTX 50 Super GPUs head-on.

Insights from Digital Trends suggest that while major launches may be sparse, the focus on refinements could provide the clarity insiders crave. The article posits that Nvidia will use the platform to outline how it plans to push its stack forward, emphasizing software ecosystems over immediate hardware drops.

In parallel, recent X posts from accounts like Pure Tech News amplify the buzz, linking back to expectations for answers on specs and timelines. This collective anticipation highlights Nvidia’s pivotal position: delivering on Super promises could invigorate the market, setting the stage for sustained innovation through 2027 and beyond.

Evolving Expectations and Potential Surprises

Industry observers are also watching for any surprises, such as partnerships or ecosystem expansions that could accompany Super announcements. For example, integrations with emerging AI tools in video editing and livestreaming, as previewed in prior Nvidia updates, might be expanded upon.

Referencing earlier coverage from TechPowerUp, the emphasis on ties with hardware leakers like Hongxing2020 underscores the reliability of CES as a confirmation point. Similarly, Guru3D’s reporting on delays suggests Nvidia is prioritizing quality, a move that could pay dividends in user satisfaction.

Ultimately, the convergence of these elements at CES 2026 positions Nvidia to not only resolve uncertainties but also to chart a course that influences the entire tech sector.

He estimates a 1-gigawatt data center costs $80 billion, with AGI requiring immense capital. Krishna believes current AI has a slim chance of achieving AGI, urging focus on present productivity gains over speculative trillion-dollar bets.

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has now issued a warning as the artificial intelligence companies are racing to build massive data centres. Krishna said that the scale of spending required to pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI) could reach levels that threaten even the most ambitious technology companies including OpenAO and its CEO Sam Altman. Speaking at the Decoder podcast with Nilay Patel, Krishna said that filling a 1-gigawatt data center costs about $80 billion, a figure he dubbed “today’s number.” He noted that companies committing 20–30 gigawatts of infrastructure could face $1.5 trillion in spending at current costs. Along with this, Krishna also talked about the short lifespan of AI chips which have to replaced in five years. This replacement will lead to compounding financial burden.

The debate over returns

Krishan also estimated that an AGI investment of $8 trillion would need $800 billion of profit to just cover interest payments. So, this calculation further raise questions that whether such spending can be ever justified. ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently announced a $1.4 trillion in long-term buildout agreements with partners like Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and Alphabet. Altman believes that OpenAI is capable of generating returns on its capital investments. However, Krishna feels that the current infrastructure commitments reflect beliefs rather than confirmed outcomes.

IBM CEO feels correct technology has only “zero to 1%” chance of achieving AGI

Krishan also said that he gives current technologies only a “zero to 1%” chance of achieving AGI, stressing that today’s large language models fall short of true intelligence. He emphasised that while current tools deliver significant enterprise value, they are not on a guaranteed path to AGI. Despite the warnings made by Krishna, the companies like Google, Microsoft and others are still accelerating spending. Google parent Alphabet recently raised its 2025 capital expenditure outlook to $91–93 billion, while Amazon lifted its estimate to $125 billion. Industry-wide, AI infrastructure investments are expected to reach $380 billion this year alone. Krishna suggested that achieving AGI will require combining large language models with forms of hard knowledge, though he admitted he remains “a maybe” on whether that approach would be sufficient. For now, he said, the industry should focus on the productivity gains current AI tools already deliver, while recognizing that trillion-dollar infrastructure bets may not guarantee breakthroughs.

When the Hue Bridge Pro was launched in September, the manufacturer announced that it would be possible to migrate more than one bridge before the end of the year. With the update to version 5.57.0 of the Hue app and an accompanying firmware update for the control centers, this very feature was delivered. However, there are still a few issues that Philips Hue needs to address with the Hue Bridge Pro.

While the number of light bulbs was previously the major bottleneck, it is now the “rules”. Unlike with lamps or scenes, Philips Hue has not raised the limit here, which remains at 250 rules. With my two bridges, I am already using 81.2 percent of this capacity, while the maximum number of light bulbs is only 61 percent utilized (and 150 lamps are not even the hard limit).

But what are the rules all about? Each button assignment on a switch is a rule. And there are far more than just the four buttons on the Hue dimmer switch, for example, because multiple or long button presses require additional rules.

However, there are other areas where Philips Hue could improve. One example that comes to mind is the Hue Sync function, which is still limited to 10 lights and simultaneous syncing. A backup function is also long overdue, especially now with particularly large installations using the Hue Bridge Pro. Some new software features are set to be unveiled in January, and I’m curious to see exactly what we can expect.

Neue Studienergebnisse zum Hoffnungsträger Retatrutide zeigen Gewichtsverluste, die bisherige Medikamente in den Schatten stellen. Während Analysten ihre Kaufempfehlungen bestätigen und institutionelle Anleger ihre Positionen ausbauen, rückt auch eine mögliche Zulassungsbeschleunigung durch die FDA in den Fokus.

Retatrutide setzt Benchmark

Der zentrale Treiber für den aktuellen Optimismus sind die am Wochenende veröffentlichten Phase-3-Daten für den Wirkstoffkandidaten Retatrutide. In Studien über einen Zeitraum von 68 Wochen erzielte das Medikament einen Gewichtsverlust von bis zu 28,7 Prozent. Dieser Wert übertrifft nicht nur die Konkurrenzprodukte deutlich, sondern schlägt auch das hauseigene Medikament Zepbound. Analysten werten diese Ergebnisse als Bestätigung für Eli Lillys aggressive Pipeline-Strategie, die darauf abzielt, die Dominanz im Bereich der Stoffwechselerkrankungen für das kommende Jahrzehnt zu sichern.

Rückenwind durch Regulierer

Neben den klinischen Erfolgen zeichnen sich auch auf behördlicher Ebene positive Entwicklungen ab. Berichten zufolge drängt die US-Arzneimittelbehörde FDA intern auf eine verkürzte Prüfungszeit für den oralen Abnehm-Kandidaten Orforglipron. Ziel könnte eine Entscheidung bis März 2026 sein. Auch in Europa gibt es Fortschritte: Der Ausschuss der EMA empfahl, die Zulassung für das Diabetes-Medikament Mounjaro auf Kinder ab zehn Jahren auszuweiten, was den adressierbaren Markt weiter vergrößert.

Wachstum trifft auf Bewertung

Die operative Stärke spiegelt sich in den Finanzkennzahlen wider. Zuletzt steigerte das Unternehmen den Umsatz um fast 54 Prozent im Jahresvergleich, während der Gewinn je Aktie die Erwartungen deutlich übertraf. Trotz dieser fundamentalen Stärke und einer Kursperformance von gut 15 Prozent seit Jahresanfang deutet die kurzfristige Technik auf eine Konsolidierung hin. Der Relative-Stärke-Index (RSI) von 28,5 signalisiert aktuell eine überverkaufte Situation.

Großanleger scheinen dies zu nutzen: Institutionelle Investoren wie Bamco Inc. haben ihre Bestände zuletzt massiv aufgestockt. Zwar notiert die Aktie mit einem KGV von rund 50 deutlich über dem Branchendurchschnitt, doch Experten wie die Analysten der Citi argumentieren, dass das enorme Wachstumstempo diesen Aufschlag rechtfertigt. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung, die sich der Billionen-Dollar-Marke nähert, bleibt der Fokus nun auf der Umsetzung der Pipeline-Projekte im Jahr 2026.

The recent 15.4% 1 month share price return has pushed Delta closer to its 69.81 dollar level highs for the year. That momentum builds on a three year total shareholder return of about 116.7%, suggesting investors are warming to its earnings recovery story.

If you are watching airlines regain altitude, it can be worth seeing what else is taking off in transport and travel linked names via .

With shares hovering near yearly highs yet still trading at a sizable intrinsic discount, investors face a key question: Is Delta still underappreciated by the market, or are future gains already fully priced in?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 16.7% Overvalued

With Delta closing at 69.81 dollars, the most closely followed narrative pegs fair value lower, framing recent share strength as running ahead of fundamentals.

With any meaningful capacity expansion cancelled for the time being, DAL protects its average load factor and thus its yield, which is outstanding for a legacy carrier in a cut throat competition market such as air travel in the US, while roughly maintaining its market share. Yet, with its early warning about waning travel demand in March, my original assumptions in February regarding revenue growth and future PE had to be revised downwards from 4 to 2 per cent p.a. and 12, respectively, resulting in a fair value of about $53.50 a share.

According to PittTheYounger, this valuation leans heavily on disciplined margins, cooler growth and a reset profit multiple. Curious which assumptions really drive that gap?

Result: Fair Value of $59.84 (OVERVALUED)

However, softer travel demand or a renewed trade war hitting transatlantic routes could quickly pressure Delta’s thin margins and challenge this overvaluation narrative.

Another View: Deep Discount on Fundamental Value

While the popular narrative calls Delta around 16.7% overvalued, our DCF model paints a very different picture, suggesting fair value near 140.98 dollars, roughly double the current 69.81 dollars price. That kind of gap hints at either a real bargain or serious skepticism about long term cash flows. Which do you believe?

On December 13, 2025, at 9:43 AM, the City Hall of São Paulo informed that, through Procon Paulistano (the consumer protection agency), it had notified Uber and 99 to clarify the increase in ride prices in December in the capital. The Ricardo Nunes (MDB) administration stated that disproportionate prices, without clear technical or economic justification, may constitute an abusive practice., potentially violating principles of the Consumer Protection Code.

The charges against Uber and 99 come after user reports that rides with dynamic pricing nearly tripled from November to December. Tests and social media posts compiled examples with values ​​and dates., including a simulation for December 5, 2025, and comparisons between November 28, 2025, and December 8, 2025, in routine routes.

Notification from Procon Paulistano and focus of the São Paulo City Hall

The São Paulo City Hall states that the actions of the São Paulo Consumer Protection Agency (Procon Paulistano) are focused on possible price increases for ride-hailing services in December, with particular emphasis on the application of dynamic pricing.

In the statement, the body linked to the Municipal Secretariat of Justice cites that the conduct may violate principles of article 6 of the Consumer Protection Code, especially Transparency, affordable rates, and adequate service provision..

The City of São Paulo maintains that imposing disproportionate fees without a clear technical or economic justification may constitute an abusive practice.

According to Procon Paulistano, the purpose of the notification is to obtain technical and economic information that explains how prices are formed for rides and how this policy is communicated to consumers during periods of high demand.

10-day deadline and what Uber and 99 need to explain.

The São Paulo consumer protection agency (Procon Paulistano) has given Uber and 99 ten consecutive days to provide explanations.

The formal request addresses the technical and economic basis of pricing, the functioning of dynamic pricing, and internal mechanisms for preventing abuse during peak demand periods. The items requested are:

What is the technical and economic justification for adopting dynamic pricing, including dynamic pricing, in December?

What measures are taken to prevent price gouging during periods of high demand for rides?

Is there a fare cap for rides? If so, what is the amount and how is it applied?

How and when is the pricing policy communicated to the consumer, especially when there is dynamic pricing?

What internal mechanisms ensure affordable fares and prevent disproportionate advantage in fares?

The City of São Paulo stated that failure to comply within the deadline may lead to administrative measures as outlined in the Consumer Protection Code.

Among the consequences mentioned are fines, temporary suspension of activity, and other applicable penalties.

User complaints and examples of races have nearly tripled.

User reports indicate that as soon as November turned into December, rides became more expensive in São Paulo, with some cases where the price almost tripled at certain times.

In a test conducted late on the night of December 5, 2025, a ride between Jardins and Mooca, which cost around R$ 35 in November, appeared in December for R$ 95, due to the dynamic pricing logic indicated by the apps themselves.

On social media, the complaint gained momentum.

A post by communicator Nanda Xie on the X network had over 3,5 million views and surpassed a thousand comments, with users reporting similar increases in other cities outside the capital and the state.

The content highlights short trips and high prices, reinforcing the perception that rides have started to feature high dynamic pricing in different areas.

Starting with Black Friday, price comparison and impact on transportation.

In the comments, users say they noticed an increase in rides starting the week of Black Friday, at the end of November.

A financial analyst from São Caetano do Sul reported variations in December, with price jumps for rides from R$ 20 to almost R$ 50 and from R$ 70 to almost R$ 130, while others cite stretches of less than 2 km reaching R$ 45.

There are also objective comparisons at specific times.

Users who regularly travel from Barra Funda to the Avenida Engenheiro Luiz Carlos Berrini area around 5 am reported that the same fare increased from R$ 64 on November 28, 2025 to R$ 102 on December 8, 2025.

With fares becoming more expensive, some passengers say they have reduced their use of Uber and 99 and switched to public transportation, especially in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The report comes in the context of the announcement of the operation of four Metro lines between Saturday and Sunday, cited by users as an alternative when dynamic pricing makes commuting unfeasible.

What do Uber and 99 say about dynamic pricing?

Uber Brazil has stated that when the demand for rides in a given area is greater than the number of partner drivers operating in the region at that time, the price becomes dynamic And it could get more expensive for the same route.

The company says that the application of dynamic pricing aims to encourage more drivers to connect to the app to increase supply, and that when supply increases again, prices tend to return to the standard.

Uber also states that Dynamic pricing is displayed to the user at the time the trip is requested..

99 Tecnologia reported that the final price of the ride uses an equation that considers the distance traveled and the travel time, defined according to the supply and demand of drivers per region.

The company added that the final price may be affected by variables such as heavy traffic, rain, or increased orders through the platform, which influences the level of dynamic prices during times of pressure.

Next steps, oversight, and risk of punishment.

With the notification, Procon Paulistano is awaiting documents and technical responses from Uber and 99 regarding the pricing system, the criteria for dynamic pricing, any potential limits, and the mechanisms for transparency to the user.

The case could result in administrative sanctions if the São Paulo City Hall determines that there are information failures, disproportionate practices, or a lack of technical and economic justification for the behavior of the races.

For consumers, the key point is to verify whether the communication about dynamic pricing was clear at the time of the request and whether there were tools for comparison and predictability.

The outcome depends on the consistency of the responses and the demonstration of internal controls against abuse., including tariff ceiling criteria, where they exist, and standardized information practices.

If you frequently use Uber and 99, take screenshots of the fare before confirming the ride, keep the receipt, and compare similar trips at around the same time.

If you identify extreme price fluctuations without explanation, file a formal complaint with the São Paulo City Hall and the São Paulo Consumer Protection Agency (Procon Paulistano), including the date. origin, destination, time and displayed value.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Prefeitura-aciona-Procon-e-cobra-Uber-e-99-por-corridas-que-quase-triplicaram-em-dezembro-na-capital.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 23:58:54.594970

ADBE: A Cash Cow Up Against Low Expectations MarketBeat tracked two Wall Street analysts who updated their Adobe price targets on Dec. 11.
TD Cowen’s $400 target and DA Davidson’s $500 target both imply upside versus the stock’s Dec. 11 closing price near $350.","For software behemoth Adobe ADBE, 2025 has been anything but a good year. Year-to-date, shares are down 21%, trading near $350—a massive 45% decline from their all-time high of $635, reached in February 2024.

Despite this steep downward trajectory, shares got a bit of relief after the tech company posted its latest financial results on Dec. 10. The stock closed up by around 2% the next day in reaction to the company’s solid but not game-changing release. The results provide a clearer view of where the stock may be headed next.

Ultimately, Adobe is currently priced at a level that implies tepid growth going forward. This could lead to significant long-term upside for the stock if the firm can outperform these low expectations. Still, competition and disruption are mounting, making the company’s future difficult to predict.

Adobe’s Beats Across the Board, Leading to a Modest Gain in Shares

In its Q4 fiscal year 2025 (FY2025), Adobe recorded revenue of $6.19 billion, or a growth rate of 10%. Note that the company’s fiscal reporting period is about one quarter ahead of the calendar period. This beat sales estimates of approximately $6.11 billion. The company’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased by around 14% to $5.50. This moderately beat estimates of $5.40.

Annualized recurring revenue (ARR) is an important metric for the company. This represents the value of customer subscriptions over the next year. The figure ended FY2025 at $25.66 billion, rising by 11.5%. In FY2026, Adobe expects ARR growth of just over 10%. At their midpoints, Adobe projects that it will generate $26 billion in revenue and adjusted EPS of $23.40. These represent growth rates of 9.3% and 11.7%, respectively. The figures were slightly ahead of expectations, contributing to Adobe’s rise on Dec. 11.

Adobe & AI: The Market’s Tug of War

The primary overhang on Adobe stock is the belief among many investors that artificial intelligence (AI) tools will significantly limit the company’s long-term growth. Image generation tools, such as Alphabet’s GOOGL Gemini Nano Banana Pro, directly challenge Adobe’s traditional offerings, like Photoshop. Outside of AI-specific tools, key competitor Figma FIG is growing at rates north of 35%.

Adobe has invested significantly in building its own AI capabilities as it seeks to counter this disruption. AI tools are seeing strong engagement. For example, customer usage of generative AI credits increased threefold in just one quarter. The use of AI features in Acrobat and Reader also increased by four times compared to the prior year. Furthermore, ARR from content automation offerings, such as Firefly Services and Firefly Foundry, doubled from the prior year. These metrics show that customers are rapidly increasing their use of Adobe’s AI offerings despite competition.

Still, markets worry that these investments will not lead to a reacceleration in revenue growth. The company’s FY2026 ARR forecast implies a decline from 11.5% to 10.2%. At the same time, Adobe’s current valuation is justifiable even if growth is significantly lower than 10% long-term. However, this would require that Adobe’s free cash flow margin doesn’t stray far from its very high level of 41% long-term.

It is certainly possible that margins could face pressure. Boosting investments or increasing customer acquisition and retention spending to fend off competitors are two key ways that this could materialize. The company’s adjusted operating margin in FY2025 was around 46.2%. Notably, Adobe expects a moderate contraction in this figure to 45% in FY2026. A contraction in this figure could also pressure the free cash flow margin.

ADBE: A Cash Cow Up Against Low Expectations

MarketBeat tracked two Wall Street analysts who updated their Adobe price targets on Dec. 11. TD Cowen’s $400 target and DA Davidson’s $500 target both imply upside versus the stock’s Dec. 11 closing price near $350. The MarketBeat consensus price target near $419 implies around 20% upside potential.

Overall, given the relatively meager expectations baked into Adobe’s share price, the stock’s risk-reward profile looks moderately skewed to the upside. Still, investors need to keep a close eye on this name going forward.

Establishing itself as a true force to reckon with in the rapidly evolving AI landscape is key to the stock's long-term success.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Walt Disney Company has entered a landmark agreement with OpenAI, which will bring more than 200 characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars to Sora, OpenAI's generative video platform.

A three-year licensing agreement was announced on Thursday that will allow Sora users, beginning in early 2026, to create short, fan-driven videos featuring iconic heroes, villains, creatures, costumes, and environments from Disney's extensive catalog. The deal also includes a 1-billion-U.S.-dollar equity investment by Disney in OpenAI.

Disney will become a major OpenAI customer, adopting ChatGPT internally for employees and integrating OpenAI APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to build new products, tools and interactive experiences, according to the agreement.

Disney's CEO Bob Iger framed the partnership as a pivotal moment for the whole entertainment industry, noting that technological innovation had always reshaped how stories are told and experienced. He emphasized that Disney intended to expand its storytelling reach through generative AI while protecting creators and maintaining respect for its intellectual property.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman for his part described Disney as the ""global gold standard for storytelling"" and called the collaboration an example of how creative and AI companies can work together responsibly to broaden access to content and inspire new forms of expression.

Amid intensifying disputes between media companies and AI platforms over copyright protections, the deal marks a major turning point in Hollywood's relationship with generative AI as Disney, long known for fiercely protecting its characters and brands, positions itself at the forefront of AI-driven entertainment.

""Companies in every industry are racing to adopt AI tools to boost productivity. Disney is going further than many, however. The OpenAI deal makes Disney the first major entertainment company to invest in the AI juggernaut, and allows its beloved characters to be used in the video generator Sora,"" Business Insider reported Friday.

Both companies emphasized a shared commitment to responsible AI development. OpenAI agreed to maintain stringent safety systems, age-appropriate policies and other controls to prevent the generation of illegal, harmful, derogatory or infringing content.

Images and voices of the Hollywood stars who embodied these heroes on film are specifically excluded from the deal.

The transaction remains subject to board approvals and standard closing conditions, but once finalized, it will mark the most significant collaboration to date between an AI company and a major Hollywood studio. ■",,N,,2025-12-13 18:01:12.431993

One of the twists in the AI wars has been Google sort of bouncing back, this surge by Gemini versus OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Sam Altman calling this code red. You’ve said before that it’s hard to know who a winner will be.

Interestingly, on Pivot, we thought Google was going to do this because they had all the pieces. If they didn’t, what a bunch of idiots, that kind of thing.

They were ahead. They just didn’t take the bet because they were afraid of it.

Yeah, of course. Well, Sundar [Pichai] is a much more risk—he’s more risk-averse. I think Sergey Brin has re-arrived there. I think you can feel his influence. He’s one of the founders. So I think that they had all the elements in place to do it and just had to make the . . . it’s very hard to jump from one thing to the next and do it.

The one company that does do it is Netflix. It’s like, “Now we’re this. We’re not doing advertising. Now we are. We’re mailing DVDs. Now we’re not.” I love these guys. Every time they’re, like, “Eh, today we’re not buying anything,” which was a head fake. “Oh, we’re going to buy the studio.” I love it. It’s like, great.

So Google just took advantage of its obvious assets, and the fact that it wasn’t ahead was the story. Not that it should be by every . . . they’ve got the technology, they’ve got the people, they’ve got the data, they’ve got the right businesses. They’re the most set up for this era. Now, look, ChatGPT has gotten really far.

OpenAI has gotten very far, but ultimately, what I kept asking myself, is it “Netscape” or is it “Google”? Is OpenAI “Netscape” or “Google”? It’s feeling a little Netscapey these days. Even though they’re way ahead, a lot of times in technology the plains are covered with the bodies of pioneers. There’s all kinds of that. You know that from being around. There are so many companies that were there and then weren’t, but were important.

Jony Ive, the iconic Apple designer working with Altman and OpenAI on some new device or interface or form factor or whatever. Big deal, differentiator.

I don’t care. I think these devices are stupid. I think the way I see it pulling out, it’s just going to be around you. It makes such a big deal about these devices you wear. I think probably what I would see more interesting—this is sort of an opportunity for Apple—is your AirPods, which you wear now comfortably. Even though at the time, if you remember when it rolled out, everyone said how ugly they were.

I think if you put a camera in those and they could see as you go through the world—the glasses format is probably the way it’s going to go. But does it have to be glasses on your face? Because not everybody wants to wear those. But if there was something in your ear that could see as you move through the world—who’s the company who is most able to do that? There are two of them: Google and Apple, right? Because people are very comfortable in the Apple environment. So to me, they have a lot of opportunity in this area.

Apple is having a lot of trouble getting its AI action together. Although does it not need to because you carry it through . . .

I don’t know. I don’t know if they need it. I think they have to integrate it into its products, that’s for sure. So they don’t necessarily have to own the AI. They didn’t have to own Maps, did they? No. They tried, and they sort of half failed. And then they used Google, or they didn’t have to make a lot of stuff. They didn’t have to make all those apps. Everybody else did, and they took advantage of it.

To me, they’re a system. They can write up on things. I think the integration is what’s difficult here. And so how do you integrate AI into the things that already exist? To me, I keep obsessing on the AirPods. I’m, like, “What if they were just a little more functional?” I know it sounds crazy, but I still have my pair of Google glasses—which I’m going to keep so I can sell them someday to send one of my kids to college.

It was directionally the correct idea; it just didn’t have enough functionality. Same thing with the Meta glasses. What do they do? They take a picture. That’s pretty much it. How much functionality is that? Not much. And so, where can you get more functionality out of the things you might do every day? Which is information you need. It sounds dumb, but directions, ordering food, getting places, appointment making, things like that. To me, that’s where they should focus on, honestly . . . the software rather than the hardware.

At Apple, do you feel like Tim Cook is doing a good job?

He did. He should leave now. That’s what I would do if I were him.

What about Disney? Bob Iger is another one who sort of declared victory and then had to come back, and now his contract is ending.

I think, personally, they need to merge with someone or sell. Ultimately, I think he’s done an amazing job with that brand, for sure. Again, another person, that probably shouldn’t have come back. I think he was bored. I think he retired a little too early, because he’s so vibrant and intelligent and he looks great.

At one point he was sending me a lot of texts from some boat in French Polynesia he was sailing or something. And I’m, like, “Oh, you’re coming back.” And I joke with him onstage about it. I’m, like, “You’re bored. You have more to give, essentially.” I think he probably should find the right person to take over.

They’ve got plenty of people. I’ve always maintained it’s the biggest of the small things. It’s too small in today’s environment. And so they really have to hook up with a tech. I would think Apple would be a very good merger with them, or Comcast, or they’re just going to have to, given the size problems. I think they’re number two in streaming, but if this one passes, that’ll be a problem for them.

I’m just getting a note here that Paramount is potentially back in the action with the cash bid.

It’s a hostile cash bid. What a bunch of losers, honestly.

You don’t see it happening, huh?

Maybe. Maybe. I don’t know. I just think their only argument was “we’re friends with Donald Trump.” That seems noneconomic to me. I’m sorry, but Big Daddy and nepo baby really have to have a better argument than we’re friends with Donald. I mean, how ridiculous a way to conduct business is that? And so look, by the way, from an existential point of view, they’re f*cked if they don’t get this.

They’re going to have to merge with someone else. I don’t care how rich they are. There’s only so much money you’re throwing at the yacht. But one of the things that drove me crazy is they had a thing right when they did the deal, and they’re, like, “We’re going to take technology and make it better.” And I was, like, “Specifically what?” And they’re, like, “Technology and make it better.” And I was, like, “Yeah, I’d like a specific.” And they were, like, “Technology.”

It ultimately comes back to they’re rich. They can spend it. They can buy, I don’t know, all of France and give everyone a glass of wine. That’s not really economics.

They just want to own it.

It’s just a toy. Then it’s just a toy. And then, “Okay, all right, that’s what you’re doing.”

How much are you willing to pay for your toy is the question.

Exactly. But they need it. Let me just tell you from a business point of view, these things need to merge. I know everybody’s all upset in Hollywood . . . getting back to that . . . but there is no other direction, largely because Hollywood didn’t innovate for so long.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/12/p-1-91459948-rr-kara-swisher-fast-company.jpg",N,,2025-12-13 17:01:14.770199

Révision de la Convention d’arrangement : les partenaires Robex et Predictive Discovery sont convenus de nouvelles conditions, selon lesquelles les actionnaires de Robex recevront 7 862 actions Predictive pour chaque action Robex. Autrement dit, en tenant compte de tous les titres exerçables, ils détiendront 46,5 % de la société nouvellement fusionnée selon une structure de capital entièrement diluée.

Appui marqué des actionnaires : les actionnaires ont confirmé leur participation ferme à l’opération, à noter que d’importants actionnaires, administrateurs et dirigeants de Robex pesant pour près de 23,8 % des actions Robex en circulation ont fait réviser leurs conventions de vote en parallèle.

Avantages stratégiques : l’opération de fusion donne vie à l’un des principaux producteurs aurifères d’Afrique de l’Ouest et permet de mutualiser deux exploitations avancées majeures à faible budget tout en tablant sur un important potentiel de croissance.

Valeur ajoutée : à moyen terme, l’opération devrait être vectrice de valeur pour les actionnaires de la société fusionnée, du fait d’une attractive exposition à ses actifs de qualité supérieure, de sa plus grande envergure, d’une diversification plus marquée de ses actifs et de son potentiel d’intégration aux indices.

Mise à jour concernant l’assemblée générale : la date limite pour voter par procuration est reportée au 29 décembre 2025 à 17 heures, heure de l’Est, soit le 30 décembre 2025 à 6 heures, heure de l’Ouest australien.

En vertu de cet Avenant, Acquireco, une filiale en propriété exclusive de Predictive, fera l’acquisition de la totalité des actions ordinaires émises et en circulation de Robex (les « Actions Robex ») par le biais d’un plan d’arrangement statutaire établi conformément au chapitre XVI, section II de la Loi de la Province québécoise sur les sociétés par actions, ci-après désigné l’« Arrangement » ou l’ « Opération »).

Conformément à l’Avenant, les porteurs d’actions Robex (les « Actionnaires de Robex ») recevront désormais 7 862 actions ordinaires pleinement libérées du capital de Predictive (les « Actions Predictive ») pour chaque action Robex détenue, modalité ci-après désignée la « Nouvelle contrepartie »). À l’issue de l’Opération, les actionnaires actuels de Predictive et les anciens actionnaires de Robex détiendront conjointement et respectivement près de 53,5 % et 46,5 % des parts de la société fusionnée selon une structure de capital entièrement diluée.

Les conditions de l’Avenant ont été agréées après réception par Predictive d’une proposition concurrentielle supérieure, ci-après désignée l’« Offre concurrentielle » portant sur la totalité de ses actions en circulation, et telle qu’annoncée par ses soins le 3 décembre 2025.

Un exemplaire de l’Avenant est déposé sous le profil SEDAR+ de Robex à l’adresse www.sedarplus.ca.

Matthew Wilcox, directeur général de Robex, s’exprime en ces termes :

« Nous souhaitons vivement remercier nos actionnaires principaux pour leur vision partagée, selon laquelle seul le cadrage de cette opération apporte une valeur ajoutée significative. La convention révisée concède aux actionnaires de Robex et de Predictive une valorisante exposition aux actifs de qualité supérieure de la société fusionnée, et les place en bonne position pour bénéficier d’une réévaluation à la hausse du cours de son titre à mesure que se matérialise notre trajectoire de croissance à moyen terme. Cette alliance renforce l’entreprise à l’appui des flux de trésorerie à court terme issus des activités d’exploitation des mines de Kiniero et de Bankan, apporte des synergies de projet et ouvre l’accès à une équipe de construction minière d’envergure mondiale et forte d’une expérience très récente en Guinée. La société fusionnée est idéalement positionnée pour dégager des rendements significatifs et instituer l’un des principaux producteurs aurifères d’Afrique de l’Ouest par la création d’un pôle de premier niveau en Guinée. »

Raisonnement stratégique de l’Opération :

Contribution des actionnaires : un appui marqué des principaux actionnaires en faveur de l’opération révisée.

Une alliance stratégique :la fusion donne vie à l’un des principaux producteurs aurifères d’Afrique de l’Ouest mutualisant l’exploitation de deux sites miniers majeurs très avancés et assortis d’un faible budget, à savoir les mines de Kiniero et de Bankan, à raison de projections de production calculées à plus de 400 000 onces d’or par an à l’horizon 2029 et de ressources cumulées avoisinant les 9,5 millions d’onces.

Agilité financière : les flux de trésorerie de la mine de Kiniero et les produits attendus des bons de souscription de Robex financent le développement de la mine de Bankan, ce qui nuance le risque de financement.

Des synergies d’exploitation : la proximité des chantiers induit un pôle minier de premier ordre et en optimise le développement, l’exploration et le déploiement de la main-d’œuvre.

Un meilleur profil boursier : une envergure supérieure et un portefeuille multi-actifs renforcent ses chances d’intégration dans des indices majeurs (comme l’ASX 200 ou le GDXJ) et jouent en faveur d’une meilleure liquidité et d’un intérêt accru aux yeux des investisseurs.

Une équipe de tête expérimentée : l’équipe de direction renforcée justifie d’une expertise avérée dans les juridictions concernées et témoigne d’une expérience dans le pilotage de sociétés à double cotation.

Réévaluation du cours de l’action : un potentiel de réévaluation revu à la hausse du fait d’une envergure supérieure, une croissance imminente de la production d’or, un portefeuille multi-actifs et un meilleur potentiel d’intégration aux indices.

Sur recommandation unanime de son Comité spécial, et après avoir consulté ses conseillers juridiques et financiers externes, le Conseil de Robex a adopté la Convention d’arrangement telle que modifiée par l’Avenant à l’unanimité, en déterminant qu’elle sert au mieux les intérêts de la Société et que la Nouvelle contrepartie à recevoir par les Actionnaires de Robex dans le cadre de l’Opération est financièrement équitable.

CODE JORC ET NORMES DE DÉFINITION CIM

Le terme « réserve en minerai », tel que défini par le Code australasien de déclaration des données d’exploration, des ressources minérales et des réserves de minerai préparé par le Joint Ore Reserves Committee de l’Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, l’Australian Institute of Geoscientists et le Minerals Council of Australia (le « Code JORC ») équivaut au terme « réserve minérale » selon les normes de définition CIM applicables aux ressources et réserves minérales, telles qu’adoptées par l’Institut canadien des mines, de la métallurgie et du pétrole le 19 mai 2014 (les « Normes CIM »). Les termes « ressources minérales présumées », « ressources minérales indiquées » et « ressources minérales mesurées » ont la même signification dans le Code JORC et les Normes CIM. Les « réserves minérales prouvées » définies dans le Code JORC sont égales aux mêmes « réserves minérales prouvées » en vigueur dans les Normes CIM. Il en va de même pour les « réserves minérales probables ». Le Code JORC est reconnu comme un code étranger acceptable au sens de la norme canadienne NI 43-101.

Ressources et réserves minérales et objectifs de production

Le présent communiqué fait état de ressources minérales et de réserves en minerai PDI et Robex conjointes respectivement chiffrées à près de 9,5 millions d’onces d’or pour les ressources, et quelque 4,5 millions d’onces d’or pour les réserves. Nous présentons ci-après des estimations complémentaires sur les ressources minérales et réserves en minerai respectives de PDI et Robex.

PDI

Ressources minérales et réserves de minerai estimées

Les estimations des ressources minérales relatives aux gisements de NEB et de BC ont été publiées sur l’ASX le 7 août 2023, dans une annonce de PDI intitulée « Hausse des ressources minérales du projet Bankan à hauteur de 5,38 millions d’onces d’or ». Les estimations des ressources relevant des gisements de Fouwagbe et de Sounsoun ont quant à elles été publiées le 23 avril 2025 sur l’ASX dans une annonce intitulée « Ressources minérales estimées à 153 000 onces d’or à Maiden Argo ». L’estimation des réserves en minerai propres au gisement Bankan a été publiée sur l’ASX le 25 juin 2025, dans une annonce de PDI intitulée « Étude de faisabilité définitive portant sur le gisement de Bankan et confirmant les prévisions économiques du projet ». PDI confirme ne pas avoir connaissance de nouvelles informations ou données susceptibles de réviser substantiellement ses estimations de ressources minérales ou de réserves en minerai, et maintient l’invariabilité et la validité de toutes les hypothèses majeures et paramètres techniques sous-jacents aux estimations communiquées dans les annonces précédentes. Il convient de souligner l’intention de PDI de rappeler ses rétractations à Argo et Bokoro annoncées le 28 mai 2025, conformément au Code minier. Les ressources minérales présumées de la zone Argo ne représentent que 2,8 % des ressources minérales totales de PDI.

The software indeed enables data center operators to monitor various aspects of an AI GPU fleet. Among other things, it allows for detecting the physical location of these processors, a possible deterrent against smuggling chips. However, there is a catch: the software is opt-in rather than mandatory, which may limit its effectiveness as a tool to thwart smugglers, whether nation-state or otherwise.

The software collects extensive telemetry, which is then aggregated into a central dashboard hosted on Nvidia's NGC platform. This interface lets customers visualize GPU status across their entire fleet, either globally or by compute zones representing specific physical or cloud locations, which means the software can detect the physical location of Nvidia hardware. Operators can view fleet-wide summaries, drill into individual clusters, and generate structured reports containing inventory data and system-wide health information.

Nvidia stresses that the software is strictly observational: it provides insight into GPU behavior but cannot act as a backdoor or a kill switch. As a result, even if Nvidia discovers via the NGC platform that some of its GPUs have been smuggled to China, it cannot switch them off. However, the company could probably use the data to figure out how the GPUs arrived at that location. Nvidia says the software is a customer-installed, open-source client agent that is transparent and auditable.

Nvidia's new fleet-management software gives data center operators a detailed, real-time view of how their GPU infrastructure behaves under load. It continuously collects telemetry on power behavior — including short-duration spikes — enabling operators to stay within power limits. In addition to power data, the system monitors utilization, memory bandwidth usage, and interconnection health across fleets, to enable operators to maximize utilization and performance per watt. These indicators help expose load imbalance, bandwidth saturation, and link-level issues that can quietly degrade performance across large AI clusters.

Another focus of the software is thermals and airflow conditions to avoid thermal throttling and premature component aging. By catching hotspots and insufficient airflow early, operators can avoid performance drops that typically accompany high-density compute environments and, in many cases, prevent premature aging of AI accelerators.

The system also verifies whether nodes share consistent software stacks and operational parameters, which is crucial for reproducible datasets and predictable training behavior. Any configuration divergence, such as mismatched drivers or settings, becomes visible in the platform.

It is important to note that Nvidia's new fleet-management service is not the company's only tool for remotely diagnosing and controlling GPU behavior, though it is the most advanced. For example, DCGM is a local diagnostic and monitoring toolkit that exposes raw GPU health data, but requires operators to build their own dashboards and aggregation pipelines, which greatly shrinks its usability, but enables operators to build the tools they need themselves. There is also Base Command, a workflow and orchestration environment designed for AI development, job scheduling, dataset management, and collaboration, not for in-depth hardware monitoring.

Meanwhile, all three tools represent a formidable set of knobs for data center operators. DCGM provides node-level probes, Base Command handles workloads, and the new service integrates them into a fleet-wide visibility platform that scales to geographically distributed GPU deployments.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/faMa9LvixhRJgP7cbkeJEL-1920-80.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 15:02:44.105207

This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.
Simply Wall St has no position in any stocks mentioned.","If you are wondering whether Capgemini at around €147.60 is a bargain hiding in plain sight or a stock that has already had its moment, you are not alone.

Over the last month the share price has climbed 9.4%, including a 2.1% gain in the past week, even though it is still down 5.8% year to date and about 3.2% over the last year.

Recent headlines have focused on Capgemini doubling down on AI driven consulting and cloud transformation deals, alongside expanding partnerships with hyperscalers to support large digital overhauls for European corporates. At the same time, management has been emphasizing operational efficiency and selective hiring, which helps explain why the market has started to reassess the risk reward profile, despite a still cautious macro backdrop.

On our framework Capgemini scores a , meaning it screens as undervalued on five of six checks. Next we will break down what those checks actually say about the stock and hint at a more powerful way to think about valuation that we will come back to at the end.

Approach 1: Capgemini Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, DCF, model estimates what a company is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and discounting those cash flows back to today in € terms. For Capgemini, the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model starts from last twelve months free cash flow of about €2.16 billion and uses analyst forecasts for the next few years, then extrapolates further growth.

Analysts see free cash flow rising from roughly €2.22 billion in 2026 to about €2.61 billion by 2029. After that, growth assumptions gradually slow, taking projected FCF to around €3.15 billion by 2035. Simply Wall St converts this stream of future cash flows into today’s money, arriving at an estimated intrinsic value of about €209.39 per share.

Compared with the recent share price of roughly €147.60, the DCF implies Capgemini is trading at a 29.5% discount to its estimated fair value. This indicates the market may not be fully pricing in its future cash generation.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Capgemini is undervalued by 29.5%. Track this in your or , or discover .

Approach 2: Capgemini Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like Capgemini, the price to earnings ratio, or PE, is a useful way to judge value because it links what investors pay today to the profits the business is already generating. In broad terms, higher expected growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth or greater uncertainty usually demand a lower, more conservative multiple.

Capgemini currently trades on a PE of about 16.1x, which is slightly below both its IT industry average of roughly 21.6x and the peer group average of around 16.5x. Simply Wall St also calculates a Fair Ratio of about 24.5x for Capgemini, a proprietary estimate of what its PE should be given its earnings growth outlook, profit margins, industry, market cap and risk profile. This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple peer or sector comparison because it adjusts for Capgemini specific characteristics instead of assuming all IT stocks deserve the same multiple.

Since the Fair Ratio of 24.5x sits meaningfully above the current 16.1x, the PE perspective suggests Capgemini shares are still pricing in relatively modest expectations.

Result: UNDERVALUED

PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Capgemini Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. This is an easy tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page that lets you describe the story you believe about a company and link it to your own forecast for revenue, earnings, margins and, ultimately, a fair value. You can then compare that fair value to the current share price to inform your decision on whether the stock suits your investment approach. The whole Narrative automatically updates as new news or earnings arrive.

For Capgemini, for example, one investor might build a bullish Narrative around accelerating AI partnerships, sovereign cloud contracts and margin expansion, and use that to support a fair value closer to the top of recent analyst targets near €214. Another investor might instead focus on macro risk, slower revenue growth and margin pressure, and use that view to arrive at a more cautious fair value nearer the low end around €134. Narratives helps both investors see clearly how their story, numbers and valuation connect, and how their expectations differ from the market price today.

Orchestration is the true backbone of warehouse resilience.
Hardware-agnostic orchestration gives warehouse operators the flexibility to adapt without unraveling their infrastructure each time they incorporate a new vendor.","It’s a common sight in the logistics industry: warehouse robots sitting idle on the floor. The warehouse operations and robotic automation directors say it wasn’t a failure of the robots’ picking or handling abilities, or speed or throughput, that forced them out of commission. The problem was orchestration. The more the business invested in automation, the more their robots, software and human workers fell out of sync. They spent more time struggling with disjointed operations than enjoying the productivity benefits of automation.

They’ve discovered an old truth about automation: speed is nothing without synchronization. The real value of robotics stems not from the power of any one machine, but the ability to coordinate many of them—and the human workers and software systems controlling them—intelligently at scale.

Robot specs don’t fix the real efficiency problem: coordinating thousands of agents in highly volatile fulfillment environments

Warehouse robotics buyers tend to fixate on speed, payload capacities and unit-per-hour rates. In practice, the challenge is not getting AMRs to move faster. It's coordinating dozens, sometimes hundreds, of different bots, conveyors and pick stations so they don't work at cross-purposes.

That’s a hard job, and it’s getting harder all the time. Modern fulfillment environments are chaotic by nature. One inventory pool now serves multiple fulfillment channels—e-commerce, retail replenishment and wholesale—each with different and sometimes conflicting SLAs. Optimizing locally can slow the network. A picking robot working at maximum speed can overwhelm packing stations downstream.

Then there’s the fragile supply chains, easily upset by tariffs and other external shocks. SKU proliferation in the e-commerce space is relentless. Consumer behavior shifts overnight. Fulfillment centers aren’t just grappling with higher volume, but higher volatility. Warehouse operators started peak season planning earlier than ever because they can't predict demand patterns amid inflation and supply shortages.

Warehouses need systems that get smarter as the fulfillment environment gets messier. Operators need a reliable, effective way to reconfigure fulfillment logic between channel types, integrate with a variety of hardware from different vendors, dynamically reassign work across machines and people and reroute workflows based on real-time inventory.

That’s the way to convert uptime to better fulfillment outcomes. AI-driven neural networks can calculate the optimal routes for thousands of robots within milliseconds, even updating paths on the fly for unexpected congestion and task changes. That capability doesn't come from faster hardware. It comes from more intelligent orchestration.

Robotic orchestration software must be capable of handling extreme complexity—let’s say, 20 different types of robotic technologies operating across 80 different warehouse formats, all without disrupting business logic or forcing costly integrations each time the hardware changes. The only viable orchestration layer is one that lets you swap in and out technologies without ripping out warehouse operating logic. Pivot from one hardware vendor to another over a weekend, keeping your operations running without code changes.

Most robotics vendors don’t want you to know this. They want you to commit to building your tech stack on their hardware. But that’s reckless. One unexpected tariff decree can upend an entire automation strategy. Robots are constantly improving. Economic conditions are quickly changing. Do you really want to lock yourself in with a single vendor for a decade or more?

Orchestration is the real competitive edge

As fulfillment environments grow increasingly complicated, operators will realize that the real advantage of automation comes not from individual hardware but from using software intelligence to better synchronize their diverse robotic fleets. Orchestration is the true backbone of warehouse resilience. It’s what ensures machines, humans and software all work in sync. Hardware-agnostic orchestration gives warehouse operators the flexibility to adapt without unraveling their infrastructure each time they incorporate a new vendor.

The winners of the fulfillment arms race will be those who know how to orchestrate—not just accumulate—their robotic, human and software assets.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/greyorange-greymatter.V6K3upicFz.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-12-13 18:00:41.305625

Headlines this week include Delta’s Wi-Fi rollout, a potential nonstop flight from Las Vegas to Australia, and updates from across The Pond in Europe, among other notable developments.

Let’s get started.

Delta Leads American and United With Fast Free Wi-Fi

Delta Air Lines was proud to announce that it reached a new milestone with its Wi-Fi rollout this week. As of Monday, December 8, 1,000 of Delta’s planes now feature fast, complimentary, Delta Sync Wi-Fi. I tried it out on a couple of flights in the summer, and it worked without a hitch both times.

Fast, complimentary Wi-Fi is a must-have for airlines these days if they want to stay relevant in a very competitive industry. While the vast majority of carriers around the world are opting for Elon Musk’s Starlink, Delta’s fast and free Wi-Fi is supplied by T-Mobile.

To enjoy unlimited free in-flight Wi-Fi access when flying Delta, you’ll just need to log in with your SkyMiles membership number.

Of the big 3 U.S. airlines (American, Delta, and United), Delta’s Wi-Fi offering is currently the best, although American and United both have significant plans for their Wi-Fi offerings in 2026.

What’s Going on With American and Spirit?

The rumor mill is spinning after American Airlines bought 2 gates from Spirit Airlines at Chicago O’Hare (ORD). The plot thickens, as American also requested to be a “party in interest” in Spirit’s bankruptcy proceedings.

However, neither of those things, together or separately, gives a clear indication that American Airlines is looking to buy Spirit. After Spirit axed half of its routes from O’Hare, selling the gates that it no longer needs — to the tune of $30 million — is a normal financial step to make. American is also doing whatever it takes to compete with United at its failing Chicago hub.

American Airlines’ request to be a “party in interest” is where the lines blur a little. The request means that American is privy to all reporting, liquidation statements, and other plans regarding Spirits’ bankruptcy and potential acquisition by another airline. According to Reuters, a spokesperson for American confirmed that the request is related to an “airport-specific” agreement, which leads us back to its purchase of 2 gates from Spirit and nothing more.

Las Vegas Nonstop to Australia Could Become a Reality

But it’s probably a long way off yet.

In 2026, Qantas will operate charter flights to Las Vegas (LAS) to support NRL matches for its second year in a row. However, in a recent chat with Executive Traveller, Cam Wallace, CEO for Qantas International, confirmed that Las Vegas is a target for a potential seasonal service for the Australian flag carrier.

When you combine the fact that visitor numbers to the U.S. are decreasing and that Qantas’ U.S.-bound ticket sales aren’t exactly flourishing, now might not be the most ideal time to start a niche route from Australia to Vegas.

It would, however, make more sense for Qantas’ low-cost subsidiary Jetstar to start a service to Las Vegas. Steph Tully, CEO for Jetstar, recently told The Australian that a flight from Bris-Vegas (Brisbane) to Las Vegas is “very Jetstar.”

With the introduction of Jetstar’s retrofitted Boeing 787s in 2026, the reality of a nonstop Brisbane (BNE) to Vegas flight might not be too far away.

Transiting Through Paris Charles de Gaulle Will Be Less Confusing

Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) is frequently criticized by frequent flyers and those who transit through the airport for being unnecessarily confusing.

It’s particularly troublesome for Air France‘s transiting passengers who are welcomed in Terminal 2, which has sub terminals 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2EK, 2EL, 2EM, 2F, and 2G.

Thankfully, Group ADP, the company that runs airports in Paris, has seen sense and decided it’s about time the airport’s terminals were renamed. As of March 2027, the airport’s terminals will be logically renamed from Terminal 1 through to Terminal 7, and there won’t be a random letter from the alphabet in sight.

Before the changes come into effect, the airport has a mammoth task on its hands to replace 3,000 signs in the terminals, 600 signs in the parking lots, and 250 road signs. The planned completion date of March 2027 coincides with the launch of the CDG express — a new train that will reduce journeys from Paris Gare de l’Est to Charles de Gaulle by around 10 minutes.

Air France Will Open a Stunning New Lounge at London Heathrow

Sticking to Europe, let’s move to my home country of England, which will soon get its first-ever dedicated Air France lounge.

Opening in spring 2026, Air France passengers flying in La Première (first class), business class, and select elite status holders will have access to a brand-new lounge at London Heathrow’s Terminal 4.

According to Air France, the 2,460-square-foot lounge will boast a “vast” bar featuring French wines and Champagnes, as well as the finest in French gastronomy — and possibly even a spa.

With up to 7 daily flights, it makes sense for Air France to invest in London’s biggest airport.

Terminal 4 is also where Air France’s partner, KLM, and other SkyTeam airlines, such as Aeromexico and Kenya Airways, operate. While eligible KLM passengers will have access to the lounge, I reached out to Air France to verify whether eligible passengers flying with other SkyTeam airlines will also get to enjoy the space before their flight. I have yet to receive a response.

Lufthansa Group Unveils Simplified Branding

The next time you fly Lufthansa, or one of the ever-increasing number of airlines that are part of the Lufthansa Group, you might notice changes to its branding.

The changes are subtle, and the iconic crane remains the symbol that represents the group.

“A visual identity in aviation must do much more than just create an eye-catching appearance,” said Dieter Vranckx, chief commercial officer at Lufthansa Group. “It will reflect our strategic brand values and a promise we want to make to our passengers across all our brands.”

The new Lufthansa Group branding will also be visible outside some of the group’s airline lounges with the names of each member airline written underneath.

Final Thoughts

I’m not sure what I find more surprising: that Qantas might launch a route to Las Vegas or that Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport will finally have terminal names and numbers that make sense.

As for Delta’s Wi-Fi, I’ll be flying one of its Boeing 767s from Honolulu to Los Angeles next month, so I wonder whether the rollout will have reached even those older aircraft by that point.

The vessel is part of Uber Boat by Thames Clippers’ sustainability initiative.","The electric ferry, operated by Uber Boat by Thames Clippers, is scheduled to enter full service in London next spring. It was constructed at Wight Shipyard in East Cowes with partial funding from government grants. The battery-electric vessel was designed by the Aus Ships Group. According to the operator, Uber Boat by Thames Clippers—also the owner of the vessel—the Orbit Clipper is Britain’s first fully electric ferry.

The vessel measures 25.20 metres in length, 10.10 metres in width, and has a draught of 1.10 metres. It can accommodate 150 passengers and 100 bicycles. The ferry is powered by 150 kW electric motors and Hydromaster 360° azimuth thrusters. Its battery is a 960 kWh Octopus series unit from EST Floattech. The ferry is designed to reach a speed of 10 knots and will dock overnight at Canary Wharf, where it will be charged using a charger from Aqua Superpower. The charging process is expected to take six hours at a power output of 150 kW.

The Orbit Clipper will operate specifically between Rotherhithe in the south and Canary Wharf in the north. It will provide ‘an accessible, fast and green service for thousands of Londoners and visitors a day,’ the company stated. The electric ferry will commence operations alongside the existing vessel, Twinstar. “The vessel will be progressively phased into operation, with full operation and exclusivity of the route targeted for Spring 2026,” the announcement reads.

The vessel is part of Uber Boat by Thames Clippers’ sustainability initiative. The company already operates three hybrid ferries: Earth Clipper, Celestial Clipper, and Mars Clipper. These hybrid vessels run on pure battery power in central London, switching to combustion engines outside the city centre.

Sean Collins, CEO of Uber Boat by Thames Clippers, is convinced that the introduction of Britain’s first fully electric vessel marks a turning point for sustainable transport in London: “The launch of Orbit Clipper is a significant milestone for sustainable transport in London. As the UK’s first all-electric, zero-emissions vessel, it represents our commitment to reducing the city’s carbon footprint while continuing to provide reliable and efficient river transport.”

Sustainability and Risk Management Sustainability and resilience are no longer two separate goals.
Preparing for What’s Ahead Infrastructure decisions in 2026 and beyond will be defined by long-term thinking, smarter investments and better use of data.","2026 is shaping up to be an important year for the infrastructure world as governments, cities and private developers deal with growing pressure on aging systems. Instead of focusing only on building quickly or staying under budget, more attention is shifting toward durability, long-term performance and overall resilience. The goal is no longer just to put a project in the ground, but to build something safer and better prepared for the next several decades.

Two big trends are driving this change. The first is the push for sustainability that can be proven with real data, and the second is the growing use of predictive, technology-enabled risk management. Together, these trends point toward a future where infrastructure is monitored continuously, proactively maintained to deliver measurable results over its full lifecycle.

Data Verified Sustainability

Sustainability used to be defined mostly by intentions, by using greener materials or trying to reduce emissions where possible. That simply isn’t enough as we move into 2026. Stakeholders want numbers tracking and transparency. They expect material choices and emissions claims to be backed by data. This has changed how projects are evaluated. Instead of focusing on speed or initial costs, discussions now revolve around how long an asset will last, how often it will need repairs and how it performs from an energy and carbon standpoint year after year. Benchmarks like digital traceability and long-term performance testing are becoming standard requirements.

This approach is also changing how infrastructure is designed. More projects now incorporate sensors, digital twins and automated reporting tools right from the start. These systems create ongoing feedback loops so owners and engineers can verify that sustainability goals are being met in the real world. Whether it is buildings, bridges, or energy systems, data is becoming the main way to prove that infrastructure is delivering on its environmental promise.

From Reactive to Predictive

Aging assets and more extreme weather are making traditional maintenance schedules less effective. Inspections that occur every few years can miss early warning signs, especially as structures age. In 2026, more organizations are turning to predictive risk management, which uses sensors, analytics and better materials to spot problems earlier. Engineers now have access to continuous monitoring tools that can track structural behavior in real time. Issues like corrosion, vibrations causing shifting and emerging cracks can now be identified earlier than before.

Bridges are a good example. Many bridges are at or past their intended lifespans, and traditional inspections can miss subtle changes that could grow into serious problems. With real-time monitoring and predictive analytics, engineers can catch early signs of stress, extend the useful life of structures and reduce the need for major repairs. Recent innovations allow the monitoring of critical structural parameters such as local defects or stress peaks from the point of installation of the structure. This can locate failures remotely as well as measure parameters such as localization of local defects, longitudinal variation of friction losses and local stress peaks due to cracking of the concrete, which previously could not be quantified.

Risk scoring systems are also gaining traction. These models combine historical information, environmental data, structural behavior insights, and real-time monitoring to predict where problems are most likely to happen. Organizations can then prioritize repairs, improve safety planning and avoid unexpected shutdowns.

A better understanding of materials is another part of this shift. Knowing how different construction materials behave over time helps engineers build more accurate models and plan for repairs or upgrades well before issues become urgent. Many organizations are working to build a more risk-aware culture where data, alerts, and transparent reporting are a normal part of operations.

Sustainability and Risk Management

Sustainability and resilience are no longer two separate goals. They influence each other directly. Infrastructure that lasts longer and requires fewer repairs is automatically more sustainable. And systems that are monitored continuously and maintained proactively are safer and more reliable.

More projects are pairing durable, environmentally responsible materials with sensor networks and monitoring tools. This creates infrastructure that can adapt as conditions change while still meeting safety and sustainability expectations. New reporting platforms can help owners track both environmental impact and asset health in one place, making it easier to manage long-term performance and make informed funding decisions. Investors and public agencies are also paying attention.

Preparing for What’s Ahead

Infrastructure decisions in 2026 and beyond will be defined by long-term thinking, smarter investments and better use of data. Speed will still matter, but sustainability and safe performance will matter more.

Engineers and public agencies will work together to put durability and lifecycle planning at the center of project design, use digital monitoring and predictive tools to stay ahead of risk, report on both environmental and operational outcomes in clear, measurable ways, and build on a culture that values long-term reliability over short-term wins. The infrastructure we build today must serve communities well into the future.",https://img.forconstructionpros.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/santiago-adobestock-1527417203.VVqhRn0FMg.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-12-13 17:01:01.079451

Barclay mentioned his visit with local business owners was one of several community discussions he had made in recent days, including a trip to Westridge later that evening to talk about “home hardening” with deputies from the Major Crimes Bureau.
He encouraged people to exercise their rights, but to do so responsibly, adding that he knew it wasn’t a laughing matter.
“That doesn’t mean you go out and buy a 9 mm and leave it there so your young kid can get access to it.
“Because remember, on every call for service that I go on, there’s a gun in every room.","Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff’s Station Capt. Brandon Barclay, the SCV’s de facto “chief of police,” shared a message with the business community Thursday, touting another month of reduction in overall crime numbers as the department works to increase its number of deputies.

Barclay quoted Ronald Reagan, Maya Angelou and Robin Williams during his visit with the Valley Industrial Association at Margarita’s, answering questions about public-safety concerns and giving advice to residents about how to stay safe.

Barclay mentioned his visit with local business owners was one of several community discussions he had made in recent days, including a trip to Westridge later that evening to talk about “home hardening” with deputies from the Major Crimes Bureau.

The visits weren’t about responding to a crime uptick, he said Friday, it was about being proactive and making sure residents know they can dialogue with their local law enforcement agency.

Barclay shared the latest crime data revealed a 19% overall decrease in Part-I crimes, despite a 9% increase in violent crime that he said was largely attributable to a “generational gang” in Newhall that had been targeted by a significant Sheriff’s Department operation.

A veteran gang detective said in August the evidence is still being investigated and linked to other cases, and Barclay said Thursday he was hopeful the District Attorney’s Office would bring forth more prosecutions from that work.

Barclay said even though Santa Clarita’s a safe city, there are things people can do to avoid being victims of high-tech crime rings, such as one the station caught in April using drones to target homes and then WiFi jammers to knock out their camera systems.

There are also less-sophisticated “jugging” thefts, where people get followed from banks after covert surveillance helps thieves find someone who has just made a large deposit — a crime the business leaders inside the Mexican restaurant should be aware of, he said.

“I believe as Ronald Reagan said, ‘Failing to prepare is preparing to fail,’ right?” he said at one point Thursday, answering a question about how deputies were working with school districts, as well as local colleges, to train in the event of an active-shooter situation.

He later said preparation was part of the idea behind messaging for Westridge, too, in terms of reminding people about the need to thoroughly screen any workers who might have close access to their homes and some other new ways thieves are gaining access.

When asked his views on gun ownership, he responded by asking the Valencia crowd which amendment gave the right to bear arms, and a chorus responded with, “the Second.”

He quipped back, “Or as Robin Williams might say, ‘The right to arm bears,’” which drew several laughs. He encouraged people to exercise their rights, but to do so responsibly, adding that he knew it wasn’t a laughing matter.

“That doesn’t mean you go out and buy a 9 mm and leave it there so your young kid can get access to it. That’s very important,” he said, adding gun ownership was a “tremendous responsibility.”

“So, you have to then also be trained with the weapon and make sure you’re familiar with your equipment,” he said. “Because remember, on every call for service that I go on, there’s a gun in every room. Why? Because I’m bringing it there.”

The business community also asked about how it could help, in response to recent data indicating deputies are still working five to seven mandatory overtime shifts monthly to fulfill city and county policing obligations with 77% of its traditional workforce.

Barclay said the station receives great support from the city, which is working on bolstering local traffic enforcement, and the station also is looking to acquire a state-of-the-art 3D laser scanner, which is useful in forensic investigations at crime scenes.

Barclay said the station feels a lot of love and called it a “flagship” as the department’s largest, but asked, as with anything, that people remember there’s a human element, which he always tries to do when working with the community.

One of his closing sentiments was a cribbed quote he credited to Angelou, whom he called a “great civil rights activist,” with, “Say what you said, do what you do, but you’ll always remember how they made you feel.”",https://signalscv.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12204039/IMG_8520-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 16:00:17.876155

I either have to pay for software I'll hardly use or scour the internet for sketchy PDF converter websites with questionable functionality.

That's why I was excited to come across a free app called PDFgear. It's an all-in-one PDF viewer, creator, and editor available on multiple platforms so that I can use it on my Windows 11 laptop or Samsung Galaxy phone. I tried this free PDF editor for a week and won't go back to Adobe after discovering these excellent features.

100% Free

No strings attached

Trying PDFgear was a no-brainer because it's completely free, and I had nothing to lose. Many PDF apps I've tried either ask for cash upfront or lock certain features behind paywalls, which I only discovered after I've already started working on a document. Other free PDF apps require me to create unnecessary accounts to track me and sell my data.

PDFgear is free, and there's no need to create an account or log in to access the full range of features.

There's no need to create an account or log in to access the full range of features. I also appreciate that everything is straightforward, and I can work uninterrupted by unwanted ads or prompts to try other products.

Multi-platform capability

Mobile or desktop

I prefer using apps that work on my phone and laptop because they have a lower learning curve and let me sync my files between them. PDFgear works on Mac, Windows, and Android, so it's accessible to me wherever I am.

The Windows version offers a comprehensive feature set with all the bells and whistles, while the mobile version is a bit more streamlined with fewer features for on-the-go users.

PDFgear works on Mac, Windows, and Android, so it's accessible to me wherever I am.

PDFgear on my Samsung phone is good enough for my smaller tasks, and I can edit and sign documents while I'm sitting at coffee shops or train stations.

It also has a conversion feature that changes Excel files or images into PDF format. When I'm done, I can save my files to OneDrive so I can access them from my laptop later.

Turn images and documents into PDFs

I don't need to try other apps because PDF has me covered with all the conversion options I'll ever need. Accessing them is simple because they are separated into Convert from PDF and Convert to PDF pages, or I can find all of them in a single location on the All Tools page.

It only takes seconds to convert my PDFs to and from Excel, Word, JPEGs, PPTs, and other popular file formats.

Most importantly, PDFgear's conversion tools are a cinch to use. All I need to do is drag and drop the file into the app, click the Convert button, and it's done. All my converted files are saved in the PDFgear folder in Documents, or I can map them to a custom folder on my desktop.

The overall functionality is outstanding, and it only takes seconds to convert my PDFs to and from Excel, Word, JPEGs, PPTs, and other popular file formats.

Merge & Split tool

Add or remove pages from your PDFs

I often need to remove outdated pages from my resume and other documents, and the Split PDF tool makes the process easier. All I do is drag and drop the file into PDFgear and select between the Fixed or Custom range options for splitting the document.

The Custom range option lets me input specific page numbers or a range of page numbers to split. Alternatively, I can use the Fixed range to split the file into individual pages or groups of equal size.

I often need to remove outdated pages from my resume and other documents, and the Split PDF tool makes the process easier.

Merging files works similarly, and I can drag and drop all the separate PDFs I'd like to merge into a single file. This tool takes things a step further by letting me choose specific pages from multiple PDFs for the merger.

After selecting my options, I click the Merge button, and the operation completes instantly. PDFgear even opens the file's location so I can view and access it without wasting time navigating to the folder.

PDF Editor

Add text and fill forms

PDFgear offers numerous user-friendly tools to edit my documents. I can create a new PDF from scratch and add images, text, and other elements to make it exciting.

I find this feature perfect for creating flyers and other business documents. The Edit option is ideal for working on existing PDFs and lets me modify text and images, as well as add elements such as links and watermarks.

I like that PDFgear includes a Form menu to help me manage my agreements and contracts.

I like that PDFgear includes a Form menu to help me manage my agreements and contracts. I can skip reading the text and use the Highlight Form Fields to find the places to add my signature, dates, and other required information.

A mes y medio de asumir el cargo y con Colombia como hub regional, el ejecutivo peruano aterriza con una visión que cruza negocio, tecnología y propósito: duplicar el tamaño del negocio en los próximos años, fortalecer el talento local y profundizar la conexión emocional entre las marcas y los consumidores.

En esta conversación con Revista P&M, Gotuzzo detalla cómo piensa ese crecimiento, el rol de lo digital, la sostenibilidad y la relevancia estratégica de Colombia para el grupo.

Revista P&M: Regresas a Colombia después de muchos años. ¿Cómo encuentras el país y qué significa volver ahora como CEO de la región?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: Bien; la esencia es un poco la misma aunque, por supuesto, ha evolucionado. Viví en Colombia entre 2007 y 2010, fue mi primera experiencia fuera de mi país, así que volver 15 años después es especial. Hoy estoy basado acá porque el hub de la región Andina y Centroamérica está en Bogotá. Aquí está gran parte del equipo y también la planta de maquillaje en Funza. Colombia es muy importante para el grupo, así que estoy contento de regresar.

Revista P&M: Para quienes no conocen tu trayectoria, ¿Cómo resumirías ese camino profesional que hoy te trae a liderar la región?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: Soy peruano y tengo más de 25 años de experiencia. Trabajé muchos años en Kimberly Clark en distintos países de América Latina; fui gerente general de Centroamérica. Luego estuve en British American Tobacco. Después llegué a L’Oréal hace once años y he tenido una carrera internacional muy rica dentro del grupo. Fui director general del negocio de consumo masivo en Perú, luego la misma posición en Portugal y después en México, donde convertimos ese negocio en uno de los top tres del mundo en contribución al crecimiento.

Luego tuve un reto que cambió mi carrera: lideré la parte comercial y de desarrollo de negocio para Europa, con sede en París. Fueron tres años trabajando con cerca de 50 mercados y un equipo de 30 personas de 17 nacionalidades. Culturalmente fue un desafío enorme, pero uno de los aprendizajes más ricos que he tenido. Tras eso, este mes asumí el liderazgo de Centroamérica y la Región Andina.

Revista P&M: Llegas a una región donde el grupo proyecta un crecimiento acelerado. ¿Qué ambición traes exactamente?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: Hay una ambición muy clara: convertirnos en la región número uno en contribución al crecimiento de América Latina. En segundo lugar, ser uno de los top siete países del mundo para el grupo. Y tercero, duplicar el negocio en tres o cuatro años. Es un stretch ambicioso, pero factible. Para lograrlo necesitamos fortalecer el talento. He visto talento latinoamericano que es absolutamente competitivo a nivel global, y me encantaría ver colombianos, ecuatorianos, peruanos o panameños trabajando en Europa y mostrando lo que esta región puede aportar.

Revista P&M: Hablemos del Brand Love Index. L’Oréal aparece como una marca altamente admirada. ¿Cómo fortalecer esa conexión emocional?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: Es un diagnóstico muy acertado. Somos una marca aspiracional, pero aspiracional no es igual a lejano. Queremos conectar más con el consumidor colombiano, y por eso lo digital es fundamental. Las plataformas permiten contenido más relevante y entender qué necesitan los consumidores, qué conversan, qué problemas buscan resolver. El social listening nos muestra, por ejemplo, si hablan de brillo en la piel, de acné o de cabello: eso impacta nuestros lanzamientos.

También es clave trabajar con influencers que representen bien nuestras marcas y conectar experiencias offline y online. Y, por supuesto, aterrizar propósitos reales: un ejemplo es Stand Up, el programa de L’Oréal Paris para educar sobre acoso callejero. Puede sonar parisino, pero trabaja sobre un problema local, con impacto real.

Revista P&M: Ganaron “Marca del Año” en los TikTok Ad Awards. ¿Van a mantener ese nivel de apuesta digital?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: No solo mantenerlo: acelerarlo. Las plataformas nos permiten personalizar, educar y conectar. En belleza, uno de los grandes retos es educar al consumidor. Mucha gente no sabe qué usar para su piel o su cabello. Con IA y test virtuales podemos ofrecer rutinas y productos alineados a necesidades reales. Todo eso seguirá creciendo fuertemente.

Revista P&M: El mercado colombiano de belleza vive un auge de marcas locales y coreanas. ¿Cómo equilibrar la fuerza global del portafolio con la relevancia local?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: Es cierto: hay dinamismo y es positivo. El mercado de belleza creció más de 16% el año pasado. Las marcas emergentes hacen que todos seamos mejores.

Nuestro portafolio global, combinado con el entendimiento local, es una ventaja. Escuchamos al consumidor, analizamos redes, observamos tendencias y trabajamos rápido para aterrizar lanzamientos relevantes. Tenemos marcas globales y también locales como Vogue, muy fuerte en maquillaje. Todo parte de entender necesidades reales y de una agenda muy clara de innovación y tecnología.

Revista P&M: En comunicación estratégica, ¿Qué quisieras transformar?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: Reforzar el trabajo alrededor del propósito de marca. El propósito tiene un doble impacto: construye reputación corporativa y construye vínculo emocional con el consumidor. No se trata de “compra este producto”, sino de “esta marca comparte tus principios y valores”.

“Porque tú lo vales” es un buen ejemplo: habla de autoestima, resiliencia, empoderamiento. En el desfile de París, quienes participan no son escogidos por apariencia, sino por lo que representan. Historias reales, personas empoderadas.

En Centroamérica y Andina ya existe una base, pero debemos ampliar el alcance y la consistencia de esos propósitos.

Revista P&M: ¿Cómo se integra la sostenibilidad en tu visión?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: La sostenibilidad es compleja, sí, pero en L’Oréal hay convicción, no discurso. Te doy ejemplos concretos.

Cuando el plástico virgen bajó de precio post pandemia pero el reciclado subió, el grupo igual apostó por plástico reciclado en gran parte del portafolio. También desarrollamos refill y recargas en cosmética y profesional, que reducen hasta 66% del plástico. El reto es que el consumidor no está acostumbrado a recargar y tampoco quiere pagar más, así que debemos ofrecer valor: good for your wallet, good for the planet.

La planta de Funza ya opera con 100% energía renovable; 30% proviene de paneles solares. A nivel global estamos en 97% de energía renovable en plantas. Además, queremos que mínimo 10% del volumen sea de recargas a largo plazo. Esto transforma hábitos y el mercado.

Revista P&M: Hablemosde la planta de Funza. ¿Qué representa hoy para el grupo?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: Muchísimo. Hace unos años producía casi exclusivamente Vogue. Hoy produce las cuatro marcas más importantes de maquillaje para la región: Vogue, Maybelline, L’Oréal Paris y NYX. Exporta a 14 países.

El año pasado facturamos cerca de 70 millones de unidades y este año creceremos alrededor de 15%. Hay capacidad instalada para seguir creciendo y además 90% del talento de la planta es local. Y algo que me encantó: 65% de quienes trabajan allí son mujeres, desde operarias hasta el directorio. Eso muestra coherencia entre lo que decimos y lo que hacemos.

Revista P&M: ¿Qué mensaje les darías a las agencias creativas y equipos de marketing que quieren trabajar con L’Oréal?

Eduardo Gotuzzo: Que piensen 100% en el consumidor colombiano. Que busquen conectar con iniciativas frescas, nuevas, arriesgadas, siempre alineadas a la esencia de nuestras marcas.

Somos una compañía ambiciosa: queremos conquistar el mercado colombiano y la región. Las agencias y socios deben compartir ese mindset, tener ambición, foco en desarrollo del negocio, impacto positivo ambiental y un marco ético impecable. Y, sobre todo, ayudarnos a vernos más locales sin perder la aspiración global.",https://i.revistapym.com.co/cms/2025/12/13095251/eg.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-13 23:58:51.043197

Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Oracle had delayed by a year the delivery of some data centers it's developing for ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The delays were caused by material and labor shortages, according to Bloomberg.

The report weighed on Oracle's shares, already under pressure following the release of its results earlier in the week, pulling them another 4.5% lower Friday to levels not seen since June.

The company in a statement said ""all milestones remain on track.""

“There have been no delays to any sites required to meet our contractual commitments,” an Oracle spokesperson told Investopedia. “We remain fully aligned with OpenAI and confident in our ability to execute against both our contractual commitments and future expansion plans.”

Friday’s losses extended Oracle stock’s Thursday drop, when shares tumbled more than 10% after the company’s quarterly earnings fell short of expectations and revived concerns about its AI ambitions. Oracle stock lost nearly 13% of its value this week.

Oracle is aggressively investing in AI infrastructure to compete with cloud computing incumbents Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN). However, unlike its largest competitors, whose profits are paying for their data center projects, Oracle is borrowing heavily. Some investors are concerned the company will struggle to repay its debt if AI demand falls short of expectations.

Dec. 12 — Happy Friday! We cannot start this week without talking about the biggest news in Hollywood – the bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Last week, Warner Bros. announced that it would sell its movie studio and streaming business to Netflix for a whopping $72 billion. On Monday, Paramount Skydance, the other major player in the bid for Warner Bros., launched a hostile takeover bid for the entire company, including its cable networks, like CNN.

It really feels like there is no good ending in this situation. There’s the general peril of consolidation in general – less jobs, less competition, etc. – and then there’s the choice we’re left with: a tech company with open disdain for the theatrical experience taking over a historic movie studio, or a Trump-approved company (although, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos is doing a bit of cozying up himself) taking over the movie studio and the news apparatus.

The second option is obviously much worse (Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has reportedly told President Trump that he would make “sweeping changes” at CNN if he came out on top), but nothing feels GOOD. I generally don’t like to doomsday too much in this newsletter, and obviously, nothing is a done deal here – but the more I think about our options, the more everything feels bad. I’ve been reading and listening about this deal a lot this week. If you want to go more in-depth, I highly recommend this piece in The New Yorker from Richard Brody and this episode of “The Big Picture” podcast.

‘Atlanta Is…’ podcast dives into what makes the city unique

🎧 Peters Street. Morris Brown. Club 559. For any local who knows their stuff, all of these names are synonymous with Atlanta. And the new podcast “Atlanta Is…” is diving deeper into the institutions, art, and culture that make Atlanta unique.

The podcast, produced by Will Packer Productions and Complex, features eight episodes that spotlight the stories behind Atlanta’s music scene, politics, film, religion, and more. To help decide what those stories should be, the production team brought in a trio of experts.

Jewel Wicker, Maurice Garland, and Christina Lee serve as hosts of the podcast, tasked with figuring out just how those eight episodes should be divided up. With seven of the eight episodes already out (the final one drops Dec. 17), the trio has covered everything from the influence of Atlanta’s Black churches on the rest of the world to the city’s status as a Mecca for Black businesses.

‘Hamnet’ and the act of creation as communion

WEEKLY FILM REVIEW

🎭 From the moment Agnes (Jessie Buckley) and Will (Paul Mescal) – more commonly known as William Shakespeare – first meet, a particular dynamic arises. Her emotions come easy, raw, and unfiltered, while he finds it necessary to process his through art.

“Hamnet,” Chloé Zhao’s adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s 2020 novel of the same name, dramatizes that dynamic in connection with the death of the couple’s 11-year-old son Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe), which in turn inspires perhaps Shakespeare’s most famous play, “Hamlet.” (The film begins by telling us that those two names would have been interchangeable at the time.)

While a bit clunky in its narrative setup, “Hamnet” slowly nestles into your heart, evolving into a beautifully considered meditation on art and legacy, but not necessarily in the way you expect a movie that’s, at least in part, about William Shakespeare to be. Although “Hamnet” is unmistakably about grief, it feels trite to pin its considerations down to just the process of dealing with unimaginable loss. Instead, “Hamnet” is also about the pain and joy of creation, both in parenthood and art. It’s about two people in a constant dance with each other and the world, reckoning with their pasts in an attempt to build something stronger together.

Spotlight: Benicio del Toro in ‘One Battle After Another’

🍻 My favorite section of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” is the part that involves Sensei Sergio St. Carlos (Benicio del Toro), and his “Latino Harriet Tubman situation.”

When the authorities crack down on the sanctuary city where our main characters live, Sensei works to smuggle immigrants out of the city via a hidden passageway (hence the Harriet Tubman reference). The sequence is the film’s most electric, the camera following Sensei and the hapless Bob (Leonardo DiCaprio) through an ever-expanding network of hallways and rooms, each hiding another person under Sensei’s care.

The reason this sequence, to be frank, rocks so damn hard is that it’s quietly getting at one of the main themes of the film — the importance of community within the context of a revolution. DiCaprio’s Bob isolates himself from the rest of the world. He did this when he was with the far-left group, The French 75, and he does so now that that part of his life is over. In contrast, Sensei knows everybody in town. As the sequence unfolds, it’s clear he has made a point to make himself an integral part of this community, gaining trust from even its most vulnerable members – and even from Bob and his daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti), who don’t trust anyone.

That’s in the text, but so much of the reason the audience believes in Sensei is due to del Toro’s performance. He’s always had an edge of cool about him, and here he uses it to great effect. He glides through rooms, calm and collected, but with purpose, a foil to Bob’s stumbling, zig-zagging gait. Sensei is funny, but content for those in authority to mistake him for silly – his little dance upon being caught by the cops (pictured above) betrays just enough goofiness so that he’s not taken seriously, and so that he can continue to scoot by unnoticed. But somehow, del Toro is able to imbue a guy who necessarily has to fly under the radar with so much raw power. It’s that Clint Eastwood kind of power – the kind where he doesn’t have to raise his voice to command attention, or deliver an order. The people who know him – and he makes sure his community knows him – would never mistake his good nature for guilelessness. He always has a plan.

Lights, Camera, Action!

✍️ Speaking of “One Battle After Another,” I really love this piece about the movie from critic Angelica Jade Bastién. Since the film’s release, there’s been a lot of chatter about its handling of Black female characters, and I think Bastién does a great job at exploring those issues with nuance – celebrating the complicated characters at the center of the story and giving kudos to the amazing actresses who play them, all while considering where Anderson’s script might have fallen short.

🎙️ When the Golden Globes nominations came out, who else could I turn to but my old trusty prognosticators at the “Little Gold Men” podcast? Take a listen to this recent episode where they talk about the biggest snubs and surprises.

🏊‍♀️ Kristen Stewart made headlines this week for breaking down her issues with how some actors (namely, men) approach The Method, and the art of acting in itself. That was only a small bit of an interview she recently did with David Marchese of the New York Times, talking about her directorial debut, “The Chronology of Water.” You can read the whole thing – light Marlon Brando shade included – here.

ADNOC Distribution, the UAE’s largest fuel and convenience retailer, will begin accepting AE Coin stablecoin payments across nearly 980 service stations in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.

The move follows a partnership with Al Maryah Community Bank, enabling customers to pay using AE Coin via the AEC Wallet at fuel pumps, Oasis by ADNOC convenience stores, and car wash services.

What Is AE Coin?

AE Coin is the first stablecoin licensed by the UAE Central Bank and is backed 1:1 with the dirham, making it suitable for regulated, everyday transactions rather than speculation.

Why This Matters

By integrating stablecoin payments at scale, ADNOC is pushing crypto beyond online use cases and into real world retail. The rollout shows how regulated stablecoins can function within existing financial systems while offering faster and more flexible digital payments.

Bottom Line

ADNOC’s adoption of AE Coin marks a major step for stablecoin usage in the Middle East, reinforcing the UAE’s position as a leader in regulated crypto innovation and real world blockchain adoption.

S&P: pressure on Poland’s rating may increase

S&P Global Ratings warns that pressure on Poland’s credit rating could increase if the country’s medium-term economic growth outlook deteriorates significantly, especially alongside rising macroeconomic imbalances or external shocks such as spillovers from Russia’s war against Ukraine. The agency notes that deep fiscal consolidation will be difficult ahead of the 2027 parliamentary elections, given strong political polarization.

These risks are partly offset by Poland’s resilient economy, solid growth prospects, moderate inflation, and continued access to EU financial support.

Who Are Marsh & McLennan’s Top Shareholders?

Marsh & McLennan’s shareholder base is anchored by large passive institutions that tend to hold through market cycles, supporting long term ownership stability. Active managers have adjusted positions in both directions, pointing to valuation sensitivity rather than a broad shift in confidence.

The Vanguard Group: 45,974,310 shares (9.38%), ~$8.56B value. Added 37,713 shares (+0.08%).

BlackRock Institutional Trust Company: 25,480,279 shares (5.20%), ~$4.74B value. Added 18,616 shares (+0.07%).

State Street Investment Management: 21,538,014 shares (4.40%), ~$4.01B value. Added 96,436 shares (+0.45%).

Capital International Investors: 18,590,697 shares (3.79%), ~$3.46B value. Added 221,033 shares (+1.20%).

Capital World Investors: 17,702,898 shares (3.61%), ~$3.30B value. Added 92,767 shares (+0.53%).

Wellington Management Company: 15,091,478 shares (3.08%), ~$2.81B value. Added 1,260,434 shares (+9.11%).

Fidelity Management & Research: 13,745,203 shares (2.81%), ~$2.56B value. Cut 3,680,844 shares (-21.12%).

Geode Capital Management: 12,967,908 shares (2.65%), ~$2.41B value. Added 283,698 shares (+2.24%).

Capital Research Global Investors: 9,861,067 shares (2.01%), ~$1.84B value. Added 68,826 shares (+0.70%).

MFS Investment Management: 9,257,167 shares (1.89%), ~$1.72B value. Cut 208,515 shares (-2.20%).

T. Rowe Price Associates: 7,542,071 shares (1.54%), ~$1.40B value. Cut 1,776,094 shares (-19.06%).

Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street continue to anchor Marsh & McLennan’s ownership, while additions from Wellington contrast with trims from Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, and for investors this pattern suggests stable institutional support with selective, valuation driven repositioning.

Hedge Fund Highlights

Two Sigma Advisors, co founded by John Overdeck, sharply increased its Marsh & McLennan position last quarter, boosting its stake by over 200% to roughly $264M value, which may reflect confidence in MMC’s defensive earnings profile and margin stability.

Citadel Advisors, led by Ken Griffin, raised its exposure by nearly 180%, bringing its position to about $79M value, a move that appears consistent with building positions in highly liquid, institutionally supported companies during periods of share price consolidation.

Gotham Asset Management, founded by Joel Greenblatt, expanded its stake by roughly 158% to around $23M value, which could suggest Gotham views Marsh & McLennan’s recent pullback as attractive relative to its long term cash flow consistency.

AQR Capital Management, co founded by Cliff Asness, lifted its stake by nearly 140%, now holding about $208M value of Marsh & McLennan shares, and for investors this hedge fund activity points to selective accumulation rather than broad speculation.

Marsh & McLennan’s Recent Insider Trades

Insider filings show several small transactions across executives and directors. The activity appears modest relative to Marsh & McLennan’s size and does not materially change insider ownership.

John Q. Doyle (Officer): Sold 21,079 shares at ~$182.22 and acquired 21,079 shares at ~$63.09.

Steven A. Mills (Director): Acquired 231 shares at ~$183.28.

Morton O. Schapiro (Director): Acquired 652 shares across two trades.

Lloyd M. Yates (Director): Acquired 248 shares across two trades.

Jane H. Lute (Director): Acquired 182 shares across two trades.

Deborah C. Hopkins (Director): Acquired 97 shares.

Anthony K. Anderson (Director): Acquired 76 shares.

Tamara Ingram (Director): Acquired 37 shares.

Jan Siegmund (Director): Acquired 5 shares.

The small size and dispersed nature of these transactions make it difficult to draw a strong directional signal, and it appears insiders are maintaining exposure rather than making aggressive changes, which for investors aligns with the steady institutional positioning seen elsewhere in the shareholder base.

What the Ownership & Insider Trade Data Tell Us

Marsh & McLennan’s ownership remains firmly anchored by large passive institutions, while hedge fund activity shows selective accumulation from several well known managers. Insider trades appear limited in scale and do not suggest a meaningful shift in sentiment.

Taken together, the data supports the view that Marsh & McLennan continues to be regarded as a durable, cash generative business with stable long term fundamentals, and for investors the ownership picture reinforces confidence in the company’s earnings durability and pricing power despite recent share price volatility.

Also Read: Hyderabad Gains Momentum In Global Cloud Race Hyderabad Strengthens Role As Innovation Hub","Hyderabad’s position as one of India’s fastest-growing technology corridors has received a fresh boost, with three global corporations—Costco, Western Union and Stolt-Nielsen committing to establish new global capability centres (GCCs) in the city. The decision follows the recent Telangana Rising Global Summit, reinforcing Hyderabad’s push to attract long-term, technology-led investments that align with sustainable and inclusive urban development goals.

American retail major Costco plans to build a centre that will eventually employ more than 500 professionals. According to a senior official familiar with the development, the facility will become a core pillar of Costco’s global digital infrastructure, supporting functions such as data analytics, AI-driven operations and supply-chain optimisation. Industry analysts note that such centres not only enhance business efficiency but also help create knowledge-intensive local jobs that contribute to a more resilient and equitable urban economy. UK-based logistics company Stolt-Nielsen is also establishing a digital innovation hub in Hyderabad. The hub will anchor its product development, DevOps and data-intensive operational systems. Experts say the decision reflects a growing shift among international logistics players to diversify technology operations into cities that offer strong engineering talent and reliable urban services—two factors that Hyderabad has consistently strengthened through long-term planning and infrastructure upgrades.

Meanwhile, Western Union has confirmed that Hyderabad will host its second India-based GCC. Developed through a Build-Operate-Transfer model with HCLTech, the centre is expected to employ more than 400 people. A senior executive from the company noted that the facility would accelerate Western Union’s digital transformation strategy, focusing on platform engineering and next-generation financial technologies. This expansion is particularly significant at a time when global financial firms are increasingly seeking cities that combine regulatory stability with innovation ecosystems capable of supporting large-scale digital operations. Government officials stated that the announcements stem from Hyderabad’s continued efforts to project itself as a city where global firms can scale sustainably supported by robust public transport, green urban initiatives and planned digital infrastructure. Urban planners say that the clustering of GCCs also supports environmental goals by enabling densification, reducing commute distances and stimulating demand for mixed-use, walkable neighbourhoods.

In a parallel development, Google and the Telangana government have launched a Google for Startups Hub at T-Hub, offering workspace and mentoring support to AI-led regional startups. The initiative aims to strengthen local entrepreneurship while ensuring that emerging digital businesses have equitable access to resources, networks and investment opportunities. While the immediate impact of these new GCCs will be reflected in job creation and increased investment flows, analysts emphasise that their long-term value lies in shaping Hyderabad into a more inclusive and future-ready city one where global technology, urban sustainability and local talent can advance together.

The sole dissenting vote came from Councilman Bryan Bain.

Final approval is pending compliance with all Federal Aviation Administration regulations.

Where will the Walmart drone delivery be based?

Clermont city leaders approved a variance for Walmart to create a dedicated drone hub at its store on Johns Lake Road, just off U.S. 27.

Questions arose about privacy because drones fly over private yards. There was also a discussion about bothersome noise and the intrusiveness of unattractive shipping container hubs. Noise levels and safety concerns, such as crossing busy roads to retrieve delivered items, came up.

How far will the delivery radius be?

Expect residents and businesses within a 6- to 8-mile radius to qualify for the drone deliveries from Walmart.

This is what it sounds like when drones fly

Some have described the devices, somewhat oxymoronically, as sounding like a ""quiet lawnmower.""

Social media short videos show deliveries in process on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. The humming sound is more high-pitched than a lawnmower but not as loud.

What were some positives brought up about the new service?

City planners said the drones could cut down on local traffic with fewer delivery trucks and a reduction in shoppers driving to Walmart.

What do people typically have delivered?

According to Walmart, customers are using drone delivery for items they may have forgotten during their weekly grocery trip or for urgent care items, such as over-the-counter cold and flu medicine, baby formula and COVID tests. Among the most frequently delivered products are pet food, fresh fruit such as bananas, lemons and limes, eggs and ice cream.

Which company will supply the drones?

According to a Fox News report, Walmart has worked with Wing, Zipline and DroneUp, with some past collaboration with Flytrex

When will the drones start flying?

If all goes as planned, the drone program could launch within the next few months.

Where are the Walmart drones being tried out?

Texas, Florida and North Carolina

How much will it cost? What app do you use?

Delivery would be free for Walmart Plus members and $19.99 for nonmembers.

Customers order small essentials (groceries, medicine, etc.) via the Wing Drone Delivery app for delivery in under 30 minutes, often within minutes.

Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando and Tampa Walmart customers can sign up on Wing’s website to be notified when drone delivery becomes available in their area by visiting wing.com/walmart.

What's the heaviest package delivered by Walmart's drones?

Items eligible for drone delivery would weigh a little more than 2 pounds or less.

Where won't the drones fly?

Mayor Tim Murray asked city planners if the drones would be restricted from flying over State Road 50 or U.S. 27. No word yet if that restriction has been confirmed.

Or is the 99-year-old airline pioneer on a comeback path?

There is no doubt that American Airlines has its share of issues, from high rates of flight delays and cancellations to customer experience issues like reduced legroom, a lack of seat-back entertainment screens on many flights, and tiny lavatories on its single-aisle planes. The airline has also been over-exposed, compared to its Big Three rivals, to what has been an anemic domestic market in 2025.

The airline also has large amounts of debt. For example, in 2021 the airline launched more than $7 billion in bonds using its frequent flyer program as collateral. Why? At the height of the COVID shutdown of world airlines, American’s AAdvantage loyalty program was valued at between $18 billion and $30 billion, while the airline itself was worth less than $7 billion.

American Airlines has also shown poor stock performance. American Airlines stock (AAL) closed at 9.82 on May 4, 2020, the day it was announced that Warren Buffet had sold off his 10% stake. Five and a half years later, after government bailouts and the airlines’ post-COVID recovery soared to all-time passenger highs, AAL still trades around $15.

Some say that many issues American Airlines faces come from a corporate culture that historically prioritized efficiency over customer and employee satisfaction. This can make it difficult to compete with airlines that prioritize service and comfort like Delta, particularly in the most profitable classes of service like First, Business and Premium Economy.

To move forward, American Airlines is betting on such premium travelers, with more upscale seats, and more and updated Flagship Lounges and Admirals Clubs.

But to this point, the airline continues to lag its main competitors, Delta and United. United CEO Scott Kirby has not only implied that American is ‘cooked’ he has added that the U.S airline market will soon be dominated by just two full-service, brand-loyal carriers. To Kirby, these ‘winners’ are Delta and, no surprise, United. In his view, the other airlines, like American, will be left to compete on price rather than premium service or customer loyalty.

Despite Kirby’s words, American is actually the U.S. airline market share leader, controlling about 21% of the U.S. domestic airlines market, followed by Delta with 19%, Southwest 18%, and United with 16%. American also remains the largest US carrier by fleet size and passenger capacity, serving a broad domestic and global network.

Still, there’s no denying that American has problems, from customer satisfaction to profitability.

On October 23, American reported record third-quarter revenue of $13.7 billion. However, unlike the other members of the Big Three, American lost money with a third-quarter GAAP net loss of $114 million, ($0.17) per diluted share. Delta is the profitability and revenue leader, while Unite had quarterly revenue of $15.23 billion with net income of $949 million excluding adjustments.

But as Robert Isom, CEO of American said of an earlier gibe by United’s CEO in May, “Scott says this kind of stuff I’m sure because he would like nothing better than to not have American Airlines as a competitor.” Isom added that American boasted a great fleet of aircraft, a strong Sunbelt position from its growing Dallas and Charlotte bases, and a partnership with Japan Airlines for trans-Pacific flyers.

In July, Isom countered additional negative comments by United CEO Kirby, saying, “We don’t run our airline based on other airlines’ perception of our business”

The truth is that many U.S. airlines share American’s problems. By one “best” airline metric, the Skytrax World’s Top 100 Airlines survey, American Airlines is 83rd among world airlines for service, one notch above Air India. But most American airlines fared poorly, with Delta ranked 22nd, United 51st, Jet Blue 52nd Alaska 69th and Southwest 76th. Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, and ANA, All Nippon Airways, finished in the top five.

Similarly, according to the most recent J.D. Power North America Airline Satisfaction study, American ranked last among six airlines in the First/Business Class category. With a maximum possible score of 1,000 points, JetBlue Airways led with 738, followed by Delta Air Lines at 724, Alaska Airlines 709, United Airlines 690 and Air Canada 686. American trailed at 684.

But if American’s new premium initiatives succeed at all, leap-frogging Air Canada and United will requires less than ten points worth of improvement.

American has stated its intention to do just that, by accelerating its lounge expansion, including recent openings in Philadelphia and offering a new a grab-and-go option in Charlotte. The airline also plans for more Flagship Lounges and Admirals Clubs at major hubs, as well as upgrades and yes, increases in lounge capacity in 2026.

And according to Aviation Week, American is looking to grow what can be a profitable international flight profile. Additional long range aircraft such as the wide body Boeing 787-9 and the Airbus A321XLR will be added to the fleet.

In addition to its highly successful, 45-year-old AAdvantage loyalty program, American is part of the OneWorld airline alliance. In October, I took advantage of both programs and used Atmos miles on Alaska to fly to Hawaii, flying back to LAX from Maui on American.

I sat in the back in an aisle economy seat. Comfortable enough for the five hour flight, it was an adequate, if not luxury, experience. I liked the little seatback rack American now offers in economy to park your phone at eyelevel to watch its free streaming entertainment.

More importantly, I liked American’s partnership with Alaska, which allowed me to get a round trip ticket for 50,000 Alaska Atmos points and ten bucks. Booking and flying the two airlines was simple and seamless.

American pioneered the points and miles system, and there are millions of people with AAdvantage accounts. Businesses also buy points to bundle with their products and services.

Like anything else the popularity of the AAdvantage program can be pushed too far. American is now offering a $5000 AAdvantage pass for holiday travel, that includes a rather skimpy 100,000 miles, AAdvantage Gold status and 15,000 loyalty points.

Still, such efforts are a way to build on American’s past successes. American is also aiming a special FIFA World Cup promotion directly at its millions of AAdvantage members.

For the World Cup, American is adding more seats and flights between the 16 host cities of the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada. For the matches in June and July, 27,000 seats on a dozen routes, like Boston-Dallas, Atlanta-Miami and Los Angeles-Seattle will be added. AAdvantage members can also redeem miles for early access to World Cup tickets starting Dec. 17.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/665a737587f1f0abbe4dee29/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-13 08:59:29.999645

A panel of human judges then decide if the model’s work matches or exceeds the output of a skilled human worker.

GPT-5.2 Pro, a larger and more expensive version of the model, fared even better with a 74.1 percent GDPVal score.

OpenAI wrote that GPT‑5.2 completed the GDPval tasks 11 times faster than expert humans at just 1 percent of the cost, “suggesting that when paired with human oversight, GPT‑5.2 can help with professional work.”

With global obesity prevalence climbing and existing treatments failing to meet the scale of demand, Eli Lilly's Retatrutide has emerged as a standout contender. This triple-agonist (GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon) drug has demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in Phase III trials, positioning

to dominate a market projected to exceed $100 billion by the late 2020s. For investors, the question is no longer whether Retatrutide will succeed, but how quickly it can reshape the competitive landscape and deliver outsized returns.

A New Benchmark in Efficacy

According to a report by FierceBiotech, Eli Lilly's TRIUMPH-4 trial results for Retatrutide in 2025 set a new standard for weight loss outcomes. Patients receiving the 12 mg dose achieved an average 28.7% reduction in body weight over 68 weeks, while the 9 mg dose resulted in 26.4% weight loss

. These figures far outpace the 22.5% weight loss reported for Mounjaro (tirzepatide) after 72 weeks and the 14% loss seen with Ozempic (semaglutide) . Beyond weight reduction, Retatrutide also showed a 75.8% improvement in knee osteoarthritis pain scores, a critical differentiator for patients with comorbid conditions . The drug's ability to address cardiovascular risk factors further strengthens its value proposition. Data from Lilly's investor statement reveals significant reductions in non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hsCRP, alongside a 14 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure in the highest-dose group . These outcomes suggest Retatrutide could appeal not only to obesity specialists but also to cardiologists and primary care physicians, broadening its market reach.

Outpacing the Competition

Retatrutide's triple-agonist mechanism gives it a clear edge over dual-agonists like tirzepatide and semaglutide. As noted in a comparative analysis by The NNT, Retatrutide's 28.7% weight loss at 68 weeks exceeds the 22.5% and 14% benchmarks of its rivals, even when accounting for differences in trial duration

. This superior efficacy could drive rapid adoption among patients who have not responded adequately to existing therapies, a population estimated to represent 30-40% of obese individuals .

However, the drug's safety profile introduces complexity. Adverse events such as nausea, diarrhea, and dysesthesia-reported in 20.9% of patients on the 12 mg dose-have led to higher discontinuation rates (18.2%) compared to 4% in placebo groups

. While these side effects are consistent with the class, they highlight the need for careful patient selection. Notably, discontinuation rates were lower in patients with higher baseline BMIs, suggesting Retatrutide may be most effective for individuals with severe obesity-a segment where unmet need is acute .

Strategic Positioning in a $100B+ Market

The obesity drug market is expanding rapidly, fueled by rising obesity rates, increased awareness of metabolic health, and the approval of novel therapies. Retatrutide's potential to capture a significant share of this growth hinges on its ability to balance efficacy with tolerability. Lilly's pipeline strategy-with additional Phase III trials slated for 2026-will be critical in addressing safety concerns and optimizing dosing regimens

.

For investors, the key catalysts include regulatory approval timelines, pricing power, and differentiation from competitors. Given Retatrutide's superior weight loss outcomes, it is well-positioned to command premium pricing, particularly if it secures indications for comorbidities like osteoarthritis or cardiovascular disease. Analysts estimate that a drug achieving 25%+ weight loss could capture 20-30% of the obesity market within three years of launch, translating to annual revenues exceeding $15 billion

.

Risks and Mitigants

The primary risks to Retatrutide's success include adverse event management, regulatory delays, and competition from emerging therapies. However, Lilly's experience with GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Jardiance) and its robust R&D pipeline provide a strong foundation for mitigating these challenges. The company's focus on patient-centric dosing strategies-such as gradual dose escalation-could reduce side effects and improve adherence

. Additionally, Lilly's partnerships with payers and healthcare providers will be crucial in navigating reimbursement hurdles.

Conclusion: A Strategic Buy for 2026

Eli Lilly's Retatrutide represents a paradigm shift in obesity treatment, combining best-in-class efficacy with a differentiated mechanism. While safety concerns warrant caution, the drug's potential to redefine weight loss outcomes and address comorbidities positions it as a cornerstone therapy in an expanding market. For investors with a medium- to long-term horizon, Retatrutide's anticipated 2026 regulatory milestones and market launch make Lilly a strategic buy. The company's ability to execute on its clinical and commercial roadmap could unlock significant value, cementing its leadership in one of the most dynamic sectors of the pharmaceutical industry.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1765614933482.jpg.png,N,,2025-12-13 11:05:07.040966

Ruby GregoryLocal Democracy Reporting Service

A former crown court in London is to be demolished and replaced with student accommodation and social housing after the plans were approved by councillors.

iQ Student Accommodation will redevelop Blackfriars Crown Court, building accommodation for 600 students as well as 71 affordable homes.

Southwark Council's planning committee voted to grant permission for the scheme, which will transform the site on Pocock Street, which has been vacant for six years.

The building was originally constructed in the post-war period for use as a printworks HM Stationery Office, before later becoming a court.

The planning committee was told by an iQ representative that the development would provide ""high-quality and well managed student housing, and much needed affordable housing in the heart of Southwark"".

Under the proposals, the student accommodation will be contained in one block and will be made up of 350 studios and 40 shared flats.

Students will have access to communal spaces including a cinema, karaoke room and gym.

At its tallest, the housing block will be six storeys and will be made up of entirely affordable housing, including 23 one-beds, 34 two-beds, six three-beds and eight four-beds. A café as well as commercial floorspace is also set to be built on site.

During the public consultation stage, the plans received two objections from the public, with concern raised over a lack of affordable housing, the concentration of student housing in the area, as well as the impacts on privacy and sunlight.

In a report, a planning officer responded, saying the scheme was ""considered appropriate for the area"" and the plan for 40% affordable housing was ""very good.""

Blackfriars Crown Court was one of hundreds of courts to be shut between 2010 and 2019 in an effort to cut costs and streamline the judicial system.

The Ministry of Justice said at the time that its closure would ""represent improved value for money for the taxpayer and help us improve facilities for court users"".

But closures have been criticised as the crown court backlog in England and Wales has risen to a new record of almost 80,000 cases and wait times for trial dates have reached up to four years.

Her Majesty's Court & Tribunal Service told The Law Society Gazette that it had enquired about temporarily using the site whilst redevelopment plans were drawn up, but ""the venue was only available for a short period of time and the offer did not represent value for money.""

""We're thrilled to bring Photoshop, Adobe Express and Acrobat directly into ChatGPT, combining our creative innovations with the ease of ChatGPT to make creativity accessible for everyone,"" said David Wadhwani, president, digital media, Adobe.
An example prompt for Photoshop is: ""Adobe Photoshop, help me blur the background of this image.""
Express for design Adobe Express for ChatGPT brings template-driven design into the chatbot.
Photoshop, Adobe Express and Acrobat for ChatGPT are free for ChatGPT users around the world.","Adobe has released new versions of Photoshop, Adobe Express and Adobe Acrobat that run directly inside ChatGPT, offering free access to the tools for the chatbot's global user base.

The integration places three of Adobe's best-known creative and document products inside one of the world's most widely used conversational AI platforms. ChatGPT has more than 800 million weekly users, according to the announcement.

The move extends Adobe's recent focus on conversational interfaces and AI assistants. It also widens the reach of its software to people who may not use the company's standalone applications.

Users can access the tools by naming an app and giving a plain-language instruction in the chat. ChatGPT then loads the relevant Adobe experience and guides the user through the requested task.

People can edit images, create visual designs or work with PDFs inside the chat window. They do not need to open separate desktop or mobile applications.

Adobe said the apps are now available for ChatGPT users on desktop, web and iOS. Adobe Express for ChatGPT is also available on Android. Support for Photoshop and Acrobat on Android is planned.

""We're thrilled to bring Photoshop, Adobe Express and Acrobat directly into ChatGPT, combining our creative innovations with the ease of ChatGPT to make creativity accessible for everyone,"" said David Wadhwani, president, digital media, Adobe. ""Now hundreds of millions of people can edit with Photoshop simply by using their own words, right inside a platform that's already part of their day-to-day.""

Conversational editing

The new apps place familiar Adobe features inside a conversational workflow. Users can describe the edit they want and then refine the result through follow-up prompts.

They can also switch from text-based instructions to on-screen controls. The Photoshop experience inside ChatGPT includes interface elements such as sliders for brightness or contrast.

An example prompt for Photoshop is: ""Adobe Photoshop, help me blur the background of this image."" The system then identifies the image, applies background blur and offers options for further changes.

Adobe said the approach allows step-by-step refinement. Users can ask for adjustments until the output matches their intent.

Photoshop in chat

Photoshop for ChatGPT focuses on core image editing functions. Users can alter specific regions of a picture, such as a background or a subject.

They can adjust brightness, contrast and exposure from within the chat. They can also apply effects such as Glitch and Glow.

Adobe stated that the image tools are designed to preserve visual quality while changes are applied. The chat-based interface sits on top of Adobe's existing imaging technology.

Express for design

Adobe Express for ChatGPT brings template-driven design into the chatbot. Users can browse the Express library of layouts and graphics from within the conversation.

They can select a template for occasions such as events, social posts or marketing materials. They then fill in text, swap images and add simple animations.

All of these steps occur inside the ChatGPT environment. Users do not need to move between different design tools while they iterate on a piece of content.

Adobe said the Express integration targets people who want quick, branded or polished assets without spending time learning complex design software.

Acrobat for PDFs

Acrobat for ChatGPT focuses on PDF management and text handling. Users can edit PDFs inside the chat, extract passages of text or pull out tables.

The app can merge several files, organise page order and compress large documents. It can also convert other file types into PDFs.

Adobe said the conversion process maintains layout and formatting. Acrobat for ChatGPT also includes tools for redacting sensitive details.

That means users can remove confidential information from documents before they share or export them.

AI and MCP context

The launch follows a series of AI-related updates across Adobe's portfolio this year. Earlier, the company introduced Acrobat Studio, which creates interactive workspaces on top of static documents.

Acrobat Studio allows users to ask questions of their PDFs and generate new content from them. It uses conversational prompts and AI models to summarise and reformat information.

At its MAX conference, Adobe also unveiled AI Assistants in Photoshop and Adobe Express. These tools turn text instructions into creative outputs and then allow detailed manual edits using Adobe's toolsets.

Adobe is also working on an AI Assistant for its Firefly generative service. The company said this assistant will support workflows that run across multiple Adobe apps and external environments.

The ChatGPT integrations use Adobe's work on agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. This protocol manages how tools interact with AI models and user data across different systems.

Route into full apps

Adobe said the ChatGPT experiences form an entry point into its broader product range. People can start a project inside ChatGPT and then move into the full desktop or mobile apps when they need more detailed control.

The transition preserves the state of the work so users can continue editing without repeating earlier steps. This approach links low-friction, text-based creation with deeper professional workflows.

Photoshop, Adobe Express and Acrobat for ChatGPT are free for ChatGPT users around the world. They are available immediately across supported platforms.",https://itbrief.co.nz/uploads/story/2025/12/13/compatible_laptop_workspace_photo_editing_pdf_design_ai_brain_interface.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 02:58:53.972584

DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. has stepped up technology in its popular F-150 pickup to combat the ever-evolving techniques car thieves have at their disposal.

It is the latest cat-and-mouse move that the automaker hopes will help customers avoid the costly and frustrating process that occurs when vehicles are swiped and includes a feature that won’t allow an engine to start even if a key fob is in the pickup.

Motor vehicle thefts recently have been on the decline in the U.S. after several years of increases. Still, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that more than 850,000 vehicles were stolen in the U.S. in 2024, pegging losses at $8 billion.

But thefts dropped 23% during the first six months of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, according to an analysis by the National Insurance Crime Bureau.

Ford’s F-150 was in the top 10 of most stolen models.

“F-150s have been the bestselling vehicle for decades, so there are a lot of them on the road,” said Christian Moran, Ford Secure general manager. “Thieves do like to go after pickup trucks. They also like to go after the contents that are often in pickup trucks. Oftentimes, there are people who have thousands of dollars worth of tools and products in the back that are valuable above and beyond what the vehicle is worth.”

Ford’s Stolen Vehicle Services, which was launched with the 2024 F-150 model year, added a “Start Inhibit” feature that allows owners to disable an F-150’s engine from a smartphone by using the FordPass app. This makes it impossible for a thief to start the pickup.

That was expanded in the 2025 model year to include the F-250 Super Duty pickup. Ford plans to extend it to other vehicles in the 2026 model year.

The security package comes with the purchase of a pickup and is included for one year once activated. The cost after the first year is $7.99 per month.

Technology matching wits with thieves

F-150 owners can receive alerts to their smartphones of potential thefts that include an unauthorized person entering their pickup, whether doors are ajar and if the vehicle is moved or towed.

One of the strongest features of the security package is the coordination with police agencies, Moran said.

It works this way. Once an owner realizes or is notified that their pickup has been stolen, the owner is encouraged to call police and file a report. The owner then contacts a Ford call center, which confirms with police that a theft report was completed. The call center coordinates efforts with police to use “Start Inhibit” to shut down the engine and to pinpoint where the pickup stopped.

“Usually, within an hour is when we try to work as hard as we can to get those vehicles,” said Officer Ibrahim Kakish, a member of the Detroit police commercial auto theft section. “The sooner we get the vehicle, the better. The vehicle is more likely to be intact.”

Security measures up, thefts trending down

Auto theft is lucrative as some vehicles, especially high-end and luxury models, are targeted for resale. Other stolen vehicles are used to commit crimes like carjackings and smash-and-grab robberies at jewelry, liquor and other retail stores.

“We used to say most of the people stealing cars were joyriders,” said Thomas Burke, a retired New York City police detective and a current director with the Chesapeake, Virginia-based International Association of Auto Theft Investigators.

“There are very few joyriders, now,” Burke added. “It’s all professional. They steal them, change the (vehicle identification) numbers and sell them.”

Thieves seek out easy targets like key fobs left in vehicles. They also break into a vehicle to reprogram its computer to accept another key, Burke said.

But it appears security measures are working.

“In New York in 1990, we had 196,000 cars stolen in one year,” Burke said. “This year, so far, a little over 10,000 have been stolen, and that’s out of more than 3.5 million cars registered.”

Motor vehicle theft in Detroit decreased from 9,260 in 2023 to 8,408 last year, according to the city’s police department. So far this year, there have been 1,837 fewer thefts than in 2024.

“We’re finding out ways that they’re stealing vehicles, and we work with companies to try to get that stopped,” Kakish said.",https://www.akronnewsreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pic_1_and_cutline_to_run_with_US-Steal-My-Truck_67546-1.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-12-13 07:58:55.457234

CEO Hock Tan said Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.
Broadcom also said it had a $73 billion backlog of AI orders over the next 18 months.
Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note on Friday that ""AI angst"" was driving Broadcom's shares lower.","Broadcom's quarterly results and guidance sailed past Wall Street estimates. It didn't matter.

The chipmaker's shares plummeted 11% on Friday, their worst day since January, as investors ran for the exits on the artificial intelligence trade. Oracle dropped 4.5% a day after plunging 10% following its earnings report.

Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices , the two leading makers of graphics processing units for AI workloads, slid about 3% and 5%, respectively.

AI has been the driver for the stock market and the broader economy this year, so any negative sentiment has potentially far-reaching consequences. The Nasdaq on Friday fell about 1.69%, and the S&P 500 declined by 1%.

The companies getting hit the hardest are the ones most closely tied to AI infrastructure, which has been booming as hyperscalers build out their data centers to try and meet what they describe as insatiable demand for compute-intensive AI services. Broadcom makes custom chips for many of the the largest tech companies, and saw its market cap about double each of the past two years before rallying again in 2025.

""This stock is up 75-80% year to date. You're seeing a little bit of a pullback,"" Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho, told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Friday. ""We would be buyers on this pullback.""

Mizuho raised its price target on the stock to $450 from $435. It closed on Friday just below $360.

""This is still where the growth is,"" Rakesh said. ""They are still the big supplier to Google on their entire hardware stack, to Meta , to Anthropic and even OpenAI coming down the road.""

Broadcom reported revenue growth of 28% during the quarter, largely due to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, to a total of $18.02 billion, topping the $17.49 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 adjusted topped the $1.86 average estimate.

CEO Hock Tan said Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.

One concern among investors is that margins are coming down, at least in the short term, due to higher up-front costs. CFO Kirsten Spears said on the earnings call that ""gross margins will be lower"" for some of Broadcom's AI chip systems because the company will have to buy more parts to produce the server racks.

Broadcom also said it had a $73 billion backlog of AI orders over the next 18 months. Part of that is from $21 billion of orders from Anthropic, which the company revealed as a key customer on Thursday.

While OpenAI has been a highly touted customer following a multibillion-dollar agreement announced in October, Tan doused some hope for the deal, telling investors late Thursday that, ""We do not expect much in '26.""

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note on Friday that ""AI angst"" was driving Broadcom's shares lower.

""Frankly we aren't sure what else one could desire as the company's AI story continues to not only overdeliver but is doing it at an accelerating rate,"" Rasgon, who recommends buying the stock and raised his price target, wrote in the note.

Oracle has been facing more extreme skepticism. The stock is now down more than 40% from its record reached in September. The company beat on earnings but missed on revenue in its report on Wednesday, and investors were disappointed they didn't get more detail on how Oracle will finance its massive buildout that so far has required mounds of debt.

CoreWeave , which is investing in data centers to offer cloud-based AI services, sank 10% on Friday and has lost more than half its value since peaking in June.

Assassinations and helping separatists inside Pakistan pose minimal diplomatic risks to India — unlike in the United States and Canada.","The military and geostrategic implications of the India–Pakistan conflict in May 2025 after the Pahalgam attack have been widely discussed. But India’s campaign against Islamic militants inside Pakistan has received less attention.

Since 2021, India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) is reported to have targeted at least twenty Pakistani militants through an elaborate network of intelligence agents and mercenaries. The targets belonged to prominent jihadi organisations and were alleged by India to have been involved in major terrorist attacks since the 1990s.

The first reported instance was the June 2021 suicide bombing outside the heavily guarded residence of Hafiz Saeed, the founder and leader of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which later operated through its front group Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and whose affiliates went on to form the Milli Muslim League. Saeed survived, but three people were killed and 24 were injured, including police personnel.

Subsequent attacks have all been close-range shootings and the trend has picked up pace across multiple cities, killing important members of JuD, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Hizbul Mujahideen among others. The Pakistani press did not initially acknowledge the identity of the targets and accusations of Indian involvement were muted.

But as both the profile of targets and the frequency of such shootings have risen, it has been difficult to deny their affiliations or rule out involvement of RAW. The most notable killings in 2025 were JuD leaders Zia ur Rehman in Punjab in March and Abdul Rehman in Sindh in May. The attacks are reported to follow the same pattern — UAE-based Pakistani workers or Afghan nationals are recruited by RAW in return for cash, and they work with a small local cell for months to plan and execute the killing.

The strategy has worked for middle-ranked militants. While RAW has not eliminated top leaders like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar, it got as far as Saeed’s residence and members of Azhar’s family were killed in Indian airstrikes in Bahawalpur in May 2025. Indian intelligence officials proudly cite Israel as their inspiration for this kind of warfare.

Indian policymakers might also be congratulating themselves on finally having turned the tables on Pakistan by supporting the insurgency in Balochistan. Yet India shares more demographic and political features with Pakistan than with Israel, and its leaders would do well to draw some sobering lessons from their neighbour’s experience.

A familiar pattern emerges in many states — intelligence agencies eventually employ their covert war strategies and personnel for domestic political ends rather than geostrategic purposes. After 2001, the Pakistani military used its longstanding relationship with Islamic militant groups not only to shield the Afghan Taliban and extract financial returns from its US alliance, but also to consolidate its control over national politics.

This included a deliberately ambiguous, tacitly tolerant approach as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) assassinated Benazir Bhutto and the entire leadership of the secular Awami National Party in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, clearing the way for the army’s favoured political contender — Imran Khan.

Notably, the Mumbai terrorist attack in 2008 came soon after the president of the newly elected Pakistan People’s Party government made dovish statements about India to the international press. Similarly, the 2016 Uri attack came after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Pakistan in December 2015, when the Pakistan Muslim League was in power. These tactics served several short-term aims — eliminating political threats, undermining civilian governments and keeping tensions with India alive. But the strategy has unravelled since 2021 amid financial crises, international sanctions and political instability after the fallout with Imran Khan and a more aggressive TTP campaign.

Two weeks after the Pahalgam attack, Satya Pal Malik — the last governor of Jammu and Kashmir — accused the central government of serious security lapses. He charged that they were stoking communal divide and ‘war hysteria’ for political mileage ahead of the November 2025 Bihar elections, rather than prioritising investigation and accountability. There were also widespread allegations of manipulation and mass disenfranchisement before these elections. For observers of the TTP-army relationship in Pakistan, patterns of intelligence and security failures before well-timed terrorist attacks, followed by thin accountability, warrant scrutiny.

The second lesson is more obvious — mercenaries and proxies invariably turn on their patrons. Only recently did the United States learn this lesson from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Pakistan is learning it at an even higher price, struggling with armed insurgencies in its western provinces and hostile relations with Afghanistan, Iran and India.

Covert warfare policies temporarily strengthen the military and intelligence apparatus at the expense of democratic institutions but ultimately undermine both. Assassinations and helping separatists inside Pakistan pose minimal diplomatic risks to India — unlike in the United States and Canada. But an important reason to question the value of going down this road is the cost to India’s own social and political fabric.

The Dutchman was bombarded with questions about Salah during Friday’s press conference ahead of the Premier League encounter against Brighton & Hove Albion. Slot did well to swot them away, even joking that it was pointless for the assembled reporters to ask follow-ups. He is looking to downplay a sensational drama that has dominated the Liverpool agenda for nearly a week.

Slot and the club will look to draw a line under it after the Brighton game, especially following news on Friday that Salah will be involved for the Reds after productive talks were held at the AXA Training Centre.

In what has been a challenging season for all those connected to Liverpool, Slot clearly feels frustrated that he has been forced to confront a fresh and unnecessary problem this week.

“The biggest factor is [to] do the best for the team and for the club,” the former Feyenoord boss explained. “I haven’t said this before but I can say I am definitely not enjoying this situation. It’s not like I’m happy we are in this situation by far.

“We have won the league together and he [Salah] has done so much for the club. Ideally, you are not in a situation like this with your player.

“But I have to make my line-ups doing what is best for the club and for the team, in my opinion.

“I would definitely prefer to [avoid a circus against Brighton] because I don’t think it’s in the interests of the team and the club that we keep having,” he added.

“And I don’t think it’s a circus for me, but if it is a circus that is not helpful for anyone. Everything I have done until now is doing what is in the best interest of the club and the team and I don’t think if I tell you what I felt or blah blah that it will help us in the situation.

“I can completely understand why you ask as it is interesting to know but what I’ve tried to do since I’ve been here and for this whole situation is doing what is best for the team and the club in this situation as it is already challenging enough for us without this situation.”

Slot has cut a composed and unshakable figure in the days since that interview, making the tough call to drop Salah against Inter Milan, recall him to face Brighton, and repeatedly deal with pointed questions about the subject.

Most feel he has emerged from the situation with his reputation enhanced and with greater authority. Slot emphasized that before the midweek win in Milan, telling journalists in a press conference that he is “kind, not weak”.

""What I meant was I am not afraid to take decisions that I think I have to take,” Slot said when asked about those comments. “Can players sense weakness? Yes. But you don’t have to show strength or weakness when it doesn’t help the team.

“It would not be smart to be like: 'Oh, I am so strong and I am not afraid to take big decisions’, if that doesn’t help the team.

“It is not my idea to show I can take, even if it was a strong decision or a hard or difficult one, but definitely I have been in dressing rooms and they are constantly checking the decisions you make.

“And I have to make 40-50 a day I think, if not more. But players, like pundits and journalists, hardly ever know everything that happens and I have heard a lot about this whole situation.”",https://i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article33050595.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2250398995.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 12:02:16.403940
ID27,L’Oréal,2025-12-13 05:12:03+00:00,Retail Brew,Inside the rise of an e-commerce giant in India - Retail Brew,Jeena Sharma,,,,,https://www.retailbrew.com/stories/2025/12/12/inside-the-rise-of-an-e-commerce-giant-in-india,"Over the years, India has emerged not only as a manufacturing powerhouse but also one of the largest e-commerce markets globally.
A key piece to its evolving consumer has also been younger millennials and Gen Z, per the company.
Currently, Myntra has more than 20 million Gen Z customers—a number that has doubled YoY.
“There are going to be close to 200 million Gen Z who will be transacting online, and we want to lead that way in being the brand of choice for Gen Z,” he said.
“In 5–10 years from now, Gen Z will be the biggest chunk of our business.”","Over the years, India has emerged not only as a manufacturing powerhouse but also one of the largest e-commerce markets globally.

As of 2024, India’s e-retail market was estimated at about $60 billion, per Bain, with its market value projected to reach $325 billion by 2030.

At the center of this success are online retailers like Myntra, which was acquired by local e-comm giant Flipkart in 2014. Per an Economic Times report, the retailer’s net profit skyrocketed nearly 18x to 548 crore (~$62 million) from 31 crore the previous year. Meanwhile, operating revenue rose 18% to 6,043 crore (~$687 million).

Sunder Balasubramanian, CMO at Myntra—which sells everything from apparel to beauty, home, and tech—believes many factors have formed the backbone of the online boom. They include widespread internet and smartphone usage at low prices and by extension, more access.

“This really allowed the mobile phone to become an access point like nothing else before for the consumer at large in the country, and that is the trend on which e-commerce piggybacked,” Balasubramanian told Retail Brew.

He added that as a large country with more than 600,000 villages, before mobile became ubiquitous, “most of the point of access is related to the physical retail shops…if you wanted any of the larger brands, you had to travel to the bigger cities.”

E-commerce, per Balasubramanian, “broke that barrier” by facilitating direct reach to both Indian and global brands, but also smaller niche labels.

Currently, Myntra partners with thousands of Indian and international brands across categories including Mango, H&M, Nike, and L’Oréal as it continues to grow and add more retailers to its portfolio.

The company attributes a lot of its growth to not just its affluent customers in bigger cities but also smaller cities (termed Tier 1, 2 and 3) and towns across the country.

Balasubramanian explained that although Myntra operated at a “mid-premium” pricing level, which limited its selection to affluent cohorts, “as adoption grew…we are right now seeing almost 50% of our user base and revenue coming out of metro or the Tier 1 cities, versus the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities,” he said, adding that “40%–45% of the demand for international brands comes from the non metros or the smaller towns itself, because aspirational premiumization is happening across the country.”

Beyond geographical reach, the retailer was initially more “women-focused,” but it’s also seeing increasing interest from men. “Now we have 50% women, 50% men, kind of a focus,” Balasubramaniun said.

A key piece to its evolving consumer has also been younger millennials and Gen Z, per the company. Currently, 40% of Myntra’s user base is Gen Z.

To further accelerate the connection with the younger generation, the company has also introduced GlamStream—a content commerce platform, with 350K monthly active creators and 3.5 million shopper-creators (66% of which are Gen Z). According to the company, it has been a significant generator with its social commerce now contributing 10% of the platform’s revenue— with a 50% increase in contribution in the past 4 months.

For the digitally native generation, it has been a hit, as has Myntra’s beauty category with more than 4,000 brands including MAC, Clinique, Estée Lauder, and Huda Beauty.

“Over the past few years, we are growing at about 2x of the online beauty market, so it’s been a really good growth driver for us,” Balasubramaniun said.

And as he looks to the future, the company will continue to bet on Gen Z. Currently, Myntra has more than 20 million Gen Z customers—a number that has doubled YoY.

“There are going to be close to 200 million Gen Z who will be transacting online, and we want to lead that way in being the brand of choice for Gen Z,” he said. “In 5–10 years from now, Gen Z will be the biggest chunk of our business.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/09fc1c8e08dff99b5c7ef2ec7607711fc502e853-1680x1120.jpg?rect=0,119,1680,882&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-12-13 03:59:30.501711

consent to u.k. bail-in power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes results from several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-10 of this pricing supplement.

·You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of at least one Underlier falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

·You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Underlier, which may be significant, and that your potential return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes.

·You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Underlier will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date.

·You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Underlier and understand that any decline in the value of one Underlier will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Underlier.

·You understand and accept the risk that you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Underlier is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date.

·You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Underliers.

·You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of the Underliers, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to the Underliers.

·You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be automatically redeemed and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield.

·You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Underliers.

·You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not automatically redeemed.

·You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

·You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

·You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of at least one Underlier falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

·You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Underliers rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes.

·You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Underlier will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Underlier will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates.

·You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Underlier and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Underlier will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Underlier.

·You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Underliers.

·You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of any Underlier may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons, regardless of the performance of any other Underlier.

·You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to, the Underliers.

·You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be automatically redeemed.

·You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Underliers.

·You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not automatically redeemed.

·You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings.

·You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

·You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the appropriateness of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement, the prospectus and the prospectus supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the Notes for investment.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT coupon PAYMENT DATE

The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

§Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of each Underlier: $100.00*

§Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Underlier: $70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

*The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of $100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of $70.00 for each Underlier have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the actual Initial Underlier Values or Coupon Barrier Values for the Underliers. The actual Initial Underlier Value and Coupon Barrier Value for each Underlier are set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement.

For information regarding recent values of the Underliers, please see “Information Regarding the Underliers” in this pricing supplement.

Example 1: The Closing Value of each Underlier is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date.

Underlier Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date LULU Underlier $105.00 MARA Underlier $85.00 ORCL Underlier $150.00

Because the Closing Value of each Underlier is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $11.875 per $1,000 principal amount Note (1.1875% of the principal amount) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Example 2: The Closing Value of one Underlier is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date, and the Closing Value of each other Underlier is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date.

Underlier Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date LULU Underlier $140.00 MARA Underlier $40.00 ORCL Underlier $85.00

Because the Closing Value of at least one Underlier is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Example 3: The Closing Value of each Underlier is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date.

Underlier Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date LULU Underlier $45.00 MARA Underlier $55.00 ORCL Underlier $40.00

Because the Closing Value of at least one Underlier is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Underlier is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE upon an automatic REDEMPTION OR AT MATURITY

The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an automatic redemption or at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

§Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of each Underlier: $100.00*

§Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Underlier: $70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

*The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of $100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of $70.00 for each Underlier have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the actual Initial Underlier Values or Coupon Barrier Values for the Underliers. The actual Initial Underlier Value and Coupon Barrier Value for each Underlier are set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement.

For information regarding recent values of the Underliers, please see “Information Regarding the Underliers” in this pricing supplement.

Example 1: The Notes are automatically redeemed on the sixth Observation Date.

Observation Date Underlier Closing Value on Observation Date Are the Notes Automatically Redeemed? Payment upon Automatic Redemption 1 LULU Underlier $140.00 N/A N/A MARA Underlier $135.00 ORCL Underlier $120.00 2-5 LULU Underlier Various N/A N/A MARA Underlier ORCL Underlier 6 LULU Underlier $150.00 Yes $1,011.875 MARA Underlier $115.00 ORCL Underlier $130.00

Because the Closing Value of each Underlier on the sixth Observation Date (which is approximately six months after the Issue Date and is the first Observation Date on which the Notes may be automatically redeemed) is greater than its Initial Underlier Value, the Notes are automatically redeemed on the immediately following Contingent Coupon Payment Date. You will receive on the relevant Contingent Coupon Payment Date a cash payment of $1,011.875 per $1,000 principal amount Note, which is equal to your principal amount plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due. No further amounts will be payable on the Notes after they have been automatically redeemed.

Example 2: The Notes are automatically redeemed on the fifty-ninth Observation Date.

Observation Date Underlier Closing Value on Observation Date Are the Notes Automatically Redeemed? Payment upon Automatic Redemption 1 LULU Underlier $80.00 N/A N/A MARA Underlier $115.00 ORCL Underlier $95.00 2-5 LULU Underlier Various N/A N/A MARA Underlier ORCL Underlier 6-58 LULU Underlier Various (at least one Underlier below Initial Underlier Value) No N/A MARA Underlier ORCL Underlier 59 LULU Underlier $105.00 Yes $1,011.875 MARA Underlier $120.00 ORCL Underlier $115.00

Because the Closing Value of each Underlier on the fifty-ninth Observation Date is greater than its Initial Underlier Value, the Notes are automatically redeemed on the immediately following Contingent Coupon Payment Date. You will receive on the relevant Contingent Coupon Payment Date a cash payment of $1,011.875 per $1,000 principal amount Note, which is equal to your principal amount plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due. No further amounts will be payable on the Notes after they have been automatically redeemed.

Because the Closing Value of at least one Underlier is below its Initial Underlier Value on each Observation Date from and including the sixth Observation Date, the Notes are not automatically redeemed. You will receive on the Maturity Date a cash payment per $1,000 principal amount Note equal to $1,000 plus any Contingent Coupon otherwise due.

Selected Risk Considerations

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Underliers. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

·You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes—The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Underlier on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Underlier on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Underlier is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

·Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Underlier—The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Underlier, which may be significant.

·Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Underlier, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Underlier—The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Underlier. With multiple Underliers, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Underlier will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons. Further, the performance of the Underliers may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Underliers, the greater the potential for one of those Underliers to close below its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date.

It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Underliers will be over the term of the Notes. The Underliers represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes.

Although the correlation of the Underliers’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Underliers’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Underliers, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons.

·You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Underlier—Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Underliers. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Underlier. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Underlier. Poor performance by any Underlier over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the values of the other Underliers. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Underlier must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Underlier.

·Automatic Redemption and Reinvestment Risk—If the Notes are automatically redeemed, the holding period over which you may receive Contingent Coupons could be as short as approximately six months. The payment upon an automatic redemption, together with any Contingent Coupons that you may have received on prior Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been automatically redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are automatically redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after an automatic redemption. The automatic redemption feature of the Notes may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

·Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Underliers on the Dates Specified—Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Underliers on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Underliers determined at any other time.

·Repayment of the Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Automatic Redemption—You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any automatic redemption. If you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Underlier has increased from its Initial Underlier Value. See “—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

·The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk—Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The Contingent Coupon is determined based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Underliers. The Contingent Coupon will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would be if the level of expected volatility of the Underliers taken into account in determining the terms of the Notes were lower. As volatility of an Underlier

PS- 10

increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that the Closing Value of that Underlier on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher Contingent Coupon reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will not receive Contingent Coupons with respect to one or more Observation Dates than would have been the case had the Contingent Coupon been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive Contingent Coupons for the reasons described above.

·Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Underliers—The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the Underliers. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the Underliers would have.

·Tax Treatment—As discussed further below under “Tax Considerations” and in the accompanying prospectus supplement, if you are a U.S. individual or taxable entity, under our intended treatment of the Notes, you will be required to accrue interest on a current basis in respect of the Notes over their term based on the comparable yield for the Notes and pay tax accordingly. This comparable yield is determined solely to calculate the amount on which you will be taxed prior to maturity and is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of what the actual yield will be.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

·Credit of Issuer—The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

·You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underliers

·There Are Risks Associated with Single Equities—The price of each Underlier can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to that Underlier and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuer of each Underlier.

·Anti-dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-dilution Adjustments—The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of an Underlier. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect an Underlier. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect the market price of, and any amounts payable on, the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·Reorganization or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated—Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or

PS- 11

de-listing of an Underlier, the Calculation Agent may replace that Underlier with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of that Underlier upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent or may make other changes to the terms of the Notes to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the Calculation Agent to replace an Underlier, to accelerate the Notes or to otherwise adjust the terms of the Notes could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the Notes than if the Calculation Agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs—Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or an Underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·Historical Performance of the Underliers Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Underliers Over the Term of the Notes—The value of each Underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of an Underlier is not an indication of the future performance of that Underlier over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation between the Underliers is not an indication of the future correlation between them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Underliers individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Underlier.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

·We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Underliers. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Underliers and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underliers” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

·Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

PS- 12

·Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe market prices of, dividend rates on and expected volatility of the Underliers;

ocorrelation (or lack of correlation) of the Underliers;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

·The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes—The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

·The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes—Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

Tax Considerations

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Indebtedness for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The discussion below applies to you only if you are an initial purchaser of the Notes; if you are a secondary purchaser of the Notes, the tax consequences to you may be different. In the opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, the Notes should be treated as debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that this treatment is correct.

Because the Notes will be offered to initial purchasers at varying prices, it is expected that the ""issue price"" of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be uncertain. We currently intend to treat the issue price as $1,000 for each $1,000 principal amount Note, and the remainder of this discussion so assumes, unless otherwise indicated. Our intended treatment will affect the amounts you will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the uncertainty with respect to the Notes' issue price, including the tax consequences to you if the actual issue price of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not $1,000 per Note.

We intend to treat the Notes as “contingent payment debt instruments” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as described under “—Contingent Payment Debt Instruments” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Assuming that our treatment of the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments is correct, regardless of your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you generally will be required to accrue taxable interest income in each year on a constant yield to maturity basis at the “comparable yield,” as determined by us, with certain adjustments in each year to reflect the difference, if any, between the actual and the projected amounts of the interest payments on the Notes in that year according to the “projected payment schedule” determined by us (and the projected amounts of the periodic payments will not be separately includible in your income). Although it is not entirely clear how the comparable yield should be determined when a debt instrument may be called prior to maturity, we will determine the comparable yield based upon the term to maturity of the Notes assuming no automatic call occurs. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, you are required to use our determination of the comparable yield and projected payment schedule in determining interest accruals and adjustments in respect of your Notes, unless you timely disclose and explain the use of other estimates to the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Any income recognized upon a sale or exchange of a Note (including redemption upon automatic call or at maturity), will be treated as interest income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You generally will recognize taxable income or loss equal to the difference between the amount received from the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in the Notes. You generally must treat any income as interest income and any loss as ordinary loss to the extent of previous interest inclusions, and the balance as capital loss. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

The discussions herein and in the accompanying prospectus supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b).

After the original issue date, you may obtain the comparable yield and the projected payment schedule by requesting them from Barclays Cross Asset Sales Americas, at (212) 528-7198. Neither the comparable yield nor the projected payment schedule constitutes a representation by us regarding the actual amounts or timing of payments that we will make on the Notes.

If you purchase Notes at their original issuance for an amount that is different from their issue price, you will be required to account for this difference, generally by allocating it reasonably among projected payments on the Notes and treating these allocations as adjustments to your income when the payment is made. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the treatment of the difference between your basis in your Notes and their issue price.

You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Non-U.S. holders. We do not believe that non-U.S. holders should be required to provide a Form W-8 in order to avoid 30% U.S. withholding tax with respect to interest payments on the Notes, although the IRS could challenge this position. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that these regulations should not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.

SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

We have agreed to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “agent”), and the agent has agreed to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The agent commits to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.

VALIDITY OF THE NOTES

In the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special United States products counsel to Barclays Bank PLC, when the Notes offered by this pricing supplement have been issued by Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the indenture, the trustee has made, in accordance with instructions from Barclays Bank PLC, appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master global note that represents such Notes (the “master note”), and such Notes have been delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such Notes will be valid and binding obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith) and possible judicial or regulatory actions or application giving effect to governmental actions or foreign laws affecting creditors’ rights, provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to (i) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above or (ii) the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of the stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Notes to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York. Insofar as this opinion involves matters governed by English law, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP has relied, with Barclays Bank PLC’s permission, on the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP, dated as of May 15, 2025, filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form F-3ASR by Barclays Bank PLC on May 15, 2025, and this opinion is subject to the same assumptions, qualifications and limitations as set forth in such opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee’s authorization, execution and delivery of the indenture and its authentication of the master note and the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the indenture with respect to the trustee, all as stated in the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, dated May 15, 2025, which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement referred to above.

That is no longer the case after all this,” Thomas wrote to Epstein.
Again to focus on the business and scientific/philanthropic aspect of the piece,” Thomas wrote.
“He seems very interested in your relationship with the news media,” Thomas wrote to Epstein in an email dated June 1, 2016.","A New York Times reporter told Jeffrey Epstein that he could write an article that would define the financier on his own terms as he faced allegations of sexually abusing minors in the months leading up to his 2008 conviction, newly uncovered emails reveal.

After a negative article about Epstein was published in September 2007, then-New York Times journalist Landon Thomas Jr advised Epstein to “get ahead” of more bad publicity by doing an interview that would define the story “on your terms”.

“I Just read the Post. Now the floodgates will open — you can expect Vanity Fair and NYMag to pile on,” Thomas wrote to Epstein in an email dated September 20, 2007, referring to the magazines Vanity Fair and New York Magazine.

“My view is that the quicker you get out ahead of this and define the story and who you are on your terms in the NYT, the better it will be for you.”

Thomas, who left the Times in 2019, urged Epstein to quickly do an interview to prevent the “popular tabloid perception” about him from hardening, and expressed sympathy over his legal troubles.

“I know this is tough and hard for you, but remember jail may [be] bad, but it is not forever,” Thomas wrote.

As part of his pitch to Epstein, Thomas recalled a 2002 profile he wrote about the financier for New York Magazine, titled Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery.

Written before Epstein’s first arrest in 2006, the profile portrayed the financier as an enigmatic but highly successful businessman with the appearance of a “taller, younger Ralph Lauren” and a “relentless brain that challenges Nobel Prize-winning scientists”.

The piece contained glowing appraisals from Epstein’s many high-profile associates, whose praise-filled descriptions included that he was “very smart”, “amazing”, “extraordinary”, and “talented”.

“Remember how for a while my NY Mag piece was the defining piece on you? That is no longer the case after all this,” Thomas wrote to Epstein.

“But I think if we did a piece for the Times, with the documents and evidence that you mention, plus you speaking for the record, we can again have a story that becomes the last public word on Jeffrey Epstein.”

A little more than a week later, on September 28, Thomas sent Epstein an email reiterating the importance of “getting out ahead” of other publications.

Thomas suggested that he begin reaching out to associates of Epstein who could talk about the financier’s business activities and scientific and philanthropic work, including former Harvard President Larry Summers and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.

“Before I get a glimpse of the legal material, I was thinking that I should at least start calling around to people who know you. Again to focus on the business and scientific/philanthropic aspect of the piece,” Thomas wrote.

“Could I start to do that — call people like Larry Summers, Jess Staley, George Mitchell, Ehud Barak, Bill Richardson and others?” Thomas finished the email expressing his hope that Epstein was “holding up okay” and stating his view that “we need to move on this.”

It is not clear how Epstein responded to Thomas’s emails, which were included in a trove of emails from Epstein’s personal accounts that were made available to Al Jazeera by the whistleblower website Distributed Denial of Secrets.

Thomas did not respond to a request for comment.

Following Thomas’s correspondence with Epstein, the Times went on to publish an article by the journalist detailing the financier’s downfall the following year.

The article, published a day after Epstein’s guilty plea on June 30, 2008, drew from in-person and phone interviews that Thomas had conducted with the financier, including during a visit to Epstein’s island of Little St James several months earlier.

In the article, Thomas described the financier sitting on the patio of his island mansion as he likened himself to the eponymous character of the satirical novel Gulliver’s Travels.

“Gulliver’s playfulness had unintended consequences,” Epstein was quoted as saying.

“That is what happens with wealth. There are unexpected burdens as well as benefits.”

A 2019 report by NPR said colleagues of Thomas at the Times had been “appalled” by the article when they reviewed it years later, following the journalist’s admission that he had solicited a $30,000 donation from Epstein for a cultural centre.

The emails obtained by Al Jazeera also show that Epstein emailed an error-strewn Word document to himself in which Thomas is described discussing the legal case against Epstein with then-Florida prosecutor David Weinstein.

The purpose and origin of the document, which describes Thomas and Weinstein discussing technical aspects of the charges facing Epstein, is unclear. Weinstein said he spoke to Thomas in January 2008, but that the document did not contain an accurate description of their conversation.

Weinstein said they had spoken about the “criminal justice process and general state and federal statutes”, but not Epstein’s case specifically.

He said he did not know where the information in the document came from or who provided it to Epstein.

“I never spoke with him about the specific facts of the late Mr Epstein’s case, nor did I offer any opinion about that matter,” Weinstein told Al Jazeera.

The emergence of the emails between Thomas and Epstein comes after correspondence the two men shared from 2015 to 2018 came to light last month in a batch of documents released by US lawmakers.

Among other revelations, those emails showed that Thomas let Epstein know that the late investigative journalist John Connolly had contacted him for information for Connolly’s 2016 book Filthy Rich: The Jeffrey Epstein Story.

“He seems very interested in your relationship with the news media,” Thomas wrote to Epstein in an email dated June 1, 2016. “I told him you were a hell of a guy :)”.

A spokesperson for the Times said Thomas had not worked for the newspaper since early 2019 “after editors discovered his failure to abide by our ethical standards”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25260804016532-1765249088.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-12 23:04:33.762641

“The launch of Orbit Clipper is a significant milestone for sustainable transport in London.","Ferry transport in London is entering a new phase, focusing on sustainability following the launch of a zero-emission vessel. The boat is being promoted as transforming the experience of passengers travelling along the Thames.

Four years after committing to introducing high-speed and eco-friendly vessels to operate on the Thames, Uber Boat by Thames Clippers is launching Orbit Clipper, the UK’s first fully electric zero-emissions ferry. On December 5, the new vessel completed its first passenger trip on the Thames, ushering in what is being described as a new era for sustainable transport in London.

Uber Boat by Thames Clippers reckons that the Orbit Clipper is a groundbreaking vessel in many aspects. The 150-passenger ferry with capacity for 100 bicycles features a roll-on/roll-off design that enables automated docking on both sides owing to its double-ended, self-docking, auto-mooring features. The vessel will operate between London’s Canary Wharf on the north side of the Thames and Rotherhithe on the south, offering an efficient and eco-friendly service for cross-river transport.

Built by UK’s Wight Shipyard Co, Orbit Clipper was partly funded by the UK government through the Department for Transport and Innovate UK. The 25-meter (82-foot) vessel with a maximum speed of 12 knots forms a major component of Uber Boat by Thames Clippers drive towards sustainable transport in London.

In recent years, the operator has added three hybrid high-speed vessels to its main fleet of River Buses, each cutting emissions by up to 90 percent and contributing to its ambitious target of reducing carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2035 and achieving net-zero by 2050. The boats operate on battery power while in Central London and recharge while using biofueled power on the rest of their journey.

“The launch of Orbit Clipper is a significant milestone for sustainable transport in London. As the UK’s first all-electric, zero-emissions vessel, it represents our commitment to reducing the city’s carbon footprint while continuing to provide reliable and efficient river transport,” said Sean Collins, Uber Boat by Thames Clippers CEO.

The new vessel is expected to replace the current cross-river ferry service, continuing to serve the growing number of passengers. Estimates indicate the vessel will, on average, ferry more than 20,000 passengers daily.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Vessels_Small/Orbit-Clipper-ferry.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 22:05:30.339543

This wonderful piece of hardware, which we consider one of 2025's best laptops for its performance, keyboard responsiveness, and portability, among other rich features, is now on a holiday discount for $549.99 at Best Buy.

Why buy the Surface Pro 12-inch?

The Microsoft Surface Pro 12-inch is a well-designed laptop packed with plenty of features that make it worth buying for hard-working students or professionals looking to get their work done in the office or while travelling abroad.

Its performance is rock-solid thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor, which is able run Microsoft Office apps, edit digital art in Photoshop, and search through internet browsers with ease. Not to mention it does so without generating too much heat in the system or draining its batteries.

It also features a responsive keyboard that instantly reads your key inputs, high-quality audio speakers and camera, and a gorgeous 12-inch touchscreen display able to render images with crisp details at 2196x1464 resolution and 90Hz refresh rates.

The touchscreen is also compatible with stylus pens, so you can draw digital art with greater ease compared to using a mouse.

The Surface Pro 12-inch is also portable-friendly as it measures at 274 x 190 x 7.8 mm (10.79"" x 7.48"" x 0.31"") and weighs around 0.68 kg (1.5 lbs), so you can store it easily in luggage/carrying cases without requiring much strength to lug it around.

On top of that, it has full Copilot+ AI integration with a mighty Qualcomm NPU of 45 TOPS, so it can efficiently run AI-empowered features like Click To Do, Recall, and Studio Effects.

The only drawbacks of this laptop are that it has a short battery life of 7 hours when its Power Settings are in 'Best Efficiency' Mode or 5 hours when it's on 'Balanced' Mode.

Not to mention its display's colors could use some work as they're often muted even when running on the 'enhanced' color profile.

Lastly, this laptop can run a hefty MSRP of $799 at most retailers. Thankfully, that last bugbear is no longer an issue for a limited time as it's now on sale for $549.99 at Best Buy.

So, if you're looking for a new workhorse laptop to tackle the challenges of 2026, then this Christmas bargain for the Surface Pro 12-inch is for you.

Alternative discounts

If stock runs out for the Surface Pro 12-inch with (256GB UFS) runs dry at Best Buy, or if you have budget for more storage, here are some alternative discounts as backup options:

$699.99 at Best Buy (was $899.99) (512GB UFS)

$749.00 at Walmart (was $799.99) (256GB UFS)

Competition

Some would argue that there are better devices than the Surface Pro 12-inch out there that offer better value and performance.

One such tablet that it gets compared to is the Apple iPad Air M3, which offers more display size options (11"" and 13""), more color options, a superior ""tablet"" experience, and a cheaper MSRP (especially the 11"" version is on sale for $499.00 at Best Buy).

However, the Surface Pro 12-inch offers superior performance as an AI Laptop with its Snapdragon X Plus CPU, 45 TOPS NPU with full Copilot+ integration, 16GB of RAM, and Dual external display support.

So if you had to choose between the two, I'd recommend the Surface Pro 12-inch for those seeking the best portable laptop experience. At the same time, the Apple iPad Air M3 is better suited for those looking for a budget-friendly tablet experience.

FAQ

The 45X credit provides up to 10% of production costs for US-based producers of critical minerals including cobalt, graphite, palladium and platinum — materials essential for renewable energy infrastructure, advanced electronics and defense systems.
Removing the 45X tax credit ""was a huge hit to us,"" said Heather McDowell, senior vice president and general counsel for legal and external affairs, Americas, at Sibanye Stillwater Ltd. ""Having that tax credit indefinitely is really what we expected.""
Operational impacts Matthew Lengerich, president and executive general manager at Jervois Mining USA Ltd., said his company expanded its Finland project into the US specifically because of the 45X tax credit and other incentives.
""The project doesn't work without that tax credit,"" Lengerich said, highlighting the fundamental role the incentive played in making US critical mineral projects economically viable.","Critical mineral producers are struggling with project economics after President Donald Trump's budget reconciliation bill eliminated long-term certainty for the Section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, industry executives said at a Dec. 11 conference in Washington, DC.

The sweeping legislation signed into law on July 4 phases out the credit starting in 2031 and eliminates it in 2034, removing what had been a permanent incentive under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

The change is forcing companies to reassess project viability and make difficult operational decisions as they compete with lower-cost foreign suppliers, particularly from China and Russia. The 45X credit provides up to 10% of production costs for US-based producers of critical minerals including cobalt, graphite, palladium and platinum — materials essential for renewable energy infrastructure, advanced electronics and defense systems.

Removing the 45X tax credit ""was a huge hit to us,"" said Heather McDowell, senior vice president and general counsel for legal and external affairs, Americas, at Sibanye Stillwater Ltd. ""Having that tax credit indefinitely is really what we expected.""

The company, whose Montana operations include the only US-based palladium, platinum and rhodium mine, has cut approximately 40% of its workforce in recent months, McDowell said.

Operational impacts

Matthew Lengerich, president and executive general manager at Jervois Mining USA Ltd., said his company expanded its Finland project into the US specifically because of the 45X tax credit and other incentives. Jervois operates the only US-based cobalt mine in Idaho, though it has faced operational challenges due to price volatility.

""The project doesn't work without that tax credit,"" Lengerich said, highlighting the fundamental role the incentive played in making US critical mineral projects economically viable.

The discussion reflects broader challenges facing the US critical minerals sector as it attempts to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers while competing against state-subsidized operations. Price support mechanisms are a topic of increasing debate among business leaders and policymakers, with some arguing that Western projects cannot survive without effective government backing.

Why it matters: It represents a shift in the AI investment thesis: Investors are set to reward efficiency, not spending, in 2026. That could be a big problem for Nvidia, which benefits from record spending from a handful of Big Tech customers.

What they're saying: If 2026 is the year when investors reward efficient spending, ""that certainly would be bad"" for Nvidia, Mandeep Singh of Bloomberg Intelligence tells Axios.

Oracle is seen as Exhibit A for inefficient spending within the AI elite class, while Google as seen as the North Star.

""The market is discerning and telling you that Google is doing much better in capex efficiency than an Oracle,"" Singh says.

Driving the news: In early afternoon trading on Friday, Oracle shares were down more than 4% after tumbling on Thursday, while Broadcom was down more than 10%. Nvidia shares were off nearly 2%.

Threat level: As executives see this turn in Wall Street's reward mechanism toward efficiency versus spending, they may shift to more budget-conscious models.

""If OpenAI and Oracle get scrutinized in terms of their investments, how does that affect Nvidia?"" Singh says.

""To my mind, that's why Nvidia may remain under pressure.""

By the numbers: With $90 billion in capex, Google was able to train Gemini 3, accelerate its cloud business and service generative AI into its search.

That capex represents a quarter of Google's revenue.

In contrast, Oracle reported a capex plan of $50 billion for the year. Its total revenue for fiscal year 2025 is just over $57 billion.

Meta, meanwhile, is set to spend over $70 billion this year, which makes up nearly half of its revenue.

The bottom line: 2026 may be the year investors seek a return to fundamentals that historically define prices on Wall Street: Revenue. Debt. Earnings. You know, the boring stuff.

A return to boring may be healthy for the market, but it would take the air out of Nvidia's stock, whose rise has made it the most valuable company in the world.

Yes, but: Any selloff tied to AI helps quell the bubble concerns.

""I'm hesitant to call it a bubble in any way because every time a name has even disappointed slightly the reaction has been some sort of correction which is very healthy,"" Singh adds.",https://images.axios.com/s4H1zWSFhW3sHIGSJkDKg4YJOcQ=/0x0:1600x900/1366x768/2025/12/12/1765562105454.png,N,,2025-12-12 23:59:04.999511

Context engineering is emerging as a crucial aspect of AI, driven by the shift to agentic work, where AI agents perform tasks independently with deterministic guidance. It is a broader approach than prompt engineering, focusing on setting up large language models with the necessary tools, data sources and memory to succeed. This requires creating environments where agents can collaborate and maintain context through a shared layer.

In this episode of the “Next in Tech” podcast, S&P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research analysts Jean Atelsek and Alex Johnston joined host Eric Hanselman to explore this emerging discipline and its application to AI environments.

Germany may miss target start date for implementation of EU’s Renewable Energy Directive III

Germany faces significant delays in implementing the EU's Renewable Energy Directive III (RED III) by the Jan. 1, 2026, deadline. The legislation, requiring initial discussion by the executive Bundeskabinett branch before passage through the parliamentary Bundestag and Bundesrat, has been postponed since October due to a lack of consensus among ministries. This ongoing delay has left market participants uncertain about Germany's 2026 biofuel blending mandates, leading to volatility and making firm pricing ""challenging.""

Delayed or retroactive implementation of the legislation is likely, with one policy consultant calling the situation a ""catastrophe for the whole market."" With the Bundeskabinett not discussing the bill and the Bundestag requiring multiple readings, full legal assent before year-end is almost impossible. This situation creates regulatory ambiguity, particularly regarding double-counting incentives for advanced biofuels, and raises competitiveness concerns for neighboring markets, such as the Netherlands, where timely implementation is expected.

What is the Aspirational Nostalgia Trend: The Viral Commercialization of Heritage Luxury

This trend is the social media-driven virality of the Ralph Lauren Corporation's meticulously curated, heritage-rich holiday aesthetic, which blends elements of classic American prep, cozy sophistication, and ""old money"" elegance into a widely sought-after lifestyle look for both fashion and home décor. The trend has sent searches for “Ralph Lauren inspired Christmas” soaring by 3,000% on Pinterest, demonstrating the consumer desire to buy into a feeling of classic, comforting tradition.

The Signature Aesthetic DNA

The aesthetic is defined by a consistent, rich visual language: plaid trimmings, pine garlands, rich red and hunter green color palettes, brass accents, dark wood, and the Polo Bear mascot. This uniformity, polished over a decade, provided the ideal visual blueprint for social media content creators to easily replicate and trend.

Fashion-Meets-Home Décor Loop

Unlike most trends, ""Ralph Lauren Christmas"" is a complete lifestyle package, covering both apparel (cable-knit sweaters, blazers) and home décor (tartan tablecloths, brass bells, roaring fireplaces). This cross-category resonance amplifies the brand's presence, reinforcing its desire to be seen as a broader luxury lifestyle entity, as highlighted by its home décor and hospitality offerings (cafes and restaurants).

The Strategic Role of Accessibility

While the look is intrinsically linked to a luxury brand, its success is fueled by its perceived accessibility. Consumers can buy the core Ralph Lauren staples or achieve the ""inspired"" look for less at chains like Vans or Amazon, a dynamic that ensures broad, fast adoption across various price points, giving Ralph Lauren the halo effect of the trend without sacrificing its luxury positioning.

Consumer Insights: The trend is an emotional investment in tradition; consumers are purchasing a feeling of comfort, stability, and curated luxury, often using core brand items (like the Polo Bear sweater) to anchor their self-styled look.Insights for Brands: A fully realized lifestyle aesthetic that spans clothing, home, and hospitality is marketing gold; invest in building a consistent, emotionally resonant visual world that consumers can easily reference and replicate.

Why it is the topic trending: The Convergence of Timeliness, Trend, and Tradition

This trend is a case study in perfect timing, sitting squarely at the intersection of several powerful, reinforcing cultural trends that naturally amplify Ralph Lauren’s long-term brand strategy.

The Return to Sophisticated Dressing (Preppy and Quarter Zip Crazes)

The current fashion cycle favors preppy style (cable-knit sweaters, blazers) and sophisticated casual dressing (the quarter zip), categories where Ralph Lauren is the undisputed, authentic category leader. This natural trend alignment made the brand’s core product range highly desirable before the holiday season even began.

The Comfort of Tradition in Uncertain Times

The trend's emphasis on pine garlands, cozy fires, and traditional colors taps directly into a deeply rooted consumer desire for nostalgia, comfort, and safety during the holidays, especially in uncertain times. This emotional anchor makes the aesthetic more compelling than fleeting, purely novelty-driven trends.

The Final Wave of ""Quiet Luxury""

The aesthetic successfully marries the ""old money"" vibe of quiet luxury (polished image, heritage staples, upscale retail strategy) with holiday maximalism. This allows consumers to participate in the perceived exclusivity of quiet luxury while satisfying the seasonal desire for abundance and expression, creating a compelling, aspirational style.

Consumer Insights: Your desire for comfort and stability is influencing your spending; look for brands that offer authentic heritage and classic styles that feel like a reliable long-term investment.Insights for Brands: Success comes from strategic timing and brand authenticity; ensure your brand is the undisputed, genuine leader in the core aesthetic that happens to align with the dominant cultural mood (e.g., nostalgia, prep).

Detailed findings: Strategic Elevation and Experiential Marketing

The findings show that the organic viral trend was accelerated by Ralph Lauren’s deliberate, years-long strategy to elevate its image and invest in experiential and culturally sensitive marketing.

Luxury House Elevation Strategy

Under CEO Patrice Louvet, Ralph Lauren has strategically elevated its image, moving closer to European luxury houses like LVMH by cutting back on less ""chichi"" retailers and upgrading its outlet stores and core retail locations. This repositioning made the brand feel luxe and aspirational just as the ""old money"" aesthetic began trending.

Experiential Retail and Brand Immersiveness

The company augmented the trend with experiential holiday pop-ups in global cities (Seoul, London, Tokyo) offering activities like hot chocolate sipping, seasonal floral displays, and visits to Santa's grotto. These activities transform a shopping trip into a shareable, immersive ""Ralph Lauren Christmas"" experience, fueling social media content and brand engagement.

Culturally Sensitive Storytelling

Ralph Lauren cleverly leverages its ""American Dream"" narrative while simultaneously embracing the country’s diversity. The 2022 collaboration with historically Black colleges and the collection celebrating Oak Bluffs demonstrate a strategy of inclusive storytelling that broadens the brand's appeal and deepens its relevance to a wider, modern consumer base.

Consumer Insights: Look for brands that offer experiences and cultural depth, not just products; the ability to pose for a selfie by a themed installation (like the vintage red pick-up truck) is part of the purchase value.Insights for Brands: Experiential marketing (pop-ups, cafes) is vital for converting viral buzz into real-world engagement; use these touchpoints to create highly Instagrammable moments that solidify the brand's aspirational lifestyle credentials.

Key success factors of Ralph Lauren Christmas Trend: Authentic Vision and Platform Leverage

The trend's success is rooted in the founder's enduring, authentic vision, the strategic elevation of the brand's status, and the masterful use of the social media landscape.

The Power of an Authentic, Enduring Vision

The founder's ability to sell a consistent, aspirational vision of the American dream, despite his own background, is the core emotional anchor of the brand. This timeless, authentic vision gave the aesthetic the stability to be rediscovered and celebrated by a new, nostalgic generation.

Strategic Brand Elevation

Ralph Lauren ensured it was ready for the moment by focusing on its core products (cable-knit sweaters, blazers) and aggressively improving its distribution quality and store presentation. This prepared the brand to capitalize on the organic trend, ensuring consumers met an elevated, ""luxe"" version of the brand.

Organic Amplification and Social Media Genius

While the trend grew organically, the brand successfully augmented the association through marketing efforts like the holiday pop-ups. Generating about $6 million in social media value from these efforts proves the genius of creating real-world, highly visual moments that naturally generate user-generated content (e.g., selfies with the red pick-up truck).

Consumer Insights: Invest in brands with a clear, timeless vision; their enduring quality is what makes them popular in the viral nostalgia cycles of social media.Insights for Brands: The most successful viral trends are often organic but augmented; create visually rich, real-world experiences that are tailor-made for user-generated content and social sharing.

Key Takeaway: Lifestyle Branding is the Ultimate Hedge Against Trend Cycles

The primary takeaway is that by successfully establishing an all-encompassing lifestyle brand that extends far beyond apparel (into home décor, hospitality, and cultural narrative), Ralph Lauren has built a powerful hedge against the fickle nature of fashion trend cycles, allowing it to remain relevant even as specific styles like ""preppy"" or ""quiet luxury"" peak and wane.

Lifestyle as Longevity Insurance

The focus on home décor, cafes, and the Olympic uniforms reinforces Ralph Lauren’s broader lifestyle credentials. When the preppy clothing look wanes, the brand can pivot to its other distinct sub-brands (Purple Label, Double RL) or categories (handbags, hospitality) to maintain sales momentum.

Halo Effect on the Core Business

The ""Ralph Lauren Christmas"" buzz is translating into tangible results, with sales through its own US stores and website tracking ahead of consensus expectations. This confirms that cultural relevance directly drives golden quarter revenue, providing a significant halo effect across the entire business.

The Power of Brand Diversity

The brand's decision to retain distinct sub-brands gives it the structural flexibility to adapt to whatever the next aesthetic fancy may be. This diversified portfolio minimizes risk compared to single-category luxury players.

Consumer Insights: A brand's resilience and longevity are a sign of value; purchasing a core piece from a brand with diverse lifestyle offerings is a safer investment against rapidly changing trends.Insights for Brands: The goal is to evolve from a fashion house to a cultural institution; use your core aesthetic to build an immersive lifestyle narrative that extends into high-margin categories like home and hospitality.

Market and Cultural Signals Supporting the Trend: The Post-Luxury Nostalgia Boom

The ""Ralph Lauren Christmas"" trend is directly supported by market and cultural signals that indicate a widespread consumer yearning for comfort, nostalgia, and a softened, traditional form of luxury following years of digital-first chaos and economic uncertainty.

The Nostalgia Cycle and Comfort Consumption

The appeal is directly linked to the emotional comfort of nostalgia, channeling the festive spirit of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and the ""Home Alone"" aesthetic. This signals a cultural move towards comfort consumption where purchases are justified by the positive emotional memories or feelings they evoke.

The Broadening of Americana and Heritage

The collaboration with Historically Black Colleges and the Oak Bluffs collection demonstrate that the market supports a more inclusive, contemporary definition of Americana and heritage. This allows the brand to tap into a wider demographic of next-generation consumers who prioritize cultural diversity and authentic storytelling.

The Democratization of Aspiration

The fact that competitors like Vans and Hugo Boss are adopting the red-and-green plaid, tartan, and teddy bear motifs confirms the aesthetic's status as a mass-market commercial theme. The trend's power lies in the fact that it makes the aspirational Ralph Lauren aesthetic achievable across all price points.

Consumer Insights: Your desire for tradition is a powerful economic driver; recognize that even budget-friendly retailers are now catering to this demand for classic, comforting aesthetics.Insights for Brands: The market rewards brands that can redefine and broaden their heritage narrative to be inclusive and culturally sensitive, ensuring the ""dream"" they sell resonates with a diverse, modern audience.

Description of consumers: The Culturally Literate Comfort Seeker

The key consumer segment driving this trend is the Culturally Literate Comfort Seeker: a digitally engaged shopper who values brand heritage, seeks emotional stability through traditional aesthetics, and uses high-quality, recognizable items to signify refined taste and cultural understanding.

Aspirational but Discerning: They are drawn to the ""old money vibe"" but are savvy about pricing and appreciate that Ralph Lauren is looking both ""luxe and accessible"" compared to aggressively priced European rivals.

Emotionally Driven: They are motivated by the desire for the comfort, tradition, and stability that the aesthetic provides during the holidays, viewing the brand's products as a form of emotional security.

Socially Engaged Content Generator: They are active on platforms like Pinterest (where searches surged 3,000%) and social media, queuing for selfies at the pop-ups and generating the content that fuels the trend's virality.

Consumer Insights: Your emotional needs for comfort and tradition are key purchasing drivers; choose brands whose aesthetics authentically align with that feeling.Insights for Brands: The target consumer is looking for heritage with a contemporary conscience; continue to invest in inclusive storytelling that broadens the definition of the brand's American dream.

Consumer Detailed Summary: The Modern Heirloom Builder

Who are them:Modern Heirloom Builders—consumers prioritizing timeless pieces and emotional value, often leveraging social media to curate and share their refined lifestyle.

What is their age?: Primarily Millennials and Gen Z (the next-generation consumers), who are driving the TikTok/Pinterest virality, coupled with core, loyal Gen X and Baby Boomer consumers who drive high-value purchases.

What is their gender?Broad Appeal, spanning traditional menswear staples (blazers, rugby shirts) to the growing womenswear focus (handbags) and gender-neutral home décor.

What is their income?Mid-to-High Disposable Income for core Ralph Lauren product, but the trend's diffusion allows for participation from lower income brackets via ""get the look for less"" strategies.

What is their lifestyle:Established, Culturally Active, and Family-Oriented, seeking to host and curate classic, traditional holiday experiences in their urban or suburban homes.

What type of shopper is (based on motivation):Aspirational Shopper with an Emotional Value Focus, motivated by quality, longevity, and the powerful feeling of heritage and tradition.

What is consumer motivation: Investing in Timeless Emotional Security

Emotional Counter-Trend to Volatility: In uncertain times, consumers gravitate towards the stability and predictability of classic, heritage-rooted brands like Ralph Lauren, seeing the aesthetic as a safe haven from fleeting fads.

The Value of Longevity: The motivation is to purchase ""forever pieces""—cable-knit sweaters, blazers, quality home goods—that transcend seasonal trends, aligning with the brand's strategy of focusing on products it is best known for.

The Desire to Be a Lifestyle Curator: Consumers are motivated to use the aesthetic to curate and communicate their own elevated lifestyle on social media, viewing the clothes and décor as tools for self-expression and social signalling.

Consumer Insights: Your desire for quality and tradition is your long-term value guide; prioritize classic staples over highly trend-driven items.Insights for Brands: Frame products not as purchases, but as heirloom-quality investments in a stable, desirable lifestyle, appealing directly to the consumer's need for security and tradition.

Strategic Trend Forecast: Global Lifestyle Expansion and LVMH-Style Event Takeovers

Global Expansion of Experiential Touchpoints: Following the pop-ups in Seoul and Tokyo, expect Ralph Lauren to aggressively roll out its hospitality and home décor concepts in key global cities to transform the brand's aesthetic into immersive, year-round destinations, solidifying its lifestyle status.

The LVMH-Style Event Takeover: The brand's outfitting of the US Olympic teams presents a massive marketing opportunity. Ralph Lauren should consider an LVMH-style takeover of a major cultural or sporting event (especially the 2028 LA Summer Games) to generate a massive, sustained global buzz and solidify its position as a top-tier luxury lifestyle conglomerate.

Strategic Handbag and Womenswear Growth: To maintain momentum when the preppy look wanes, the company will continue to aggressively invest in womenswear, particularly handbags, which offer high margins and a strong entry point into the luxury market for female consumers.

Consumer Insights: Watch for Ralph Lauren's high-profile event activations; they signal where the brand is placing its biggest strategic bets and where the next big trend will emerge.Insights for Brands: Success lies in global, cohesive lifestyle immersion; use a tiered brand structure and high-impact cultural events to maintain visibility beyond core product cycles.

Areas of innovation: Sub-Brand Agility and Connected Retail

Sub-Brand and Brand Portfolio Agility: Ralph Lauren's key innovation is its use of distinct sub-brands (Purple Label, Double RL) as a built-in adaptive mechanism. This innovation allows the company to tap into whatever fancy comes next (e.g., heritage workwear through Double RL) without jeopardizing the core Polo identity.

Advanced Connected Retail: The focus on core stores and online integration (US stores and website sales tracking well) will require innovation in ""connected retail""—using digital tools and AI to personalize the high-end in-store experience, anticipate consumer needs, and create seamless transitions between the physical store and the online lifestyle world.

Marketing Value Measurement: Innovation in marketing will involve advanced use of platforms like Launchmetrics to accurately measure the social media value ($6 million generated by pop-ups) and ROI of non-traditional, experiential activations, ensuring future marketing spend is optimized for cultural impact.

Consumer Insights: Shop across the brand's sub-labels to find the aesthetic that best suits your changing personal style; the diversity of the brand is its strength.Insights for Brands: Invest in a multi-label structure that acts as a hedge; this sub-brand agility is the new core competency for long-term luxury survival.

Core Macro Trends: Luxury-to-Mass Diffusion and The Comfort Economy

The ""Ralph Lauren Christmas"" phenomenon is a powerful expression of the Luxury-to-Mass Diffusion trend and the broader cultural pivot toward the Comfort Economy.

Luxury-to-Mass Diffusion (Aesthetic Copying): The aesthetic's viral success and its adoption by mass-market competitors like Vans and Amazon prove the efficiency of this trend. A high-end brand sets the aesthetic, and its visual elements (plaid, teddy bear motifs) rapidly diffuse and are copied across the entire retail spectrum.

The Comfort Economy (Nostalgia and Tradition): The trend is fundamentally driven by consumer demand for comfort, tradition, and security in an unstable world. The aesthetic acts as a cultural security blanket, prioritizing emotional warmth and classic styling over sharp, conceptual fashion.

The Lifestyle Conglomerate: Ralph Lauren’s success is part of the macro trend of Fashion as Lifestyle Conglomerate, where brands must generate significant revenue from categories outside of apparel (home, hospitality) to ensure long-term stability and brand relevance.

Consumer Insights: The aesthetics you see at all price points are often dictated by a few luxury brand leaders; your choice is between the original's quality and the copy's affordability.Insights for Brands: The greatest value is in being the originator of the viral aesthetic; your cultural resonance dictates the size of the subsequent mass-market trend.

Core Consumer Trend: The Heritage-Seeking Style Investor

The core consumer trend is the Heritage-Seeking Style Investor: a shopper who views their clothing and home décor as long-term assets, prioritizing brands with a rich history, transparent quality, and an aesthetic that promises lasting relevance.

Prioritization of Quality over Quantity: They value the quality of core classics (cable-knit sweaters) that transcend trends, aligning with the principle of investing in pieces with high perceived longevity and value.

Demand for Emotional Richness: They actively seek brands that provide a rich emotional narrative (the American dream, tradition) that adds a layer of meaning to their purchases beyond mere utility.

Social Currency of ""Timelessness"": In the rapid-fire world of social media, the ability to post an aesthetic that reads as ""timeless"" or ""old money"" provides a higher form of social currency than posting an ephemeral fast-fashion trend.

Consumer Insights: A brand's history and core product focus are your most reliable indicators of future value; buy the classics, not the fleeting fashion items.Insights for Brands: The focus should be on communicating enduring value and heritage rather than chasing every seasonal fad, ensuring the brand maintains its status as the benchmark for ""timelessness.""

Core Strategy: Balancing Luxury Elevation with Inclusive Storytelling

The core strategy driving this commercial success is the precarious but potent balance between aggressive brand elevation toward the luxury segment and a deliberate, authentic commitment to inclusive cultural storytelling that broadens the brand's reach and relevance.

Strategic Retail Disruption: The move to cut back on less chichi retailers and invest in core stores signals a commitment to elevating brand perception, making the brand feel more exclusive and higher-end.

Inclusive Heritage Narrative: The collaborations with Historically Black Colleges and the Oak Bluffs collection are a crucial strategy to ensure the ""American dream"" narrative is seen as inclusive, diverse, and relevant to the next generation of consumers.

Product Focus and Core Reinforcement: The strategy of concentrating on products it is best known for (70% core business) provides a stable base, allowing the brand to be ready for moments like the preppy and Christmas aesthetic trends.

Consumer Insights: The most powerful brands are those that evolve their heritage to be relevant and inclusive today; support brands that reflect contemporary cultural values.Insights for Brands: The future of luxury demands a dual strategy: elevate image and control distribution while simultaneously ensuring your brand narrative is authentically diverse and culturally broad.

Core Industry Trend: The Chief Executive as Chief Curator

The core industry trend is the transformation of the CEO role into the Chief Curator—a visionary who ensures the brand maintains its creative integrity, elevates its positioning, and leverages both cultural heritage and global market opportunities, much like Patrice Louvet balancing Ralph Lauren’s vision with market logic.

Creative and Commercial Synthesis: The CEO's role is no longer just operational but involves balancing ""magic and logic""—upholding the founder's creative vision while driving digital transformation and disciplined operational growth.

The Focus on Long-Term Value: The move to reduce marketing spend as a percentage of revenue and invest in core products and quality distribution demonstrates a shift away from short-term gains toward sustainable, long-term brand equity.

The Global Luxury Race: The strategic move closer to European luxury houses like LVMH signals that the American heritage brand is competing directly in the global luxury arena, emphasizing its aspirational value and timelessness.

Consumer Insights: The strategic direction of a brand's CEO is a key indicator of its future value; look for leaders who prioritize brand equity and long-term vision over quick trend-chasing.Insights for Brands: The modern CEO must be a visionary curator who embeds the brand's heritage into a disciplined, digitally-led growth strategy, prioritizing sustainable value creation.

Core Motivation: The Desire to Purchase a ""Perfect"" Moment

The core motivation driving the viral adoption is the Desire to Purchase a ""Perfect"" Moment—a yearning to own the idealized, curated, and emotionally rich holiday scene that Ralph Lauren has spent decades perfecting in its advertising, thereby transforming a commodity purchase into an emotional asset.

Escapism and Idealization: The aesthetic offers a form of escapism into a warm, perfect, and orderly world (pine garlands, roaring fires), which is a powerful psychological driver for holiday consumption.

The Image-Driven Imperative: The consumer is motivated by the desire to replicate and share this idealized image on social media (queuing for selfies, Pinterest searches), making the trend a social and cultural imperative.

The Emotional Value of Heritage: The products are seen as tangible elements of a desirable, established tradition, providing a psychological ""investment"" in a feeling of belonging and stability.

Consumer Insights: Your purchases are a reflection of an ideal; buy the pieces that allow you to curate and realize the ""perfect"" scene you aspire to share.Insights for Brands: Sell the scene, not the product; design every retail, store, and pop-up experience to be a ready-made, high-quality backdrop for the consumer's self-generated aspirational content.

Final Insight: The Halo Effect of Cultural Nostalgia

The success of ""Ralph Lauren Christmas"" teaches that a brand's most valuable asset is an authentic, fully developed, and culturally resonant heritage narrative that can be effortlessly rediscovered by a new generation seeking emotional comfort and stability. This halo effect of cultural nostalgia translates directly into increased traffic, sales, and enduring brand equity, proving that timelessness is the ultimate form of viral marketing.

Consumer Insights: The value of a brand is tied to the strength of the feeling it evokes; choose brands whose history feels like a positive part of your aspirational future.

Insights for Brands: Nurture your brand's heritage as an asset, but ensure you create modern, inclusive cultural collaborations to make that heritage relevant to the next generation of high-value consumers.

Final Thought (summary): Ralph Lauren's Strategic Triumph in the Comfort Economy

The ""Ralph Lauren Christmas"" aesthetic is a strategic triumph, demonstrating the powerful commercial returns generated when a luxury brand's disciplined, decade-long elevation strategy perfectly intersects with a dominant consumer trend for comfort, nostalgia, and quiet luxury. The core consumer is the Heritage-Seeking Style Investor, a digitally savvy shopper who uses the brand's aesthetic—defined by tartan, deep greens and reds, and Polo Bear motifs—to purchase a feeling of timeless, aspirational stability during uncertain times. The future implication for the industry is the necessity of becoming a cohesive lifestyle conglomerate, moving beyond apparel and using high-impact, experiential marketing (like the global pop-ups) to transform a well-honed aesthetic into a viral cultural moment, thereby securing enduring sales growth and insulating the brand against inevitable fashion trend cycles.

Trends 2025: Comfort Nostalgia: The Psychology of Softness and Sentiment

This macro trend describes the widespread consumer behavior, particularly across Millennials and Gen Z, of actively seeking comfort, stability, and emotional well-being by engaging with and purchasing products that evoke fond memories and a sense of familiarity from past decades. In fashion, this translates to styles that prioritize relaxed silhouettes, familiar heritage codes, and a sense of timeless quality over fleeting, challenging trends.

The Emotional Security Purchase The trend is a direct psychological response to global uncertainty, rapid technological change (AI, metaverse), and the fast-paced digital world, which leaves many feeling disconnected. Nostalgic cues—whether from the Y2K era or a heritage brand like Ralph Lauren—activate emotional memories linked to comfort, security, and simpler times, leading to higher customer trust and loyalty. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for items that provide this emotional relief, often referred to as ""comfort buying.""

The Rise of the 'Kidult' Consumer A significant driver is the rise of the ""Kidult""—adults seeking products that trigger nostalgia and recreate the comfort of childhood. For fashion, this translates into an acceptance of playful elements and whimsy (e.g., the Polo Bear, teddy bear motifs, Y2K accessories like butterfly clips) but presented with an elevated, self-aware twist that meets adult expectations of quality and style.

The Blended, Unburdened Aesthetic The comfort is manifested in design through flowing, relaxed silhouettes (wide-leg denim, elevated athleisure, oversized cardigans) and tactile materials (luxe cashmere, soft faux fur, sherpa linings) that feel huggable and non-restrictive. The nostalgia is often a ""composite"" aesthetic, freely mixing references from different decades (e.g., '90s plaid with Y2K silhouettes) to evoke a general feeling of familiarity rather than historical accuracy.

Implication for Fashion Industry: Brands must pivot their design and marketing from selling seasonal novelty to selling emotional resonance and enduring value. This requires investing in storytelling, material quality, and design longevity to create products that function as tangible links to positive memories and provide psychological comfort in an unstable world.

LAS VEGAS, N.M, December 12, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A New Mexico jury has returned a $220 million verdict, finding that the Michelin North America tire company was liable for a deadly crash that killed three members of a Texas family in the summer of 2021.

Laura Zamarippa, Rosalva Marin and 14-year-old Alexis Zamarippa died when a Michelin-produced LTX M tire installed on the front driver’s side violently separated while the three family members were driving on a rural highway in Gaines County, Texas.

The failure caused the car being driven by Laura Zamarippa to veer into oncoming traffic, causing a head-on collision with another vehicle. As a result of the crash, Ms. Zamarippa and Ms. Marin were pronounced dead at the scene, while Alexis died shortly after being transported to a medical facility by air ambulance.

In honor of its half-century milestone, beloved SoHo mainstay Raoul’s teamed up with Moda Operandi and Chloë Sevigny to celebrate in true French American fashion. In other words, a steak and martini-filled dinner followed by a bash in the bistro.

Under the instantly-recognizable tin ceiling, a lucky posse of invitees mingled by the bar, picking up Grey Goose cocktails and glasses of bubbly to take to their seats. A quintessential intimate date night, Raoul’s style, commenced. Tables of two and booths of four were occupied, with custom Moda Domus ceramic ash trays and Warby Parker reading glasses nestled alongside the place settings. Finely-dressed waiters appeared with oysters bienville gratinées, a warm goats cheese salad, and artichoke vinaigrette to start. And after that, there was only one acceptable phrase heard: Steak au-poivre, s’il vous plait.

While the food was prepared, the room was abuzz. By 8.30 p.m., a surprise burlesque performance dazzled the room, with Jennifer Lawrence watching on with delight. Fashion designers Jackson Wiederhoeft and Christopher John Rodgers had gotten their hands on crayons—transforming the paper tablecloths into chef-d'œuvres—while Lauren Santo Domingo chatted with Brandon Maxwell and Stephanie Suberville of Heirlome.

The appetizers appeared and were cleared just as fast, plates of steaks were reduced to mere peppercorns as cornets upon cornets of frites flowed from the kitchen. A gigantic tiramisu sheet cake—so massive that it took three people to light the cake—was served on custom Moda Domus x Raoul’s dessert plates. Owners Guy and Karim Raoul gave a heartfelt toast to the crowd: “Here's to 50 more years,” they said, followed by a host of hoots and cheers.

A late-night party ensued, swelling bigger and bigger with each passing hour. An influx of notables were scattered around the bar, admiring, and wearing, the merchandise collaboration—graphic 8th Story baseball caps and Les Tien hoodies and baby tees—while they waited for the diners to finish their slices of birthday cake to come join them.

The later it got, nobody wanted to leave, as more and more people arrive to pack in tightly against the paintings and nude drawing-covered walls. Hours later, guests walked out of the undiscerning door onto the streets of Soho, bellies full and hearts even fuller.","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/693c9fb84f3adc478bb8d464/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/000080780012.jpg",N,,2025-12-12 23:04:37.752493

ID32,Nvidia,2025-12-12 23:15:52+00:00,The Next Platform,Everybody But Nvidia And TSMC Has To Make It Up In Volume With AI - The Next Platform,Timothy Prickett Morgan,,,,,https://www.nextplatform.com/2025/12/12/everybody-but-nvidia-and-tsmc-has-to-make-it-up-in-volume-with-ai/,"Broadcom’s other option was to find itself on the outside of the GenAI boom and get nothing and risk losing a substantial portion of chip sales into datacenter products.
That AI order book also includes DSPs, lasers, PCI-Express switches, and probably a smattering of other things like storage controllers.
In the quarter, AI XPU sales were modest, around $765 million in our model, but up 2.2X from a year ago.
Most of the AI sales came from AI networking, which we think hit $5.74 billion thanks in large part to the 102.4 Tb/sec Tomahawk 6 rollout but also helped by the Jericho 4 rollout, too, we think.
Add it up, and AI drove $6.51 billion in revenues, up 74 percent year on year.","We keep seeing the same thing over and over again in the AI racket, and people keep reacting to it like it is a new or surprising idea. So we will say it very clearly here one more time: The only companies that are making money – meaning additional gross and operating profits, and sometimes meaning “material revenue” as the US Securities and Exchange Commission uses that term – on the GenAI boom right now are Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Everybody else in the AI system and model supply chain, as far as we can tell, is either losing money fist under hand or diluting their profits by expanding into AI. What financial people call “operating profit accretive but operating margin dilutive.” Broadcom, for all of its might and prowess in networking and other switchery in the datacenter, where it thankfully has very good operating margins, is no exception. And so, we see that Broadcom, like other chip suppliers as well as OEMs and ODMs higher up in the value chain, have one after the other decided to go after the GenAI business and dilute their profits rather than be left behind.

It really is the only choice, and thankfully for Broadcom, it bought Symantec, CA, and VMware to have some highly profitable legacy enterprise software that is very sticky in the datacenter and therefore can counterbalance its AI aspirations and the skinnier margins they necessitate based on the nature of this market. Broadcom’s other option was to find itself on the outside of the GenAI boom and get nothing and risk losing a substantial portion of chip sales into datacenter products.

So while people are jaw-boning about how Broadcom missed Wall Street’s expectations for AI-related revenues in the final quarter of 2025, we do not think that is the issue. This AI business has a backlog of $73 billion over the next six quarters, and Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive officer, was clear that between now and the end of that backlog term even more orders will come in. What was really driven home that Broadcom is being coaxed into being an AI system integrator and that this, too, will further dilute its profits – and there is no escaping this. If big clients – hyperscalers, cloud builders, and model builders – want their chip helper to deliver full systems, they will go elsewhere to get that super-low price, that one ass to kick when things are late, and that one throat to choke when stuff doesn’t work.

And so, without asking for it, Broadcom is now an ODM, which means it has the responsibility of an OEM but at a much larger scale with even lower profits.

Strange world we are building, isn’t it? Perhaps Supermicro should merge with Marvell and get it over with. (You heard it here first.)

One of the four Broadcom XPU customers was already buying rackscale machines built by the company, and now the fifth XPU customer is going straight to buying rackscale machinery, which includes a slew of Broadcom chips but obviously also a lot of stuff that comes from the outside.

Of that $73 billion in AI backlog, the XPUs represent around $53 billion of that, and the Tomahawk 6 switch ASICs are probably a very big portion of it. Tan said that Tomahawk 6 is the fastest ramping switch ASIC in Broadcom’s history, and that is saying a lot. That AI order book also includes DSPs, lasers, PCI-Express switches, and probably a smattering of other things like storage controllers.

By the way, Tan confirmed that it was indeed model builder Anthropic that had placed an order with Broadcom to get around $10 billion of Google TPU racks a few months back, and said further that Anthropic had just placed a new order for another $11 billion in TPU racks for delivery in late 2026. As for the fifth customer, which we do not believe is OpenAI even though Broadcom is partnering with that model builder, the order is for $1 billion worth of XPU systems of unknown design, delivered in 2026. OpenAI’s deal with Broadcom runs from 2027 through 2029 (not 2026 as the press release said as Tan clarified in the call with Wall Street) and we believe is to help shepherd 10 gigawatts of some kind of capacity to OpenAI. (For all we know, OpenAI wants to use Google TPUs as well.) And, for the record, Tan confirmed that this OpenAI deal is “different from the XPU program we are developing with them,” by which we think he means the development and manufacturing of OpenAI’s homegrown “Titan” inference XPU.

Not to get all Appalachian on y’all, but that’s a lot of lean spring bear meat to eat and not a lot of fat to cut it with. But it is eat or be eaten out there in GenAI Land, so get out your knives like Broadcom has. And, by the way, that CA and VMware base can be fattened up with higher prices as needed. . . . And you can bet Hock Tan’s last dollar that this will happen if the overall company margins require it.

With that all said, let’s get to the Broadcom Q4 F2025 numbers.

In the quarter ended on November 2, Broadcom had a little over $18 billion in sales, up 28.2 percent year on year and up 12.9 percent sequentially. Operating income rose by 62.3 percent to $7.51 billion, and net income rose by 97 percent to $8.52 billion, thanks in part to a $1.65 billion tax gain that Broadcom has kept in its back pocket.

For the full year, Broadcom had $63.89 billion in sales, up 23.9 percent and net income of $23.13 billion, up by a factor of 3.9X and representing 36.2 percent of revenues. This is amazing, truly. It isn’t magic, it is just what happens when you put together a whole bunch of little monopolies to give you the ability to face the even harsher reality of the modern chip market.

Broadcom ended the quarter with $16.18 billion in cash and $65.14 billion in debts, the latter trending downward ever so slowly and the former growing fast.

The Infrastructure Software group that has been built up over the past decade as a profit bulwark had $6.94 billion in sales, up 19.2 percent, with operating income of $5.42 billion, up 29.1 percent and representing 78 percent of revenues. For the year, the Broadcom software conglomerate had just over $27 billion in sales, up 25.9 percent, and $20.76 billion in operating income, up 48.5 percent and accounting for 76.8 percent of revenues. That is some mainframe-class profitability, and it stands to reason because CA is literally mainframe software and VMware is the modern mainframe software stack in a Kubernetes world.

In the final quarter of fiscal 2025, the Semiconductor Solutions group at Broadcom had $11.07 billion in sales, up 34.5 percent, with operating income of $6.53 billion, up 41.7 percent. For the year, the chip side of the Broadcom house had $36.86 billion in revenues, up 22.5 percent, with operating income of just a hair over $23 billion, up 37.6 percent and representing 62.5 percent of revenues. This is still a very healthy business given that margin-diluting XPU business.

In the quarter, AI XPU sales were modest, around $765 million in our model, but up 2.2X from a year ago. Most of the AI sales came from AI networking, which we think hit $5.74 billion thanks in large part to the 102.4 Tb/sec Tomahawk 6 rollout but also helped by the Jericho 4 rollout, too, we think. This is a factor of 3.1X sequential boost in revenue. Add it up, and AI drove $6.51 billion in revenues, up 74 percent year on year.

Here’s the data behind our model:

Looking ahead to Q1 F2026, Broadcom expects to double AI chip revenues to $8.2 billion, with non-AI chips down a bit to $4.1 billion due to seasonality in the wireless chip business. Infrastructure software revenue will be about $6.8 billion in the Broadcom forecast. Add it up, and Broadcom is expecting around $19.1 billion in revenues for Q1, up 28 percent.",http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/broadcom-jericho-4-chip.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 01:59:02.967113

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead. FASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments. I’m really sorry that we could not get to them all. But we only have an hour. (Laughs.) KISSANE: Thank you.

Contributor Series: From Prompt Design to Data Engineering – Why Architecture Matters for Agentic AI

Agentic AI is having a moment. Teams everywhere are wiring up agents that plan tasks, call tools, and act autonomously. Demos look smooth, and product pitches sound sharp. But most of these systems sit on a fragile base. At their core, agents depend on data. If that data is slow, scattered, or stale, the system breaks, no matter how good the model or prompt may be.

Why Instacart is betting on AI agents for grocery shopping For Instacart, the ChatGPT app builds on a broader partnership with OpenAI.","Instacart launched a new shopping app inside ChatGPT, bringing online grocery ordering directly into the artificial intelligence (AI) assistant.

Now live, the integration makes Instacart the first grocery partner — and the first app overall — to support end-to-end shopping with Instant Checkout inside OpenAI’s ChatGPT, according to dual announcements from the companies. In time for the holidays, shoppers can build grocery carts and complete checkout directly inside a chat, with orders fulfilled through Instacart’s own delivery network.

How the Instacart app works in ChatGPT

More broadly, the app highlights how retailers are now using AI systems not just to surface products, but to carry out complete shopping tasks. The growing trend — often referred to as agentic shopping or “agentic commerce” — allows AI to take action on a user’s behalf, including completing entire purchases.

In practice, the Instacart experience starts with a prompt inside the chat interface. Shoppers can ask ChatGPT a question such as, “Instacart, can you help me shop for apple pie ingredients?” OpenAI said ChatGPT may also suggest the Instacart app when users mention food, recipes or meal ideas.

From there, shoppers can sign into their Instacart account to install the app. Once connected, the app pulls items from nearby retailers and assembles a ready-to-review cart using OpenAI’s models, the companies said.

Notably, the experience draws on Instacart’s real-time inventory and pricing data, so recommendations reflect what is actually available at local stores.

“Powering grocery shopping inside an AI agent requires technology that understands constantly changing, highly local inventory and converts it into accurate, real-time decisions,” stated Anirban Kundu, chief technology officer at Instacart, in the announcement.

The app also incorporates shoppers’ existing preferences — such as past orders and favorite brands — similar to how personalization works in Instacart’s own app and website. Once a cart is finalized, users can check out and pay directly within ChatGPT, without switching to a separate site or app, OpenAI said. Instacart then assigns a shopper to pick and deliver the order through its network, which now spans nearly 100,000 stores across North America.

Bringing payments into ChatGPT

Behind the scenes, the in-chat payment flow is enabled by OpenAI’s new Instant Checkout experience.

OpenAI introduced Instant Checkout earlier this year, initially with Etsy and a limited group of Shopify merchants. Since then, the company has announced additional commerce partnerships — including with Walmart and Target — as it works to expand in-chat shopping.

Instant Checkout runs on the Agentic Commerce Protocol, an open-source framework co-developed by OpenAI and Stripe. Payments are processed through Stripe, with Instacart support for digital wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay expected to roll out in the coming weeks.

According to OpenAI, Instant Checkout for Instacart is available to ChatGPT Pro, Plus and logged-in free users in the United States. The full Instacart experience with Instant Checkout is available on desktop and mobile web. The standalone Instacart app is available on iOS and Android, with Instant Checkout expected to launch on those native platforms in the coming weeks.

Why Instacart is betting on AI agents for grocery shopping

For Instacart, the ChatGPT app builds on a broader partnership with OpenAI. Instacart was an early contributor to OpenAI’s Operator research preview, according to the companies, and continues to use OpenAI APIs alongside its own AI technology.

Earlier this year, Instacart launched Smart Shop, which uses generative AI and machine learning to personalize food recommendations. In November, Instacart followed with additional AI tools for grocery retailers, including an agentic shopping assistant called Cart Assistant. Kroger is among the first retailers planning to offer Cart Assistant to customers.

Instacart said its partnerships with OpenAI, as well as Google and Microsoft, are “helping define how grocery shopping works across the next generation of digital agents.”

Looking ahead, the company added that it expects ‘every generative AI company to connect more directly with Instacart’s grocery engine, linking their massive consumer reach with our network of retail partners and driving incremental demand.”

What Instacart’s partnership with OpenAI signals for AI-driven commerce

The Instacart launch shows chat-based commerce moving closer to real transactions, with grocery emerging as an early proving ground for agentic shopping.

Early data suggests the shift is already underway. Adobe data indicates traffic from AI-driven sources to ecommerce sites rose 758% year over year between Nov. 1 and Dec. 1. The firm also projected that traffic from large language models (LLMs) to retail sites would increase 515% to 520% during the 2025 holiday season, compared with 2024.

Shopping activity inside ChatGPT is also increasing. Shopping has gained a larger share of mobile ChatGPT queries in recent months, according to Sensor Tower data cited by Bain & Company. From December 2024 through June 2025, shopping-related queries rose from 7.8% to 9.8% of all searches. This represents a 25% category gain on top of roughly 70% overall growth in ChatGPT usage, Bain said.

That growth effectively means shopping queries doubled over the six-month period from January to June. Bain noted that “optimizing for AI (AIO) — also called generative engine optimization (GEO) — with ChatGPT and Perplexity is no longer an option for B2B and consumer brands.”

Against that backdrop, OpenAI has continued to expand ChatGPT’s shopping capabilities. In November, the company rolled out new shopping research features that add personalized recommendations, feedback and discovery tools across its apps and subscription tiers. The updates position ChatGPT more directly against competitors such as Perplexity and Google, which are also expanding agentic shopping tools.

Among branded airline lounges, Delta Sky Club leads the way.

The survey of 1,430 travelers who visited a U.S. airport lounge in the past year was fielded from September through October.

Another interesting finding: Access to a preferred lounge has become a major driver of airport and airline selection.

The survey included seven airline lounge brands: Centurion, Sky Club, Capital One, Chase Sapphire, American Airlines Admirals Club, Alaska and United Club. Sizeable lounge networks The Club and Escape Lounges weren't included in the published report because survey sample size wasn't large enough, said Michael Taylor, J.D. Power's managing director of travel, hospitality and retail.

The survey also didn't include the United Polaris, American Flagship or Delta One premium lounge brands, nor did it include international airline-branded lounges.

Airport lounge brands, by the numbers

The Centurion Lounge brand led the way with a customer satisfaction index of 782 on J.D. Power's 1,000-point scale.

Capital One and Sky Club brands were next with 773 points, followed by Chase Sapphire with 771 points. In the bottom half of the survey were Admirals Club with 753 points, Alaska lounges with 748 points and United Club with 705 points.

Food and beverage offerings are the biggest draw of lounges, J.D. Power found, with 74% of respondents citing F&B as a reason for going to a lounge. More than half of those, 38%, said they visited an airport lounge to avoid expensive airport eating and drinking options.

Among lounge visitors, 34% said they gained access from a credit card perk, 21% gained access due to elite status with an airline and 18% had lounge memberships.

Notably, 47% of respondents said access to a preferred airport lounge is a driver of airport and connecting airport selection.

Taylor said he was surprised by how high that figure was. But he also said he was among the flyers whose flight selection is shaped by lounge access. He likes to fly early on Delta out of LaGuardia so he can take advantage of his favorite Sky Club.

Inclusion criteria included stage I to III invasive breast cancer, premenopausal status at diagnosis, age 18 to 45, and candidacy for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.

The prospective cohort evaluated fertility preservation strategies in this patient population, and data were shared at the 2025 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Among patients aged 41 to 45 years, 75% received GnRHa alone, and 25% declined any procedure. Among patients 40 years or younger, 89% received GnRHa, 25% underwent cryopreservation, and 9% underwent no procedure. Acceptance varied according to hormone receptor status, with higher GnRHa uptake in patients with hormone receptor-positive disease. Factors associated with cryopreservation acceptance included younger age, absence of prior children, more recent year of diagnosis, and lower tumor grade.

“Most premenopausal women with early breast cancer accepted the use of a genetic agonist during chemotherapy to preserve ovarian function. Factors associated with acceptance included younger age at diagnosis, no prior children, more recent year of diagnosis, and lower tumor grade,” explained Matteo Lambertini, associate professor and consultant in medical oncology at the University of Genova and IRCCS Policlinico San Martino Hospital in Genova, Italy.

Importantly, controlled ovarian stimulation for oocyte cryopreservation did not negatively impact disease-free survival or overall survival.

PREFER Study: A National Oncofertility Initiative

Oncofertility counseling is recommended for all premenopausal women with newly diagnosed early breast cancer who are candidates for chemotherapy. Standard approaches include cryopreservation of oocytes, embryos, and ovarian tissue, with concurrent GnRHa therapy recommended during chemotherapy to preserve ovarian function. However, data on the uptake of these strategies and reasons for patient refusal have been limited.

The analysis presented at the 2025 symposium represents the first multicenter evaluation of patients enrolled in PREFER between November 2012 and December 2024. PREFER was conducted at 23 Italian centers. Inclusion criteria included stage I to III invasive breast cancer, premenopausal status at diagnosis, age 18 to 45, and candidacy for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with stage IV disease, prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy, severe psychiatric disorders, or inability to provide consent were excluded.

The primary objective was to evaluate patient needs and choices regarding ovarian function and fertility preservation, including acceptance rates and reasons for refusal. Secondary objectives included safety of controlled ovarian stimulation for oocyte cryopreservation in patients 40 years or younger, with disease-free survival and overall survival as endpoints. Subgroup analyses were performed according to hormone receptor status.

Key Findings: Fertility Preservation by Age and Hormone Receptor Status

In patients aged 41 to 45 years, 78% of those with hormone receptor-positive disease chose GnRHa alone, while 22% had no procedure. Among hormone receptor-negative patients, 69% received GnRHa alone and 31% declined any intervention. The most frequently reported reason for refusal in this age group was completion of family planning (11%).

Among patients 40 years or younger with hormone receptor-positive disease, 90% received GnRHa, 26% underwent cryopreservation, and 8% had no procedure. For hormone receptor-negative patients, 87% received GnRHa, 21% underwent cryopreservation, and 12% had no procedure. Younger age strongly predicted oocyte cryopreservation, as did having no prior children, more recent year of diagnosis, and lower tumor grade. Hormone receptor-negative status was associated with lower uptake relative to hormone receptor-positive disease.

Patients who underwent oocyte cryopreservation (127 patients) were younger, with a median age of 33, compared with 36 among those who did not pursue cryopreservation (406 patients). Parental status strongly influenced decisions: 87% of patients who pursued cryopreservation had no prior children compared with 35% who did not. Tumor grade and type of chemotherapy also differed between groups, with anthracycline- and taxane-based regimens more frequently used in patients not undergoing cryopreservation.

Safety and Clinical Implications

Among patients 40 years or younger, disease-free survival remained high in both groups. Four-year disease-free survival was 95% in patients who underwent oocyte cryopreservation versus 87% among those who did not. Overall survival at four years was 97% in those who had cryopreservation versus 96% in those who did not. These results suggest that undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation does not negatively affect outcomes.

“Results from the PREFER study may provide novel prospective evidence to improve oncofertility counseling for premenopausal women with early breast cancer. From a public health perspective, these findings may help optimize collaboration between oncology and fertility units, including resource allocation,” Lambertini concluded.

China has figured out the U.S. strategy for allowing it to buy Nvidia Corp.’s H200 and is rejecting the AI chip in favor of domestically developed semiconductors, White House AI czar David Sacks said, citing news reports.

President Donald Trump said on Dec. 8 he would allow shipments of Nvidia’s H200 to China, part of an administration effort backed by Sacks to challenge Chinese tech champions like Huawei Technologies Co. by bringing American competition to their home market. On Dec. 12, Sacks signaled that he was uncertain about whether that approach would work.

“They’re rejecting our chips,” Sacks said in an interview on Bloomberg Tech, citing an unspecified news article he had seen that day. “Apparently they don’t want them, and I think the reason for that is they want semiconductor independence.”

Sacks’ comments raise questions about whether Nvidia will be able to recover revenue from China, a data center market it has removed entirely from its forecasts but that CEO Jensen Huang has put at $50 billion this year. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimate annual H200 revenue in China to be a $10 billion opportunity — but only if the nation accepts the U.S. firm’s chips.

(Bloomberg Technology via YouTube)

In a statement from a spokesperson, Nvidia said it continues to work with the administration on H200 licenses for vetted customers. “While we do not yet have results to report, it’s clear that three years of overbroad export controls fueled America’s foreign competitors and cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars,” the company said.

China is weighing a package of incentives worth as much as $70 billion to support its local chipmaking industry, Bloomberg reported Dec. 12, underscoring Beijing’s resolve to reduce its reliance on foreign chipmakers such as Nvidia. It suggests the government will continue to support companies like Huawei and Cambricon Technologies Corp. even with the H200 cleared by the U.S. for export to China.

The H200, which was introduced in 2023 and began shipping to customers last year, is part of the Hopper generation of Nvidia’s chips, second-best to the Blackwell line and two generations behind the upcoming Rubin series. An 18-month lag behind the latest Nvidia chips was part of the Trump administration’s justification for the decision.

Sacks, a venture capitalist who joined the administration in January, identified China’s desire to prop up and subsidize Huawei as a key reason for its H200 reluctance. Even so, he defended the decision to allow China to access H200 chips, which he called a “lagging” technology and no longer state-of-the-art.

RELATED: Rivian Unveils AI Chip for Automated Driving, Ditches Nvidia

“What you see is China’s not taking them because they want to prop up and subsidize Huawei,” Sacks said. “That was part of our calculation, of selling not the best but lagging chips to China, is that you can take market share away from Huawei, but I think the Chinese government has figured that out, and that’s why they’re not allowing them.”

The H200 decision was motivated by an assessment that Huawei — Nvidia’s Chinese archrival — offers AI systems with comparable horsepower, including its Cloud Matrix 384 platform, which links hundreds of processors together to compensate for lower performance in individual chips. Some U.S. officials saw the H200 as compromise from Nvidia’s earlier push to export a version of the Blackwell chip to China, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Last week, as officials weighed the decision, Huang told reporters in Washington that he had no clue if China would accept H200 chips. On Dec. 8, Trump said in a Truth Social post that President Xi Jinping of China responded positively to the possibility of H200 export approvals.

Beijing has yet to publicly agree to allow imports of Nvidia’s H200 products. It also has yet to publicly reject them, despite the recent U.S. policy change. Earlier this year, China shunned the H20, a significantly less capable chip Trump allowed this summer.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-12/Nvidia-1200_1.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:13:53.413834

Reuters (TRI) was the first to report that Eli Lilly & Co. is pushing for a faster review process as it races to bring the new weight-loss pill to market. The FDA Commissioner’s Office is said to want to cut the time reviewers spend checking whether the drug applications have enough material from 60 days to one week for Eli Lilly’s pill and other medicines under a new, speedier process.

However, after internal pushback, the Commissioner’s Office is said to now be pushing to cut those reviews to two or three weeks from 60 days. If adopted, the new timeline could see Eli Lilly’s weight-loss pill approved as early as March 28 of next year. Currently, Eli Lilly has May 20 circled as the likely decision date for Orforglipron.

Eli Lilly’s Weight-Loss Drug Race

Eli Lilly is racing to bring its new weight-loss drug to market as it tries to stay a step ahead of archrival Novo Nordisk (NVO), which is expected to submit its own weight-loss pill for FDA approval this December or in January 2026. Eli Lilly has already begun manufacturing Orforglipron in anticipation of regulatory approval.

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk dominate the obesity treatment market that analysts estimate could be worth $150 billion annually by 2030. Weight-loss pills are expected to be a game-changer for the medications, which are currently taken by injection using needles. Orforglipron helped patients lose 12.4% of their body weight in a late-stage clinical trial.

Is LLY Stock a Buy?

The company made the move to delay projects from 2027 to 2028, Bloomberg reports, mostly due to labor and material shortages.

OpenAI has signed a record $300 billion contract with Oracle for cloud services over five years, with the contract starting in 2027.

Oracle is also a backing Stargate, the OpenAI joint venture which currently has one operational data center in Texas. The Abilene facility was built by Crusoe (which is expanding the site), and operated by Oracle for OpenAI.

However, improved international airport connectivity is crucial for continued growth.

Representative Image

For decades, Pune has been known as a city shaped by academia, industry, and engineering. Its economic base was first anchored by automotive majors such as Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto and Mercedes-Benz India, which in turn built a large ecosystem of component makers and engineering design talent. Other large manufacturing units grew through industrial groups such as Bharat Forge, Kirloskar and Thermax, which further strengthened the city’s engineering capabilities. Establishments like Defence Research and Development Organisation, College of Military Engineering, and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory created a skilled pool in electronics, materials science, and precision systems.""This long-standing mix of automotive, defence, and manufacturing expertise is the reason GCCs (global capability centres) trust Pune with complex design, digital engineering, analytics, and operations work,” says Niket Karajagi, who is doing a doctorate in enterprise resilience at the Savitribai Phule Pune University. Estimates by GCC consultancy Zinnov finds that about 21% of India’s GCCs have their presence in Pune, employing nearly 12% of the country’s GCC talent across engineering R&D (42%), IT (25%), and BPM (33%). A host of global engineering companies, financial institutions and others have their GCCs in the city. Sameer Jain, executive VP at technology consulting firm Intraedge, says all the GCCs he was part of used Pune’s talent to design, prototype, build, test, and release highly innovative products in technology and engineering. Piyush Kedia, co-founder & CEO of GCC consultancy InCommon, says when a bank or mobility firm sets up in Pune, it finds engineers who already understand safety, precision, and scale – “which is exactly what modern digital platforms demand.” Rashmi Rawat, head of talent offerings & insights at GCC consultancy GatewAI, says the defining feature of Pune’s GCC ecosystem is simple: “The design-build-optimise culture here means Pune adopted applied AI faster, especially in supply chain, planning, and operations. This is not ticket delivery. It’s product thinking.” Conceived in Pune, used worldwide That product thinking is reflected across GCCs. Raja Jamalamadaka, MD of Roche Digital Centre of Excellence India, recently told us that their Pune centre is at the core of the future of healthcare for the Swiss pharma giant. The centre is focusing on leveraging technology, especially AI/ML, to predict disease, identify patients at risk, diagnose disease early and improve chronic disease management. Pascal Daloz, CEO of Dassault Systemes, the France-based provider of 3D virtual environment software used to design just about everything, recently told us that their Pune centre is their largest development centre in the world. The CEO of the company’s India solutions lab, Sudarshan Mogasale, said what the world will see in engineering three or six years from now is what is being built today in India. “From embedding AI in design tools to building virtual cities and digital factories, our teams are transforming how products are imagined and built,” he said. Sudish Lambodara Panicker, MD and head of BNY India, which has a large GCC in Pune, told us the GCC is working with data and algorithms to help shape the future of the American financial services giant, understand what its future markets and products should be. Rashmi Rawat says solutions originating from Pune include AI-based optimisation engines that scaled across multiple global business units, industrial IoT platforms that moved from proof-of-concept to enterprise-wide deployments, and cloud-native data or streaming platforms that became reference architectures within their organisations. Sachin Kulkarni, president of global services at US financial technology firm Fiserv, and whose Pune centre began in 2007, says Maharashtra is home to hundreds of engineering colleges that offer a rich talent pool for roles and skills the centre focuses on, including product development, data science, automation, full-stack developers, cloud computing, cybersecurity, AI/ML, Java, and more. Divesh Agarwal, founder & CEO of offshore solutions firm Aumni, says their global clients prioritise system safety, operational efficiency, and fault tolerance, “and Pune excels in high-stakes domains like financial engineering, core banking, and cyber automotive.” Need international airport As more and more GCCs enter Pune, some are getting worried about the growth beginning to outpace its infrastructure. The biggest concern is poor international connectivity. The absence of a full-fledged international airport means most international travel is via Mumbai, which adds 4-6 hours to every global trip. “This affects leadership visibility and makes it harder to attract global talent,"" says Kailash Maisekar, country director for India at software solutions firm Idox Group. GRAPHICCity’s product-thinking culture sets it apart Pune’s industrial backbone – auto, defence, and manufacturing – trained an entire generation of engineers to think in systems, not slides. The same discipline that once designed engines now designs digital platforms, SDV (software defined vehicle) software, and AI-driven control systems. Piyush Kedia, Co-founder & CEO, InCommon Pune’s product-thinking culture is what sets it apart. Pune engineers think in systems, not just code, emphasising how legacy strengths from auto and industrial sectors directly support modern domains like digital twins, industrial IoT, predictive analytics, and platform optimisation workstreams.Rashmi Rawat, Head, Talent Offerings & Insights, GatewAI BFSI GCCs are increasingly favouring Pune due to lower real estate costs, campus scalability, and access to finance-tech talent. While Mumbai remains the front office for financial institutions, Pune is fast becoming the engine room for their global operations, analytics, and digital transformation work. Sandeep Panat, Founder, Wizmatic The co-existence of engineering and technology talent in Pune has led to an explosion of GCC setups that are pivoted around product and engineering innovation, particularly in areas such as automation, Industry 4.0, AI, and smart factory.Sameer Jain, Executive Vice-President, Intraedge Around 21% of India’s GCCs are based in Pune, employing nearly 12% of the country’s GCC workforce across engineering R&D, IT, and BPM functions. The city’s rising focus areas – agentic and physical AI, platform modernisation, and digital twins – align with global technology priorities and reflect Pune’s position as an innovation-led engineering hub.Namita Adavi, Partner, Zinnov Pune airport is already operating near saturation, and that directly affects one-stop international routings, cargo capacity and even slot availability for global leadership travel. That is why Purandar, the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje International Airport, is absolutely critical for the region. If we accelerate Purandar, we can meaningfully upgrade Pune’s global connectivity and give our GCC ecosystem the cargo and international access it urgently needs.Sangramsinh Pawar, Founder & CEO, Uttung GCC Pune’s GCCs are uniquely positioned to bridge IT and OT (operational technology) capabilities at scale. Vikram Puranik, Senior Vice-President, GlobalLogic Pune GCCs have delivered global product modules, risk and analytics platforms for banking clients, automotive control and telematics software, and full-stack SaaS modules for their parent companies.Niket Karajagi, Vice-Chair, CII Pune GCC ForumMajor GCCs in Pune BNY Mellon, HSBC, Barclays, Vodafone, Deutsche Bank, Mastercard, Cummins, Dassault Systemes, UBS, ZS Associates, Citibank, Siemens PLM, Skoda, Credit Suisse, Maersk, Roche

When I'm traveling, I'll usually check for a Courtyard before I even start thinking about other properties. With such a wide selection in its portfolio, though, I'm almost always able to find a Marriott property—with all the consistency and quality that comes with it—wherever I go. In the coming year, I have a few short trips planned, and these are the hotels I've got my eye on.

1. SpringHill Suites by Marriott: Springdale, Utah

SpringHill Suites by Marriott - Springdale Zion National Park is located in the heart of Springdale, Utah, just minutes from the west entrance to Zion National Park. This property punches well above its weight and feels more like an upscale lodge than a chain hotel. The architecture and decor feature natural wood and stone that blend seamlessly with the surrounding landscape. Its unbeatable location makes it a perfect base camp for exploring both Zion and the charming town of Springdale.

What makes it a great place to stay is the immersion in nature. The outdoor pool and hot tub offer unobstructed, panoramic views of the massive red sandstone cliffs, allowing you to soak in the scenery after a long day of hiking. The last time I stayed, I arrived at night, and when I opened my window to the red rock views, I literally gasped. The suites are spacious and modern, and the outdoor patios with fire pits are perfect for stargazing. This hotel offers the reliability of a Marriott property and the affordability of the SpringHill Brand with the vibe of a luxury canyon resort.

2. Fairfield Inn and Suites Waterfront: Port Clinton, Ohio

Fairfield by Marriott Inn and Suites Port Clinton Waterfront is perfectly situated along Ohio's Lake Erie shoreline. This property takes full advantage of its waterfront location with a lakeside patio where you can enjoy your morning coffee or your favorite evening beverage while watching boats drift by. It is also conveniently located near the Jet Express ferry, making it the perfect launchpad for day trips to Put-in-Bay or Kelleys Island. Plus, Cedar Point is only about half an hour from the hotel.

What impresses me, though, are the lake views. Unlike many hotels that claim to be ""near"" the water, this one sits right on the Lake Erie shoreline—minutes from the iconic Port Clinton lighthouse. Some rooms even boast balconies that look out over the lake, toward the Perry’s Victory monument. With a complimentary hot breakfast and a bright, modern indoor pool area, this Fairfield is an excellent value for folks looking for a lake vacation in Ohio.

3. Courtyard by Marriott Oceanfront: Carolina Beach, North Carolina

If you're a beach lover, you won't do much better than Courtyard by Marriott Carolina Beach Oceanfront. Every single guest room at this hotel is oceanfront and features a private balcony overlooking the Atlantic. You are guaranteed a front-row seat to the sunrise and the sound of crashing waves, without paying for an upgrade or risking a “partial view.”

Located nearly on the sand and the vintage Carolina Beach Boardwalk, the property offers immediate access to dining, shopping, and, of course, the beach. The property has both indoor and outdoor pools, ensuring you can swim regardless of the weather.

4. Hotel Saint Louis, Autograph Collection: St. Louis, Missouri

While I've visited St. Louis a handful of times, I've never stayed right downtown, so I'm excited about the prospect of spending a few nights at the Hotel Saint Louis, Autograph Collection. Housed in the historic Union Trust Building, designed by legendary architect Louis Sullivan, the hotel is a masterpiece of early skyscraper architecture. It captures the soul of St. Louis by blending 19th-century grandeur—apparent in the lobby’s arched stained-glass ceiling—with modern boutique luxury.

I'm particularly eager to test the FORM Skybar's skill with old-fashioneds. Located atop the hotel, the lounge offers some of the best views of downtown St. Louis. Not a bad backdrop for an evening cocktail, if you ask me. The guest rooms are upscale, featuring modern amenities such as smart mirrors and premium bedding. It's perfect for travelers who want a property with a full-service spa, a distinct personality, and a sprinkle of history.

5. Courtyard by Marriott Downtown/Lake Union: Seattle, Washington

Because I have friends in the area, I'm a frequent traveler to the Seattle area. Because it's a metropolitan area with such a variety of sights and activities, I haven't booked a hotel more than once. For my next trip, I've got my eye on the Courtyard by Marriott Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. Located right across from Lake Union, it's an ideal spot for being close to the action—the Space Needle and the Museum of Pop Culture are just a short walk away—but prefer a more scenic view. The hotel's vibe is nautical and relaxed, reflecting the neighborhood's maritime history. Personally, I'm looking forward to a front-row seat to one of the city's most dynamic areas.",https://admin.onlyinyourstate.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/zion-national-park-winter-blue-sky-feature.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-12-12 19:13:04.649921

Stock Regains Some Ground.,"RYAN DEFFENBAUGH, Investor's Business Daily",,,,,https://www.investors.com/news/technology/oracle-stock-openai-data-center-delay/,"The reported delays are due to labor and material shortages, according to the Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources.
Oracle responded Friday, saying all milestones for OpenAI remain on track on an agreed-upon timeline.
Oracle stock is down 3.5% at 191.74 in recent action on the stock market today.
Oracle Stock: 10% Sell-Off After Earnings Oracle sold off by 10% in Thursday trading in response to its fiscal Q2 report the night earlier.
""OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) now operates 147 live customer-facing regions with 64 more regions planned.","Oracle (ORCL) stock trimmed some of its losses Friday afternoon after the company said there have been ""no delays to any sites"" required for its contractual commitments to OpenAI. Shares fell sharply following a report earlier in the day that some of the data centers the tech giant is building for the ChatGPT creator are being pushed back to 2028 from 2027.

The reported delays are due to labor and material shortages, according to the Bloomberg report, which cited unnamed sources. Oracle responded Friday, saying all milestones for OpenAI remain on track on an agreed-upon timeline.

""We remain fully aligned with OpenAI and confident in our ability to execute against both our contractual commitments and future expansion plans,"" Oracle spokesman Michael Egbert said in an email.

Oracle reached a $300 billion deal in September to provide the cloud computing power needed for OpenAI to train and operate the AI models behind ChatGPT. That includes a massive data center in Abilene, Texas, which Oracle co-Chief Executive Clay Magouyrk said on an earnings call Wednesday is set to provide more than 96,000 processors from Nvidia (NVDA).

Oracle stock is down 3.5% at 191.74 in recent action on the stock market today. Shares fell by as much a 6.5% following the report, which published near 11 a.m. ET. Oracle's response came roughly two hours later.

Oracle Stock: 10% Sell-Off After Earnings

Oracle sold off by 10% in Thursday trading in response to its fiscal Q2 report the night earlier. Revenue missed estimates while Oracle raised its forecast for capital expenditures.

The results underscored what analysts described as a ""timing mismatch"" for Oracle. It has a huge backlog of AI-related cloud work, rising to more than $500 billion as of November. But it will need to rapidly scale up capital expenditures before it can realize that revenue. The stock's recent struggles highlight concerns about how fast that buildout will happen, as well as how profitable the contracts will ultimately be.

Magouyrk defended the company's ability to scale up and meet that demand on Wednesday.

""We have ambitious, achievable goals for capacity delivery worldwide,"" he said on a call with analysts. ""OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) now operates 147 live customer-facing regions with 64 more regions planned. In the last quarter, we handed over close to 400 megawatts of data center capacity to our customers.""

With Friday's slide, Oracle is trading at levels last seen in June. Shares soared in September to a record high of 345.72 in September, after the company first revealed its cloud backlog. But the stock is now down more than 45% from that level.

TORONTO, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edesa Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq:EDSA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing host-directed therapeutics for immuno-inflammatory diseases, today reported financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 and provided an update on its business.

During the year, the company initiated manufacturing activities for a Phase 2 study of Edesa’s dermatology drug candidate, EB06 (an anti-CXCL10 monoclonal antibody), in patients with moderate-to-severe nonsegmental vitiligo. Edesa anticipates that recruitment will begin by midyear 2026, subject to the completion of clinical-grade drug manufacturing and regulatory approvals. In its respiratory program, Edesa reported that a Phase 3 study of its monoclonal antibody, paridiprubart (EB05), met primary and secondary endpoints with statistical significance. Edesa is currently exploring development and commercialization partnerships for paridiprubart as well as expedited regulatory pathways that may be available in certain jurisdictions.

“Our strategy to advance a high-impact dermatology asset alongside a now-validated respiratory therapeutic is bearing fruit, and we believe Edesa is well positioned for our mission to deliver transformative therapies to patients with high unmet medical needs,” said Par Nijhawan, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Edesa. “With new momentum and data in hand, we are engaging with potential strategic and government partners to seek additional non-dilutive support and collaborative arrangements that advance our programs.”

Edesa's Chief Financial Officer Peter Weiler reported that financial results for the fiscal year reflected a ramp up in activities for the company’s vitiligo program as well as the completion and close-out of the Phase 3 clinical study of paridiprubart. “This year, we strengthened our balance sheet and extended our Canadian government funding agreement to support manufacturing and development for our respiratory program. Looking ahead, our priorities include executing the Phase 2 vitiligo study, advancing respiratory assets toward partnering and commercialization, expanding manufacturing capacity, and maintaining financial discipline,” he said.

Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2025

Total operating expenses increased by $0.9 million to $7.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2025 compared to $7.0 million for the prior year:

Research and development expenses increased by $0.8 million to $3.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2025 compared to $2.9 million for the prior year primarily due to increased expenses for manufacturing-related activities and other preparations for a planned Phase 2 clinical study of EB06 in vitiligo patients, as well as increased external research expenses related to the completion of a Phase 3 study of paridiprubart (EB05) and drug supply costs for an ongoing U.S. government study of paridiprubart, partially offset by lower spend on other development programs.

General and administrative expenses increased by $0.1 million to $4.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2025 compared to $4.1 million for the prior year primarily due to an increase in noncash share-based compensation, which was partially offset by a decrease in professional fees.

Total other income decreased by $0.1 million to $0.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2025 compared to $0.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in interest income, which was partially offset by an increase in reimbursement funding from the Canadian government's Strategic Innovation Fund.

For the year ended September 30, 2025, Edesa reported a net loss of $7.2 million, or $1.27 per common share, compared to a net loss of $6.2 million, or $1.93 per common share, for the year ended September 30, 2024.

Working Capital

At September 30, 2025, Edesa had cash and cash equivalents of $10.8 million and working capital of $10.4 million. Subsequent to the fiscal year end, the company received $3.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting sales agent commissions, from common shares sold under an at-the-market offering program.

Calendar

Edesa management plans to participate in one-on-one meetings during JP Morgan week, which begins on January 12, 2026, in San Francisco, California. Attendees interested in meeting with management can request meetings by contacting Edesa at investors@edesabiotech.com .

AUSTIN, Texas, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Astrotech Corporation (Nasdaq: ASTC) (the “Company” or “Astrotech”) today announced its support of the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) recent initiative to modernize aviation security screening and technology nationwide. On November 22, 2025, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced a $1 billion nationwide plan to upgrade Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) equipment and security screening. 1st Detect Corporation stands ready to deploy its TRACER 1000™ detection systems to support such initiatives.

The Company's TRACER 1000 detection systems, approved by both the TSA for air cargo screening and the European Civil Aviation Conference for aviation security applications, use mass spectrometry to deliver laboratory-grade trace detection in field-deployable systems. While TRACER 1000 is operational at airports internationally and cargo facilities across the United States, the technology has not yet been deployed at U.S. passenger screening checkpoints.

The DHS modernization initiative addresses an important need as airports manage record passenger volumes while facing increasingly sophisticated threats. Traditional screening technologies can have higher relative false alarm rates, which result in slower operations, increased costs, and more stress for travelers.

""American aviation security isn't just about detecting known threats, it's about building systems resilient enough for threats we haven't encountered yet,"" said Thomas B. Pickens III, Chairman and CEO of Astrotech Corporation and 1st Detect. ""Mass spectrometry set the standard, lab-grade precision in the field, detecting trace amounts that traditional screening often miscategorizes. As DHS modernizes this critical infrastructure, we believe we are ready to deliver technology that doesn't just meet today's standards but sets tomorrow's.""

Addressing the False Alarm Challenge

A key advantage of mass spectrometry-based detection is the reduction in false alarm rates compared to conventional screening technologies. False alarms create cascading operational problems, including extended checkpoint delays, wasted security personnel time, missed flights, and frustrated passengers. By providing more accurate molecular identification of threat substances, TRACER 1000 can help security teams focus resources on genuine threats rather than investigating harmless substances that trigger false positives.

Immediate Capacity to Scale

Unlike technologies that require years of development or manufacturing ramp-up, Astrotech believes that 1st Detect has the infrastructure and capacity to expand production immediately to meet anticipated demand from the DHS modernization program. The Company believes that its Austin, Texas, facility is positioned to support rapid deployment as airports and federal agencies implement upgraded screening infrastructure.

""We are offering tested, certified, and ready to deploy technology that is operational today in some of the world's busiest airports,"" Pickens added. ""We believe we have the capability to scale production to meet the timeline Secretary Noem has outlined.""

Supporting a National Security Priority

The DHS aviation security modernization plan represents a substantial investment in screening infrastructure. As the initiative moves from planning to implementation, 1st Detect and Astrotech intend to engage with federal agencies, airport authorities, and industry stakeholders to demonstrate how detection and analysis with its mass spectrometry technology can strengthen security posture while improving operational efficiency.

For airports and security professionals interested in learning more about TRACER 1000's capabilities and deployment timelines, 1st Detect is available for briefings, demonstrations, and technical consultations.

Thursday, the FDA greenlighted Uplizna (inebilizumab) to treat generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and anti-muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive.
Myasthenia gravis is a rare autoimmune disorder that hampers neuromuscular communication, which can in turn cause fluctuating muscle weakness, Amgen explained.
""By selectively targeting CD19-positive B cells, Uplizna offers a new approach to treatment that addresses a biological root cause of disease,” he continued.
At the study’s 26-week mark, treatment with Uplizna was associated with a 1.9-point difference on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale—a common measure of myasthenia gravis symptoms—versus placebo, Amgen noted in its release.","Amid a swell of regulatory successes in the myasthenia gravis arena this decade, Amgen is wading into the fray with a new indication for its monoclonal antibody Uplizna.

Thursday, the FDA greenlighted Uplizna (inebilizumab) to treat generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and anti-muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive. After two loading doses, Uplizna for gMG is administered just twice a year, Amgen noted in a Dec. 11 press release.

Myasthenia gravis is a rare autoimmune disorder that hampers neuromuscular communication, which can in turn cause fluctuating muscle weakness, Amgen explained. The condition—which is estimated to affect about 80,000 to 100,000 people in the U.S. by Amgen’s reckoning—is thought to be primarily driven by AChR and MuSK autoantibodies, which are produced by CD19+B cells, the company added.

Since late 2021, a bevy of targeted gMG therapies has crossed the regulatory finish line in the U.S. and beyond, beginning with argenx’s FcRn blocker Vyvgart (efgartigimod) four years ago and most recently culminating in April’s approval of Johnson & Johnson’s Imaavy (nipocalimab), prior to the Uplizna nod.

""This approval marks a significant advancement for people living with gMG,"" Jay Bradner, M.D., Amgen’s executive vice president of R&D, said in a statement.

""By selectively targeting CD19-positive B cells, Uplizna offers a new approach to treatment that addresses a biological root cause of disease,” he continued. “Uplizna is conveniently dosed twice a year and delivers durable efficacy, helping people manage debilitating symptoms that can compromise daily function – including trouble breathing, speaking and seeing.""

Uplizna’s efficacy in gMG is thought to lie in its “targeted and sustained” depletion of cells essential to the underlying disease process, which Amgen defined in its release as autoantibody-producing CD19+ B cells, including plasmablasts and some plasma cells.

The FDA gave Uplizna the thumbs-up after reviewing data from Amgen’s phase 3 Mint trial. At the study’s 26-week mark, treatment with Uplizna was associated with a 1.9-point difference on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale—a common measure of myasthenia gravis symptoms—versus placebo, Amgen noted in its release. Specifically, Uplizna led to a 4.2-point reduction on the scale versus a 2.2-point reduction in the trial’s control cohort.

The drug’s benefits persisted through an entire year in the trial among patients in the AChR-positive subgroup, Amgen pointed out.

The California pharma also touted a steroid taper baked into the study’s protocol, noting that by Week 26, 87.4% of patients on Uplizna and 84.6% of those on placebo had curbed their steroid dose to 5 mg or less per day.

The approval marks Uplizna’s second this year and third overall. Back in April, the antibody drug was cleared by the FDA to treat adults with immunoglobulin G4-related disease, building on the drug’s original 2020 green light to treat certain neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder patients.

Uplizna is entering the gMG market at a busy time. Aside from argenx’s Vyvgart and J&J’s Imaavy, UCB’s Rystiggo and Zilbrysq and AstraZeneca and Alexion’s Soliris and Ultomiris also carry recent approvals in the indication. Meanwhile, argenx scored a thumbs-up for a subcutaneous version of its drug, dubbed Vyvgart Hytrulo, back in 2023.

In terms of competitive advantages, Amgen appears to be leaning heavily on the potential convenience edge that Uplizna’s twice-a-year dosing could provide. The treatment schedules for the other targeted gMG therapies on the market tend to require maintenance dosing every few weeks, with the timing sometimes dependent on factors related to each patient.

Moreover, analysts at Citi Research noted on Thursday that Uplizna's CD-19 targeting mechanism, coupled with its efficacy across gMG subgroups, dosing convenience and steroid-sparing potential, could present ""unique differentiation"" in the crowded market.

Uplizna could be looking at a $1.7 billion sales opportunity in gMG by 2030, the Citi team added.

With the approval of Imaavy in April, meanwhile, J&J asserted that its label covered the “broadest population of people living with gMG,” banking those claims in large part on the fact that its drug is approved not only in adults but in people ages 12 and up.

Elsewhere, argenx recently scored an FDA nod for a prefilled syringe format of Vyvgart Hytrulo that can be administered at home. And the company is homing in on a potential approval in seronegative patients, which describes the minority of people with gMG who lack detectable AChR or MuSK antibodies in their blood, making the already rare autoimmune condition even trickier to diagnose.

The AI outfit's CEO, Sam Altman, has marked the anniversary with a retrospective blog post which concludes much as the company's original mission statement began, with a call to ""benefit all humanity."" Question is, how well has that ambition aged?

Specifically, Altman signs his latest blog post off with these comments:

""Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I’m really proud of the trajectory the team has us on. We are seeing tremendous benefits in what people are doing with the technology already today, and we know there is much more coming over the next couple of years.""

It may seem convenient, trite, and not a little facetious to use PC gaming as a prism through which to view OpenAI. But it's actually a pretty handy starting point, not least because this is such a massive, unwieldy topic. So, anything that breaks it down into manageable chunks is very useful.

Needless to say, OpenAI and its broader influence has been far from unambiguously beneficial for PC gamers. As things stand today, there are legitimate reasons to doubt whether it will be practical or affordable to buy a new gaming PC in the next few years, such is the catastrophic impact of the demand for computer memory by the AI industry in general and OpenAI in particular.

OpenAI itself is acutely culpable in that process thanks to its megadeals for memory with Samsung and SK Hynix. At this point, it's quite possible that the ludicrous net impact of the current AI trend is that consumers will have as much AI slop as they can eat, but they'll be accessing it on knackered old phones, laptops and PCs, because they won't be able to afford new ones.

That is but one small detail in what is a very broad picture. In other words, the AI boom is such an enormous, imponderable phenomenon, it's bound to have all kinds of wide-reaching and unpredictable outcomes. And we're nowhere near knowing what the net benefits and costs will be.

Putting aside concerns around consumer electronics pricing, there's the fact the entire stock market seems to be propped up by AI. And what about the gargantuan power footprint of AI? Or the water usage and impact on jobs? And that's before you even touch on the broader existential threat that some see AI posing.

In his blog post, Altman observes, ""when I look back at the photos from the early days, I am first struck by how young everyone looks. But then I’m struck by how unreasonably optimistic everyone looks, and how happy.""

Unreasonably optimistic given the current context? That I get. In the end, and from the perspective as a casual outside observer, it's hard to grasp how AI insiders get their head around all these issues. How do they press on, ""optimistically"", with a technology that poses so many risks, that comes with so many overwhelming ambiguities?

You could argue that pretty much all new technologies pose some risk and come with some downsides. But they're not usually this existential. And they don't often threaten to implode largely unrelated industries before any really substantial benefits have kicked in. If nothing else, it will be interesting to see if Altman is in a position to pen such an optimistic retrospective in another 10 years.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2nZrXYYcxNP9fJWgbWby7k-1280-80.png,N,,2025-12-12 19:14:06.987745

Share BACK IN 2021, NETFLIX PAID $469 million for the right to produce and own two sequels to Knives Out.","RIAN JOHNSON’S FIRST TWO Knives Out films are almost impossibly rooted in their own moments.

Benoit Blanc’s (Daniel Craig) initial outing is as 2019 a movie as exists, just a mishmash of clod-like conservatives and woo-woo progressive hypocrites and snide references to Hamilton, the ultimate symbol of Obama-era liberalism. The hero was a kindhearted immigrant whose mother was at risk of deportation; the villains, the epitome of white privilege. It was like a celluloid manifestation of “allyship.” But the overbearing ideological markers didn’t overwhelm the film because Johnson had crafted a clockwork-tight script, a deft combination of “whodunit” and “howcatchem” that kept audiences who thought they had it figured out guessing until the closing moments.

In 2022, Benoit Blanc returned in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. And like its predecessor, it too is a time capsule upon rewatch three years later: Shot in the midst of COVID and focused on a tech mogul and his moronic hangers-on (including, naturally, a manosphere podcaster and a sweatpants entrepreneur canceled for dropping ethnic slurs), the mystery at the heart of the picture was sloppier and the resolution less satisfying because it boiled down to Blanc yelling “You’re dumb” at the Elon Musk stand-in played by Edward Norton. This may have been emotionally satisfying for some, but intellectually it was fairly stultifying.

And now, three years later, Johnson and Craig are back with Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Suffused with Catholic ideas about guilt and penance, Wake Up Dead Man is an interesting counterpoint to the first two films. Yes, yes: the ideological signifiers are all still there. The worst characters are the most likely to code as rightwing doofuses; the kindest characters more likely to code as progressive. But for the first time in the series, Johnson offers up something like forgiveness—absolution, if you will—to those willing to ask for it.

Get all The Bulwark for free for 30 days

The film opens with a long flashback, Rev. Jud Duplenticy (Josh O’Connor) writing a letter to Blanc explaining precisely how he has come to be the primary suspect in the murder of Monsignor Jefferson Wicks (Josh Brolin). Very long story short: O’Connor’s an outsider to this parish and Wicks is much beloved—at least, by his core group of worshipers, which is shrinking by the day. Duplenticy has been sent to Wicks to help him rekindle faith in the broader community, but his open arms are no match for Wicks’s punchiness. And there are so many secrets being hidden by everyone involved that, naturally, everyone’s a suspect.

I shan’t go into the mystery at the heart of the film or discuss the way it is unraveled, save to say that it is a.) tighter than the previous entry in the series and b.) set up to pay off with one of Blanc’s patented stemwinder explainers. But Blanc withholds his showy checkmate at the last moment, understanding, even as an atheist, that absolution can only come from confession and contrition. You can reveal the guilty but you cannot redeem them; that’s a choice they have to make for themselves.

Like the previous Knives Out films, this picture is a cavalcade of stars, with Oscar nominees like Glenn Close, Jeremy Renner, Jeffrey Wright, and Thomas Haden Church joining A-Listers like Mila Kunis and Kerry Washington along with relatively fresh faces like Andrew Scott and Cailee Spaeny. It’s just fun watching such top-of-the-line talent chew on Johnson’s occasionally hammy dialogue.

It’s also a remarkably good-looking movie. Cinematographer Steve Yedlin, who has worked with Johnson since his remarkable 2005 debut feature, Brick, has really outdone himself with this movie, playing with light and shadow, sunbeams through stained-glass windows, strobe lighting during a chaotic fight sequence, and more. There’s one moment where a character is backlit by a giant blood moon, and it’s framed and shot in such a way that despite knowing this has to be some sort of special-effects trickery, your mind can’t quite process what’s been done, what’s been monkeyed with. So you just accept the gothic grandeur of it. I didn’t love how Glass Onion looked—too much CGI architecture—but this movie calls to mind the initial outing’s effort to shoot the grand old house that serves as the primary set with a sort of intricate, elevated seediness, along with a return to some of the fun camera-play that Johnson has shed a little over the years.

Elevated seediness: that is the heart of these, or really any, murder mysteries, from Edgar to Agatha to Gillian. They are, all of them, tawdry affairs, murders resulting from greed, or lust, or maybe a little of both. But Johnson, for the first time, seems to have some sympathy for his devil, some empathy for their missteps. And that lends Wake Up Dead Man a tragic air that has been previously lacking in the series.

BACK IN 2021, NETFLIX PAID $469 million for the right to produce and own two sequels to Knives Out. Wake Up Dead Man is the second of them; it hits the service today after a perfunctory run in a couple of hundred theaters that most people in the country weren’t aware of because Netflix doesn’t really advertise these things. It will, like its predecessor, do boffo numbers for the streamer, the Christmas season being the perfect time to gather the family round the television and have everyone shut up for two blessed hours.

I mention this because Netflix is in the news for making another astronomical purchase: $82.7 billion or so for Warner Bros., its film library, its streaming service, and other sundry assets. (I discussed with Vulture’s Nicholas Quah just how many weird little things—like the Harry Potter portions of the Universal theme parks—Netflix will have its fingers in if the deal goes through on the podcast this week, I hope you give it a listen.) And I feel like some of the lessons from Knives Out are instructive here.

The best-case scenario for people who love movie theaters is the one laid out by the Entertainment Strategy Guy here, namely that Netflix will decide that picking up a studio with one of the best distribution arms in the world will give them an excuse to fundamentally alter their own streaming-first business strategy. The idea here being that there’s simply too much money in play to scrap theatrical releases—which have generated more than $1.85 billion in revenue for Warner Brothers alone this year—entirely. Netflix will have debt to pay down, this is money they can use to pay down that debt, et voila: Theaters are saved, at least for now.

Maybe! But I look at Knives Out and I wonder. Because that deal only makes sense through one lens: depriving rival studios and movie theaters a nearly guaranteed hit. You don’t pay $235 million for the right to produce a sequel to a movie that cost $40 million because you think it’s going to generate 8 million new subscribers. You do it to chop a leg out of the theatrical ecosystem. Just as Netflix has done by overpaying for awards season fare. Just as Netflix has done by overpaying action stars like Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds. Just as Netflix has done by overpaying for comedy names like Adam Sandler.

Taking Warner Bros. off the table doesn’t just chop a leg out from under theatrical: It cleaves the whole thing. Here’s hoping that someone at the FCC understands this well enough to force some sort of theatrical guarantees as a condition for letting this deal go through.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T6bz!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F774fb178-a145-4f21-95a3-7473b252c1a8_2160x1161.jpeg",N,,2025-12-12 19:13:26.517350

You don't have to look too long to recognize that the RC450 has two decently sized winglets at the front.
Now that KTM is coming out with what'll likely be the most powerful motorcycle in this category, is it going to take everyone else's lunch money?","KTM's upcoming RC450 specs have been leaked due to Chinese type-approval documents filed by the joint-venture operation that is KTM and CFMoto. Thank god for homologation documents. The long-awaited update to the Austrian brand's entry-level sportsbike is heavily based on the CFMoto 450SR-S, except it's, well, better or at least sportier.

Powering the little orange rocket is the same 270-degree 449cc parallel twin engine that debuted in the CFMoto 450SR. But, unlike the 50 HP that this unit puts out in the 450 SR-S, it'll produce an extra 5 HP in the RC450, bringing the grand total to 55 HP and, interestingly, making it non-A2 compliant in Europe without restricting the power. Either way, it's going to beat the US version of the niche-topping Ninja 500, which produces 51 HP.

Cradling the parallel twin is a trellis-style frame that also features on CFMoto's 450 SR-S, but whereas the 450 SR-S tips the scales with a dry weight of 171kg, KTM has ensured that RC450 has been made on a calorie restriction and weighs just 168kg dry. The bottom line is that the KTM has more power and less weight than the CFMoto that donated so much of its DNA to put this bike into production so quickly.

One place the RC450 differs from the 450 SR-S is its 1,360mm wheelbase, which is 10mm shorter than the CFMoto's. So the KTM should give it a racier riding position. The type approval document also revealed that the RC450 will be fitted with Bosch 10.3MB ABS, but we don't know what other rider aids await us.

The RC450 steps up the sportiness in other areas, too, with its WP suspension, WP steering damper, and clip-ons that appear to be mounted below the top yoke in a racier position than the 450 SR-S. Again, exaggerating the fact that this is made to attack tracks are revised pegs and foot controls that are mounted quite high on the RC450, and a quickshifter load sensor. Then there's its style, or rather lack of.

You don't have to look too long to recognize that the RC450 has two decently sized winglets at the front. For a bike that tops out at around 120 mph, on a good day, I can't imagine how often the downforce from these winglets will come into play and whether they're worth the trade-off in style points. Speaking of style, I'll leave it up to you to decide whether you like the front blinkers and mirrors, which have been taken directly off the 450 SR.

The RC390 was hugely competitive in this market thanks to a racy chassis, but couldn't keep up as other manufacturers developed more powerful engines before the Kawasaki Ninja 500 essentially became the de facto motorcycle in this niche—Aprilia's RS 457 is raising eyebrows, however. Now that KTM is coming out with what'll likely be the most powerful motorcycle in this category, is it going to take everyone else's lunch money?",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/G3YRWV/s1/leaked-ktm-rc450.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 20:07:11.373158

The contentious allegations were made against the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) by a staff association representing crew members at the major regional carrier SkyWest, which provides services to the likes of Alaska Airlines, Delta, and United Airlines.

In October 2023, the AFA sued SkyWest over accusations of serious labor law violations over its funding of the SkyWest Inflight Association, or SIA for short. In response, SIA filed a slew of serious counterclaims against the AFA.

How Did The Dispute Start In The First Place?

Representing more than 50,000 flight attendants, the Association of Flight Attendants is by far the largest crew member union in the United States. For years, it has tried but failed to become the official union of around 4,600 flight attendants at the Utah-based regional carrier SkyWest.

Since 2019, SkyWest has funded an independent staff association for its crew members known as the SkyWest Inflight Association (SIA).

SIA is the only body allowed to negotiate with SkyWest management over various issues like pay, conditions, and internal policies, although the AFA has questioned SIA’s true independence or ability to negotiate on behalf of SkyWest flight attendants.

A dispute between the AFA, SIA, and SkyWest came to a head in 2023 when the airline sacked two veteran crew members after they exposed what they claimed were serious security flaws with an internal election held by SIA.

AFA Accused Of Computer Fraud Conspiracy

In April 2023, one of the flight attendants who was later terminated discovered that SIA’s supposed secure website could be easily manipulated by changing the URL. This then allowed access to confidential information like crew member names, their ID numbers, and voting credentials for SIA elections.

The crew member shared this information with a coworker and an AFA representative. But rather than also immediately reporting the vulnerability to SIA, the trio allegedly sat on this information, according to SIA.

More than that, SIA claims the three hatched a plan to quietly access the vulnerability each month, and AFA’s agent allegedly instructed one of the crew members to “quietly download” information from the SIA secure website each month, the association claimed.

This continued until August 2023, when the SIA held internal elections. After votes had already been cast, another crew member produced a video explaining the vulnerability, which ultimately led to the ballot being abandoned.

Judge Permits Computer Fraud Conspiracy Counterclaim To Proceed

After the AFA sued SkyWest for terminating the crew members who had exposed the security vulnerability, SIA made a slew of counterclaims against the AFA, including violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

In total, the SIA made eight counterclaims:

Violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

Claims under the Stored Communications Act

Utah Computer Abuse and Data Recovery Act

Breach of Contract against one of the crew members

Conversion (civil theft of property)

Trespass to Chattels

Civil Conspiracy

Tortious Interference with Contract

The AFA then moved to have six of these counterclaims dismissed. Earlier this week, District Judge David Barlow made his ruling.

Judge Barlow ruled that many of SIA’s counterclaims should be dismissed, including a standalone civil conspiracy claim.

The judge did, however, allow part of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act counterclaim to proceed – notably that of conspiracy.

Lawsuit Began In October 2023 When Skywest Was Accused Of ‘Extraordinary Violations’ of Labor Law

The AFA filed its suit against SkyWest in October 2023 over what it described as “extraordinary violations” of labor law. The lawsuit almost immediately followed SkyWest’s decision to terminate the two flight attendants who exposed the security vulnerability in SIA’s secure website.

The ongoing lawsuit alleges that Skywest violated the Railway Labor Act in several areas, including funding SIA and terminating Price and Grange without a mechanism for arbitration.

Department of Labor Is Also Suing SkyWest’s Flight Attendant Association

Last August, the Department of Labor filed a seperate lawsuit against SIA over the way it ran its local elections in 2023.

The lawsuit alleged that a former executive officer of SIA and potentially several other members of the association cast ballots for at least 300 members – something that came to light when members went to vote only to find that their ballots had already been cast.

When SIA carried out a rerun of the election, it disqualified two nominees because they had allegedly shown disloyalty to the association over their support for the AFA.

Bottom Line

Although very narrow in its scope, a district judge has ruled that a counterclaim can continue against an AFA agent for alleged computer fraud conspiracy in connection with a secure website used by the SkyWest staff association.",https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/shutterstock_1663665115-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 18:14:21.343959

“Nearly 135 years after hundreds of lives were lost in the Wounded Knee Massacre, the time is now here to properly memorialize the lost and preserve the land,” said Johnson.
“It is now poised to become an Act of Congress: an important Act that will preserve the memory of the Wounded Knee Massacre and the legacy and sacrifice of our ancestors.
Significantly, it also promotes tribal self-determination and allows us to protect our Wounded Knee site in perpetuity.
Wounded Knee Massacre Background: In the late 1880s, a movement called the Ghost Dance swept across the nation.","Washington, D.C. – Today, the Wounded Knee Sacred Site and Memorial Act, introduced by U.S. Representative Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent. The bill now heads to the president’s desk.

“Nearly 135 years after hundreds of lives were lost in the Wounded Knee Massacre, the time is now here to properly memorialize the lost and preserve the land,” said Johnson. “I look forward to seeing the president sign this into law to ensure the land remains sacred for generations to come.”

“We thank the Senators Thune and Rounds and Congressman Dusty Johnson for their leadership and support in helping us protect our sacred site through the passage of the Wounded Knee Massacre Memorial and Sacred Site Act,” said Ryman LeBeau, Chairman, Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. “The U.S. Cavalry shot at and murdered more than 350 unarmed Lakota babies, girls, boys, women, men, and elders at Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The U.S. Cavalry stopped our people out on the high plains as they were seeking peace, surrounded them with guns and cannons, disarmed them, opened fire, and murdered them. Today, we stand to acknowledge the atrocities committed against the Lakota people to continue to heal, to protect, to educate, and most importantly, to ensure that we never forget the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890.”

“On behalf of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, I am pleased that today the Senate passed the Wounded Knee Massacre site bill, a bill that passed the House earlier this year,” said Frank Star Comes Out, President, Oglala Sioux Tribe. “It is now poised to become an Act of Congress: an important Act that will preserve the memory of the Wounded Knee Massacre and the legacy and sacrifice of our ancestors. Significantly, it also promotes tribal self-determination and allows us to protect our Wounded Knee site in perpetuity. We thank Representative Dusty Johnson as well as Senator Rounds and Majority Leader Thune for getting this bill through both chambers of Congress. It is fitting that this action comes as we prepare to commemorate the 135th anniversary of the Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29th.”

After months of working in coordination with the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Johnson introduced the legislation last Congress, which passed the House unanimously but was not voted on by the U.S. Senate. Johnson reintroduced the bill in January 2025 and it passed the House later that month.

The identical Senate companion bill is led by U.S. Senators Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and John Thune (R-S.D.).

Wounded Knee Massacre Background:

In the late 1880s, a movement called the Ghost Dance swept across the nation. Indians believed that this dance would give stolen land back to the Indians, bringing about a renewal of Native society. Indians would join together, wearing shirts they believed would protect them from bullets, to dance for this renewal, all at the protest of the federal government.

On December 29, 1890, a group of Lakota Indians led by Chief Spotted Elk had made camp near Wounded Knee Creek on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. There, U.S. Army 7th Calvary troops were sent to disarm the Lakota. A struggle occurred between the U.S. Army and some of Chief Spotted Elk’s band – a majority of which consisted of women and children. A shot rang out, and the U.S. Army opened fire on the largely unarmed group, massacring an estimated up to 350-375 Lakota Indians. Twenty-five U.S. soldiers also died.",https://dustyjohnson.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/dustyjohnson.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/2.png,N,,2025-12-12 18:14:51.106042

""These tests are not dynamic pricing—prices never change in real-time, including in response to supply and demand,"" an Instacart spokesperson told Investopedia.
""And with AI making surveillance pricing easier and faster, it’s only going to get worse.""
California, Colorado and Pennsylvania are also considering legislation that goes beyond New York’s notification requirement, banning surveillance pricing outright for certain retailers.","The U.S. government may have minted the last penny last month, but Instacart's algorithms are still fighting for every last cent.

While shoppers have grown accustomed to prices ending in .99—a psychological trick as old as the cash register—Instacart (CART) users like me see something different: $4.17 for eggs, $17.37 for Nature Valley bars, $11.43 for basil pesto. The company's pricing shifts seemingly every time you log in, with price changes down to the penny.

A major investigation published this week suggests just how far Instacart's pricing precision has been taken. Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that Instacart has been running AI-powered pricing experiments on millions of shoppers, charging customers different prices for identical items at the same stores, sometimes as much as 23% extra.

I reviewed a year's worth of my own Costco Wholesale (COST) orders through Instacart and found the same pattern—double-digit price swings on items I buy regularly, with no obvious explanation. (More on that below)

What the Investigation Found

CR and Groundwork Collaborative recruited 437 volunteers across four cities to shop on Instacart for identical items at the same stores simultaneously. Three-quarters of the products had different prices for each user. The average shopping basket varied by about 7%—a difference that CR estimated could cost a family about $1,200 a year.

The retailers affected included Costco, Kroger (KR), Target (TGT), Safeway, Albertsons (ACI) and Sprouts (SFM).

The practice, known as surveillance pricing, appears to go back to Instacart's 2022 acquisition of Eversight, an AI pricing company. In the company's 2023 shareholder letter, Instacart described one of its tools, ""smart rounding,"" as ""a machine learning-driven tool that helps retailers improve price perception and drive incremental sales.""

With surveillance pricing, algorithms set individualized prices based on your customer data, often without your knowledge. Unlike a price tag or a coupon, it's invisible—two people can see different prices for the same item simultaneously and not know it.

It's also tricky for outside analysts to prove it's being used, but the CR investigators caught a lucky break. Costco accidentally forwarded an internal Instacart email confirming that ""smart rounding"" experiments were underway between the companies. After its investigation was published, Instacart said it had stopped running pricing experiments at both Costco and Target.

But Instacart has stopped short of saying it was using algorithms based on specific individuals. ""These tests are not dynamic pricing—prices never change in real-time, including in response to supply and demand,"" an Instacart spokesperson told Investopedia. ""The tests are never based on personal or behavioral characteristics—they are completely randomized.""

But a disclosure Instacart shows its New York customers tells a different story. Under the state's Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act, which took effect Nov. 10, the company must tell its users if it engages in the practice. As such, its app notifies New York users that ""certain prices and/or fees may vary based on randomized tests,"" ""we use personal information (such as delivery address) to calculate fees, and ""this price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.""

What I Found in My Own Orders

My family orders from Costco through Instacart almost every other week, so I pulled a year of receipts to see whether the same kinds of price swings showed up in my own history.

They did: The price I paid for Kirkland thick-sliced bacon ranged from $14.75 to $17.59, a 19% jump for the same product. Kerrygold butter swung even more, from $11.58 to $17.58, a 52% difference. Even a pantry staple like Kirkland basil pesto moved between $10.37 and $11.43.

Not everything shifted. Bananas stayed anchored at $1.63–$1.64 all year; Costco's famed $4.99 rotisserie chicken rang up as $5.46 throughout the year on Instacart with its extra fee. But the items with the biggest swings were the same as those CR flagged: branded staples and higher-margin products such as eggs, olive oil and blueberries.

Price changes over time are normal—after all, grocery prices rose about 2.7% over the past year. But the CR investigation worked by having volunteers shop simultaneously, exposing how people were getting different prices for the same goods as the same time. Like other customers, I can't replicate that just with my own receipts and reviewing prices over time at my local store, which makes it almost impossible to separate ordinary price changes from algorithmic testing.

And that’s the point: Instacart is marketed as a convenience. Few people have the time or the data-wrangling skills to untangle whether a price hike is a seasonal shift or part of an AI-driven experiment running quietly in the background.

How Instacart Explains Its Pricing

You have to dig for the scant details Instacart provides on the prices it adds to your bill beyond its service fee for each delivery and your annual membership costs for both Costco and Instacart. At the top of each retailer’s Instacart page, there’s a small link called “Pricing & Fees.” Clicking through pulls up a brief disclosure: retailers may charge more on Instacart, and a flat percentage markup is added to cover Instacart’s service.

What the policy doesn’t say is how big that markup is or who sets it. When journalists have asked where the prices come from when you buy items from Costco through Instacart, the companies have pointed the finger at each other. Instacart has said, ""each of our retail partners sets the prices."" Costco has said the opposite: ""Pricing above and beyond our walk-in warehouse price is set by Instacart.""

Instacart’s own terms of service add another wrinkle, noting that the company may vary fees based on demand, order attributes or other factors—language that reads very differently after the investigation into its algorithmic pricing experiments.

What's Next for Surveillance Pricing

Lawmakers are taking notice. This week, Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) introduced the ""One Fair Price Act,"" which would ban companies from charging customers different prices based on their personal data.

“Experimenting with people’s hard-earned money to see just how much you can get them to pay for food for their family isn’t fair pricing,"" Jane Garza, Gallego’s spokesperson, told Investopedia. ""And with AI making surveillance pricing easier and faster, it’s only going to get worse.""

California, Colorado and Pennsylvania are also considering legislation that goes beyond New York’s notification requirement, banning surveillance pricing outright for certain retailers. For now, shoppers in the other 49 states are left to read the fine print—and wonder what it's not telling them.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/fr0jlE_ipgHstGaWNn9bvh0_MVo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-2004544232-82aae96027b248c59cc1fa827af1e7a7.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:12:33.499137

According to people familiar with the project who requested anonymity, the postponement is mainly due to labor and material shortages. Oracle has been working to fulfill a $300 billion contract to provide computing power for training and running OpenAI’s models since signing the agreement this summer.

Shares pared losses to 4% by 2 pm after Oracle issued a statement addressing the report. ""There have been no delays to any sites required to meet our contractual commitments, and all milestones remain on track,"" a company spokesperson said, adding that ""site selection and delivery timelines were established in close coordination with OpenAI.""

Despite the reported delays, the timeline for these U.S. projects remains ambitious as they are set to become some of the largest data centers globally.

The decline extends Oracle’s recent downward trend, coming just a day after its shares closed sharply lower following softer-than-expected quarterly results.

The broader market also struggled on Friday, with the S&P 500 falling 1.25% and the Nasdaq dropping 2%. latest results added to growing concerns about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, compounding worries already sparked by Oracle’s disappointing performance.

Consequently, the former owners of K stock may be thinking of looking to buy Kraft Heinz (KHC), which is the closest publicly traded alternative to Kellanova.

About KHC Stock

Kraft Heinz, as its name indicates, owns and markets the Kraft and Heinz brands. It also has many other consumer packaged food brands, such as Oscar Mayer, Jell-O, and Philadelphia Cream Cheese. The company has a market capitalization of $28.7 billion.

In the third quarter, KHC's sales dropped slightly to $6.237 billion from $6.383 billion during the same period a year earlier. However, its operating cash flow did increase to $3.09 billion from $2.8 billion.

In September, the company announced that it would split itself “into two scaled, focused companies.” One firm will include the Heinz, Philadelphia, and Kraft Mac & Cheese brands, “with approximately 75% of (its) net sales coming from sauces, spreads and seasonings.” The other spun-off company will feature the Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles, and Lunchables brands. In 2024, the two firms generated EBITDA, excluding some items, of about $4 billion and roughly $2.3 billion, respectively.

According to KHC, the move will allow the two spun-off entities to be more focused and efficient.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B) owned 27.5% of KHC as of September. Also in September, CNBC reported that KHC had lost over two-thirds of its value since the merger that formed Kraft Heinz in 2015, which Berkshire helped engineer, was finalized.

The Threats Facing KHC Stock

In an interview with CNBC in September, Buffett would not dismiss the possibility of Berkshire selling part of its stake or its entire stake in the firm. Obviously, if Berkshire sells a sizeable amount of its shares, KHC stock is likely to sink meaningfully.

The most attractive aspect of KHC stock is its high dividend yield, which is currently about 6.5%. But in the press release announcing the split, KHC did not 100% commit to maintaining the yield. “In aggregate, the current dividend level is expected to be maintained,” the firm stated.

CNBC noted that “health-conscious consumers” bought fewer of KHC's products, which tend to feature unhealthy items like processed cheeses, processed meats, and sizeable amounts of sugar, in the years following the merger. With 85% of consumers reportedly worrying about the healthiness of the food and beverage items that they buy, according to recent research, that issue may have intensified since the merger and certainly hasn't faded at all. Further, the year-over-year (YoY) decline of the firm's revenue in Q3 indicates that this issue may still be negatively impacting its growth.

And in a related development, KHC, at the urging of the U.S. government, announced in June that it would remove ""Food, Drug & Cosmetic (FD&C) colors"" from all of its products “before the end of 2027.” Although KHC stated that almost 90% of its products “by net sales” in America no longer have FD&C colors, it's possible that this change will have a material, negative impact on the company's financial results.

No Major Positive Catalysts

It's true that in recent years, some spun-off stocks, such as GE Vernova (GEV) and Solventum (SOLV), have performed extremely well. But the spun-off stocks that delivered great results for investors tended to have had extremely powerful positive catalysts.

Conversely, the only potential positive catalyst that I see for KHC is the increased focus and efficiency cited by the company following the merger. But that's not a very tangible catalyst, and even Buffett said he does not believe that the breakup will address the issues that KHC is facing. Others were also dubious about the efficacy of the transaction, with, for example, Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi stating that “More marketing support isn't some form of elixir.”",https://media.barchart.com/contributors-admin/common-images/images/S%26P%20500%20Companies/Consumer%20Defensive/Kraft%20Heinz%20Co%20boxes%20by-%20jentakespictures%20via%20iStock.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:12:43.530215

Holiday prices this year have soared, according to new analysis from Groundwork Collaborative, The Century Foundation, and AFT. Trump’s suggestion that kids would have to get by with fewer toys under the tree this year appears to be the sad reality for working families across the country. Americans know who the Scrooge is: nearly three in four voters hold President Trump responsible for rising costs this holiday season, leading to a sharp drop in consumer confidence in November.

To make matters worse, corporations are extorting shoppers while they look to trim the tree and prepare their holiday meals. Groundwork Collaborative, Consumer Reports, and More Perfect Union released a bombshell report this week detailing the AI-powered pricing schemes Instacart runs on shoppers to drive up prices and maximize profit. Shoppers across the country have been unknowingly enrolled in price experiments that can charge as much as 23% more for identical grocery items from one cart to another. This Instacart tax could cost households as much as $1,200 per year. Does Santa know his cookies and milk come with a side of pricing shenanigans?

Groundwork’s Chief of Policy and Advocacy, Alex Jacquez, shared his frosty reaction:

“This holiday season, American families are having to tighten their belts thanks to Trump’s senseless tariffs and economic upheaval. While we should be wrapping gifts, we’re instead grappling with higher bills at the grocery store and busted budgets in the toy aisle. Meanwhile, corporations like Instacart are running pricing experiments on shoppers buying supplies for holiday hosting and Christmas dinners. Bah humbug indeed.”

This week in the Trump Slump, new polling, investigative reports, and economic indicators continue to show that President Trump’s actions are deeply unpopular, hurting the economy, and harming America’s workers.

Polling and Economic Indicators on Trump’s Handling of the Economy:

Holiday shoppers are in for a jingle bell shock as prices continue to rise. Prices for popular holiday gifts increased an average of 26% compared to last year, — nearly nine times the rate of inflation, according to a new analysis by Groundwork Collaborative, The Century Foundation, and AFT. For some go-to gifts, the increases are even higher: kids’ tea sets are up 55%, speakers are up 63%, and watches and earrings are up as much as 50%.

The strain of higher prices is falling unevenly, as lower-income families expect to trim their holiday budget by more than $100 this year, while higher-income families plan to spend about $100 more.

New polling from Groundwork Collaborative and Data for Progress finds that nearly 60% of voters hold President Trump responsible for rising prices this holiday season — including 44% who say they blame the president a lot.

AI-driven pricing tools are pushing up grocery prices for Americans. A new blockbuster investigation from Groundwork Collaborative, Consumer Reports, and More Perfect Union reveals that many U.S. shoppers who order grocery pickup and delivery through Instacart are unknowingly enrolled in AI-enabled price experiments that can charge them up to 23% more than other shoppers for the same item ordered from the same store at the same time. This could result in some households being charged as much as $1,200 extra each year at the same time consumers are facing the most severe grocery affordability crisis in a generation.

Rising costs force small businesses to increase prices. Inflation was ranked the second most important problem in operating a small business, after labor quality, according to November’s NFIB report. Over one-third of small businesses owners reported rising prices in November, up 13 points from October, representing the largest monthly jump in the survey’s history and the highest reading since March 2023, well above the monthly average of 13%.

Additionally, expectations for better business conditions have fallen by 32 points since President Trump took office, as his economic mismanagement has eroded optimism among small business owners.

The labor market is looking frightful. The hiring rate fell to 3.2% in the latest JOLTS report, approaching the lowest level since the pandemic. Layoffs rose to 1.2%, and the quit rate fell to 1.8%, the lowest level since May 2020, as workers have little confidence they will be able to find a job if they leave their current one.

Wages and benefits rose 3.5% over the year in September, marking its slowest increase in four years, just slightly above inflation, as workers deal with a worsening affordability crisis.

Applications for unemployment benefits rose last week by the most since the pandemic to 236,000 claims. While initial claims often fluctuate, Thursday’s figures are still on the higher side relative to other 2025 readings.

The Federal Reserve cut rates, as it struggles to address both the sluggish job market and rising inflation. The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50% to 3.75% this week. In his press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the labor market is likely worse than official data shows, and the job report may be overestimating job creation by up to 60,000 jobs a month.

Homeownership has become a luxury that most Americans can no longer afford. Over 75% of U.S. homes on the market are unaffordable to the typical household and in most of the nation’s largest metros, buying a typical home now requires at least a six-figure income. On average, families would need roughly $33,000 more per year to afford a median-priced house.

Trump’s handling of the economy continues to hit new lows. Just 31% of U.S. adults now approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, according to a new AP-NORC poll — down from 40% in March and the lowest economic approval rating he’s received in any AP-NORC survey during either of his terms

Additionally, the same survey found that only 3 in 10 U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling health care.

Americans are increasingly priced out of the basic necessities. Roughly half of Americans (48%) have dipped into their savings just to cover routine expenses in the past year, according to a new survey from The Century Foundation.

The percentage of Americans believing health care costs are rising has increased by 10 points this year to 72%.

By a 21-point margin, Americans blame Trump and Republicans in Congress more than Democrats for rising prices.

About 30% of Americans postponed or avoided medical care because of cost. Nearly two-thirds cut back on groceries or opted for cheaper options, with over 34% saying they skipped a meal in the past year. Additionally, 82% of Americans expect the cost of living to rise over the next two years, including 70% of Trump voters.

A recent poll by Navigator found similar results: most Americans (51%) say they are unable to save as much money as they’d like, nearly half have stopped spending on things like eating out and going to the movies, and 47% have cut back on gift purchases due to higher prices.

As part of the recent three-year extension of ‘Big Apple Connect’, the city’s corporate partners, Optimum and Spectrum, made a $1.2 million investment toward the creation of this Hub and digital literacy programming through the Neighborhood Tech Help program across the city’s three main library branches. NYCHA residents can register for an account on the Digital Learning Resource Hub here.

“New York City is more connected than ever thanks to the actions the Adams administration took over the past four years to meet the immediate needs of underconnected communities,” said CTO Fraser. “This Digital Learning Resource Hub demonstrates our lasting commitment to expand upon the landmark success of Big Apple Connect to ensure public housing residents can get the most out of their free internet access. Thanks to our corporate partners, Optimum and Spectrum, for their commitment to building a more connected, equitable city for New Yorkers.”

Under the Adams administration, the city’s efforts to bridge the digital divide have centered on three key areas: access to internet, devices, and digital skills training. New York City provides free internet access to more residents than any other American city thanks in large part to Big Apple Connect, which supplies fast, free, and reliable internet access to 150,000 households across 220 NYCHA sites. This September, Mayor Adams and CTO Fraser celebrated the third anniversary of the landmark program by announcing a new three-year extension with Optimum and Spectrum that ensures subscribers receive uninterrupted internet services through June 2028. As part of the extension, Optimum and Spectrum committed to the creation of the Digital Learning Resource Hub to ensure residents can make the most of this internet access.

Starting today, the Hub is offering its first pre-recorded session, “Getting to Know Your Computer,” to users in English. The Hub’s free live trainings begin later this month with a “Getting to Know Your Computer” course offered in English (Tuesday, December 16) and Spanish (Thursday, December 18). Learners must register for an account on the website in order to sign up for a class. Instructional materials, including a recording of the class and associated learning documents, will be posted on the site so that learners can benefit even if they are unable to join a live class. Subsequent classes will be taught in additional languages – including Russian and traditional and simplified Chinese – to reflect the diversity of residents across NYCHA.

In addition to Big Apple Connect, the Adams administration has built a more connected and affordable New York City through an impressive array of digital equity initiatives. Mayor Adams and CTO Fraser announced in September that 350,000 New York City Public School students would receive Chromebooks with high speed internet access during the 2025-2026 school year to power their success inside the classroom and at home. This summer, the Adams administration expanded internet access to residents of Section 8 through ‘Liberty Link’ – a three-year pilot led by the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and the New York Public Library (NYPL) that provides high-quality internet at little or no cost to nearly 2,200 households across 35 affordable buildings in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan. HPD and the city’s three library systems also partnered to launch Neighborhood Tech Help, an in-person program that deploys “digital navigators” who serve as trusted guides to provide communities with one-on-one technical support to navigate a wide range of online services. In March 2025, the city published the “NYC Digital Equity Roadmap” to advance digital equity for underserved communities and invested $2.4 million toward refurbishing older adult centers with updated technology, the expansion of the NYPL TechConnect program, and the purchase of an additional NYCHA van that will provide services throughout public housing sites. OTI also funds and administers NYC Connected Communities which underwrites more than 100 public computer centers – including libraries, parks, and older adult centers – with critical access to internet, devices, software, mobile hotspots, and more than 24,000 hours of high-quality digital literacy programs.

“We thank OTI for providing NYCHA residents with these critical resources and promoting digital equity,” said NYCHA Chief Operating Officer Eva Trimble. “We encourage residents to register for a free account on the Digital Learning Resources Hub to gain access to classes and trainings on a variety of topics including computer basics, online security, and emerging technologies.”

“As New York City’s partner in the 'Big Apple Connect' initiative, we deliver essential digital resources and connectivity to thousands of NYCHA residents,” said Camille Joseph-Goldman, group vice president of government affairs, Spectrum. “Through programs like the BAC Learning Hub, they will now also have opportunities to develop the skills needed to thrive in today's digital landscape.”",,N,,2025-12-12 19:13:48.550315

Uses and applications of biomethane

As it has a composition and energy power very similar to those of fossil natural gas, biomethane can be used for the same purposes:

Alternative to natural gas: It can be injected into the gas network to replace natural gas (it is mixed with this in any proportion) and distribute it for both residential and industrial consumption. This makes it possible to make the most of existing infrastructure.

Generate electricity and heat: Its combustion also serves to generate electricity and heat. In this case, biogas is usually directly used without the need to purify it to biomethane.

Power vehicles: In fact, the use of biomethane as an advanced renewable biofuel enables an improvement in air quality as it emits less greenhouse gases, in a way that it becomes a great ally in the energy transition as a renewable fuel. The use of compressed natural gas or CNG is on the rise among, for example, urban bus fleets.

Raw material: As a raw material, for example, for the production of renewable hydrogen.

Create employment: The production of biomethane leads to further development of rural areas and increases the creation of jobs related to the agricultural and livestock sectors. Moreover, its self-consumption helps to reduce carbon emissions in the agro-livestock sector, contributing to its environmental balance.

Boost the circular economy: As it allows efficient management and harnessing of organic waste, since the digestates obtained are returned to the field as fertilizers.

Waste use: Lastly, the using waste to produce local energy contributes to the energy dependency reduction plan in Europe

The production of hydrogen from biomethane

Renewable or green hydrogen (i.e., free of emissions) is today considered a key player in the decarbonization of certain sectors that are very difficult to electrify, such as heavy industry or long-distance transportation, so it’s crucial to find ways to produce it with the lowest possible impact.

In this regard, Repsol has announced the production of renewable hydrogen with biomethane as a raw material. This feat has taken place at the Repsol plant in Cartagena, where 10 tonnes of renewable hydrogen has been produced from 500 MWh of biomethane. It’s a truly remarkable first step in replacing the conventional natural gas needed to produce hydrogen at the existing facilities for biomethane from a renewable source.

The production of renewable hydrogen by this method is another example of Repsol’s effort to transform its industrial complexes into multi-energy hubs capable of generating decarbonized products. It’s part of its circular economy strategy that, since 2018, is committed to using waste as a raw material for its products. As a leader in the production and consumption of hydrogen in Spain, Repsol dedicates a large part of its efforts to promoting large-scale industrial projects such as the Basque Hydrogen Corridor, the Hydrogen Valley of Catalonia, the Hydrogen cluster in Castilla-La Mancha, and the Renewable Hydrogen Hub in Cartagena, while it promotes several technologies to achieve its renewable hydrogen production objectives.

We can meet REPowerEU biomethane production target

Today, 3 bcm of biomethane and 15 bcm of biogas are produced in the EU-27. Our estimation shows that up to 41 bcm of biomethane could be available to meet the REPowerEU 2030 target of 35 bcm. [13]

Towards 2030, more than 90% of biomethane will be produced via anaerobic digestion of waste and residual biomass from agriculture, the food industry and municipal waste. [14] Beyond 2030, other technologies such as thermal gasification will help to further increase the potential, to achieve over 1,000 TWh per year by 2050, which would be a substantial share of the future gas mix. [15] , [16]

Significant increase of potential from 2030 to 2050

At a European level, there is significant potential to scale up the production of sustainable biomethane in the coming decades. If the supporting action and policy are deployed, biomethane production potential can increase from 41 bcm in 2030 to 151 bcm in 2050. [17]

Even more biomethane potential can be unlocked by looking at additional feedstocks (e.g. biomass from marginal or contaminated land and seaweed, as noted in the REPowerEU plan [18] ), and technologies (e.g. hydrothermal gasification of wet feedstocks, including organic wastes and residues). Renewable methane (or power to methane), produced from renewable electricity and biogenic CO2 captured in biogas upgrading can furthermore contribute additional potential, as can landfill gas.

Government Initiatives for the Biomethane Industry:

Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) Initiative: This scheme invites entrepreneurs to set up CBG production plants and assures them a long-term offtake agreement and procurement price for the CBG produced by public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs).

GOBARdhan (Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan) Scheme: This initiative aims to manage cattle dung and organic waste in rural areas by converting them into biogas/CBG and compost, providing financial assistance for establishing plants.

National Bioenergy Programme: The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) provides central financial assistance (CFA) as a capital subsidy to project developers for setting up biomethane/biogas generation plants from urban, industrial, and agricultural waste.

CBG Blending Obligation (CBO): The government has introduced a phased mandatory blending of CBG into Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Piped Natural Gas (PNG) networks, starting from 1% in FY 2025-26 and increasing to 5% by 2028-29, to create a sustained demand for biomethane.

What is Going on Around the Global Biomethane Industry?

In April 2024, France-based AirLiquide announced the expansion of its production capacity of biomethane in the U.S. with the construction of two new plants in Pennsylvania and Michigan. These plants will cater to the industrial and transport sectors in the region.

In December 2025, a Dutch developer secured a substantial loan from the EBRD to build a biomethane plant in Latvia, aiming to boost renewable gas production and strengthen supply infrastructure in the region. A €17.4m senior loan from the EBRD was secured by the Dutch family-owned holding company HoSt.

In October 2025, Uniper and Five Bioenergy signed a multi-year contract for biomethane from Spanish plants. Uniper has backed a shift toward low-carbon gas supply for the energy and transport sectors.

“I always look forward to the Winter Antiques Show, which I attended with my mother for many years,” Caroline Kennedy tells ELLE Decor.
She is also the founder of the International Poetry Exchange Program and the Honorary President of the John F. Kennedy Library.
“We are proud to honor Caroline Kennedy for her remarkable leadership and lifelong commitment to education, diplomacy, and the arts,” reads a statement from The Winter Show.
In response to being named the honoree, Kennedy says, ""It is an honor to be recognized by The Winter Show and East Side House at this year’s Opening Night Preview.","It likely doesn’t come as a surprise to learn that former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, long a patron of the arts, spent many years attending The Winter Show, the longest-running U.S. fair devoted to fine art, antiques, and design. She even brought along her daughter, Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, where she, too, developed a love for the show and the cause it supports.

Proceeds from The Winter Show have always benefited East Side House Settlement, a community-based organization that provides education, support, and workforce training to families in the Bronx and northern Manhattan. Founded in 1891, the organization serves more than 10,000 families annually.

“I always look forward to the Winter Antiques Show, which I attended with my mother for many years,” Caroline Kennedy tells ELLE Decor. “It is a New York tradition that brings history to life, joins together the design community, and helps those who need it most.”

In a full circle moment, years after she first attended the show with her mother, Kennedy is The Winter Show’s Opening Night Honoree for this January’s 72nd anniversary of the fair. Aside from being the United States’ Ambassador to Japan and later Australia, Kennedy was the Vice-Chair of the Fund for Public Schools, where she worked to improve New York’s public school system and expand arts education. She is also the founder of the International Poetry Exchange Program and the Honorary President of the John F. Kennedy Library.

“We are proud to honor Caroline Kennedy for her remarkable leadership and lifelong commitment to education, diplomacy, and the arts,” reads a statement from The Winter Show.

In response to being named the honoree, Kennedy says, ""It is an honor to be recognized by The Winter Show and East Side House at this year’s Opening Night Preview. Now more than ever, we need to support individuals and families in need.”

She continues, “As a lifelong New Yorker, I am proud to stand alongside East Side House in its commitment to providing empowering educational resources and critical social services to the city's most vulnerable communities.”

Kennedy is not this year’s only honoree. Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia, co-creative directors of clothing brand MONSE and formerly of Oscar de la Renta, are the honorees for the show’s Young Collectors Night, held on January 29. At this year’s Jewelry Luncheon, held on January 25, the organization will honor fashion and jewelry designer Ulla Johnson.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ce3172f4-e099-4ad8-9338-157a2aa56fa5.jpeg?crop=0.522xw:0.401xh;0.444xw,0.0837xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-12-12 15:19:26.426985

A new analysis by Realtor.com zeroed in on metros with the highest rate of home sales over the past year. Instead of New York or California, as was especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, cities in Texas featured prominently.

But Kansas City, Missouri took the cake.

Kansas City witnessed a rash of sell-offs between September 2024 and August 2025, according to the analysis.

The relatively high turnover of 45 sales per 1,000 housing units is partly to do with the the Midwestern metro’s affordable home prices and correspondingly high demand. The median list price hovers around $380,000, according to Realtor.com.

Harsh winter weather in Kansas City, as well as third-ranked Indianapolis, Indiana, may have contributed to the heightened sales activity as well, as aging Baby Boomer populations sought sunnier skies for retirement.

It’s hard to beat Indianapolis’ median list price of $320,000, but an October report from Axios identified a striking uptick in local residents’ wanderlust. Roughly 65% of local web searches for new homes looked outside of the city, up from 47% of searches in 2019.

Even balmy Texas saw a bump in home sales.

San Antonio, Kansas City and Indianapolis roughly tied this year, with turnover rates of approximately 45 sales per 1,000 homes.

Four of the top 10 metros with the most offloaded homes were concentrated in the Lone Star State. This doesn’t mean residents are moseying on out, however.

Texas turned into a real estate powerhouse during the pandemic, attracting residents from across the country in search of wide open spaces, blue skies, cheap taxes — and freedom from the COVID restrictions that gripped states like New York. Instead of suffering under tight supply, Texas went big on building.

A new-construction push in metros like Dallas, Austin and Houston promoted a flurry of real estate activity. Economic research analyst Hannah Jones told Realtor.com that increased supply helped temper rising housing prices and left buyers spoiled for choice, hence the frequent home sales.

San Antonio, in particular, enjoys a comfortably low media list price of just $329,000.

Local experts told Realtor.com that empty nesters were the main culprit behind sell offs in fourth-place Las Vegas, Nevada. Homes in Sin City changed hands at a rate of 43 sales per 1,000 units.

Both Nashville, Tennessee and Charlotte, North Carolina put up strong numbers at 42 sales per 1,000 homes. Rather than high supply, however, brokers pointed to accelerating costs as the reason behind these metros’ housing hustle.

The cost of living has risen in both Nashville, with a median list price of $536,739, and Charlotte, with a median list price of $438,348. Brokers said rising costs prompted some homeowners to cut bait and run this year.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/river-walk-san-antonio-city-117217482.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-12 15:16:40.985225

The firm's rationale centers on the indispensable nature of real-time data for generative AI, suggesting Confluent could accelerate growth within IBM's software portfolio.
This update is expected to provide deeper insight into the integration plan for Confluent and the early progress toward justifying the $11 billion investment.","In a bold strategic move, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) has announced its intention to acquire Confluent for a substantial $11 billion. This transaction represents the company's most significant purchase in years and is positioned as a decisive play to secure a leading role in providing real-time data streaming for artificial intelligence applications. The market's initial analytical response has been positive, with Stifel raising its price target on IBM shares to $325.

IBM has agreed to pay $31 per share for Confluent, which equates to a premium exceeding 30% over Confluent's stock price prior to the deal's announcement. Pending the necessary regulatory approvals, the acquisition is slated for completion by mid-2026.

The core of IBM's strategy lies in Confluent's technology. The company operates a streaming data platform built on the open-source Apache Kafka framework, which is already employed by approximately 40% of Fortune 500 companies. IBM plans to integrate this capability directly into its watsonx AI and data platform. The objective is unambiguous: to enable AI systems to analyze and act upon live data streams, moving beyond reliance on outdated, batched information.

This approach delineates a different path from the massive investments in data center infrastructure pursued by hyperscalers like Google and Amazon. Under CEO Arvind Krishna, IBM is emphasizing intelligent software layers for hybrid cloud environments over raw computational power. The company has already reported $9.5 billion in AI-related revenue for the third quarter, predominantly driven by its consulting and software integration services.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Market Analysts Assess the Deal

Financial analysts have begun to weigh in on the proposed acquisition. Stifel has maintained its ""Buy"" rating on IBM stock while increasing its price target from $295 to $325. The firm's rationale centers on the indispensable nature of real-time data for generative AI, suggesting Confluent could accelerate growth within IBM's software portfolio.

Concurrently, IBM disclosed a separate partnership with educational publisher Pearson to develop AI-powered learning tools for higher education, underscoring its broader focus on AI applications.

From a financial perspective, IBM anticipates the transaction will be accretive to its operational EBITDA in the first full year following closure. While some analysts project a minor impact on free cash flow in 2026, the prevailing mid-term view characterizes the deal as neutral to positive.

Investors will be watching for further details when IBM releases its quarterly earnings on January 28, 2026. This update is expected to provide deeper insight into the integration plan for Confluent and the early progress toward justifying the $11 billion investment.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405656_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 15:17:45.275870

CEO Bob Iger said the move would let Disney take advantage of a fast-growing area of entertainment.

Iger said eventually the company wants users to create AI videos within Disney+ itself.

There's a key word in Iger's comment that signals why Disney might be particularly motivated to make this deal: engagement.

Time people spend on Disney's and other leading streaming services has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, while YouTube and social video have grown. Disney's share of US TV viewership for its streaming services — including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — has been stuck at around 4.8% this year, according to Nielsen. YouTube is the top streaming platform on TVs, with a nearly 13% share in October, and its lead has been widening.

Data from analytics firm Luminate showed that engagement with Disney+'s original content fell to a 3% share of US viewing time in the third quarter of 2025. That's down from 9% three years earlier, the largest decline among paid streamers.

Disney has been highly protective of its famous characters and favors keeping people on its own platforms. This stance has made it difficult for the company to capitalize on the rise of user-generated content. And it's losing its monopoly on its core constituency, kids, as they increasingly watch YouTube over Disney+.

Hollywood needs new strategies to keep people engaged

Traditional media companies are struggling to grow, so they're trying to figure out new ways to get people to engage with their content, whether it be games, live events, or fan content creation, media analyst Doug Shapiro, a senior advisor at BCG, recently told Business Insider.

""It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse,"" he said. ""I think they're all asking themselves, how can they have a deeper relationship with fans?""

Disney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite maker Epic Games last year and struck a deal with Webtoon to create a new digital platform for Disney's comics, including Marvel and Star Wars. Outside Disney, Netflix is opening Netflix Houses, mini theme parks in malls that let people enter the worlds of its popular shows. Amazon has backed Fable Studios, a startup that has an AI streaming platform that lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP.

John Attanasio, CEO of Toonstar, a tech-driven animation studio, said Disney's IP is so popular that the Sora videos could help drive more audience. He thought Disney could potentially charge for access to AI tools on Disney+ or use the Sora videos to discover franchise extensions.

""UGC, when it's so specific, the reach is limited,"" he said. ""But when you use known IP, that expands the potential audience.""

Disney fans and Hollywood insiders had mixed reactions to the OpenAI news.

Shae Noble, a Disney superfan in her late 30s, said she could see herself sending birthday messages or making fan videos of the characters interacting in interesting ways — especially if it were integrated into Disney+.

""I've already seen some of the negative impacts of AI and people pushing it too far to create harmful images,"" she added. ""So it's smart of them to be proactive about it.""

Some in Hollywood worried about the risks to professional creators.

For one thing, the deal puts the emphasis on existing IP rather than making new content, Toonstar's Attanasio said.

The Writers Guild of America came out swinging against the deal, and said it planned to meet with Disney to explore how much the pact would let user-generated videos use the work of its members.

Sam Tung, a storyboard artist and cochair of the Animation Guild's AI committee, wondered if OpenAI's guardrails would be strong enough to protect Disney's IP, recalling a widely publicized incident earlier this year when Fortnite users used AI to make the Darth Vader character swear. He also doubted the UGC would move the needle on engagement.

""I think what audiences want is high-quality stuff to watch with your family,"" Tung said.

The retail giant hopes to emphasize its technology innovation by trading on the Nasdaq exchange.

Walmart's stock has skyrocketed in value over the past five decades.

10 stocks we like better than Walmart ›

Are you looking for the Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) ticker on the New York Stock Exchange?

After more than half a century trading on the NYSE, you'll no longer find Walmart there. The retailing behemoth just moved its listing from the NYSE to the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange. Its first day of trading on the Nasdaq was Dec. 9.

Apparently, the company is attempting to position itself as a technology firm.

""Nasdaq's focus on technology and its support for companies driving digital transformation align perfectly with our strategic vision,"" Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart, said in a press release. ""This is an exciting next chapter as we continue building a frictionless future for our customers, members, associates, and shareholders.""

The company has experienced astounding growth over 50 years

Walmart first listed on the NYSE on Oct. 1, 1972, at $16.50 a share. Today, the shares trade at around $114. But the stock has split 12 times, most recently in 2024, so the price growth for this company is somewhat misleading.

If you had spent $16.50 to purchase one share of Walmart at its IPO, you'd now have 6,144 shares worth $586,076, not including dividend gains.

Today, Walmart has a market capitalization of more than $925 billion. It is the largest employer in the U.S. with 1.6 million employees nationwide.

And the stock remains a solid investment. It's up more than 28% this year.

Should you buy stock in Walmart right now?

Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

ST. PAUL, MN — U.S. Rep. Angie Craig is demanding answers from Instacart after citing an investigation that found the grocery delivery company charged different customers different prices for the same items.

In a Dec. 11 letter to Instacart CEO Chris Rogers, Craig pointed to a Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative investigation that found some grocery prices on Instacart differed by as much as 23 percent per item from one customer to another.

Craig said the findings raise serious concerns about the company’s use of artificial intelligence and consumer data to determine pricing, particularly at a time when many families are struggling with rising food costs.

The investigation found that Instacart customers were shown varying prices and discounts for identical items, sometimes making advertised savings appear larger or smaller depending on the customer.

In one example Craig cited, shoppers ordering from a Target store in St. Paul saw their grocery cart totals differ by more than $5 for the exact same items.

""Food is not a privilege; it’s a basic need,"" Craig wrote, arguing that Instacart’s services are especially important for families, people with disabilities, caregivers, and residents of rural areas or food deserts.

Craig also raised concerns about Instacart promoting its platform to customers who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, while the investigation found higher prices were sometimes charged to users flagged by the company’s algorithm as more likely to pay them.

The Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative investigation also cited an inadvertently sent internal Instacart email in which the company referred to one pricing tactic as ""smart rounding.""

Craig described the practice of charging different prices to different customers at the same store as unacceptable and potentially illegal, calling it part of a broader pattern of technology companies using personal data to increase profits on essential goods.

She is demanding that Instacart respond by Jan. 15. Craig requested a full list of pricing experiments conducted by the company, details on what consumer data was used to determine pricing, internal reviews of potential harm to vulnerable customers, and estimates of how many U.S. users were charged higher prices and how much they were overcharged.

In a comment to CNN on the recent study, Instacart said each retailer’s pricing policy is displayed on its app and website so customers can see the difference between online and in-store prices.

""Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners — ones that already apply markups — do the same online via Instacart,"" a spokesperson told the news station.",https://patch.com/img/cdn20/shutterstock/22887410/20251212/124938/styles/patch_image/public/shutterstock-160559990___12124302806.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 18:14:43.353737

An investigation from Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative revealed Tuesday that Instacart displayed different prices on the same household staples sold at well-known stores, including Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Target. The report said customers are ""unknowingly part of widespread AI-enabled experiments.""

""Corporate practices like these increase prices for American families. When prices are no longer transparent, shoppers can't comparison-shop. When prices are no longer predictable, shoppers can't properly budget,"" the organizations said in the report.

The report found that Instacart uses AI to gauge how ""price sensitive"" customers are, meaning how much grocery stores can charge for an item before the shopper decides to not purchase it. That's different from dynamic pricing, where prices instantly change depending on supply and demand.

""That motive was confirmed by an email exchange between Instacart and Costco that was accidentally sent to (Consumer Reports) by Costco after we contacted the company for comment on our findings,"" the report said. Costco didn't immediately respond to CNN's request comment.

This report comes as Americans are feeling the pinch of higher grocery costs, which are are climbing in part because of tariffs, the immigration crackdown and extreme weather affecting food supply.

Instacart was chosen because it's ""by far the dominant e-commerce"" grocery service, with more than 250 million orders in the first three quarters of 2025, the organizations said.

The study asked 437 participants to buy the exact same item on the service and also compare to in-store prices. The investigation found that ""every one of the volunteer shoppers who participated in our tests was subject to algorithmic price experiments.""

For example, a dozen eggs sold on Instacart at a single Safeway location in Washington, DC, retailed anywhere from $3.99 to $4.28, $4.59 and $4.79. In another test, pricing for a box of Safeway's private label Corn Flakes ranged 23% between the lowest and highest prices — from $2.99 to $3.69.

In total, shoppers dependent on Instacart could see ""a cost swing of about $1,200 per year"" because of the AI-powered technology the service uses, the report found.

Instacart said in a comment to CNN that each retailer's pricing policy is displayed on their storefront on the company's app or website so customers can see the difference between online and in-store prices. (Prices of products sold on these apps are often higher because of labor costs and other fees.)

""Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners — ones that already apply markups — do the same online via Instacart,"" a spokesperson said.

Instacart added that the ""limited, short-term, and randomized tests"" helps retailers decide which essential items to keep affordable for customers.",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3123/312307/31230700.jpg?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2025-12-12 14:12:02.520214

What you may have missed

Anthropologie lands at Walmart — kind of

Anthropologie is joining Starbucks and Chipotle as part of Walmart’s home office retail lineup. Adding local, regional and national stores and services to its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, is a way the company is emphasizing convenience and connection, the big box retailer said Wednesday. It marks Anthroplogie’s first location in Northwest Arkansas.

“Anthropologie’s planned arrival, along with the full mix of businesses coming to our new Home Office, reflects our commitment to delight our associates and the Bentonville community with new-to-market concepts,” Cindi Marsiglio, senior vice president of corporate real estate at Walmart, said in a statement. “By bringing in brands like Anthropologie, we’re creating vibrant spaces that create lively weeknight and weekend experiences lasting beyond the workday.”

Pet Supplies Plus and Wag N’ Wash become independent

Pet Supplies Plus and Wag N’ Wash announced Monday that they have split from parent company Franchise Group. The reorganization formally separates the brands as their own identity, according to a press release by the companies.

Pet Supplies Plus acquired Wag N’ Wash for an undisclosed sum in 2022.

Last year, Franchise Group, which then owned Pet Supplies Plus, The Vitamin Shoppe and Buddy’s Home Furnishing, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company exited bankruptcy seven months later, operating only Pet Supplies Plus and Buddy’s Home Furnishings.

The Q-tips brand debuted $35 six-foot swabs “Quge-tips,” per a Tuesday press release. However, the product listing (which says they’re sold out) notes they’re actually 5 foot 8 inches tall.

“Our customers use Q-tips swabs in many different ways throughout their days – from beauty routines to home repairs – and many have even asked for bigger, longer, more task-specific cotton swabs,” Q-tips Marketing Director Olga Alpeter said in statement. “Quge-tips is our lighthearted take on that feedback, celebrating creativity and reminding everyone that even a classic can still surprise you.”

What we’re thinking about

3.2%

That’s how much net sales fell at Designer Brands in Q3, according to a Tuesday press release. Comps also declined, by 2.4%, though CEO Doug Howe touted “positive momentum” that has kept up into Q4. Operating profit improved across the company’s portfolio, reaching $42.7 million, and net income also grew year over year. Howe said on a call with analysts that strong cash flow allowed the company to pay down $47 million in debt in the period.

“Our third quarter performance represents another meaningful step forward in our transformation, as we demonstrated continued sequential improvement across multiple financial and operating metrics,” Howe said in a statement.

What we’re watching

Consumers lean more on BNPL this season, which could spell trouble ahead

As holiday shopping winds down, consumers’ finances appear to be in decent shape, with little sign that they’re over-relying on credit cards or buy now pay later options, according to research released Tuesday by Bank of America Institute economists.

In November, spending via credit and debit cards rose 1.3% compared to last year, down from 2.4% in October, with the use of credit versus debit about the same. However, reliance on buy now, pay later ticked up.

At the moment, Bank of America economists believe this could be as much about convenience as about resorting to credit to pay for purchases.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/g9_6Hno2Ft2GYBFiZzt7SE_pXj5Y15ew5iJ9EEzYrLY/g:nowe:0:160/c:3199:1807/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMTg2Ni5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-12 13:20:38.986343

In reality, it’s more about limiting legitimate compounding.
Congressmen Rudy Yakym and André Carson of Indiana introduced what they call the “Safeguarding Americans from Fraudulent and Experimental (SAFE) Drugs Act of 2025.” It’s essentially an anti-compounding bill straight out of the drugmakers’ playbook — it even uses the same tired, unfounded arguments.
Essentially, it would prohibit non-hospital pharmacies from compounding more than 20 times in a month “any drug product that is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug product” without submitting a report to the FDA.
Still, the fact that such a bill was even introduced is a reminder that our work calling out pharma’s “misinformation” doesn’t end.","A couple of members of Congress from Eli Lilly’s home state of Indiana have introduced a bill they say is meant to protect patients, but it’s based on pharma’s talking points.

Congressmen Rudy Yakym and André Carson of Indiana introduced what they call the “Safeguarding Americans from Fraudulent and Experimental (SAFE) Drugs Act of 2025.” It’s essentially an anti-compounding bill straight out of the drugmakers’ playbook — it even uses the same tired, unfounded arguments. (Not a surprise, considering they quoted the executive director of the pharma puppet group Partnership for Safe Medicines in their press release.)

Essentially, it would prohibit non-hospital pharmacies from compounding more than 20 times in a month “any drug product that is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug product” without submitting a report to the FDA. (Here’s the full text — 6-page PDF.)

Another bit of wording implies that the congressmen don’t know how compounding works. The bill, you see, defines “essentially a copy” as ‘a compounded drug that doesn’t produce a significant difference for the patient from the commercially available drug product as determined by the prescriber.’ But if it didn’t produce a significant difference, the prescriber wouldn’t have prescribed it in the first place!

In short, aside from increasing some inspections of 503B outsourcing facilities, the entire bill seems to be full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing.

[W]hat we’re manufacturing now, or what we are producing in terms of energy in the United States, well, it’ s good for today.
“[T]alents come from so many places, and there are so many pathways to get to careers in manufacturing,” she told Luton.
“There are so many translatable skills from the military into manufacturing,” Wengel said.
A job that will reward you: Manufacturing still suffers from a perception problem, Timmons and Wengel said.","Manufacturing in the U.S. can again see explosive growth—if the right policies are put into place, NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons and Johnson & Johnson Executive Vice President and Chief Technical Operations & Risk Officer, NAM Board Chair and Manufacturing Institute board member Kathy Wengel said on a recent episode of the “Supply Chain Now” podcast.

What’s going on: “Every country that is successful, every economy that is successful is really grounded in a strong and thriving manufacturing base, and we’ve seen that throughout our history here in the United States, that manufacturing has really enabled us to grow our economy and create a better quality of life for all Americans,” Timmons told show host Scott W. Luton during a live interview at last month’s Schneider Electric–sponsored Innovation Summit North America 2025 in Las Vegas, when asked about the NAM’s comprehensive manufacturing strategy.

“With that foundation … what makes us more successful or what enables us to be competitive around the world?”

The key, Timmons said, is having the right policies in place. And that’s a comprehensive manufacturing strategy.

Why it matters: To set the sector up for optimal growth, the U.S. needs fair, commonsense tax and regulatory policy, permitting reform and a full talent pipeline, the manufacturing leaders said on the podcast.

“We need [pro-growth] tax policy [and] … regulatory policy,” Wengel said. “We need to have the energy we need, and we need that workforce.”

The U.S. must also enact a thorough revision of its permitting system, added Timmons. “[W]e’ve got to be able to more quickly and expeditiously unlock America’s energy leadership and dominance here in this country,” he said.

Energy dominance: Timmons gave a nod to the administration for its focus on energy dominance. “Until recently, we were always a net importer of energy supply […] We’ve seen an unleashing of our potential when it comes to accessing new technologies, enabling us to access a great supply of natural gas here in this country. We are also focusing on new innovations when it comes to renewables.”

Timmons underscored the pivotal role of nuclear energy in meeting America’s future power needs. “The thing that I think we really [have to] focus on most aggressively is our capacity to build out nuclear facilities, because nuclear is clearly going to be a way to provide that energy supply that we’re going to need,” Timmons said.

“Here at this conference, one of the things that Schneider is focusing on is the advent of artificial intelligence—AI—and energy demands that will be required in order to power that system. [W]hat we’re manufacturing now, or what we are producing in terms of energy in the United States, well, it’ s good for today. It’s not good enough for tomorrow. Permitting reform will help us unlock some of that.”

Timmons added that permitting reform is “not just for energy, but also for the very things that we make,” Timmons told Luton, adding that it takes 10 to 15 years to get permitting for a copper mine in the U.S.—despite copper’s criticality to fulfilling the nation’s demand for power.

A prime workforce source: Manufacturing has had a workforce dearth for years, and if current trends continue, the U.S. will be short nearly 2 million workers by 2033. That’s why it’s so important to look everywhere for team members, Wengel said.

“[T]alents come from so many places, and there are so many pathways to get to careers in manufacturing,” she told Luton. “What we do at the Manufacturing Institute is try to focus on certain pathways and help accelerate them.”

Those exiting the military, for example, can become excellent employees in manufacturing, she said, citing the MI’s Heroes MAKE America program and others. “There are so many translatable skills from the military into manufacturing,” Wengel said.

A job that will reward you: Manufacturing still suffers from a perception problem, Timmons and Wengel said. But the sector today offers hugely enjoyable, interesting and financially fulfilling careers.

“I don’t think most people understand how rewarding these jobs are. … I hear that … every time I’m on a shop floor,” said Timmons. “It really is rewarding financially as well. Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, just said how frustrated he is that he can’t get folks on the line for $120,000 a year. So these jobs can really pay enormously … but also in terms of really enjoying what you do every day.”

Groundwork Collaborative, Consumer Reports, and More Perfect Union released a new report this week claiming Instacart’s AI pricing tool offers consumers individualized prices even when simultaneously adding the same items from the same grocery stores to their carts.

The investigation utilized 437 shoppers across four cities at two Target and three Safeway stores. Of the grocery items added to cart, 74% had differing price points from shopper to shopper, with up to five different prices per item. A Washington, DC, Safeway, for example, offered a dozen Lucerne eggs for ​​$3.99, $4.28, $4.59, $4.69, and $4.79. The average differential between high and low prices was 13%, but ranged up to 23%—which was the case for products like Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter and Wheat Thins at a Seattle Safeway.

Shopping basket totals varied by about 7%, reaching as high as 8.4%, which the report estimated could amount to $1,200 more per year for shoppers, based on an average four-person household’s annual grocery spend.

Instacart said in a blog post Tuesday that 10 of its retail partners use its Eversight AI technology to conduct “short-term, randomized tests” to “understand category-level price sensitivity,” but claimed they don’t use “personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data.”

Retailers’ use of surveillance pricing made headlines in January, when the FTC released findings and issued a request for public comment, with then-chair Lina Khan stating retailers “frequently use” consumers’ personal data to charge individualized prices. Ferguson closed the request for public comment, set to run until April 17, just a week later.

In tandem with the report’s release, Senator Ruben Gallego this week introduced the One Fair Price Act, which would block companies from setting different prices for consumers based on personal data and require them to disclose price differences instituted for other reasons.

“I’m trying to level the playing field to make sure that you as a consumer are getting a fair price that is decided by true capitalism, and not the exploitative things that these corporations are trying to do,” Gallego said in a call with journalists this week, noting he believes the bill could have bipartisan support.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/9ee437db6137aac3ecb3308787c677b40621e218-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-12-12 14:12:06.007939

S&P Global Inc. (NYSE: SPGI) stock traded higher in Friday’s session, with shares hovering around $502 as of late morning in the U.S. (intraday), building on a solid prior close.

The move comes as investors digest a busy stretch of updates around S&P Global’s AI and cloud strategy, watch the broader market’s tone shift amid “AI bubble” jitters, and recalibrate expectations for 2026 credit conditions—a key demand driver for S&P Global’s ratings franchise. [1]

Below is a detailed roundup of the notable SPGI stock news, forecasts, and analysis themes circulating on December 12, 2025, plus what investors are watching next.

SPGI stock price today: what’s moving S&P Global shares on Dec. 12, 2025

S&P Global shares were recently up about 1% on the day, trading near $502.40 after opening around $498.56. The intraday range has been roughly $496.96 to $503.91 (so far), with volume still building as the session progresses.

Thursday’s close set the near-term baseline: SPGI finished at $497.56, up 1.27%, with trading volume reported around 2.6 million shares—notably above its recent average in at least one widely circulated market recap. [2]

The macro backdrop: AI nerves vs. rate-cut optimism

In the broader market, U.S. equities were choppy Friday as investors reacted to renewed concerns about whether parts of the AI rally are overheating—an angle highlighted in real-time coverage after a major chipmaker’s outlook raised fresh questions about AI investment profitability. [3]

This matters for SPGI because the company sits at a crossroads of:

Capital markets activity (ratings, issuance, refinancing)

Market levels and indexing ecosystem (index-linked revenues)

Data and workflow demand (subscription-style intelligence products)

In other words, SPGI often trades like a “quality compounder” in financial information services—affected by macro sentiment, but ultimately driven by issuance cycles and client workflow dependency.

The biggest SPGI catalyst in focus: S&P Global’s Google Cloud partnership (AI + data distribution)

One of the most discussed company-specific developments this week is S&P Global’s multi-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud, announced December 10, 2025. [4]

According to S&P Global, the partnership is designed to accelerate enterprise transformation across agentic innovation, data distribution, and workflow automation, with two major thrusts:

Unifying S&P Global proprietary data on BigQuery to make it more “AI-ready” and distributable through BigQuery Data Sharing. [5]

Expanding agentic offerings on Gemini Enterprise, including customer experiences that allow interaction with S&P Global proprietary datasets—building on work that includes a Kensho-developed “Data Retrieval Agent” aimed at bringing citation-backed data into Gemini Enterprise. [6]

Why this matters for SPGI stock

For investors, the near-term question isn’t whether “AI” is a buzzword—it’s whether this approach:

deepens client integration (higher switching costs),

expands distribution to where customers already build AI workflows,

supports premium pricing for trusted, permissioned datasets,

and improves internal productivity through agentic tools.

A notable analysis theme in coverage on Dec. 12 is that this kind of “plumbing” move could make S&P Global’s market and commodity intelligence more directly usable inside AI-driven decision processes, potentially strengthening customer stickiness over time. [7]

S&P Global’s parallel AI move: AWS integrations for AI agents and workflows

S&P Global’s Google Cloud announcement didn’t happen in isolation.

Earlier in December, S&P Global also announced new integrations with Amazon Web Services (AWS) intended to let customers use AI agents to ask complex market, financial, and energy questions and receive answers from S&P Global data “directly within their AWS environments.” [8]

The company said its trusted datasets are available via two Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integrations with Amazon Quick Suite, and highlighted delivery of datasets (including Capital IQ Financials and earnings call transcripts) through an MCP for the Kensho LLM-ready API. [9]

Investor takeaway

Together, the Google Cloud and AWS initiatives reinforce a strategic pattern: meet customers where their AI workflows live—not only inside S&P Global products, but inside major cloud ecosystems. [10]

Forecast driver: credit markets and bond issuance still matter most to SPGI’s Ratings engine

While AI partnerships are grabbing headlines, many analysts still treat debt issuance volumes, refinancing cycles, and M&A-related financing as the most direct swing factors for SPGI’s earnings momentum—particularly for the Ratings segment.

In late October, Reuters reported S&P Global raised its annual outlook on the back of strong bond issuance activity, lifting its forecast for:

revenue growth to 7–8%, and

adjusted EPS to $17.60–$17.85 (for the year),

while noting Ratings revenue strength and expectations that issuance trends could persist given debt maturities and M&A activity. [11]

2026 outlook: “resilient, if uneven”

Adding to the macro narrative, S&P Global Ratings released a Global Credit Outlook 2026 message in early December, describing credit conditions as likely to remain resilient (though uneven), citing:

active refinancing that pushed out maturities,

policy rates that have decreased or are still decreasing,

and healthy investor appetite—while also flagging AI investment “boom” risks and geopolitical uncertainty. [12]

That report also included forecasts such as 3.2% global economic expansion in 2026 and expectations that defaults remain contained (though above long-term averages), with a U.S. speculative-grade default rate forecast around 4% through September 2026 and Europe around 3.25% (as described in the release). [13]

Analyst forecasts for SPGI stock: price targets, ratings, and upside estimates

As of Dec. 12, one widely referenced consensus snapshot shows analysts skewing bullish on SPGI:

Consensus rating: Strong Buy

Buys vs. holds vs. sells: 22 Buy, 1 Hold, 0 Sell (as shown in a recent poll window) [14]

Average 12‑month price target:$608.90

Implied upside: roughly +21% from current levels (depending on the reference price) [15]

Target range shown: about $540 (low) to $675 (high) [16]

This same consensus page lists examples of recent firm targets and actions—such as targets in the mid‑$500s to mid‑$600s, with several “maintain” actions dated in October and November. [17]

What the target spread suggests

The roughly $540–$675 band captures a common bull/bear debate for SPGI:

Bull case: sustained issuance cycle + strong subscription retention + index-linked tailwinds + successful AI-enabled distribution partnerships. [18]

Bear case: issuance slows more than expected, pricing pressure increases, or AI changes the competitive landscape for data/analytics distribution faster than incumbents can monetize.

“Current news” theme on Dec. 12: Ratings activity continues at a high cadence

On Dec. 12 itself, S&P Global Ratings published numerous ratings actions and related releases across corporates, structured finance, and public finance—illustrating the day-to-day cadence of the Ratings franchise.

The Ratings press release feed for 12‑Dec‑2025 includes items such as:

Comcast Corp. ratings affirmed with stable outlook (with updated leverage commentary),

Cleveland-Cliffs downgraded (as titled in the release list),

Heineken outlook revised to positive (as titled in the release list),

among many others posted throughout the morning (EDT). [19]

These individual rating actions typically don’t move SPGI shares on their own, but the steady flow matters because it reflects ongoing credit market engagement and underwriting/refinancing activity—important ingredients for Ratings revenue.

Capital allocation and balance sheet: senior notes offering details remain relevant

Another corporate-finance item investors are still factoring in is S&P Global’s early-December debt issuance.

S&P Global announced it priced a private placement offering of:

$600 million of 4.250% senior notes due 2031, and

$400 million of 4.800% senior notes due 2035,

with proceeds intended for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions, debt repayment/refinancing, capex, working capital, and potential share repurchases. [20]

For equity holders, the key lens is whether this financing supports:

portfolio expansion (data/analytics tuck-ins),

funding of technology investments,

and/or sustained capital returns.

Dividend snapshot: what income investors should know (as of Dec. 12, 2025)

S&P Global’s board previously approved a quarterly dividend of $0.96 per share, payable December 10, 2025, with an annualized rate of $3.84 per share. [21]

For many investors, SPGI is primarily a growth/quality story rather than a high-yield dividend play, but dividend stability can still matter for long-term total return positioning.

Institutional positioning headlines: 13F-based moves hitting the wires today

A noticeable “newswire” pattern on Dec. 12 is a wave of summaries of institutional positions based on 13F filings. These reports are backward-looking (often reflecting Q2 positions), but they can influence sentiment around ownership trends.

Examples circulating today include:

AllianceBernstein L.P. reported increasing holdings by 41.1% in Q2 (per the summarized filing story). [22]

CIBC Asset Management Inc. reported lowering its position by 9.2% in Q2 (per the summarized filing story). [23]

Canada Pension Plan Investment Board reported trimming holdings by 2.2% in Q2 (per the summarized filing story). [24]

Again, these are not real-time buys/sells—but they do underscore that SPGI remains heavily institutionally owned and closely followed.

Strategic context: acquisitions and business reshaping still frame the 2026 narrative

Even though the hottest headlines today are AI and cloud partnerships, SPGI’s longer arc into 2026 includes major strategic moves from 2025:

Private markets expansion: S&P Global’s $1.8 billion agreement to acquire With Intelligence is expected to close by early 2026, aimed at strengthening S&P’s capabilities in alternative/private market data. [25]

Portfolio streamlining: Reuters has also covered S&P Global’s plan to separate its Mobility division into an independent public company as part of streamlining and focusing on core segments. [26]

These moves matter because SPGI’s valuation often reflects confidence that management can keep compounding a high-margin information services model while selectively reshaping the portfolio.

What to watch next for S&P Global stock (SPGI)

Here are the most practical catalysts and indicators investors are tracking as of Dec. 12, 2025:

1) Next earnings date (watch the calendar)

Multiple widely used market calendars point to an expected earnings window in February 2026, with one listing February 10, 2026 as the next report date. [27]

2) Bond issuance and refinancing momentum

S&P Global’s raised outlook in late October was explicitly linked to robust issuance and Ratings strength. If issuance cools materially, SPGI’s forward narrative could soften; if it remains strong, the Ratings engine can keep delivering upside. [28]

3) Monetization of “AI-ready” distribution

The Google Cloud and AWS announcements are strategic. The stock debate will increasingly focus on whether these integrations turn into:

higher retention,

measurable new product revenue,

and/or improved margins via productivity gains. [29]

4) Credit conditions into 2026

S&P Global Ratings’ own outlook frames 2026 as resilient but uneven, with AI investment both supporting growth and introducing risks of overinvestment. Markets will watch how that macro “music playing, noise rising” scenario translates into defaults, spreads, and financing activity. [30]

Bottom line for Dec. 12, 2025

On a day when U.S. markets are balancing rate-cut optimism against renewed AI-rally anxiety, S&P Global stock is drawing attention for a different reason than most AI headlines: it’s positioning its trusted data to be usable inside the next generation of agentic AI workflows, while still benefiting (financially) from a capital-markets cycle that has been supportive for its Ratings business. [31]

With the stock trading around $502 intraday and consensus price targets clustering near the low $600s, investors now face a classic SPGI question: how much of the “durable growth + cycle tailwind + AI distribution upside” story is already priced in, and what needs to happen in 2026 for SPGI to outperform from here?

The bottom line here is that Adobe stock looks undervalued, both from a FCF standpoint and also based on analysts' price targets.

One way to play this is to set a lower potential buy-in point by shorting out-of-the-money puts. That way, an investor can get paid while waiting to buy in at a lower strike price.

Shorting OTM ADBE Puts

For example, the Jan. 16, 2026, expiry period, a little over one month from now, shows that the $335.00 put option contract, 4.4% below Thursday's close, has a high premium of $6.25 per put contract.

That means that a cash-secured short-seller of this contract makes an immediate yield of 1.866% (i.e., $625/$33,500 invested).

This also sets a potentially lower buy-in breakeven point for the short-seller of these puts:

$335-$6.25 = $328.75, i.e., -6.19% below $350.43

This only happens if ADBE falls to $335.00 on or before Jan. 16, and the investor's brokerage account is then assigned to use the cash secured as collateral (i.e., $33,500) to buy 100 shares at $350.00.

Nevertheless, the 1.866% income yield, which is earned immediately, can be repeated each month (although there is no guarantee what the yield will be each month). That implies the expected return could be 5.60% over the next three months.

That shows that a patient investor, especially those who are long ADBE shares and also short OTM puts, can make a good expected return.

In addition, as I have shown in other articles, investors can buy longer-dated in-the-money (ITM call options using the income generated from shorting OTM puts.

IBM To Acquire Real-Time Data Leader Confluent In $11B Deal

IBM tops this week’s Came to Win list for its blockbuster deal to buy real-time data streaming platform developer Confluent for $11 billion.

IBM said that with Confluent’s technology it can provide an “end-to-end platform for businesses to connect, process and govern data for applications and AI agents.”

“IBM and Confluent together will enable enterprises to deploy generative and agentic AI better and faster by providing trusted communication and data flow between environments, applications and APIs. Data is spread across public and private clouds, datacenters and countless technology providers,” IBM Chairman, President and CEO Arvind Krishna, said in a statement. “With the acquisition of Confluent, IBM will provide the smart data platform for enterprise IT, purpose-built for AI.”

Confluent, founded in 2014 and based in Mountain View, Calif., develops a series of products used to collect, process and manage continuous flows of real-time data from multiple sources—data in motion, as Confluent refers to it—for operational applications, data analysis and, more recently, artificial intelligence applications and AI agents.

Confluent is just the latest of IBM’s acquisitions in the big data arena. In May IBM bought DataStax, a developer of database, data streaming and application development software, in a bid to expand the data management capabilities of its IBM Watsonx AI product portfolio.

Qualcomm Acquires RISC-V Chip Designer Ventana To Boost CPU Efforts

Staying on the topic of strategic acquisitions, Qualcomm makes this week’s list for its acquisition of Ventana Micro Systems, a startup focused on developing server CPU technology based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture.

Qualcomm said Ventana’s expertise in RISC-V, a free and open alternative to the Arm and x86 instruction set architectures, will enhance its CPU engineering capabilities and complement “existing efforts to develop custom Oryon CPU technology.”

Oryon is at the center of Qualcomm’s push to gain footholds in the PC and server markets—and grow in other areas—as part of ongoing efforts to diversify its business beyond mobile chipsets. The company gained the custom, Arm-compatible CPU core architecture through its $1.4 billion acquisition of startup Nuvia in 2021.

Qualcomm, which has already been using RISC-V for some products outside the PC and server markets, said Ventana’s contributions will boost its “technology leadership in the AI era across all businesses,” indicating the broad impact expected by this acquisition.

AMD’s New Embedded CPUs Go After Intel On Performance, Energy Use And Size

AMD made a big move in the embedded CPU space this week, looking to take on rival Intel with the debut of its new EPYC Embedded 2005 CPUs.

AMD said the new processors offer big advantages in performance, energy use, size and features compared with competing products from Intel. Set to enter production in the first quarter of next year, the Embedded 2005 series processors pack up to 35 percent faster base CPU frequency using half the power of Intel’s Xeon 6503P-B and coming in a form factor that is 2.4 times smaller, AMD said.

With AMD marketing the chips for AI networking, storage and industrial edge use cases that need to operate around the clock, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company said that the Embedded 2005 series provide a balance of compute, energy efficiency and I/O capabilities that Intel can’t offer with a single product.

AMD is also touting the new CPUs’ “enterprise-class” reliability, availability and serviceability features for things like hardware fault protection, firmware fault recovery and secure boot.

TCS Buys Salesforce Star Coastal Cloud For $700M To Create ‘Top Five Salesforce’ Firm

Returning to the topic of strategic acquisitions, IT services giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is acquiring Coastal Cloud, a top Salesforce consulting partner, for $700 million in a move to boost its AI business, U.S. customer base and Salesforce prowess.

The news of the all-cash deal comes just two months after the $30 billion, India-based TCS acquired ListEngage, a U.S.-based Salesforce partner.

TCS said buying Coastal Cloud will strengthen its Salesforce advisory and consulting business globally via Coastal Cloud’s 400 cloud professionals who have more than 3,000 multi-cloud certifications.

“Coastal Cloud’s multi-cloud capabilities strongly complement TCS’ existing Salesforce strength—and together with ListEngage’s expertise—we are poised to build a world-class Salesforce practice to deliver full-stack, custom solutions globally,” said Vikram Karakoti, TCS global head of enterprise solutions, in a statement.

With the acquisitions of ListEngage and Coastal Cloud, TCS said it will be “among [the] top five Salesforce advisory and consulting [firms] globally.” Karakoti said the two acquisitions significantly expand TCS’ “geographic presence, deepen our sector capabilities, and significantly strengthen our talent pool.”

And somewhere in the archives is a note promising what would become “our Star Wars anthem,” the show’s triumphant theme.
Until then, “Han’s Your Man” remains the greatest show tune nobody—not even George Lucas—ever got to hear.","Broadway has seen just about everything, ranging from roller-skating trains, singing phantoms, cats reciting T.S. Eliot, the big ape himself in the form of King Kong and even a musical Spider-Man, who nearly took out the front row when he wasn’t falling from the ceiling. But somewhere between Bye Bye Birdie and Wicked, there was almost Star Wars: The Musical, complete with a wise Yoda ballad, Darth Vader belting out a tune and a swaggering Han Solo showtune called “Han’s Your Man.” And despite what you may believe, this was not a parody and it certainly wasn’t fan fiction. No, this was what became the lost Star Wars Musical, commissioned by George Lucas himself.

Charles Strouse, the Tony-winning composer behind Annie, Applause and Bye Bye Birdie, recalled it plainly: “We started one. We were asked to do it by the original producer, George Lucas. First of all, we were given a 90-page contract with his company, and my lawyer discovered a phrase which gave Lucas the right to say, ‘I don’t want to go on,’ so we pulled out, but Lucas gave us extra money—I remember the sum, it was $10,000—to sign.” He and his longtime lyricist partner, Lee Adams, wrote about five songs, but Lucas did, indeed, “call the contract. He never heard the songs, as far as I know. He decided he was going to do the prequels instead.” Which was a key difference between this proposed musical and 1978’s Star Wars Holiday Special, which he okayed but ultimately distanced himself from.

‘Han’s Your Man’ and Yoda’s Broadway ‘Star Wars’ number

The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts houses the surviving script, dated March and June 1993. It’s 84 pages long (with a few missing), full of handwritten notes and it tells all three original Star Wars films as one story—without Ewoks, Lando Calrissian or even the eventual revelation that (spoiler alert) Luke and Leia are siblings. Much of the dialogue is lifted directly from the screen (“Do. Or do not. There is no try” and “Aren’t you a little short for a Stormtrooper?” among the examples), but the heart of the script is its handful of completed musical numbers.

Darth Vader opened the show with a full statement of power. Yoda fired back with a mantra-like response that insisted good would triumph over evil—a lyrical bit of Force-philosoph. Han Solo introduced himself with the previously-mentioned number “Han’s Your Man,” a swaggering declaration of roguish heroism, and another Solo tune was planned called “You Betcha, Kid.” Princess Leia’s solo, “My Star,” would later be repurposed by Strouse and Adams for their musical Marty.

Even the Jedi had an ensemble number: “For justice is all we seek… Let’s show how our sabers speak.” Jason Robert Brown—years before Parade, The Last Five Years or Songs for a New World—handled the arrangements and orchestrations. And somewhere in the archives is a note promising what would become “our Star Wars anthem,” the show’s triumphant theme.

The stage directions read like science-fiction spectacle: novas bursting over the audience, one hundred creatures on stage consisting of mannequins and actors mixed together and effects that would have made George Lucas and Andrew Lloyd Webber respectfully shake hands.

The contract strikes back: why Lucas pulled the plug

And then came the twist ending: the kind of sudden reversal Broadway usually saves for Act Two: Lucas pulled the plug. Strouse later noted that the filmmaker never listened to the songs as Lucas pivoted away from musicals and toward what would become the prequel trilogy, leaving Star Wars: The Musical frozen in carbonite after just a few completed numbers. Strouse and Adams stepped away permanently. The irony is notable in that the man who gave the world Jedi knights, Ewoks, Wookiees and one of the most operatic villains ever created never heard Vader’s big musical moment.

Where the script lives today—and how fans can read it

Today, the unfinished script sits in the New York Public Library archives, waiting for curious theater lovers and sci-fi fans to visit. Anyone researching the show can make an appointment to read the source material, including Strouse’s draft script, lyric pages and stage effects notes. As such, it stands as a time capsule of an alternate Broadway universe where lightsabers glittered under stage lights and Yoda’s philosophy was delivered in full-blown musical style.

And as the Star Wars universe continues to expand across theme parks, streaming series and reimaginings as Shakespearean plays, one question lingers: Is it time for someone brave enough to let the Force hit a high note? Until then, “Han’s Your Man” remains the greatest show tune nobody—not even George Lucas—ever got to hear.",https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2212207963.jpg?quality=86&strip=all,N,,2025-12-12 13:20:16.714645

INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced updated results from the Phase 3 EMBER-3 study of Inluriyo (imlunestrant), an oral estrogen receptor antagonist, in patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER2–) advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC), whose disease progressed on a prior aromatase inhibitor (AI), with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor. As monotherapy, imlunestrant demonstrated a clinically meaningful 38% reduction in the risk of progression or death (median PFS 5.5 vs 3.8 months; HR=0.62 [95% CI 0.47–0.82]; nominal p=0.0007) and demonstrated an 11.4-month improvement in median OS (34.5 vs 23.1 months; HR=0.60 [95% CI 0.43–0.86]; p=0.0043; boundary for significance not met) versus endocrine therapy, in patients with ESR1-mutated disease. In all patients, imlunestrant plus abemaciclib reduced the risk of progression or death by 41% versus imlunestrant alone, demonstrated a favorable OS trend and numerically delayed time to chemotherapy (TTC) by more than a year.

These results were published in Annals of Oncology and will be shared in a late-breaking oral presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) today, Friday, December 12, at 10:45 AM CT / 11:45 AM ET.

""Following the recent FDA approval of Inluriyo as monotherapy, these updated data demonstrate continued clinically meaningful benefit—both for patients receiving monotherapy and those receiving the combination with abemaciclib—and further reinforce its role in this treatment setting,"" said Jacob Van Naarden, executive vice president and president, Lilly Oncology. ""Given the important role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in treating ER+, HER2– metastatic breast cancer, we're encouraged by the potential of an all-oral combination with imlunestrant and abemaciclib and have submitted these combination data for U.S. regulatory review in ESR1-mutated MBC.""

Results for the imlunestrant plus abemaciclib combination were consistent with previous efficacy results and demonstrated durable benefit across efficacy endpoints, regardless of ESR1 mutation status. In all patients, median PFS was nearly doubled versus imlunestrant alone (10.9 vs 5.5 months; HR=0.59 [95% CI 0.47–0.74]; nominal p<0.0001), and a favorable OS trend was observed (HR=0.82 [95% CI 0.59–1.16]), with continued separation of survival curves. Median TTC was numerically extended by more than a year (27.8 vs 15.5 months) versus imlunestrant alone. In patients with ESR1-mutated disease, median PFS was extended to 11.0 months versus 5.6 months with imlunestrant alone (HR=0.55 [95% CI 0.41–0.74]; nominal p<0.001). Notably, most patients (65%) in the combination arm had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

""With an additional year of follow-up, these results strengthen the case for imlunestrant-based regimens in ER+, HER2– metastatic breast cancer,"" said Komal Jhaveri, MD, FACP, FASCO, Associate Attending Breast Medicine and Early Drug Development Services, section head of Endocrine Therapy Research Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and one of the study's principal investigators. ""The median progression-free survival of 11 months is among the longest we've seen in this population, and just as importantly, patients are living longer without needing chemotherapy.""

Safety across imlunestrant-based regimens was consistent with previous reports, and no new safety signals were observed with this additional follow-up. Follow-up for OS is ongoing, and additional analyses are planned as data mature.

Imlunestrant is also being investigated in the adjuvant setting in people with ER+, HER2– early breast cancer with an increased risk of recurrence. The Phase 3 EMBER-4 trial completed enrollment of approximately 8,000 patients following two to five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy in the context of the established CDK4/6i standard of care.

About EMBER-3

EMBER-3 is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study of imlunestrant, investigator's choice of endocrine therapy, and imlunestrant in combination with abemaciclib in patients with ER+, HER2– locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has recurred or progressed during or following an aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy with or without a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. The trial enrolled 874 adult patients, 32% of which enrolled from the adjuvant setting into first-line treatment of MBC and 64% as second-line treatment following progression on initial therapy for MBC. Enrolled trial participants were randomized between imlunestrant, investigator's choice of fulvestrant or exemestane, or plus abemaciclib. Randomization was stratified by prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use, the presence of visceral metastases and geographic region. Patients enrolled as first line (1L) treatment for ABC (32%), following disease recurrence on or within 12 months of completing adjuvant AI, with or without CDK4/6 inhibitor for early breast cancer (EBC), or as second line (2L) treatment for ABC (64%), following progression on AI, with or without CDK4/6 inhibitor as initial therapy for ABC. Primary endpoints were investigator-assessed PFS of imlunestrant versus SOC ET therapy in patients with ESR1 mutations, imlunestrant versus SOC ET in all patients, and Imlunestrant plus abemaciclib versus imlunestrant in all patients. More information on the EMBER-3 study can be found on clinicaltrials.gov.

About Inluriyo™ (imlunestrant)

Inluriyo (imlunestrant) is an oral estrogen receptor antagonist that delivers continuous ER inhibition, including in ESR1-mutant cancers. The estrogen receptor (ER) is the key therapeutic target for patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2–) breast cancer. Inluriyo is a U.S. FDA approved oral prescription medicine. Inluriyo is also currently being studied in combination with abemaciclib for advanced breast cancer and as an adjuvant treatment in early breast cancer, including: NCT04975308, NCT05514054 and NCT04188548.

INDICATION FOR INLURIYO (imlunestrant)

INLURIYO is indicated for the treatment of adults with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, estrogen receptor-1 (ESR1)-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following at least one line of endocrine therapy.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR INLURIYO

Warnings and Precautions — Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on ﬁndings in animals and its mechanism of action, Inluriyo can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproduction study, oral administration of imlunestrant to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis led to embryo-fetal mortality and structural abnormalities at maternal exposures that were below the human exposure at the recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC). Avoid the use of imlunestrant in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use eﬀective contraception during treatment with Inluriyo and for 1 week after the last dose.

Serious and Fatal Adverse Reactions

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 10% of patients who received Inluriyo. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients included pleural eﬀusion (1.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.8% of patients who received Inluriyo, including cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, right ventricular failure, hypovolemic shock, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (each 0.3%).

Most Common Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%), including laboratory abnormalities, in patients who received Inluriyo were: hemoglobin decreased (30%), musculoskeletal pain (30%), calcium decreased (26%), neutrophils decreased (26%), AST increased (25%), fatigue (23%), diarrhea (22%), ALT increased (21%), triglycerides increased (21%), nausea (17%), platelets decreased (16%), constipation (10%), cholesterol increased (10%), and abdominal pain (10%).

Drug Interactions

Imlunestrant is a CYP3A substrate. Avoid concomitant use of Inluriyo with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the dosage of Inluriyo. Avoid concomitant use of Inluriyo with strong CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, increase the dosage of Inluriyo.

Imlunestrant inhibits both P-gp and BCRP. Avoid concomitant use unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information for P-gp or BCRP substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.

Use in Speciﬁc Populations — Lactation

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise lactating women to not breastfeed during treatment with Inluriyo and for 1 week after the last dose.

Use in Speciﬁc Populations — Hepatic Impairment

Reduce the dose of Inluriyo for patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A).

INDICATIONS FOR VERZENIO

VERZENIO is a kinase inhibitor indicated:

in combination with endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, node-positive, early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence.

in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy for the treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy.

as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR VERZENIO (abemaciclib)

Severe diarrhea associated with dehydration and infection occurred in patients treated with Verzenio. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, diarrhea occurred in 81 to 90% of patients who received Verzenio. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 8 to 20% of patients receiving Verzenio. Most patients experienced diarrhea during the first month of Verzenio treatment. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event ranged from 6 to 8 days; and the median duration of Grade 2 and Grade 3 diarrhea ranged from 6 to 11 days and 5 to 8 days, respectively. Across trials, 19 to 26% of patients with diarrhea required a Verzenio dose interruption and 13 to 23% required a dose reduction.

Instruct patients to start antidiarrheal therapy, such as loperamide, at the first sign of loose stools, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow-up. For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue Verzenio until toxicity resolves to ≤Grade 1, and then resume Verzenio at the next lower dose.

Neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis, occurred in patients treated with Verzenio. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, neutropenia occurred in 37 to 46% of patients receiving Verzenio. A Grade ≥3 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) occurred in 19 to 32% of patients receiving Verzenio. Across trials, the median time to first episode of Grade ≥3 neutropenia ranged from 29 to 33 days, and the median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia ranged from 11 to 16 days. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in <1% of patients exposed to Verzenio across trials. Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH 2. Inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever to their healthcare provider.

Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.

Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with Verzenio and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. In Verzenio-treated patients in EBC (monarchE), 3% of patients experienced ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.4% were Grade 3 or 4 and there was one fatality (0.1%). In Verzenio-treated patients in MBC (MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), 3.3% of Verzenio-treated patients had ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.6% had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.4% had fatal outcomes. Additional cases of ILD or pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported.

Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis. Symptoms may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Dose interruption or dose reduction is recommended in patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 ILD or pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue Verzenio in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis.

Grade ≥ 3 increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (2 to 6%) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2 to 3%) were reported in patients receiving Verzenio. Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), the median time to onset of Grade ≥3 ALT increases ranged from 57 to 87 days and the median time to resolution to Grade <3 was 13 to 14 days. The median time to onset of Grade ≥3 AST increases ranged from 71 to 185 days and the median time to resolution to Grade <3 ranged from 11 to 15 days.

Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or any Grade 3 or 4 hepatic transaminase elevation.

Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) were reported in 2 to 5% of patients across three clinical trials in 3559 patients treated with Verzenio (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3). VTE included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pelvic venous thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. In clinical trials, deaths due to VTE have been reported in patients treated with Verzenio.

Verzenio has not been studied in patients with early breast cancer who had a history of VTE. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. Dose interruption is recommended for EBC patients with any grade VTE and for MBC patients with a Grade 3 or 4 VTE.

Verzenio can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Verzenio and for 3 weeks after the last dose. Based on findings in animals, Verzenio may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. There are no data on the presence of Verzenio in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during Verzenio treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.

The most common adverse reactions (all grades, ≥10%) observed in monarchE for Verzenio plus tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor vs tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, with a difference between arms of ≥2%, were diarrhea (84% vs 9%), infections (51% vs 39%), neutropenia (46% vs 6%), fatigue (41% vs 18%), leukopenia (38% vs 7%), nausea (30% vs 9%), anemia (24% vs 4%), headache (20% vs 15%), vomiting (18% vs 4.6%), stomatitis (14% vs 5%), lymphopenia (14% vs 3%), thrombocytopenia (13% vs 2%), decreased appetite (12% vs 2.4%), ALT increased (12% vs 6%), AST increased (12% vs 5%), dizziness (11% vs 7%), rash (11% vs 4.5%), and alopecia (11% vs 2.7 %).

Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors increased the exposure of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites to a clinically meaningful extent and may lead to increased toxicity. Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by up to 16-fold. In patients with recommended starting doses of 200 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily, reduce the Verzenio dose to 100 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors other than ketoconazole. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the Verzenio dose to 50 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors. If a patient taking Verzenio discontinues a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increase the Verzenio dose (after 3 to 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the inhibitor. With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the Verzenio dose in 50 mg decrements. Patients should avoid grapefruit products.

Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers and consider alternative agents. Coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers decreased the plasma concentrations of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites and may lead to reduced activity.

With severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), reduce the Verzenio dosing frequency to once daily. The pharmacokinetics of Verzenio in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min), end stage renal disease, or in patients on dialysis is unknown. No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic (Child-Pugh A or B) and/or renal impairment (CLcr ≥30-89 mL/min).

Chinese companies' strong demand for the H200 stems from the fact that it is easily the most powerful chip they can currently access.

As domestic chip companies have yet to produce products that match the H200, there have been concerns that allowing the H200 into China could stymie the industry.","Nvidia has told Chinese clients it is evaluating adding production capacity for its powerful H200 AI chips after orders exceeded its current output level, according to two sources briefed on the matter.

The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the U.S. government would allow Nvidia to export H200 processors, its second-fastest AI chips, to China and collect a 25% fee on such sales.

Demand for the chip from Chinese companies is so strong that Nvidia is leaning toward adding new capacity, one of the sources said. They declined to be named as the discussions are private.

Nvidia did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.

Major Chinese companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already reached out to Nvidia this week about purchasing the H200 and are keen to place large orders, Reuters reported on Wednesday.

However, uncertainties remain, as the Chinese government has yet to greenlight any purchase of the H200. Chinese officials convened emergency meetings on Wednesday to discuss the matter and will decide whether to allow it to be shipped into China, said one of the two sources and a third source.

Very limited quantities of H200 chips are currently in production, Reuters reported on Wednesday, as the U.S. AI chip leader is focused on producing its most advanced Blackwell and upcoming Rubin lines.

China promoting its own AI industry

Supply of H200 chips has been a major concern for Chinese clients and they have reached out to Nvidia seeking clarity on this, sources said.

As part of the briefing provided by Nvidia, the company has also given them guidance on current supply levels, said one of the first two people, without providing a specific number.

The H200 went into mass deployment last year and is the fastest AI chip in Nvidia's previous Hopper generation. The chip is manufactured by TSMC using the Taiwanese firm's 4nm manufacturing process technology.

TSMC and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Chinese companies' strong demand for the H200 stems from the fact that it is easily the most powerful chip they can currently access.

It is about six times more powerful than the H20, a downgraded chip from Nvidia tailored for the Chinese market that was released in late 2023.

Trump's decision on the H200 comes at a time when China is pushing to promote its own domestic AI chip industry. As domestic chip companies have yet to produce products that match the H200, there have been concerns that allowing the H200 into China could stymie the industry.

""Its (H200) compute performance is approximately 2-3 times that of the most advanced domestically produced accelerators,"" said Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital Partners.

""I'm already observing many CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprise customers aggressively placing large orders and lobbying the government to relax restrictions on a conditional basis,"" he said, adding Chinese AI demand exceeds the capacity of local production.

During the emergency meetings, there was a proposal to require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a certain ratio of domestic chips, one of the first two sources and a third source said.

For Nvidia, adding new capacity is also challenging at a time when it is not only transitioning to Rubin but also competing with companies, including Alphabet's Google, for limited advanced chipmaking capacity from TSMC.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108229164-17636513282025-11-05t081214z_2091479820_rc2nfgakvd7y_rtrmadp_0_china-chips.jpeg?v=1763651345&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-12-12 12:19:33.685070

Shifting Consumer Choice For years, health-conscious consumers have driven an increase in the market share of wellness-oriented food brands.","A 2025 CNN article highlights a potential health scourge that’s likely already lurking in your kitchen cabinets — and may have driven substantial gains in your long-term investment portfolio.

Associated with rising rates of global obesity, chronic health conditions, and premature death, ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) — a still loosely defined category that covers staples from bread, to soda, as well as cookies, chips, and more — have long faced scrutiny from critics at UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO). In a call for scientists worldwide to study the health effects of UPFs, the WHO referred to rising UPF consumption as “a systemic threat to public health.”

Ultraprocessed Foods, High Financial Stakes

CNN also claims popular UPF products paid out more than half of the $2.9 trillion distributions food and beverages corporations issued to shareholders between 1962 and 2021.

The CNN article goes on to suggest that the high profit margins associated with UPFs have funded lobbying against all kinds of consumer protections, from food warning labels to restrictions on advertising to children. Doing so may have helped the sector avoid regulations and served to counter the conclusions of critics like Carlos Augusto Monteiro, University of São Paulo’s professor emeritus of nutrition and public health, from gaining traction. He authored a 2017 research paper arguing that “the displacement of minimally processed foods and freshly prepared dishes and meals by ultra-processed products is associated with unhealthy dietary nutrient profiles and several diet-related non-communicable diseases.”

With scrutiny of UPFs broadening, but consumption rates and profit margins high, it’s anyone’s guess as to when or how regulations might reshape the market and impact the bottom line of producers and investors. However, it may not be any coincidence that UPF brands like Coca-Cola (-2.25%), Kraft (-8.4%), Nestle (-8.2%) and Post Holdings (-11.5%) have lost value over the past six months.

Prosecuting UPFs

The simmering conflict between nutritional scientists and UPF producers sets the stage for a monumental development that may bring things to a boil.

On Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, the city attorney for San Francisco filed the first government lawsuit against UPF producers. The city’s case claims that leading F&B companies like Kraft Heinz, Nestle, and Coca-Cola, among others, knowingly “took food and made it unrecognizable and harmful to the body,” thereby, “engineering a public health crisis,” and exposing consumers to chronic illnesses like Type 2 diabetes, cancer, and other forms of chronic illness.

The city’s case centers on the burden to San Francisco in covering the cost of treatment associated with residents suffering from diseases caused by the consumption of UPFs. In bringing the case to court, the city is seeking to regulate the marketing of UPFs and recover damages to offset certain healthcare costs. Legal analysts are drawing immediate comparisons to other high-profile public-health litigation, most notably those brought against tobacco and opioid producers. But, with UPFs so ubiquitous, some are asking if, like large financial institutions after 2008, these producers may be “too big to fail” or simply too difficult to prosecute.

After all, tobacco and opioids are both easily definable and already subject to strict regulation. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet landed on an official definition for UPFs.

Where We Go From Here

It’s too early to tell how the city of San Francisco’s case will take shape. But we have seen some suggestion of the legislative and industry response to the regulation of UPFs.

The Better Food Disclosure Act was introduced in Nov. 2025. It proposes reforms to the FDA’s process of designating ingredients as “generally recognized as safe,” but does not overwrite or otherwise affect state level laws restricting or banning certain ingredients. That’s important because 108 such laws have been proposed across the U.S. in 2025 alone.

The industry appears to be gearing up for a fight. In response to the patchwork of state-level laws complicating the production and distribution of food products, a lobbying group called Americans for Ingredient Transparency emerged to advocate for unifying regulation at the federal level. And, on Dec. 5, four food-industry trade groups launched a suit of their own. The associations joined forces to challenge a Texas law, passed in June 2025, requiring warning labels on products containing 44 ingredients, including artificial dyes and other additives. The industry groups claim that the Texas law is inconsistent with federal regulation, amounts to a violation of free speech by imposing disclosures, and suggests that labeling efforts would raise production costs unnecessarily.

It’s possible though that even energetic lobbying and litigation efforts may prove fruitless in the face of a health department sympathetic to UPF critics. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary of Health and Human Services, has long spoken critically of modern food industry practices and, in 2024, posted a video on the X platform describing ultraprocessed foods as “driving the obesity epidemic.”

Political and legal pressures facing producers of ultraprocessed foods are the latest headwind, but shifting tastes signal that consumers may be moving away from ubiquitous UPF brands.

Shifting Consumer Choice

For years, health-conscious consumers have driven an increase in the market share of wellness-oriented food brands. According to data analysts Dunnhumby, the trend toward higher-quality, higher-priced grocery won’t abate anytime soon. That’s good news for health-oriented retail and F&B brands, as well as the consumers, primarily younger shoppers, who increasingly demand products that account for gut health, sleep quality, and other health considerations.

Looking Ahead

The history of tobacco regulation and litigation may offer some idea as to how legal challenges relating to UPFs may unfold. Scientists initially proposed a link between smoking and cancer in the 1920s. The first liability lawsuit was brought by a cancer victim in the 1950s but was later dropped. A Surgeon General report linking smoking to cancer was released in 1964 and many further reports on smoking and health complications followed. Still, it wasn’t until Mississippi — the first state to file a lawsuit seeking to recoup Medicaid funds — settled for $3.6 billion that states began seeking recompense from the industry en masse.

Is San Francisco’s case the Mississippi moment for UPFs? We will keep a close watch and let you know what develops.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/693c397b781774794abe919f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-12 12:19:16.956820

CBLL recently announced that the FDA has given 510(k) clearance for its latest delirium monitoring solution, making it the one and only FDA-cleared solution for continuous tracking of delirium. This milestone confirms the Ceribell System as an AI-driven brain-monitoring platform, extending its clinical efficacy by giving doctors useful information to detect risk for both seizures and delirium in more critically ill patients.

Delirium is a major unaddressed critical condition, as current screening relies on occasional bedside assessments, depending on personal judgment, which can vary from one clinician to another. CBLL’s FDA-approved Delirium Monitoring Solution continuously monitors brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG) and notifies clinicians when it sees patterns that suggest delirium. Stanford anesthesiology expert Dr. Juliana Barr says that the technology can potentially improve delirium detection rates, allow faster treatment and reduce the cost burden on both families and hospitals due to missed or delayed diagnoses.

Management noted that the FDA clearance enables CBLL to enlarge its footprint in delirium care by offering the first continuous, objective EEG technology to support doctors with early detection of delirium in critically ill patients. Further, the company will soon wrap up its launch plans and will deliver this breakthrough AI-powered neuro-monitoring technology to patients, making EEG a system-wide standard for brain care.

Likely Trend of CBLL Stock Following the News

Shares of CBLL have lost 3.8% since the announcement on Wednesday. Year to date, shares of CeriBell have declined 21.1% against the industry’s 1.1% growth and the S&P 500’s 19.5% rise.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

In the long run, the FDA clearance gives CeriBell a competitive advantage as well as supports its long-term mission of making continuous AI-based EEG technology a standard, essential tool in detecting seizure and delirium — a condition that affects up to 31% of ICU patients, 80% of ventilated patients and increases mortality rate by 10%, with longer hospital stays and higher post-ICU dementia risk. CBLL’s ability to deliver continuous AI-driven monitoring in serious neurological conditions reinforces its strategic vision of making EEG a new vital sign.

CBLL currently has a market capitalization of $748.59 million.

More on the Delirium Monitoring Solution

CBLL’s newly cleared point-of-care EEG system addresses key gaps in delirium, seizure and electrographic status epilepticus care by routine EEG-based screening that provides clinicians with real-time neurological insights to support earlier detection, reduce clinical variability and improve bedside decision-making.

CBLL’s delirium algorithm was tested on 225 critically ill adults, showing real-world reliability. The FDA clearance builds on the technology’s earlier Breakthrough Device Designation and the company has also applied for a New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to support hospitals with reimbursement benefits.

Studies show that nearly 48% of ICU patients undergoing seizures develop peri-ictal delirium, and 42% of older ICU patients with delirium show epileptiform discharges. Hence, by innovating an advanced seizure and delirium monitoring tool, CBLL enables thorough diagnosis of patient brain health and guides treatments that may improve outcomes.

ID1,Adobe,2025-12-12 16:12:27+00:00,www.dvm360.com,Create consistency to increase patient satisfaction and turn processes into profit - DVM360,"Bob Alaburda, Associate Editorial Director, Bob Alaburda, Associate Editorial Director",,,,,https://www.dvm360.com/view/create-consistency-to-increase-patient-satisfaction-and-turn-processes-into-profit,"He explains the benefits of explicitly scheduling time to strategically plan for your practice as a business, a concept he calls WONJI (Work On, Not Just In).
Weinstein: WONJI stands for “Work On, Not Just In.” We get so embedded in day-to-day operations that we forget the bigger picture.
Everyone hates staff meetings.
Weinstein: Stop using staff meetings for public flogging.
Weinstein: Don’t force change top-down.","In this dvm360 interview at Fetch Long Beach, Peter Weinstein, DVM, MBA, speaks from decades of practice-management experience about how to run better staff meetings, build repeatable processes your whole team owns, measure whether changes are working, and bring people on board without top-down friction. He explains the benefits of explicitly scheduling time to strategically plan for your practice as a business, a concept he calls WONJI (Work On, Not Just In).

Editor’s note: This dvm360 Q&A has been lightly edited and consolidated from a verbal interview to better fit a written format while retaining the substance of the original conversation.

What’s WONJI and why does it matter?

Weinstein: WONJI stands for “Work On, Not Just In.” We get so embedded in day-to-day operations that we forget the bigger picture. If you don’t program the GPS for your practice (vision, mission, values, standards of care), you won’t get where you want to go. Schedule time away—at the beach, on a mountain, even in your car—to think, plan, and set direction. If you don't schedule it, it won't happen.

Everyone hates staff meetings. How do we make them useful?

Weinstein: Stop using staff meetings for public flogging. Make them short, focused, and agenda-driven. Assign time limits to agenda items and use meetings as a classroom. Teach something clinical or managerial, celebrate wins, and revisit your mission/why at the start of every meeting. Forward-looking is better than rehashing mistakes.

You talk about process improvement. What are the small changes that make a big difference?

Weinstein: Create recipes: step-by-step processes so tasks don’t depend on a single person. Scripts and written procedures aren’t about making people robotic. They’re about consistent, high-quality output in everyday tasks like phone answering, presenting invoices, prepping surgical packs, and cleaning cages. Do it right the first time so you don’t have to apologize later.

After you change a process, how do you know it’s working?

Weinstein: Look for objective and subjective measures. Subjectively, staff will feel more prepared and satisfied. Objectively, track staff retention, client retention, reduced waste, and profitability. Consistent client and patient experiences are measurable and will show whether your process is delivering.

Change is hard. How do you get people on board?

Weinstein: Don’t force change top-down. Ask your team where the pain points are and invite suggestions. Let the people who do the work build the process. For example, video a team member doing the task, add audio, transcribe it, and create a written “recipe.” That staff-driven approach creates buy-in because the team owns the improvement.

Any closing thoughts?

Weinstein: Treat your team as the practice’s greatest asset. Veterinary medicine is a team sport. We can’t do the work without our people and our clients. Leaders should be positive, respectful, and invest in the team.

It’s one of those updates that feels small on the surface but has huge implications for how we use creative tools going forward.
And while OpenAI already has its own image-generation tools, Adobe doesn’t seem worried.
Canva already works inside ChatGPT, Google is blending AI editing tools into its products, and Apple is moving towards system-wide AI assistance on iOS.
If you want absolute control, the full Adobe apps are still just a click away.","With each new feature from software and AI companies, the line between using a chatbot and opening a dedicated app just keeps getting blurrier. Take a company like Adobe, for example, long known as a major force in the creative world. In recent years, Adobe has leaned heavily into AI, weaving it into everything from Premiere Pro to Photoshop.

This shift has lowered the barrier for anyone looking to create, because instead of taking a full Premiere Pro masterclass, you can fire up Adobe Firefly and get things done faster, or if you’re already a pro, AI simply helps you move quicker.

Now, though, Adobe seems to have taken things a step further with its latest partnership with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Users with an Adobe account can now edit images, tweak designs, or even animate directly through ChatGPT, without manually opening Photoshop, Express, or Acrobat. It’s one of those updates that feels small on the surface but has huge implications for how we use creative tools going forward.

At the core of the update is a simple idea. You talk to ChatGPT, and it talks to Adobe’s apps for you. It should be able to help you do everything from brightening an image or even removing a distracting background; all you have to do is just describe it. ChatGPT pulls up Photoshop’s editing options and even gives you relevant sliders so you can adjust things like exposure, shadows, and highlights, right inside the chat.

If you need to build a quick design or animate a social post, Adobe Express steps in with templates, assets, and creative elements. Acrobat works the same way for PDFs, letting ChatGPT merge files, extract tables, or clean up documents on the fly.

It’s worth noting that OpenAI has been pushing hard to turn ChatGPT into something like an operating system for everyday apps. We’ve already seen integrations with Canva, Spotify, Expedia, and Figma, but Adobe is easily one of its biggest wins yet. And while OpenAI already has its own image-generation tools, Adobe doesn’t seem worried. In fact, Adobe says this partnership is more about accessibility, bringing its “best-in-class tools” to wherever users already are, including inside a chatbot.

There’s also a competitive angle here. Canva already works inside ChatGPT, Google is blending AI editing tools into its products, and Apple is moving towards system-wide AI assistance on iOS. Adobe's integrating deeply into ChatGPT keeps it in the conversation, literally.

For users, the update means fewer steps and more flexibility. If you want absolute control, the full Adobe apps are still just a click away. But if you just need something done quickly, ChatGPT now feels less like a chatbot and more like a universal creative assistant, one that quietly bridges the gap between natural language and pro-level tools.",https://www.techloy.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/12/photo-1486746730710-0e7ce7b07038.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 17:16:40.223888
