Johnson & Johnson says it will invest more than $55 billion within the United States over the next four years, including four new manufacturing plants.

A number of companies have highlighted investments in the U.S. in recent months, a focus of the Trump administration. J&J rival Eli Lilly and Co. announced in late February that it planned to build four new factories in the U.S. Both Lilly and J&J cited tax cut legislation passed in 2017 as factors in their U.S. investments.

Johnson & Johnson said Friday that it is a 25% increase in investment compared with the prior four years and estimates the U.S. economic impact will be more than $100 billion a year.

“Our increased U.S. investment begins with the ground-breaking of a high-tech facility in North Carolina that will not only add U.S.-based jobs but manufacture cutting edge medicines to treat patients in America and around the world,” Chairman and CEO Joaquin Duato said in a statement.

The North Carolina plant is in Wilson, just east of Raleigh. The locations of the other three facilities were not disclosed.

Aside from building four new plants, Johnson & Johnson said that it will expand several existing sites. The company is also planning to make investments in research and development infrastructure and technology.

Johnson & Johnson’s efforts are among several companies pledging to enhance their manufacturing in the U.S. Earlier this month chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said that it plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S., on top of $65 billion in investments the company had previously announced.

In February Apple announced that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, including plans to hire 20,000 people and build a new server factory in Texas.

Apple outlined several concrete moves in its announcement, the most significant of which is the construction of a new factory in Houston — slated to open in 2026 — that will produce servers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features.

On March 21, 2025, FedEx's stock plunged by an alarming 11% after the company substantially lowered its profit expectations for fiscal 2025 amid ongoing uncertainties regarding the U.S. industrial economy.
The declining performance in stock values indicates that FedEx’s shares have fallen by about 12% since the year began, leading to fears that the overall industrial outlook could worsen.
They emphasized, ""FedEx's Q3 print and full-year forecast cut will likely exacerbate concerns of structural pressures in the parcel business.""
Investors are now keeping a close eye on FedEx's share price, particularly concerning critical support levels.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares have encountered significant pressure this week, following the logistics giant's disappointing profit outlook that could impact its financial stability. On March 21, 2025, FedEx's stock plunged by an alarming 11% after the company substantially lowered its profit expectations for fiscal 2025 amid ongoing uncertainties regarding the U.S. industrial economy.

The company's decision marked the third consecutive quarter it had adjusted its guidance downward, with CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighting that the firm is navigating a particularly ""challenging operating environment"". He noted that weakness in the industrial economy is placing considerable strain on FedEx's higher-margin business-to-business volumes, resulting in fewer shipments and lower weights in their freight business. As Subramaniam put it, ""Weakness in the industrial economy was weighing on its higher-margin business-to-business volumes."" These developments raise alarms for investors, as diminished demand could signal a broader economic slowdown.

Despite reporting a 17% increase in quarterly earnings per share to $4.51, FedEx's sales totaled $22.2 billion only increased around 2% compared to the previous year, which fell short of analyst expectations who had projected earnings of $4.56 per share. This underperformance exacerbated existing concerns about maintaining profitability amidst price pressures and stronger competition from rivals like United Parcel Service (UPS).

The declining performance in stock values indicates that FedEx’s shares have fallen by about 12% since the year began, leading to fears that the overall industrial outlook could worsen. With investor sentiment already shaken, many major stock brokerage firms, including at least ten, have slashed their price targets for FedEx in light of these struggles.

Analysts from Morgan Stanley have described the current situation as indicative of possible structural issues impacting small-package deliveries, which could complicate FedEx's cost-cutting programs. They emphasized, ""FedEx's Q3 print and full-year forecast cut will likely exacerbate concerns of structural pressures in the parcel business."" The firm has been reducing costs as demand patterns shift, struggling to manage the increasing competition, and uncertainty triggered by ongoing tariff policies from the Trump administration, which economists warn could lead to recessionary effects.

Both FedEx and UPS share a reputation for serving as economic bellwethers—often seen as sentiment indicators for broader economic activity due to their extensive involvement across various industries. Economists today are scrutinizing their results closely. The logistics sector hinges crucially on the health of manufacturing production, and any signs of stagnation could lead to significant declines in shipment volumes and revenues.

Investors are now keeping a close eye on FedEx's share price, particularly concerning critical support levels. Stock analysts have pointed to $223 as a key resistance point; failure to defend this number could pave the way for a decline toward the psychological level of $200. Conversely, should the stock bounce back, $267 general capitulation might serve as a threshold to monitor before any substantial corrective moves are attempted.

As of now, FedEx’s outlook remains uncertain, with many industry watchers advising that investors manage their expectations regarding the potential recovery of share value and future earnings. The company's lowered fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share forecast is now set between $18.00 and $18.60, sliding from the previous estimate of $19 to $20. This revision signals that FedEx may struggle to regain confidence amidst varying factors impacting its operational efficiency.

The recent actions taken by FedEx serve as a stark reminder of the volatility within the logistics market, plagued by external conditions often beyond a single company's control. As the industry awaits further updates and economic shifts, stakeholders remain alert to how global trade tensions and the ever-evolving landscape of U.S. tariffs will ultimately influence freight demand and overall logistics profitability in the foreseeable future.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/_uY_25hgT81ngB9wkC8JkaOsDnU=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F47833b4f-de4f-4079-8183-4731177f01f9.jpeg,N,,2025-03-21 13:04:40.434723

Luckin Coffee, a rapidly expanding enterprise that has already dethroned Starbucks as the largest coffee chain in China, is plotting to break into the US market by opening a store in New York City where it will offer coffee at half the price of its competitor. The Chinese contender aims to charge $2 to $3 per cup, in stark contrast to Starbucks' typical $6 to $7 per beverage.

This move comes at an inopportune moment for Starbucks, which disclosed another dip in sales for the period from October to December in January. This downturn represents the fourth straight quarter of losses for the company.

""Despite our heightened investments, we were unable to change the trajectory of our traffic decline, resulting in pressures in both our top-line and bottom-line,"" expressed Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Rachel Ruggeri regarding the preliminary financial report for 2024.

She continued: ""While our efficiency efforts continued to produce according to plan, they were not enough to outpace the impact of the decline in traffic. We are developing a plan to turn around our business, but it will take time. We want to amplify our confidence in the business, and provide some certainty as we drive our turnaround. For that reason, we have increased our dividend.""

Starbucks has recently welcomed ex-Chipotle chief Brian Niccol as its new head, and he's ringing in major changes, cautioning that Starbucks must ""fundamentally change"" to stay afloat.

In a bid to reverse declining sales, Starbucks disclosed last month their plan to cut over 1,000 jobs and streamline their menu. However, the strategy hasn't seemed to yield the desired results, as the coffee giant recently relinquished its title as the world's most valuable restaurant brand to McDonald's.

Meanwhile, Luckin Coffee is on an aggressive growth trajectory. Despite being founded only in 2017 and suffering a catastrophic collapse due to a $300 million sales fraud scandal, Luckin has bounced back impressively since exiting bankruptcy in 2022.

The brand has skyrocketed from a mere 10,000 stores two years ago to a whopping 22,340 locations today, dwarfing Starbucks' presence in China by threefold.

Luckin Coffee's CEO Jinyi Guo shared with investors the company's plans to implement ""flexible and tailored operational models to build our overseas experience.""

New York Fed President Williams said, ""The current modestly restrictive stance of the Fed's monetary policy is entirely appropriate given the solid labor market and inflation still running somewhat above our 2% goal.""

Chicago Fed President Goolsbee signaled he favors steady Fed policy when he said there's a lot of strength in the hard economic data and the Fed needs to be a steady hand and take the long view.

Market volatility may increase, and volume could be higher than normal today due to the expiration of nearly $4.5 trillion of March options and futures contracts tied to stocks, indexes, and exchange-traded funds in an event known as ""triple-witching."" The event has caused sudden price movements as contracts disappear and traders roll over existing positions.

Heightened geopolitical risks in the Middle East are negative for stocks. Israel on Tuesday launched a series of airstrikes across Gaza, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to act ""with increasing military strength"" to free hostages and disarm Hamas. Also, the US continues to launch strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels. US Defense Secretary Hegseth said strikes would be ""unrelenting"" until the group stops attacking vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthi rebels said they would respond by attacking US vessels in the Red Sea.

Stocks have been under pressure over the past two weeks due to fears that US tariffs will weaken economic growth and corporate earnings. On March 4, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and doubled the tariff on Chinese goods to 20% from 10%. On Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated that he would impose reciprocal tariffs and additional sector-specific tariffs on foreign nations on April 2.

The company's CFO highlighted that these factors are limiting demand for FedEx's business-to-business services.

In pre-market trading, FedEx shares fell by 9.0%, while its competitor, United Parcel Service (UPS), saw a 1.1% decline. Both companies are considered global economic indicators due to their extensive business operations across various sectors.

The demand for low-margin e-commerce deliveries from companies like Temu and Shein has surpassed the high-margin freight demand between businesses, prompting both FedEx and UPS to implement cost-cutting measures. The industrial sector, which is crucial for these delivery giants, has not met expectations for growth this year, partly due to new and potential tariffs.

Revenues at the McDonald’s franchise operator, Aarval which operates three outlets in Galway city, increased by 16pc from €40.27m to a record €46.93m in 2023.

However, increased costs at Aaron Byrne’s and Valerie Byrne’s Aarval Ltd contributed to pre-tax profits dipping marginally from €1.645m to €1.635m.

Revenues at the Byrnes’ franchisee McDonalds business — which is the largest in the west and midwest — have grown exponentially in recent years and the 2023 revenues of €46.93m are a four-fold increase on pre-Covid 19 revenues of €11.7m in 2019.

Numbers employed by the Byrne husband and wife team in 2019 totalled 245 and by the end of 2023 had increased to 937.

Aarval initially operated a McDonald’s outlet in Galway’s Shop Street, along with two other outlets in Galway City at Westside Shopping Centre and the Headford Road Retail Park.

In December 2020, the Byrnes expanded their Aarval business when acquiring four McDonalds restaurants in Limerick at Cruises Street in the city centre; at Jetland shopping centre, Caherdavin; at the Crescent Shopping Centre at Dooradoyle and at the Castletroy Shopping Centre at Castletroy, Limerick.

The couple further expanded their Aarval business when acquiring McDonalds outlets in Co Clare at Shannon and in Ennis in May 2021 while they scaled back their Limerick operation in August 2023 with the closure of the McDonalds on Cruises Street.

The company also saw its revenue rise to Rs 4,008 crore in FY24, a 2.3% increase from Rs 3,920 crore in the previous year as per data accessed by Tofler. This marks a strong recovery for the sporting goods retailer, which had been grappling with losses despite consistent revenue growth.

Decathlon, a French multinational sporting goods retailer, is one of the largest sports retailers in the world. Founded in 1976, the company designs, manufactures, and sells a wide range of sports equipment and apparel across multiple categories. In India, Decathlon has established a strong presence with large-format stores and an extensive e-commerce platform, making sports accessible and affordable to millions. Known for its private-label brands catering to various sports, the company has positioned itself as a leader in the affordable sports retail segment.

In FY22, Decathlon India recorded a net profit of Rs 36 crore, but it swung to a loss in FY23 despite increasing its revenue from Rs 2,897.77 crore in FY22 to Rs 3,920 crore in FY23. This loss was largely due to a sharp increase in total expenditure, which exceeded revenue for the first time. The company reported an expenditure of Rs 3,974.81 crore in FY23, compared to Rs 2,892 crore in FY22. However, in FY24, Decathlon reversed its losses by managing expenses more efficiently while maintaining revenue growth.

What led to Decathlon’s profitability in FY24?

One of the primary reasons for Decathlon’s profitability in FY24 was better control over operating expenses. While the company had suffered from high operational costs in FY23, strategic cost-cutting and operational efficiencies helped it improve margins. Through strategic cost management across areas such as utilities, rent, maintenance, fuel, advertising, IT, logistics, franchise fees, and professional services, the company reduced its overall expenses by 4.5%, lowering them from Rs 3,975 crore in FY23 to Rs 3,797 crore in FY24.

Furthermore, Decathlon continued its upward revenue trajectory, surpassing the Rs 4,000 crore mark in FY24. The company’s dominance in the sports retail sector, supported by its extensive product range and affordable pricing, contributed to sustained sales growth.

In FY23, Decathlon had a high tax outflow, which significantly affected its bottom line. The company had reported a deferred tax credit of Rs 50.92 crore that year. In contrast, FY24 saw a more stable tax situation at Rs 11.70 crore, allowing the company to report profits. Decathlon’s revenue growth was driven by the continued expansion of its retail footprint and an increase in demand for sporting equipment. Its primary revenue-generating category remained ‘Other Sports Equipment,’ which contributed a significant portion of the Rs 3,985 crore turnover in FY24. According to media reports, The company operated efficiently, spending Rs 0.95 to generate every rupee of revenue, while its ROCE improved to 17.79% and EBITDA margin reached 14.49%.",https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Decathlon-1200-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 12:05:49.253548

Forever 21, with its model based on physical stores and mass production of collections, couldn't compete with this flexibility.","The fashion chain Forever 21 has announced the closure of all its stores in the United States after declaring bankruptcy for the second time in six years. The company, which at its peak had more than 800 stores worldwide, couldn't compete against the new generation of digital retailers, led by Shein and Temu.

Shein's rise has been meteoric. Its business model is based on direct sales from factories in China without intermediaries. This has allowed it to offer extremely low prices and renew its catalog with thousands of new products every week.

This approach has displaced traditional brands like Forever 21, which couldn't match the speed or costs of the competition.

The Decline of Forever 21

During the 2000s and early 2010s, Forever 21 was a benchmark in affordable youth fashion. Its stores in shopping malls attracted millions of customers looking for trendy clothes at low prices. However, the rise of e-commerce and changes in consumer habits gradually weakened its business model.

The first major warning sign came in 2019, when the company declared bankruptcy for the first time. At that time, it closed hundreds of stores and reduced its international presence. Despite these efforts, it couldn't adapt to the digital competition.

Shein and the New Era of Fast Fashion

Meanwhile, Forever 21 was trying to restructure, Shein was establishing itself as the most popular fast fashion platform among young people. Its strategies were devastating:

Ultra-low prices: Thanks to the de minimis exemption in the United States, Shein can import products without paying tariffs, allowing it to maintain much lower prices than its traditional competitors.

Real-time production: Shein uses artificial intelligence to analyze trends and produce small quantities of new designs. If a product sells well, they make more; if not, they quickly discard it.

Direct-to-consumer sales: Without intermediaries or large warehouses, Shein reduces logistical costs and can offer constant discounts.

Social media marketing: The brand has dominated platforms like TikTok and Instagram, collaborating with influencers to attract a young audience.

Forever 21, with its model based on physical stores and mass production of collections, couldn't compete with this flexibility.

The Final Blow

In 2024, Forever 21's situation became unsustainable. Inflation and low traffic in shopping malls reduced its sales. At the same time, Shein and Temu continued to capture customers with aggressive promotions and fast shipping.

Finally, in March 2025, Forever 21 announced the liquidation of all its stores in the U.S. The brand will continue to operate online under the management of Authentic Brands Group, but its physical presence will disappear from the country.

The collapse of Forever 21 marks the end of an era in fashion retail. While Shein continues to dominate the market, other traditional brands face similar challenges. The industry has changed, and only those companies that adapt to digital commerce and new consumer trends will survive.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/shein-popup-espana_1200_800.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 08:00:21.176570

China sales plummeted 15%, as Nike Digital sales there were off 29% and Nike store sales slumped 6% as traffic declined double digits.","Nike’s fiscal 2025 third quarter results offered up a snapshot of just how biting the trade war and tariffs may be. They offered a snapshot of waning consumer demand.

And above all else the numbers — though not as bad as Wall Street might have feared — show that Nike’s turnaround will take time, a marathon and not a sprint.

As for those numbers released after the markets closed on Thursday (March 20), for the quarter that ended last month: Revenues were down 9% year over year to $11.3 billion, while the Street had expected a double digit-drop to the $11 billion level.

But looking forward, and as noted by CFO Matthew Friend, tariffs on imports from China and Mexico will hit margins by 4% to 5%. And revenues will decline in the midteens range, as management said on the call.

The stock slumped 4% in after-hours trading.

Full-Price Digital Model

Within the consolidated top line, Nike Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9% on a reported basis, amid declines seen across all geographies. Nike Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12%, and driven by a 15% decline in Nike digital sales, and a 2% dip at the companies stores.

Said Friend on the call, with discussion of the digital sales: “We are repositioning Nike Digital within an integrated marketplace. To do this, we are reducing promotional days, reducing markdown rates and shifting closeout liquidation to our Nike factory stores.”

Digital traffic is expected to be down “double digits in fiscal 2026,” he said, adding that “gradually, we expect organic traffic to stabilize and grow with new product launches and our increased brand marketing investments. … For Nike Digital, we are tightening our buys to support a full-price business model. For Nike factory stores, we are increasing markdowns to drive velocity of higher volumes of closeout inventory.”

During the call with analysts, CEO Elliott Hill, discussing the second quarter of his relatively new tenure at the helm of the company, said, “While we met the expectations we set, we’re not satisfied with our overall results. We can and will be better.

“For the quarter, the big takeaway for me was clear. When we lead with sport, we create impact for Nike. … We’re beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio. It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over-indexed on.”

Those actions will include diversifying sportwear apparel, he said. And across the brand, “We’re already reducing the promotional days and discounting at lower rates. In fact, comparing last year’s January and February to this year’s Nike Digital and North America [sales] went from over 30 promotional days to zero,” Hill said.

CFO Friend’s commentary on product lines and consumer demand were marked by declines in Nike sportswear and the Jordan brand, “led by a double-digit decline in our classic footwear franchises. These franchises again decelerated faster than the overall business with a more pronounced impact on Nike Digital.”

North America revenues slipped by 4%; in the EMEA region, revenues slipped 6%, and in that segment Nike Direct was off 12% and digital sales declined 25%. China sales plummeted 15%, as Nike Digital sales there were off 29% and Nike store sales slumped 6% as traffic declined double digits.

Navigating Uncertainty

“The market continues to be promotional especially in consumer … and in the digital channel,” Friend said of the China market.

Overall, he said, “We are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.”

Moving through those headwinds, Hill said, “We are going to run a balanced and complete portfolio. That’s why I want to make sure everybody on the call hears that. We’re going to run that through all three brand — Nike, Jordan, Converse — across performance, sportswear, men’s, women’s, kids, footwear, pro accessories, and up and down price points.”

Elsewhere, as Hill said, “We’ve been through a lot of change, but what’s encouraging is that in the 150 days since I’ve been back, we’ve reclaimed our identity. We know who we are. … Nike Inc. is a sports company.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Nike-earnings-2.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 02:32:34.668008

Nike’s (NKE-1.43%) turnaround plan is beginning to show results, thanks to a renewed focus on sports, its new CEO Elliott Hill said while unveiling better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings.

The company posted $11.27 billion in revenue and 54 cents per share in profit, beating analysts’ consensus forecasts of $11.01 billion and 29 cents, respectively. The stock rose almost 3% in after-hours trading.

“The progress we’ve made reinforces my confidence that we are on the right path,” Hill said in a statement.

It was still a difficult quarter: Overall sales dropped 9% primarily due to a 17% plunge in China, amid new tariffs and softer consumer. Margins remain under pressure as the company works to clear old inventory and introduce new styles as Hill shifts its focus back to its athletic roots.

Hill, who has reorganized corporate teams by sport and secured major sponsorship deals with the NFL, NBA and WNBA, is refocusing the brand away from fashion. This strategy was prominently showcased on the world’s biggest sports stage – the Paris Olympics.

Nike has made significant strides, particularly with female customers. A new partnership with Kim Kardashian’s Skims brand aims to expand Nike’s appeal to women and compete with brands like Lululemon (LULU-1.85%) and Alo Yoga.

Despite these moves, analysts still expect a sales decline for the current quarter, driven by multiple factors, including the departure of top strategy and communications executives, Bloomberg reported.

Since Nike’s last earnings report in December, it’s faced additional pressure from Donald Trump’s trade war. The new 20% U.S. tariff on goods imported from China affects about 24% of Nike’s suppliers, which could hurt margins if Nike can’t offset the costs or raise prices. Retailers including Costco and Walmart have demanded that Chinese suppliers absorb the tariffs.

Weaker consumer sentiment has slowed discretionary spending, affecting demand for apparel and footwear. Nike’s largest brand partner, Foot Locker (FL-2.30%), has blamed the shoemaker for its declining sales, citing the effects of sneaker markdowns.

Torrid Holdings , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $275.56 million for the quarter ended January 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.16%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $293.54 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

What's Next for Torrid Holdings?

While Torrid Holdings has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Torrid Holdings: unfavorable.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.14 on $276.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.24 on $1.1 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

(Reuters) -FedEx Corp lowered its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Thursday, as the parcel delivery firm battles stubbornly soft demand and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on trading partners.

""Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy, which is constraining demand for our business-to-business services,"" Chief Financial Officer John Dietrich said in a statement.

FedEx shares fell 5.3% to $232.29 in after-hours trade, while rival United Parcel Service stock shed 1.1%. Those companies are seen as barometers for the global economy since their business touches so many types of businesses.

Those hopes appear to have been dashed by new and threatened tariffs from the Trump administration. Experts are also concerned those import levies could spark a recession and trade war that further weakens transportation and delivery demand.

Memphis-based FedEx on Thursday lowered its full-year forecast for adjusted profit to $18 to $18.60 per share. FedEx in December cut that profit forecast for the fiscal year ending May 2025 to $19 to $20 per share, down from its initial target range of $20 to $22 per share.

FedEx also expects revenue for the 12 months ending in May to be flat to slightly down year-on-year, versus its earlier forecast for it to be approximately flat.

For the third quarter that ended on February 28, FedEx reported adjusted profit per share of $4.51. That was up from $3.86 per share last year, but below average analyst estimates of $4.54, according to data compiled by LSEG.

FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said the results came as the company was ""navigating a very challenging operating environment, including a compressed peak season and severe weather events.""

FedEx and UPS are locked in a fierce battle for market share, which analysts worry could lead to a price war.

FedEx and the United States Postal Service, its largest customer, ended their air cargo contract in September. UPS picked up that business, but in January said it was accelerating a plan to slash deliveries for its largest customer, Amazon.com.

FedEx in December announced long-awaited plans to spin off its profitable Freight division.

FedEx executives said on Thursday that the company remained on track for permanent cost reductions of $2.2 billion for fiscal 2025. CFO Dietrich also said the company had reached agreements to buy eight new Boeing 777 freighters at ""very attractive prices.""

Nike reported earnings Thursday, and cautioned that it expects sales in its current quarter to plunge because of tariffs and sliding consumer sentiment. Accenture, meanwhile, said its numbers have been hit by a reduction in contracts with the U.S. government as the latter reins in spending.

Those are warnings of the economic damage that countries could suffer — on a wider scale — when U.S. President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs come into effect April 2, as he had warned. Across the Atlantic, the European Union is trying to insulate its economy from such blows, postponing its tariffs on the U.S. as it hopes to negotiate a new deal with Trump.

Markets fail to sustain gains

U.S. markets lost momentum Thursday. The S&P 500 lost 0.22%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was mostly flat and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.33%. Accenture shares dropped 7.3% after the firm warned of cuts in contracts with the U.S. government. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.43%, its first loss in five days. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed unchanged as the Bank of England on Thursday held its benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.

Prices in Japan ease

Japan's headline inflation rose 3.7% year on year in February, easing from a two-year high of 4% seen in January. Core inflation, which excludes prices of fresh food, was at 3%, lower than January's figure of 3.2%. However, the figure was higher than expectations of 2.9% from economists polled by Reuters. The inflation figures come shortly after the Bank of Japan held interest rates steady Wednesday.

Trump's interest rate demands

Hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced it was keeping interest rates unchanged, President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that ""The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy."" Trump in January said he would ""demand that interest rates drop immediately,"" though he didn't follow through on the threat.

EU postpones U.S. tariff

The European Union will delay implementing its first set of tariffs on goods from the U.S. until the middle of April to allow for additional time for discussions with Washington, an EU spokesperson told CNBC Thursday. ""The change represents a slight adjustment to the timeline and does not diminish the impact of our response, in particular as the EU continues to prepare for retaliation of up to EUR 26 billion [$28 billion],"" they noted.

Sales weighed down by tariffs: Nike

Nike on Thursday warned that sales in its current quarter will drop by a double-digit percentage as the sneaker giant contends with ""geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations,"" Matt Friend, Nike's finance chief, said in a conference call with analysts. Pessimistic guidance aside, Nike beat Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal third quarter.

Those recent indicators illustrate the long road ahead for Nike and its new CEO Elliott Hill, who assumed the top job in October. Nike shares have slid 19% since September 20, following Hill’s appointment. Rival Adidas, meanwhile, has seen its stock tick up slightly over the same period.

A turnaround in progress

Under Hill, Nike began an ambitious turnaround, though Morningstar analyst David Swartz said one or two snazzy new styles will not be enough to get the sportswear giant back on track for sales growth.

“It needs to create a whole new franchise, like a family of products that add billions in sales,” Swartz said. “That takes years.”

Nike is expected to post a revenue decline of 11.5% to $11.01 billion in the third quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG. It would be the steepest fall since the 38% decline Nike reported in fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 during the pandemic.

Its earnings per share is expected to come in at 29 cents, down sharply from 77 cents a year earlier. Investors told Reuters they were keen for details on Nike’s efforts to rebuild relationships with retailers and clear out unsold inventory.

“It continues to be a ‘show-me’ story,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at investment banking firm Freedom Capital Markets. “The question is, do investors have the patience?”

Nike’s inventories were $8 billion in the quarter ended November 30, according to the company.

Some of Hill’s moves so far—including the launch of running shoes Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 in January and February; a new partnership with womenswear company Skims; and its first Super Bowl ad in 27 years – drew praise from John Nagle, chief investment officer of Kavar Capital Partners LLC, which holds Nike shares.

Getting in step with Kim Kardashian

The planned women’s line with Kim Kardashian-owned Skims “would be pretty good for the business,” said Nagle, “if they can even just step into that market and be a significant player alongside the Lululemons and Vuoris.”

The Super Bowl commercial, conceived with ad agency Widen + Kennedy, was intended to reach women shoppers, and to demonstrate Nike’s marketing prowess and regain its pop culture relevance.

The spot featured top female athletes like Caitlin Clark, the basketball superstar who has been central to the newfound surge in popularity of the Women’s National Basketball Association.

FedEx shares fell 5.3% to $232.29 in after-hours trade, while rival United Parcel Service UPS.N stock shed 1.1%. Those companies are seen as barometers for the global economy since their business touches so many types of businesses.

Both companies have been slashing costs as less lucrative e-commerce delivery demand from companies like Temu and Shein outperforms that of higher-margin shipments between businesses.

The industrial sector includes firms that produce products used to make other goods. It drives significant cargo volume and more profitable deliveries for FedEx and UPS. Many executives in the U.S. transportation industry had been banking on the industrial economy returning to growth this year.

Those hopes appear to have been dashed by new and threatened tariffs from the Trump administration. Experts are also concerned those import levies could spark a recession and trade war that further weakens transportation and delivery demand.

Memphis-based FedEx on Thursday lowered its full-year forecast for adjusted profit to $18 to $18.60 per share. FedEx in December cut that profit forecast for the fiscal year ending May 2025 to $19 to $20 per share, down from its initial target range of $20 to $22 per share.

FedEx also expects revenue for the 12 months ending in May to be flat to slightly down year-on-year, versus its earlier forecast for it to be approximately flat.

For the third quarter that ended on February 28, FedEx reported adjusted profit per share of $4.51. That was up from $3.86 per share last year, but below average analyst estimates of $4.54, according to data compiled by LSEG.

FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said the results came as the company was ""navigating a very challenging operating environment, including a compressed peak season and severe weather events.""

FedEx and UPS are locked in a fierce battle for market share, which analysts worry could lead to a price war.

FedEx and the United States Postal Service, its largest customer, ended their air cargo contract in September. UPS picked up that business, but in January said it was accelerating a plan to slash deliveries for its largest customer, Amazon.com.

FedEx in December announced long-awaited plans to spin off its profitable Freight division.

Chief Financial Officer John Dietrich said in Thursday's release that the company's decision to revise its earnings outlook ""reflects weakness in the U.S. industrial economy, but we remain confident in executing transformation initiatives to drive stockholder value.""

FedEx: Cost Cutting Mode

At the end of fiscal Q2 in late December, FedEx announced intentions to separate FedEx Freight, creating a separate publicly traded company in about 18 months. FedEx has implemented several cost-cutting initiatives in recent months, including combining its ground, air and other operations in a single company. The goal is to reduce costs by $4 billion before the end of its current fiscal year, ending in May.

Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker in early March wrote that it is an ""important time for the Parcel space as a whole, and FDX in particular, with structural question surrounding the growth/earnings power of the business.""

""The stock has seesawed around earnings in recent quarters though we go into this print at a more reasonable starting point,"" Shanker added. The firm remains underweight on FDX with a 200 price target.

On Tuesday, Citi analysts lowered their price target on FedEx stock to 317 from 347, keeping a buy rating on the shares. The analysts wrote that based on conversations with investors, the big debate was over whether FedEx would further lower its fiscal 2025 earnings outlook.

The firm added that investors seem fearful of the potential impact of tariffs and increasingly concerned about downside risk to consumers and industrial activity.

FedEx Stock

FedEx stock dropped 4% in after-hours stock market action Thursday. It ended the regular session down 0.4% to 246.25. FDX is down more than 6% in March and is trading below both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.

In September, the stock gapped down sharply on Sept. 20, after reporting that cost cuts did not offset weakness in lucrative priority services. Fiscal Q1 earnings missed expectations and FedEx also lowered its full-year earnings outlook.

FedEx stock has declined around 11% in 2025 while United Parcel Service (UPS) has dropped nearly 7%. Collectively, the six stocks in the IBD-tracked Transport-Air Freight industry group are down 9.5% on the year.

FedEx stock has a 21-day average true range of 2.55%. The ATR metric is available on IBD's MarketSurge charting tool. It gauges the characteristic breadth of a stock's behavior. Stocks that tend to make large jumps or dives in daily action, the kind that can trigger sell rules and shake investors out of a stock, have a high ATR. Stocks that tend to make more incremental moves have lower ATRs.

In the current, unpredictable market, IBD suggests stocks with ATRs of 3 or below. UPS stock has a 21-day average true range of 1.89%.

FedEx stock has a 30 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Shares also have a 28 Relative Strength Rating and a 52 EPS Rating.

Auchincloss explained that a series of global changes since 2020 influenced bp’s strategy shift.
“In each and every nation, they’re talking about more oil and gas.
During the interview, Auchincloss noted the company’s investments to boost oil and gas production in the Gulf of America, and onshore through its bpx business.
Answering a question about the challenges involved with carrying out bp’s new strategy, Auchincloss emphasized that process safety remains top of mind for the company.","Speaking on the main stage at the recent CERAWeek conference in Houston, bp CEO Murray Auchincloss discussed the company’s recent strategy shift and its plans to grow value in the coming years.

bp posted a short of overview of the discussion on its website.

In an interview with Dan Yergin, chairman of CERAWeek and vice chairman of S&P Global, Auchincloss explained the rationale for bp’s renewed focus on increasing oil and gas production, disciplined investments in the energy transition and driving efficiency across businesses globally. “I’m absolutely thrilled about what’s possible and look forward to growing our cash flows and growing our businesses,” Auchincloss said.

Auchincloss explained that a series of global changes since 2020 influenced bp’s strategy shift. “It became clear that the two priorities in all countries where we operate is affordable energy and reliable energy,” he said. “In each and every nation, they’re talking about more oil and gas. Yes, lower-carbon – but they need oil and gas. So that was the first thing we started to do, was strengthen the upstream portfolio, and we’ve taken great strides in that.”

Auchincloss noted that bp has “gone back to the Middle East with vigor,” including by reaching an agreement in February 2025 with the Iraqi government to invest in the rehabilitation and redevelopment of several giant oil fields in Kirkuk.

Auchincloss also pointed to bp’s significant investments in America. In fact, the company has about 30,000 employees in the US – more than anywhere else in the world. During the interview, Auchincloss noted the company’s investments to boost oil and gas production in the Gulf of America, and onshore through its bpx business. “We see great growth out of the United States,” Auchincloss said.

In discussing bp’s low-carbon energy plans, Auchincloss said the company is using a “capital-light approach” to growing value, including forming joint ventures to keep investments in those businesses off bp’s balance sheet. “You still get the electron flow for your trading business,” he said. “So we're happy, and it enables you to scale these businesses much faster than you otherwise would have inside a constrained environment of a company like bp.” Auchincloss also noted that bp is focusing its capital investments for biogas and electric vehicle charging in places where the returns can compete with upstream.

Answering a question about the challenges involved with carrying out bp’s new strategy, Auchincloss emphasized that process safety remains top of mind for the company. “We always have to keep an eye on that as we drive change and scale up construction,” he said. “That’s the number one thing.”","https://img.offshore-mag.com/files/base/ebm/os/image/2025/03/67dca65f81044d5fda3965ca-bp_yergin_ceraweek.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-03-20 22:59:36.390868

The Legacy of the Arch Deluxe By the late 1990s, the Arch Deluxe was pulled from menus.
So, here's to the Arch Deluxe — you may not have won the hearts (or taste buds) of many, but you sure did leave us with some cool memorabilia.","The '90s were wild. It was a time when frosted tips, Tamagotchis, and McDonald’s attempt at fine dining coexisted. In an era dominated by oversized jeans and boy bands, the brand experienced one of its biggest (and priciest) marketing flops when it sought to create a burger that would appeal to more sophisticated consumers.

The burger, known as the Arch Deluxe, was a bizarre creation marketed as an upscale burger for adults, and was even promoted with its own bottle of booze, dubbed the Deluxe Line Wine. And what's more grown-up than pairing your burger with a glass of wine? McDonald's — always keen to think outside the (Happy Meal) box — decided to go big or go home with this one.

A Burger Before Its Time?

In 1996, McDonald's tasked head chef Andrew Selvaggio with creating a burger that was ""unique and different to set [the brand] apart from everybody,"" Eater reports. According to Selvaggio, the Arch Deluxe was ""supposed to be the first entry into a better burger — premium burger — experience for McDonald’s.” The burger featured a quarter pound of beef, peppered bacon, lettuce, tomato, cheese, onions, and a ""secret"" mustard-mayo sauce, as described on a McDonald's fandom page.

The $200 Million Mistake

The company spent upwards of $200 million on advertising for its new Arch Deluxe line, complete with a swanky launch at the Ritz Carlton in Chicago. During the event, attendees were also treated to pours of a promotional (and low-alcohol) Deluxe Line Wine. Amid all the glamour and gourmet ambitions, one patron thought it would be a good idea to hang onto a bottle and save it for posterity.

According to a recent Instagram post from Consumer Time Capsule, the user ""recently acquired"" the commemorative bottle for an unknown amount — and people could be seen having a field day in the comment section. ""Looking a little brown in there,"" one user jokingly writes, while another says, ""I’ve heard ‘96 was an excellent year for McWine.""

Why Did It Flop?

Confusing Brand Identity: McDonald's had spent decades building a family-friendly image. Trying to pivot to an upscale market confused customers.

Pricing Problem: The burger was more expensive than a Big Mac, but not premium enough to justify the cost.

Marketing Misfire: Instead of making the burger aspirational, the ads made it seem exclusive in a way that pushed away loyal customers.

The Legacy of the Arch Deluxe

By the late 1990s, the Arch Deluxe was pulled from menus. Despite its failure, it remains one of the most infamous fast-food experiments ever attempted. Interestingly, McDonald's has flirted with reviving the concept, testing similar premium burgers in limited markets.

Would a modern version of the Arch Deluxe succeed today? With today's shift toward gourmet fast food, it's possible. But back in the 90s, it was a lesson in what no to do when rebranding a fast-food empire.

Though the Arch Deluxe has long been retired, and any remaining Deluxe Line wine bottles are likely gathering dust on some collector's shelf, we love reminiscing of a time when fast food brands tried to wine and dine us. So, here's to the Arch Deluxe — you may not have won the hearts (or taste buds) of many, but you sure did leave us with some cool memorabilia.

The market expected a lousy quarter from the sportswear giant as it works to clear inventory and increase engagement with its wholesale partners. But the third quarter results offer some green shoots that the turnaround plan under CEO Elliott Hill are bearing fruit. In October, Hill returned to Nike to replace John Donahoe as CEO.

“We’re beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio,” Hill said during the earnings call. “It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over indexed, but our approach is simple, help consumers fall in love with something new from Nike.”

Nike did not address tariffs in its financial release or on the earnings call. Concerns might be overblown as they relate to Nike. In a recent investor note, Telsey Advisory Group expected a muted impact on Nike with the 15% of its products manufactured in China largely to serve the Chinese market and few imported to the U.S.

The earnings report comes a day after a Bloomberg reported Nike’s lead strategy and communications executives—Daniel Heaf and and KeJuan Wilkins—are both leaving the company. It adds to the list of senior leadership changes under Hill.

Greater China was the worst performing region for Nike with sales down 18%, while North America, which is the largest market at $4.9 billion, was down only 4%. The Nike and Jordan brands represent the bulk of the company’s revenue, but the firm also breaks out Converse revenue, which was $405 million, down 18% for the quarter with declines across all territories. NBA MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has helped raise the profile of that brand.

“Nike is getting back to being Nike again,” Jeffries analyst Randal Konik wrote in a quick reaction research note to the news. “We think this journey takes 2 years, but our call is for a V-shaped recovery in F27.”

Last month, Konik upgraded his rating from hold to buy and made Nike his current favorite pick. He sees an upside case for the stock at $140 based on 35x his 2027 fiscal year earnings per share estimate of $4.00. The base case has the stock at $115.

Nike’s stock was the second-worst performer among the 30 components of the Dow in 2024 with a 30% drop. Its 7.2% decline the prior year made it the third-worst stock in the Dow.

Third Quarter Income Statement Review

Revenues for NIKE, Inc. were $11.3 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis compared to the prior year and down 7 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

NIKE Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis and down 6 percent on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines across all geographies.

NIKE Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12 percent on a reported basis and down 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to a 15 percent decrease in NIKE Brand Digital and a 2 percent decrease in NIKE-owned stores.

Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7 percent on a reported basis and down 4 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues for Converse were $405 million, down 18 percent on a reported basis and down 16 percent on a currency-neutral basis, due to declines across all territories.

Gross margin decreased 330 basis points to 41.5 percent, primarily due to higher discounts, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher product costs and changes in channel mix, partially offset by restructuring charges in the prior year.

Selling and administrative expense decreased 8 percent to $3.9 billion.

Demand creation expense was $1.1 billion, up 8 percent, primarily due to an increase in brand marketing expense.

Operating overhead expense decreased 13 percent to $2.8 billion, primarily due to the restructuring charges of $340 million in the prior year and lower wage-related expenses.

The effective tax rate was 5.9 percent compared to 16.5 percent for the same period last year, primarily due to a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit provided by recently finalized US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses.

Net income was $0.8 billion, down 32 percent, and Diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a decrease of 30 percent.

February 28, 2025 Balance Sheet Review

Inventories for NIKE, Inc. were $7.5 billion, down 2 percent compared to the prior year, reflecting product mix shifts, partially offset by an increase in units.

Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $10.4 billion, down approximately $0.2 billion from last year, as cash generated by operations was more than offset by share repurchases, cash dividends and capital expenditures.

Shareholder Returns

NIKE continues to have a strong track record of consistently increasing returns to shareholders, including 23 consecutive years of increasing dividend payouts.

In the third quarter, the Company returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders, including:

Dividends of $594 million, up 6 percent from the prior year.

Share repurchases of $499 million, reflecting 6.5 million shares retired as part of the Company’s four-year, $18 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2022.

As of February 28, 2025, a total of 119.3 million shares have been repurchased under the program for a total of approximately $11.8 billion.

The quarterly results beat analyst expectations of $11.01 billion, sending shares up 3 per cent in after-hours trading.

It’s the first quarter since Nike CEO Elliott Hill revealed his “Win Now” strategy. Hill, a former Nike veteran, took over the role from John Donahoe in October to steer a turnaround for the company, which laid off more than 1,600 employees last year and has had a string of negative quarters, with shares falling 28 per cent in the past year. Sales also fell 9 per cent in Q2.

The “Win Now” strategy comprises refocusing on sport; moving quickly to clear the marketplace of outdated inventory and usher in new, innovative designs; revamping Nike’s marketing strategy; investing in new countries; and elevating the brand perception.

“The progress we made against the ‘Win Now’ strategic priorities we committed to 90 days ago reinforces my confidence that we are on the right path,” said Hill in a statement. “What's encouraging is Nike made an impact this quarter leading with sport – through athlete storytelling, performance products and big sport moments.”

For the third quarter, gross margin was down 330 basis points to 41.5 per cent as the company works to clear old inventory and make way for fresh designs; inventory was down 2 per cent for the quarter. Net income fell 32 per cent to $800 million in Q3. By channel, direct-to-consumer sales were down 12 per cent to $4.7 billion, while wholesale revenues fell 7 per cent to $6.2 billion. The brand reported an increase in marketing expenses of $1.1 billion.

Nike was hit especially hard by a 17 per cent sales plunge in China to $1.73 billion. North American sales were down 4 per cent to $4.86 billion, while EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) sales fell 10 per cent to $2.8 billion for the quarter.

The brand did not update its outlook for fiscal 2025. Tariffs loom large over the US retail industry. The Trump administration imposed 20 per cent duties on goods imported from China, one of Nike’s manufacturing countries, earlier this year. “The operating environment is dynamic, but what matters most for Nike is serving athletes with new product innovation and re-igniting brand momentum through sport,” said Matthew Friend, Nike’s CFO, in a statement.

New York (CNN) — Nike is in a major slump.

The company’s global sales dropped 9% last quarter, including a 17% drop in China, Nike said Thursday.

In North America, Nike’s largest market, sales dropped 9%.

But the results weren’t as bad as investors feared: Nike’s stock (NKE) inched up 4% during after-hours trading Thursday. Still, the company’s stock has dropped around 30% over the last year.

The largest shoemaker in the world faces a consumer slowdown and tough competition from upstart running brands like Hoka and On. Customers are changing their behaviors, passing up expensive sneakers and athletic clothing for basics.

Nike is also trying to recover from strategy mistakes. The company is cutting back supply on its classic sneaker lines Air Force 1 and Pegasus to try to juice demand and sell these sneakers at full prices. Nike also wants to push shoppers to buy new, higher-priced Air Max shoes and newer Pegasus products.

In recent years, the company has slashed the number of traditional retailers it sells to, including DSW. Instead, it shifted more of its inventory to its own channels, especially online. But the abrupt change hurt Nike’s sales, and Nike has since brought back some of those partnerships.

“Nike took it too far and underestimated the importance of third-party retailers,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients in June.

Nike is betting new CEO Elliott Hill, a former Nike executive who the company brought back last year, and partnerships with celebrity brands like Kim Kardashian’s Skims can help improve profits.

ID26,Nike,2025-03-20 21:40:15+00:00,Yahoo Finance,Nike turnaround won't happen until 'at least fiscal year 2026' - Yahoo Finance,Julie Hyman,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nike-turnaround-wont-happen-until-213000529.html,"Realistically we've been hearing bad news from Nike now for well over a year, really going back to probably December of 2023.
This has been certainly highly publicized, and so people know that there's not really going to be a turnaround that we're really going to see until probably at least fiscal year 2026.
Yeah I think Nike's inventory is in better shape than it was in the past.
Uh but you know Nike's inventory is not in, not in perfect shape because realistically its sales are declined.
So it's definitely going to take some time for Nike to get its inventory in better shape in every channel, and Nike sells into a lot of channels.","Well Nike shares are jumping after reporting third quarter earnings moments ago. For more reaction we're bringing in David Swartz, equity analyst at Morningstar. And David, it seems like people here are ready to just give, give them a little grace. Give them a little wiggle room when it comes to Elliot Hill and his turnaround efforts at the company. But what did you think of this quarter specifically?

Yeah expectations were definitely very low. I anticipated an 11% sales decline and it came in down about 9%. So it was a little bit better than expected, but of course that's still a very poor quarter by Nike standards with the sales and earnings down significantly. But as you said, people anticipated that and they're willing to give Nike a pass. Realistically we've been hearing bad news from Nike now for well over a year, really going back to probably December of 2023. And so it's been a string of difficult quarters and of course there was a CEO change. And if things were really great then there wouldn't have been a CEO change. So people know that there are problems at Nike. This has been certainly highly publicized, and so people know that there's not really going to be a turnaround that we're really going to see until probably at least fiscal year 2026.

Was there anything in this report that sort of showed any kind of green shoots in that regard, or do we have to kind of wait for the call? And if so, what do you want to know from them at this point?

Yeah we don't have a lot of information yet, but it looks like the North America sales were not too bad, just down about 4% or so. So you know, that's not too bad in comparison with some other athletic companies that have been reporting in North America. However, the sales in greater China were certainly very weak, um and Europe doesn't look very good either. So it's clear that Nike has significant problems in major geographic regions that are going to need to be addressed, and it's going to definitely take some time. We know that Nike has intentionally pulled back on a lot of its shoe franchises like Air Force and Dunk that had really become stale and oversaturated in the last few years. And there have been some new products including Pegasus premium, Vomero 18, that seem to be doing pretty well, but at this point we're really waiting for a lot of new products to come out, really starting probably in fall and winter of next year.

And what about the sort of inventory clean out that they had been undergoing, right? Where they had sort of the glut of inventory as sales slowed down a little bit, and they were trying to move that through the system.

Yeah I think Nike's inventory is in better shape than it was in the past. I don't think that it's it's perfect at this point. Nike's inventory got really out of control about two or three years ago, it was just way too much product and it wasn't entirely Nike's fault because there were Covid reasons and other problems that were going on at the time, shipping issues. Um and some of those problems, I think, have passed. Uh but you know Nike's inventory is not in, not in perfect shape because realistically its sales are declined. So it's hard to manage the inventory when you've got declining sales. It's much easier when your sales are increasing. So it's definitely going to take some time for Nike to get its inventory in better shape in every channel, and Nike sells into a lot of channels.

Well and Nike has its own specific problems and then there's the macro environment right now of course. So do you think that it is going to really be fighting even more of an uphill battle given what seems to be some really wavering consumer sentiment in the US right now?

I think Nike's really been fighting those issues for some time. We have seen, for example in China, youth unemployment has been high, and that's Nike's target demographic. We've seen similar problems in North America and Europe, where inflation has affected consumer spending, especially for younger adults, teenagers. And that's Nike's target market. So the economic environment has never been perfect, um and it will never be perfect. But I think it could be better than what it is now. Uh we don't know exactly when that will happen. So Nike needs to manage its business assuming that economic conditions will not be ideal. And Nike has been increasing its sales through the value channel to some degree, uh to the family channel as well as trying to increase sales of its higher performance and higher priced products too. So Nike really needs to address all parts of the market.

And then finally David I want to ask you about tariffs. We just heard from our Brooke DePalma that the company has reduced its reliance on manufacturing from China to some extent. How much exposure does it still have there that it is then exporting to the US? Um and how do you think it's managing the tariff risk?

Well the vast majority of Nike's products that are made in China are sold in China as well, so it wouldn't be affected by the tariffs directly. Nike actually imports a small percentage of its merchandise from China to the United States. Um however, the economic factors are still there. If the trade war causes recessions in the US and China then that's definitely very negative for for Nike. And there's also a risk that tariffs will be extended to other countries. If tariffs are extended to Vietnam, that would be very damaging to Nike because it is Nike's number one sourcing country, and it does a lot of importing from Vietnam. And so I don't think Nike can avoid those tariffs very easily. It would also affect Adidas which has a big manufacturing facility in Vietnam as well.

Interesting. So watch this space on that front. David, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wGnkNQ_i0xD8oPoHGGymQQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/6d77aec0-05cd-11f0-bbff-9a32f88785b1,N,,2025-03-20 19:00:57.779748

The top-line result surpassed Wall Street estimates of $11.03 billion. North America revenues retreated 40 percent year-over-year.

Fiscal Third Quarter Summary

Revenues for Nike, Inc. were $11.3 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis compared to the prior year and down 7 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

Nike Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis and down 6 percent on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines across all geographies.

Nike Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12 percent on a reported basis and down 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to a 15 percent decrease in Nike Brand Digital and a 2 percent decrease in Nike-owned stores.

Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7 percent on a reported basis and down 4 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues for Converse were $405 million, down 18 percent on a reported basis and down 16 percent on a currency-neutral basis, due to declines across all territories.

Divisional Revenues

Regional Summary

Income Statement Summary

Gross margin decreased 330 basis points to 41.5 percent, primarily due to higher discounts, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher product costs and changes in channel mix, partially offset by restructuring charges in the prior year.

Selling and administrative expense decreased 8 percent to $3.9 billion.

Demand creation expense was $1.1 billion, up 8 percent, primarily due to an increase in brand marketing expense.

Operating overhead expense decreased 13 percent to $2.8 billion, primarily due to the restructuring charges of $340 million in the prior year and lower wage-related expenses.

The effective tax rate was 5.9 percent compared to 16.5 percent for the same period last year, primarily due to a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit provided by recently finalized US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses.

Net income was $0.8 billion, down 32 percent, and diluted earnings per share was 54 cents, a decrease of 30 percent year-over-year, but easily above consensus estimates for 30 cents per share.

Balance Sheet Summary

Inventories for Nike, Inc. were $7.5 billion, down 2 percent compared to the prior year, reflecting product mix shifts, partially offset by an increase in units.

Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $10.4 billion, down approximately $0.2 billion from last year, as cash generated by operations was more than offset by share repurchases, cash dividends and capital expenditures.

Shareholder Returns

Nike continues to have a strong track record of consistently increasing returns to shareholders, including 23 consecutive years of increasing dividend payouts.

In the third quarter, the company returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders, including:

Dividends of $594 million, up 6 percent from the prior year.

Share repurchases of $499 million, reflecting 6.5 million shares retired as part of the company’s four-year, $18 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2022.

As of February 28, 2025, a total of 119.3 million shares have been repurchased under the program for a total of approximately $11.8 billion.

To take a closer look in those numbers, adjusted earnings coming in at 54 cents, revenue coming in at 11.27 billion dollars.
Yeah, analysts telling me today that despite the, the thinking around tariffs taking a hit on their China business, it actually has reduced their exposure to China since Trump took office back in 2016.
But their China business, lots of work needs to be done in order to continue to, uh, convince that consumer to buy as well.
Is Anta China based?","Nike third quarter earnings coming across moments ago. We got the whole team with us to break it down. Joining us, Yahoo! Finances, Brad Smith, and Brooke DiPalma. Brooke, first, give us the numbers here.

So adjusted earnings per share beat expectations. We also saw revenue beat expectations. To take a closer look in those numbers, adjusted earnings coming in at 54 cents, revenue coming in at 11.27 billion dollars. That was compared to what Wall Street had expected of 11.03 billion. Now, the Nike brand, that key segment of the business, did also beat expectations when it comes to revenue coming in at 10.89 billion dollars, compared to what Wall Street had expected of 10.6. Now these were pretty lowly expectations going into this report. Many analysts telling me on the phone today that Nike is getting a pass here for this quarter and two after this, in the midst of what is a turnaround under new CEO, Elliot Hill. Analysts and investors really looking for long-term strategic moves that Hill will make. Now, this also comes at a time when consumers are very choosy. They have to be convinced to buy with newness and innovation. We also have seen other competitors like On Holdings, Skechers, and Hoka also come into the picture during this turnaround plan at Nike.

Yeah. And Brad, you had a chance to talk to some folks at the company.

Yeah, some of the sources at Nike and ultimately just additional context around how you're going to hear, I think, the executives continue over the next few months in this transitory period for the product portfolio, for their wholesale relationships, really try to tell the story and sell the story, not just internally among folks that work at Nike, but also to some of those wholesale partners. And one of the huge things that I would be watching more for is something that we've already heard for the company, this Win Now program where it's really five actions that they're trying to take to the mindset of their customers, both the wholesale partners as well as some of the customers like you and I, Josh, going into store buying up all the most recent Jordans here on the day. Uh, but ultimately, igniting their winning culture, shaping their brand for distinction, accelerating a complete product portfolio, elevating and growing marketplace, plus winning on the ground with consumers. And I know we're going to talk about one of those key areas where they do need to win on the ground regionally. But if we think about the product portfolio here, just specifically, there was a lot of talk about how they had leaned too far into Dunks, how they had gone and looked at the retro Jordan brand and tried to figure out, okay, where can we make sure that we are milking that for all of the value that it potentially has. And there were some creative launches that certainly came forward, but now there's a larger question of how sustainable longer term that was, especially as analysts, who you and I have spoken to as well, are talking about, well, where's the newness? Where's the innovation that's really going to drive a lot more of that fanfare for the brand itself?

And there's so much going on with Nike, right? When we think about sort of the global brand and Brooke, I know you've sort of been tracking what's going on with Nike and their business in China. Their adjusted EBITDA coming in a little bit lower than expected in that region right now, but what's sort of the story with Nike and their China businesses?

Yeah, analysts telling me today that despite the, the thinking around tariffs taking a hit on their China business, it actually has reduced their exposure to China since Trump took office back in 2016. If you take a closer look, their footwear exposure, as far as manufacturing goes in China, has been reduced from 29% to 18%. Apparel business also down from 26% down to 16% in the latest year. But their China business, lots of work needs to be done in order to continue to, uh, convince that consumer to buy as well. We know that we saw on this report their business sales over there, Wall Street had expected them to drop roughly 9%, they dropped roughly 15%. So that was certainly way more than Wall Street had expected.

Yeah, no, that's a great point. And one of the huge things that we have to remember about China too is Elliot Hill, the new CEO who is a, of course, boomerang for the company, he's had a lot of experience operating and really revving back up their China business. 2014-2015, that was one of the main tasks that was on his desk. And ultimately what we saw back then was a period of time where there was more globalization. It's a far different period that they're operating through now. A lot of that consumer mind share, especially localized both US and in China has moved towards some of the more homegrown options. And so with that in mind, it's going to come back to how they're able to sell further into that region, which products are able to move through wholesale partners, and what price too, because this is a company that also has talked about in the past, wanting to make sure that much of their 65% of their inventory is selling at full price here. And so as you're working with those wholesale partners, they want to make sure that you're also not undercutting them and running massive promotions. And that's actually what we saw in the recent quarter, too. They cut back on some of those promotions. Anybody who was on the platform or on the website or on the Sneakers app, probably saw, probably saw sales, but less of the sales. That's what I was experiencing. I was like, where are the discounts? I need them here. I don't have as much to spend. And so that is something that we could see potentially going forward from here as well.

Meanwhile, this makes me wonder, what's the hot sneaker brand in China right now?

Well, Anta is doing really well. Um, so, so Anta, so Kyrie Irving, of course, ex-Nike athlete, is working with Anta, and he's been coming out with some pretty good shoes.

Anta, I believe the, yes, I believe China based, but also one of the other massive things around them is they've now gotten into storefronts here in the US as well.

We have Hoka, we have On, we have Adidas, what, what's, now we have this brand.

Consensus estimates from LSEG show Wall Street had expected sales to be down 11.4% in the current quarter.
That's largely because of the costs associated with Nike's efforts to clear out old inventory in favor of new, innovative styles.
During the quarter, sales fell 17% in the key region to $1.73 billion, falling short of expectations of $1.84 billion, according to StreetAccount.
Still, revenue in the region came in better than the $4.53 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.","Nike expects its sales decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is set to end in May, to be at the ""low end"" of the ""mid-teens range,"" far worse than analysts expected.

The company said its guidance is based on its ongoing restructuring efforts, plus tariffs and sliding consumer confidence.

During the sneaker giant's key holiday quarter, sales declined 9%, driven by weakness in China.

Nike on Thursday warned that sales will drop by a double digit percentage in its current quarter as the sneaker giant contends with new tariffs, sliding consumer confidence and a slower than expected turnaround.

In a conference call with analysts, finance chief Matt Friend said Nike expects its sales decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is set to end in May, to be at the ""low end"" of the ""mid-teens range."" It also anticipates its gross margin will fall between 4 and 5 percentage points as it ramps up efforts to liquidate excess inventory and stale styles that are no longer resonating with consumers — a process it expects to continue into fiscal 2026.

""We believe that the fourth quarter will reflect the largest impact from our ... actions, and that the headwinds to revenue and gross margin will begin to moderate from there,"" said Friend. ""We are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.""

The guidance is far worse than analysts had expected. Consensus estimates from LSEG show Wall Street had expected sales to be down 11.4% in the current quarter.

Shares fell more than 4% in extended trading and are down more than 5% year to date, as of Thursday's close.

Beyond guidance, Nike beat Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal third quarter.

Here's how the company performed during the quarter, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 54 cents vs. 29 cents estimated

Revenue: $11.27 billion vs. $11.01 billion estimated

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 28 was $794 million, or 54 cents per share, compared with $1.17 billion, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier.

Money Report

Sales dropped to $11.27 billion, down about 9% from $12.4 billion a year earlier. Like other retailers, Nike saw strong demand in December followed by ""double digit"" declines in January and February.

While Nike delivered a strong earnings beat, expectations were low headed into the release and profits fell 32% from the year-ago period.

During the quarter, Nike's gross margin fell by 3.3 percentage points to 41.5%, lower than expectations of 41.8%, according to StreetAccount. That's largely because of the costs associated with Nike's efforts to clear out old inventory in favor of new, innovative styles. In a press release, the company attributed its drop in gross margin to ""higher discounts, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher product costs and changes in channel mix.""

Meanwhile, sales were down 9%, driven by weakness in China. During the quarter, sales fell 17% in the key region to $1.73 billion, falling short of expectations of $1.84 billion, according to StreetAccount.

""I spent some time over there in December. I hadn't been over there in a while. The competition is a bit more aggressive than what I remembered,"" CEO Elliott Hill, who left Nike in 2020 and returned last year, told analysts. ""So we've just got to accelerate our pace.""

Thursday's release comes about five months into Hill's tenure as CEO and his efforts to turn around the business and get it back to growth. He has focused on winning back wholesale partners, reigniting innovation and wooing back athletes that have fled to new competitors, but the work has not yet yielded results.

""I'll start by saying I'm proud of the progress we made against the key actions we committed to 90 days ago. While we met the expectations we set, we're not satisfied with our overall results,"" Hill told analysts. ""We can and will be better.""

During the quarter, sales on Nike's direct channels dropped 12% to $4.7 billion. Wholesale revenue fell 7% to $6.2 billion.

Plus, since Hill took over, the company is now contending with a new set of dynamics that could make its comeback even harder to execute.

In the three months since Nike last reported earnings, President Donald Trump has put a new 20% tariff on goods imported from China, consumer sentiment has fallen, and retail sales in both January and February were weaker than expected.

Out of the hundreds of suppliers and manufacturers that Nike works with, about 24% of them are located in China, according to a manufacturing disclosure published in January. If the retailer doesn't raise prices to offset tariffs and can't push the cost entirely on to suppliers, Nike's margins are expected to take a hit from the new duties. On Thursday's call, Nike didn't say whether it would raise prices or how exactly the new duties would affect margins.

Further, when consumers aren't feeling confident and cutting back on spending, discretionary products like new clothes and shoes are one of the first things they cut out in favor of necessities. Over the last few years, the overall sneaker and apparel markets have been slow because consumers have cut back on clothes and shoes. But up until recently, strong companies were still performing well and taking market share from weaker competitors.

However, that trend began to shift over the last few weeks when even the strongest of companies started to sound the alarm about soft consumer spending when they reported first-quarter earnings, raising questions about the health of the economy.

During the quarter, sales in North America — Nike's largest market — fell 4% to $4.86 billion. Still, revenue in the region came in better than the $4.53 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.

Nike is widely expected to reclaim the market share it lost and reset its business, and some insiders say the company's problems have been overblown. Even so, the tariffs and economic fears could mean that the retailer's turnaround could take longer, and be more difficult, than expected.

What's key to Nike's turnaround plan is its ability to reignite innovation and create the type of industry-leading shoes and apparel that have long made it the market leader. During a call with analysts, Hill said early releases for the company's new Pegasus Premium ""nearly sold out"" across North America and will scale through fall 2025. Its Romero 18, created for the everyday runner, has seen ""outstanding"" results, and Nike plans to double distribution by mid-April.

""It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over-indexed on, but our approach is simple,"" said Hill. ""Help consumers fall in love with something new from Nike, and that something is not replacing one icon for another.""

Nike has already made strides in its efforts to grow its female consumer base, another key component to boosting revenue and apparel sales. Last month, it announced it was teaming up with Kim Kardashian's intimates brand Skims to create a new product line dubbed NikeSKIMS that will include apparel, footwear and accessories. The buzzy partnership is expected to give Nike improved inroads with women and allow it to better compete with Lululemon, Alo Yoga and Vuori, which cater more to women than Nike currently does.

Further, Nike debuted a new ad campaign geared toward female athletes during the Super Bowl, its first big game advertisement in decades. The campaign showed that reaching female athletes and capturing the buzz around women's sports will be a center point of Hill's strategy.

If Nike can continue to show positive signs from new product launches and partnerships, the rest of its headwinds might just be drowned out as noise.",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2025/03/108077585-1734535741032-gettyimages-2188445202-img_1635_belsnmkl.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-03-20 20:01:49.080684

(Reuters) -Nike reported a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly results on Thursday, showing the first signs of recovery as its new Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 sneaker lines drive an uptick in demand.

Shares of the Air Jordan maker rose 4% in extended trading.

Newly launched sneakers, fast-tracked by new CEO Elliott Hill, have performed well enough to give the sportswear maker some breathing room after several quarters of weak demand.

Hill took the helm in October to lead a turnaround at a company that has lately struggled to design new, innovative shoes.

With rivals On and Hoka retaining their freshness in the eyes of consumers, analysts and investors heading into the quarter had struck a cautious tone, anticipating that Nike's turnaround could take a few more quarters.

In the five months since he took charge, Hill has stressed the need to turn Nike's focus back to its core business of sport and to repair its relationships with retailers, which suffered when ex-CEO John Donahoe shifted the company's focus to direct-to-consumer sales.

Nike also discounted key lifestyle franchises Air Jordan 1, AirForce 1 and Dunk during the quarter, as it looks to clear out old inventory and focus on innovation. That sweetened the pot for buyers, who had waited all year to splurge in the holiday season.

The company's third-quarter revenue fell 9% to $11.27 billion, compared with analysts' expectation of an 11.5% drop to $11.01 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Nike's $2 billion savings plan including job cuts, tightening the supply of some products and reducing management layers helped it report a quarterly profit per share of 54 cents, about a 30% fall compared to a year ago.

Analysts on average were expecting a 62.2% decline to 29 cents per share.

However, gross margin fell 330 basis points to 41.5%, with Nike primarily attributing it to higher discounts, an excess of outdated inventory and increased product costs.

But that doesn’t mean NotCo is focusing all of its attention on the b2b business, he said.
“The blend we have come up with so far is a combination of existing ingredients and ingredients created by us.
“And then we started to become the innovation partners of big QSRs and not just for a plant-based version of something.
And then in 2022, we had an incredible conversation with Kraft Heinz, which had everything we didn’t in North America… scale, commercialization, distribution.","Chilean foodtech firm NotCo is on course to be profitable in 2027, says cofounder and CEO Matias Muchnick. “However, I’m looking at profitability in Q2 2025 in our most mature operations in Chile, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru.”

Speaking to AgFunderNews at the Future Food-Tech summit in San Francisco last week, Muchnick said NotCo had made some “hard decisions” in late 2023 and early 2024 including laying off staff, de-listing underperforming SKUs, and closing its New York office and transferring responsibility for sales and marketing of its products in North America to joint venture partner Kraft Heinz.

However, the growth of the b2b business—whereby NotCo uses its AI tools to help industry partners develop better products—”is taking off faster than we thought and allowing us to get a P&L closer to a technology company than a CPG company,” he claimed.

“Therefore, there might be some opportunities for us to become profitable closer to the end of 2026.”

NotCo in North America

NotCo’s branded CPG products in North America (NotMayo, NotChicken, NotBurger) are now sold and distributed by its joint venture with Kraft Heinz, along with plant-based products co-developed by the partners such as Kraft Not Cheese and Oscar Mayer Not Hot Dog, said Muchnick.

But that doesn’t mean NotCo is focusing all of its attention on the b2b business, he said. “We need to preserve a CPG business as there are obvious synergies. We can also test our technology in our own CPG products. 20% of our business in Chile and Argentina is from [NotCo branded] snacks today, which is something that didn’t even exist even one year ago.”

As for the joint venture with Kraft Heinz, he said, “We are on budget. For Kraft Heinz, NotBurger and NotChicken are incremental to their business, plus they are not as strong in the natural channel, where we are very strong.” Conversely, Kraft Heinz has excellent distribution in conventional accounts such as Walmart and Kroger, which has helped get co-developed products such as Not Mac & Cheese in front of more consumers, he said. “The JV is operating really well and we will keep innovating.”

NotMilk, which was introduced in US retailers’ chilled cabinets in 2020 and then switched to their shelf-stable sets in early 2023, is still available in some retail outlets and on Amazon, he said. “But the focus has shifted to D2C. Why? Because it’s not synergetic to Kraft Heinz.”

The B2B business

Echoing comments made by cofounder and CTO Dr. Karim Pichara in a recent interview with AgFunderNews, Muchnick said that a large chunk of NotCo’s revenue in the coming years will come from partnerships with CPG companies that want to improve and speed up product development using NotCo’s proprietary AI platform ‘Giuseppe.’

In some cases partners want to create new products from concept to launch, while in others they want to reformulate existing products to reduce costs or comply with evolving regulations or consumer preferences, he said.

“Some big companies are skeptical about sharing their data. But the good thing is that we have enough data and different data than what they have to generate the value they’re seeking.”

He added: “We might find one day that they will be willing to share their data, but then the question is, do they have valuable data?

“Every company says it has incredible data, but the data is not always compatible because the protocols in which it was created 40 years ago don’t match the ones used 20 years later. Or the mass spectrometer isn’t calibrated in Germany the same way it is somewhere else. So you have a level of disparity or inconsistency of data that can impact whether that data is valuable or not.”

Ultimately, he said, “We never say that we can do something better than R&D teams with decades of experience could do in-house. What we sell is that we’re going to get there far more quickly and efficiently and come up with different ways of achieving the same goals.

“So say you want to improve the HFSS score [High in Fat, Sugar, and Salt] of a certain product [in the UK market]. It might not be just about removing sugar, it might be about re-imagining what that product is. And artificial Intelligence is incredibly clever at doing that because it doesn’t have any biases about what should be [in any given product].”

Giuseppe is well-known for coming up with unusual ingredient pairings and suggestions, such as cocoa in plant-based beef burgers or pineapple and cabbage in alt-milk. However, reformulation projects don’t always involve unexpected ingredients but might be about changing the ratio of existing ingredients or tweaking the production process, said Muchnick.

“It’s not always about novelty, because novelty has a risk. Plus all of the projects that we’re working on have the number one constraint of gross margin.”

GLP-1 booster

NotCo’s most recent project is a powdered ‘GLP-1 booster’ that can be added to foods that will help people regulate appetite and preserve muscle mass and metabolic function, said Muchnick.

“We’re not trying to replace GLP-1 drugs. This is for people that can’t access these medications or who are coming off these drugs and trying to avoid weight rebound or just looking for a natural alternative that isn’t going to have the same effect as a drug, but still provides meaningful benefits.”

Giuseppe has been collecting data on ingredients for 10 years and can also scour through peer-reviewed papers on ingredients claimed to stimulate the production of GLP-1, noted Muchnick.

However, its approach has been less about identifying an obscure ingredient that might boost GLP-1 than developing a combination of ingredients that “help support GLP-1 levels in the body through different mechanisms.”

“Algorithms don’t really care about the name of the ingredient,” said Muchnick. “They care about understanding the underlying patterns on how to create combinations to generate functionality, taste, texture, smell or color.

“It’s not just what you see on a product label. We’ve been diving way deeper into digestion, absorption, and bioavailability, and searching both what exists and what we can build. For example, we are really focusing on peptides and the engineering of probiotics and prebiotics that help boost GLP-1 more than any physical ingredient that already exists.”

He added: “It’s one thing to see what is the best combination of existing ingredients to generate the desired effect, and the other one is, how do we create new ingredients that will boost GLP-1 more than any other ingredient that’s exists today? So we’re doing both routes.

“The blend we have come up with so far is a combination of existing ingredients and ingredients created by us. As a disclaimer, we have already run some tests, but they’re not clinical trials, therefore we can only say that it will potentially help you, but we can’t say more until we get the results of human clinical trials.” He did not provide details of the timing or scope of the trials, but said: “We have moved ahead with human clinical trials.”

As for the business model, he said, “We are considering several options, from working with our CPG partners so they can incorporate this into their products to launching it as one of our own products in our foods business. But the product is designed to be applied to any food matrix from chocolate to beverages.”

One-stop-shop

Stepping back, Muchnick said: “We’ve had 10 years of data construction. We have more than 10,000 formulations with sensorial feedback from human beings. We’ve been testing digital twins [virtual representations of a physical object or system that are updated in real-time], which is now a buzzword in AI, since we started the company.

“It is the different dimensions of data and the training on the data sets that sets us apart. Then what comes next is that we’re not an AI company that builds AI without understanding the human angle of key problems facing people in the food industry, because we also make our own products.”

Critically, NotCo is not merely a concept generator, but enables partners to build products from concept to launch, said Muchnick. “There are lots of AI software startups solving parts of the problem now, lots of concept generators, social listening models, competitive analysis and so on.

“But our concepts are connected to a formulation. If you test a concept and you like it, you have a formulation already. Everything is connected.”

Speaking at a breakout session at the Future Food-Tech summit last Thursday, Muchnick told delegates: “NotCo started as a technology company 10 years ago when no one was talking about AI… we wanted to become an R&D powerhouse for many other companies.

“It didn’t work. No one understood what we were doing, and so we needed to show them what we could do with our technology through our own brands, so we created a plant-based portfolio, starting in Chile and then Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, the US, Canada.

“And then we started to become the innovation partners of big QSRs and not just for a plant-based version of something. And then in 2022, we had an incredible conversation with Kraft Heinz, which had everything we didn’t in North America… scale, commercialization, distribution. And all of a sudden, we were operating eight different categories of products in only one year and a half of commercial execution.

“After that, ChatGPT was coming out and AI was suddenly what every board member was talking about. Today, we are working with seven out of the top 10 CPGs in the world.”

Third Quarter Income Statement Review

Revenues for NIKE, Inc. were $11.3 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis compared to the prior year and down 7 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

NIKE Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis and down 6 percent on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines across all geographies.

NIKE Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12 percent on a reported basis and down 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to a 15 percent decrease in NIKE Brand Digital and a 2 percent decrease in NIKE-owned stores.

Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7 percent on a reported basis and down 4 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues for Converse were $405 million, down 18 percent on a reported basis and down 16 percent on a currency-neutral basis, due to declines across all territories.

Gross margin decreased 330 basis points to 41.5 percent, primarily due to higher discounts, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher product costs and changes in channel mix, partially offset by restructuring charges in the prior year.

Selling and administrative expense decreased 8 percent to $3.9 billion.

Demand creation expense was $1.1 billion, up 8 percent, primarily due to an increase in brand marketing expense.

Operating overhead expense decreased 13 percent to $2.8 billion, primarily due to the restructuring charges of $340 million in the prior year and lower wage-related expenses.

The effective tax rate was 5.9 percent compared to 16.5 percent for the same period last year, primarily due to a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit provided by recently finalized US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses.

Net income was $0.8 billion, down 32 percent, and Diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a decrease of 30 percent.

February 28, 2025 Balance Sheet Review

Inventories for NIKE, Inc. were $7.5 billion, down 2 percent compared to the prior year, reflecting product mix shifts, partially offset by an increase in units.

Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $10.4 billion, down approximately $0.2 billion from last year, as cash generated by operations was more than offset by share repurchases, cash dividends and capital expenditures.

Shareholder Returns

NIKE continues to have a strong track record of consistently increasing returns to shareholders, including 23 consecutive years of increasing dividend payouts.

In the third quarter, the Company returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders, including:

Dividends of $594 million, up 6 percent from the prior year.

Share repurchases of $499 million, reflecting 6.5 million shares retired as part of the Company’s four-year, $18 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2022.

As of February 28, 2025, a total of 119.3 million shares have been repurchased under the program for a total of approximately $11.8 billion.

Check out our latest analysis for Hewlett Packard Enterprise

The Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit

To properly understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise's profit results, we need to consider the US$602m gain attributed to unusual items. While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution. When we crunched the numbers on thousands of publicly listed companies, we found that a boost from unusual items in a given year is often not repeated the next year. Which is hardly surprising, given the name. If Hewlett Packard Enterprise doesn't see that contribution repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to drop over the current year.

That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.

Our Take On Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Profit Performance

We'd posit that Hewlett Packard Enterprise's statutory earnings aren't a clean read on ongoing productivity, due to the large unusual item. Therefore, it seems possible to us that Hewlett Packard Enterprise's true underlying earnings power is actually less than its statutory profit. But at least holders can take some solace from the 43% EPS growth in the last year. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example - Hewlett Packard Enterprise has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.

Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.

A competitor from China is threatening to take the top spot as it begins its expansion to the U.S.

Last year, Starbucks suffered major financial losses, according to earnings reports.

Now, a swiftly-growing Chinese rival is aiming to challenge the longtime coffee giant's command over the U.S. coffee market.

In 2023, Luckin Coffee surpassed Starbucks to become the largest coffee chain in China.

This year, it plans to enter the American market with a new location in New York City.

The chain's pricing model includes coffee priced at around $2 to $3 per cup in the U.S., significantly undercutting Starbucks, which typically charges $6 to $7 in New York.

In January, Starbucks reported another decline in sales between October and December.

It was the company's fourth consecutive quarter of losses.

Luckin has expanded rapidly, growing from 10,000 stores just two years ago to 22,340 locations.

It currently outnumbers Starbucks in China three to one.

The chain's success has been driven by its extremely low prices and a mobile-first ordering system.

Luckin CEO Jinyi Guo recently told investors that the company is adopting ""flexible and tailored operational models to build our overseas experience.""

As Luckin prepares to enter the U.S. market, Starbucks is looking to correct past mistakes.

STARBUCKS CHALLENGES

The Seattle-based coffee giant recently appointed Brian Niccol, the former CEO of Chipotle, as its new leader.

Niccol has made sweeping changes, stating that Starbucks must ""fundamentally change"" its approach.

His reforms have included cutting several drinks from the menu and laying off more than 1,000 employees.

Niccol also reintroduced ceramic cups for in-store orders, hoping to encourage customers to spend more time in cafés and make additional purchases throughout the day.

According to a Q4 earnings call, Starbucks' same-store sales dropped by 4 percent, driven by a 6 percent decrease in in-store orders.

However, Starbucks’ stock has risen by about 7 percent this year, defying broader market trends, as the Nasdaq index has fallen over 8 percent since January.

LUCKIN ON THE RISE

Despite its rapid expansion, Luckin has had its share of challenges.

Founded in 2017, the company quickly rose to prominence, went public, and then collapsed in a massive fraud scandal.

Chinese regulators discovered that company executives had falsified approximately $300 million in sales, which led to its downfall.

But since emerging from bankruptcy in 2022 under new leadership, Luckin has significantly scaled its operations in China.

Since mid-2023, the company has been launching an average of 16 new locations every day.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/SC-Starbucks-Policy-Breaker-OP-copy.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-20 15:04:51.837480

It was clear in December that 2024 had been a hard year for many restaurant brands, which struggled from traffic declines, unit closures and outright bankruptcy. As chains reported their earnings for the last quarter of 2024 earlier this year, it became clear that those trends hadn’t changed. The environment may worsen as economic uncertainty — fueled by a waffling tariff policy, mass layoffs and government spending cuts of dubious legality — ramps up.

But even as trouble looms, a number of brands were able to win by exploiting consumer desire for strong value propositions, high-quality ingredients and experiential dining. The winners of this earnings season, generally, were brands that already did well. The losers too were no surprise, as turnarounds at chains like Applebee’s and Starbucks have yet to produce major shifts in consumer behavior.

Restaurant Dive identified three winning and three losing brands from publicly traded restaurant firms, based largely on same-store sales performance and the sense of momentum conveyed by earnings calls and analyst research notes.

Winners:

Texas Roadhouse

The steakhouse brand closed out a strong 2024 with 7.7% same-store sales growth at company restaurants and 6.3% at franchised locations in Q4, according to its earnings release. The brand also opened 14 restaurants in the quarter. Average weekly sales at company restaurants hit $153,867 — equivalent to an annualized $8 million sales volume in a 52-week year.

Looking forward, CEO Gerald Morgan said value would remain paramount for consumers in 2025, and the brand would take a measured approach to pricing, raising menu prices 1.4% in Q2 2025, according to an earnings call transcript.

As consumers seek alternatives to alcohol, Texas Roadhouse is addingseveral mocktails to its menu, Morgan said, and early results have been positive.

The chain is also continuing its tech deployments, Morgan said.

“We expect to complete the conversions of all locations to a digital kitchen by the end of the year,” Morgan told analysts.“These conversions are creating a more efficient kitchen and a less stressful environment for our Roadies.”

The chain will also continue upgrades to its guest management system used at the host stand, allowing employees to better predict wait times and improve seating.

Chili’s

Brinker’s fiscal Q2 2025 saw strong same-store sales growth for the casual dining chain: 31.4%, a staggering jump.

That increase was driven by the brand’s laser focus on value, as the brand marketed its Triple Dipper menu. But menu changes have played a role too. Brinker CEO Kevin Hochman said the chain has trimmed SKUs and raised the quality of a number of its ingredients.

“Fiscal year-to-date, we've been able to remove 13 menu items, 12 pantry SKUs and several prep sets, and we've reinvested time in doing fewer things a whole lot better,” Hochman said on the company’s earnings call. Other changes include guacamole made in-house, crispier bacon and chicken wings and higher-quality chicken breast.

But the brand isn’t resting on its laurels. Chili’s is working on a new prototype and will remodel about 200 targeted stores, some of which haven’t been updated since the 20th century.

Brinker CFO Mika Ware said the chain was “ramping up with the new prototype design, which will then lead us to our new reimage design,” and that atmosphere was a vital consideration. Chili’s emphasis on atmosphere, mentioned in the earnings call 11 times by Hochman and Ware, could signal the brand — like others in the restaurant industry — is looking to prioritize on-premise experience.

Cava

Cava has been growing rapidly since it went public in mid-2023, and that development continued in Q4 2024, with another quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth. The Mediterranean fast casual brand saw most of its sales increase come from rising traffic, a good sign for the brand, which saw its average unit volume rise from $2.6 million in late 2023 to $2.9 million in 2024, according to its most recent earnings call.

That strength is helping the brand enter new markets; just this week, Cava opened its first location in Indiana as part of its expansion into city markets throughout the Midwest.

Another winning factor has been the chain’s restrained approach to pricing. In January, Cava implemented 1.7% price increases on in-restaurant menus, and plans no further increases, CFO Tricia Tolivar said on its earnings call. In February 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food-away-from-home prices were 3.7% higher than in 2024.

Menu innovation helped Cava, too.

“Guest reception of grilled steak, which we introduced in the summer of 2024, exceeded our expectations, and incidence of this new main has remained strong,” CEO Brett Schulman said on the earnings call.

Losers:

Dine Brands

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a casual dining brand in possession of a shrinking store base must be in want of a turnaround plan.

Applebee’s has seen its same-store sales fall for seven quarters and its store base has eroded in recent years, down to 1,501 stores at the end of 2024 from 1,578 in 2021. Further losses are projected in 2025.

Dine has done what it can for the neighborhood bar and grill brand, with the Really Big Meal Deal driving some sales momentum, but not enough to overcome eroding spending by consumers making less than $75,000 a year. This demographic comprises two-thirds of Dine’s customer base, CEO John Peyton said on the company’s most recent earnings call. Because of this, Applebee’s has been unable to replicate the smashing success of Chili’s value plays, though Dine is set to launch a new value platform in the second half of 2025.

Then there’s the turnaround plan: Dine is launching a renovation drive at Applebee’s starting with 30 units the company acquired from a franchisee last year. Dual-branding with IHOP in new units could also help produce sales lifts for the chain.

IHOP, which outperformed Applebee’s for several quarters, has joined its sister brand in misery with four quarters of slipping comps and projected flat unit growth. In Q4, the chain had -2.8% same-store sales growth, its worst performance in years. Still, traffic improved over Q3 “primarily driven by the launch of our House Faves value menu,” Peyton said, accompanied by advertising that highlights the pricing and value of core breakfast items.

Starbucks

Six months in and Brian Niccol’s bold plan to remake Starbucks has yet to end its traffic problem. The brand saw an 8% traffic drop in North America during fiscal Q1 2025, offset by pricing action.

Yet the brand has made a number of changes Niccol said were vital: significant increases in advertising spend, in-store ceramic mugs, the return of the coffee condiment bar.

Starbucks also reduced the number of discounted orders by nearly 40% as it shifts away from a discounting strategy that may have hurt its brand positioning. The chain is working to cut roughly 30% of its menu, though significant customization may undercut the expected operational benefits of menu reduction.

More than 1,000 corporate Starbucks workers lost their jobs in February — 6.9% of its non-retail workforce — as corporate leadership moved to simplify structure.

The results of the coffee chain’s ad campaigns won’t be evident until the next round of earnings calls, but Starbucks has had a run of acute difficulty stretching back more than a year. With such a protracted slump, recovery will take time. It’s possible the changes Niccol has made will put Starbucks back in the winners category, but they didn’t this earnings season.

Pizza Hut and KFC

A notable absence from the winners are QSRs in general, and Yum Brands in particular. While Taco Bell turned in respectable same-store sales growth, the fast food conglomerate struggled in its home market.

KFC posted its fourth-consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, with sales down 5% year over year. Despite efforts to turnaround sales at the brand, KFC has remained stagnant; Q4 was its sixth quarter without same-store sales growth in the U.S. KFC has been unable to find an effective value strategy, despite long running value meal promotions.

Yum is implementing a series of changes intended to strengthen the brand, promoting its chief marketing officer to president and shifting Scott Mezvinsky from Taco Bell’s presidency to KFC’s CEO post.

Pizza Hut likewise had trouble, with a 2% drop in same-store sales. But while chicken chains like Popeyes, Raising Cane’s and Chick-fil-A are challenging KFC, Pizza Hut’s brand competitors also saw disappointing sales, with Papa Johns’ sales down 4% and Domino’s same-store sales nearly flat.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/MvA7u9Bi8TphK2zV-Aq72ywa4DcWLxpNc3c3E47hDIs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CaWdfU21hc2hlcl9QUl9TdGlsbF9Ob19TdXBlcnMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-03-20 13:05:43.771226

This decision has left Albertsons in a difficult position, but the company hasn't remained idle. Instead of lamenting, it has decided to take swift action to adapt to market challenges.

One of the most notable steps has been the improvement of its website. Albertsons has updated its online platform to offer a smoother and more convenient experience to its customers. With this change, the company seeks to remain competitive and meet the growing demands of consumers in the digital world.

| Albertsons

Albertsons's website has been revamped to facilitate shopping and enhance customer interaction. One of the most outstanding features is the ability to create personalized shopping lists.

Users can organize their shopping efficiently, whether by week or specific needs. Additionally, the function allows for real-time adjustments, making the experience much more flexible.

Albertsons has also optimized its platform to improve the online shopping experience. Consumers can now navigate the site more easily, select products, and place orders without hassle. Additionally, home delivery is more accessible, allowing users to receive their products directly at their doorstep.

Improved Rewards Management

Another key improvement is rewards management. Albertsons has simplified this process, allowing customers to access their points, discounts, and promotions quickly and easily.

Now, shoppers can see available offers and their accumulated benefits in real-time. This enhances the shopping experience and encourages brand loyalty.

This improved rewards system is designed to bring customers back, offering them attractive incentives that can be leveraged in future purchases. All of this is managed from a single account, making rewards management easier and saving users time.

Promotion of Albertsons's Health and Wellness

Albertsons has recognized the growing consumer interest in healthy products. In response, it has incorporated health and wellness-related content on its website.

Users can now access recommendations on organic, gluten-free, and low-sugar products, among others. The company also offers information on balanced diets and healthy recipes.

This focus on health is a key strategy to differentiate Albertsons from its competitors. Additionally, the company shows its commitment to the well-being of its customers by providing tools and options to improve their lifestyle.

Response to the Merger Cancellation

Although the merger with Kroger didn't go as desired, Albertsons hasn't stopped. The company has decided to move forward and improve its digital platform. With these updates, it seeks to strengthen its relationship with customers and remain competitive in a rapidly changing market.

The improvement of its website and digital services shows that Albertsons is willing to innovate, adapt, and offer consumers a more convenient shopping experience.

Here's what Wall Street expects - CNBC,"Gabrielle Fonrouge, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/20/nike-nke-q3-2025-earnings.html,"Nike will report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday and provide updates on its turnaround plan as it navigates new tariffs and soft consumer spending.

Nike is widely expected to reclaim the market share it lost and reset its business, and some insiders say the company's problems have been overblown.
Nike has already made strides in winning back market share and growing its female customer base, a key component to boosting revenue and apparel sales.","Nike will report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday and provide updates on its turnaround plan as it navigates new tariffs and soft consumer spending.

Here's what analysts are expecting from the world's largest sneaker company, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:

Earnings per share: 29 cents

Revenue: $11.01 billion

Expectations are low for Nike as it works to implement a turnaround under its new CEO Elliott Hill. Margins could face pressure as Nike moves to clear out old merchandise in favor of new, innovative styles and reset its relationship with wholesalers. The company is also contending with a new set of dynamics that could make its comeback even harder to execute.

Since Nike last reported earnings in December, President Donald Trump has put a new 20% tariff on goods imported from China, consumer sentiment has fallen, and retail sales in both January and February were weaker than expected.

Out of the hundreds of suppliers and manufacturers that Nike works with, about 24% of them are located in China, according to a manufacturing disclosure published in January. If the retailer doesn't raise prices to offset tariffs and can't push the cost entirely on to suppliers, Nike's margins are expected to take a hit from the new duties.

Further, when consumers aren't feeling confident and cutting back on spending, discretionary products like new clothes and shoes are one of the first things they cut out in favor of necessities. Over the last few years, the overall sneaker and apparel markets have been slow because consumers have cut back on clothes and shoes. But up until recently, strong companies were still performing well and taking market share from weaker competitors.

However, that trend began to shift over the last few weeks when even the strongest of companies started to sound the alarm about soft consumer spending when they reported first-quarter earnings, raising questions about the health of the economy.

Nike is widely expected to reclaim the market share it lost and reset its business, and some insiders say the company's problems have been overblown. Even so, the tariffs and economic fears could mean that the retailer's turnaround could take longer, and be more difficult, than expected.

Nike has already made strides in winning back market share and growing its female customer base, a key component to boosting revenue and apparel sales. Last month, it announced it was teaming up with Kim Kardashian's intimates brand Skims to create a new product line dubbed NikeSKIMS that will include apparel, footwear and accessories. The buzzy partnership is expected to give Nike improved inroads with women and allow it to better compete with Lululemon, Alo Yoga and Vuori, which cater more to women than Nike currently does.

Further, Nike debuted a new ad campaign geared toward female athletes during the Super Bowl, its first big game advertisement in decades. The campaign showed that reaching female athletes and capturing the buzz around women's sports will be a center point of Hill's strategy.

When Nike hosts its earnings call at 5 p.m. ET, analysts and investors will want to know how new product launches are faring as the company restarts its innovation engine. Some analysts say clues into the product pipeline will be the most important detail to listen for during the call because Nike's ability to innovate and put out the best products in the industry is what made it the market leader in athletic apparel and shoes.

If it can show positive signs from new product launches, the rest of its headwinds might just be drowned out as noise.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108077585-1734535741032-gettyimages-2188445202-img_1635_belsnmkl.jpeg?v=1734535821&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-03-20 14:02:16.450744

Recent footfall data reveals a sector buzzing with activity and significant growth potential. Burgers dominate, capturing over a third of all foot traffic in Irish chains, a trend reinforced by a robust 7.8% increase in traffic between 2023 and 2024.

Coffee and pizza shops follow, but the data reveals a deeper story: a 5% surge in overall fast-food visits in Ireland during Q4, 2024 compared to the previous year. This growth signifies increased customer frequency, with burger and pizza categories showing a 2% or greater like-for-like (L4L) growth per store.

This Irish appetite for fast food sharply contrasts with the UK, where the sector stagnated in 2024 and experienced L4L sales declines. This divergence is likely due to Ireland's stronger consumer spending, which rose 4% compared to the UK's 1%, according to Trading Economics.

This economic buoyancy fuels Ireland's quick-service dining sector.

While burgers and pizza drive the most growth, other segments, including chicken, bakery/sandwich, and ethnic cuisines, also contribute to the sector's overall expansion.

This dynamic landscape presents both opportunities and challenges. The growing burger segment and the emerging potential of chicken chains offer fertile ground for innovation. However, success depends on understanding evolving consumer behaviour and traffic patterns. As

The Shanghai-based company posted revenues of 110 billion yuan ($15 billion) in the three months to December 31, up 24 percent year-on-year.

The figure was down on the 44 percent growth recorded in the third quarter, continuing a slowdown following 86 percent growth in the second quarter and a 131 percent surge at the start of 2024.

As owner of overseas e-commerce platform Temu, PDD Holdings is expected to face further challenges as US levies against Chinese goods begin to bite.

US President Donald Trump this month doubled a blanket tariff on all Chinese imports from 10 to 20 percent.

The order came after Trump in February scrapped a customs exemption for goods valued under $800, long a vital part of the business model supporting platforms offering low-cost goods like Temu and rival Shein.

The companies send out tens of billions of dollars worth of clothes, gadgets and other items from their vast network of factories in China annually.

Since its September 2022 launch, Temu has become one of the most widely used online shopping sites in the United States.

PDD Holdings executives on Thursday remained optimistic in the health of its online mega-shops.

""Looking ahead, we will continue to prioritize investments in the platform ecosystem as the cornerstone of our long-term value creation strategy"", the company's vice president of finance, Jun Liu, said in a statement.

The firm reported net income of 27.4 billion yuan in the fourth quarter, up 18 percent compared to a year prior.

The results came in short of forecasts, causing US shares to fall 3.3 percent in pre-market trading, Bloomberg reported.

PDD Holdings also owns one of China's leading online retailers -- Pinduoduo -- which has achieved success in part by reaching consumers in rural areas with a diverse offering of low-cost products.

The filings of Chinese e-commerce firms have been closely watched by analysts and investors for signs of a resurgence in China's consumer spending.

The stock hit a record high of $179.10/share in 2021 and is currently trading near $72. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting:

Earnings Preview

The company is expected to report a gain of $0.28/share on $11.12 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $0.33/share. The Whisper number is the Street’s unofficial view on earnings.

A Closer Look At The Fundamentals

The company has seen up and down earnings over the last few years. In 2020, the company made $1.84/share. In 2021, earnings jumped to $3.56. Then, earnings came in at $3.75 in 2022. Then, earnings slid to $3.23 in 2023. In 2024, earnings grew to $3.95 and are expected to come in at $2.08 in 2025 and $2.36 in 2026. The stock sports a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 21 which is lower than the benchmark S&P 500.

A Closer Look At The Technicals

Technically, the stock is in a long downtrend and not acting very well. The stock is trading below its 50-day moving average line (DMA) and below its longer-term 200-day moving average line which are both not healthy signs.

Company History

Nike, originally founded as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS) on January 25, 1964, began as a small operation in Eugene, Oregon. Phil Knight, a track athlete at the University of Oregon, and his coach Bill Bowerman teamed up to import high-quality running shoes from Japan’s Onitsuka Tiger (now Asics) to sell in the U.S. market. Knight sold these shoes out of his car at track meets, while Bowerman contributed his expertise by experimenting with innovative shoe designs.

By 1966, BRS had opened its first retail store in Santa Monica, California, and expanded operations to the East Coast. However, disagreements with Onitsuka Tiger led the company to rebrand as Nike in 1971, adopting the now-iconic Swoosh logo designed by Carolyn Davidson.

The launch of Nike marked a turning point for the company. In 1972, Nike introduced its first original shoe featuring Bowerman's revolutionary ""waffle sole,"" inspired by a waffle iron, which enhanced traction and durability. The company gained momentum throughout the 1970s and introduced its patented Air technology in 1979, setting it apart from competitors.

The 1980s solidified Nike's dominance with high-profile endorsements, most notably Michael Jordan in 1984. The Air Jordan line became a cultural phenomenon, blending performance and style.

Nike also debuted its ""Just Do It"" slogan in 1988, further embedding itself into popular culture and sports. Today, Nike is a global leader in sportswear and innovation, headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. It has expanded beyond footwear into apparel, equipment, and digital technology like Nike+, which integrates fitness tracking with wearable devices.

With a focus on sustainability through initiatives like Flyknit technology and recycled materials, Nike continues to adapt to modern demands while maintaining its legacy as a brand synonymous with athletic excellence and innovation.

It’s the latest consumer food company to lower its sales outlook for the year. Campbell’s and Kraft Heinz expect business to slow down, as well. All this comes as some consumers continue to pull back on grocery store spending.

Inflation over the past couple of years has made trips to the grocery store a lot harder for many Americans — and a lot of folks expect prices will keep going up.

That’s influencing the choices they make when they shop for food, according to Ed Johnson, who focuses on consumer industries at Deloitte.

“The places where we’re seeing that choice manifest is only buying essentials, right, so maybe that’s — think about categories in the grocery store that are maybe seen as simple indulgences or as nice to haves,” he said.

So things like snacks or soda — some shoppers are skipping those, he said. Or they’re trading down from name brands to generic versions.

But those store brands aren’t immune either, cautioned executive editor of Supermarket News Chloe Riley. That’s because lower-income consumers are getting pinched by rising prices for basics like coffee and eggs.

“Consumers are cutting out even many of the cheaper items as well,” she said.

All these consumer choices are trickling up to corporate offices, per Craig Rowley, who consults with retail companies at Korn Ferry. He said that his clients are starting to ask, “What do our expenses look like? If our sales are going to be a little bit slight, what can we do to reduce our expenses?”

The federal government isn’t even immune to these layoffs.

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who runs the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have been shrinking the federal government in an effort to “enhance accountability, reduce waste, and promote innovation,"" according to a Feb. 19 executive order signed by Trump.

Their controversial efforts have resulted in over 36,000 government employees being laid off by DOGE and over 113,000 federal departures, according to recent data from Layoffs.fyi.

Just last month alone, employers based in the U.S. announced 172,017 job cuts, a 103% increase from the number of job cuts announced in February last year, according to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

It is also the highest number of job cuts announced in any February since 2009.

As layoffs in corporate America continue to affect employees, employers are rethinking their workplace cultures.

Here are some of the top workplace news stories over the last two weeks that highlight the current state of corporate America.

Starbucks CEO says employees need to step it up

Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Brian Niccol has high expectations for employees after the company laid off 1,100 corporate employees worldwide last month and paused hiring for hundreds of open positions.

According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, Niccol told employees during an internal forum at Starbucks’ headquarters that they needed to adjust their decision-making process.

“We’re not effective on how things get to the store, and we’re not effective in making decisions and then holding each other accountable to those decisions,” said Niccol. “This is why we had to make the changes that we had to make.”

As Starbucks is facing declining sales, Niccol emphasized that stores need to show improvement to prevent future job cuts.

“We own whether or not this place grows,” he said.

He also highlighted that teams need to be more diligent in addressing customer complaints.

“We have way too many follow-up meetings to fix way too many surprises,” said Niccol. “We’ve got to stop it.”

Bank of America cracks down on overwork

While Starbucks is pushing employees to step their game up, Bank of America (BAC) is taking an extra step to make sure its employees aren’t overworking themselves.

According to a recent report from the Journal, Bank of America now requires its senior bankers to ensure that junior bankers aren’t working hours exceeding the company’s limits.

The company is also allegedly exploring different options to lighten the workloads of its junior bankers. One option is using artificial intelligence to assist in completing tasks such as preparing financial forecasts and pitch decks.

The move from Bank of America comes after it suffered backlash when its employee, Leo Lukenas III, who was 35 years old, died of a blood clot in his heart last year after working 100-hour workweeks at the company.

A few months after his death, the Journal found through an investigation that Bank of America employees often pull all-nighters working on projects, and some managers even instruct employees to lie about their work hours to avoid facing scrutiny from Human Resources.

Meta has a sneaky way of blocking employees from being rehired

If you’ve ever been laid off or fired from Meta (META) , and you’ve wondered why rejoining the tech giant has been impossible, you may be on a secret blocklist.

A recent report from Business Insider revealed that Meta secretly keeps blocklists that contain a list of former fired or laid-off employees who are not eligible for rehire, despite previously having a history of good performance at the company.

The blocklists don’t just apply to workers who have violated the company’s workplace policies or performed poorly, according to Insider.

""If a manager didn't like you, it wasn't hard to put someone on a list,"" said one former manager at Meta who spoke to Insider.

Allegedly, a manager can simply put an employee on a blocklist by filling out a form within minutes, and it is apparently extremely difficult for a former employee to get off of it.

In a statement to Insider, a Meta spokesperson said there are several reasons why a former employee may not be eligible for rehire.

""We determine, at the time of separation, the reason for the employee's departure — policy violation, performance termination, voluntary resignation, etc. — and that, along with the last rating prior to separation and any other recent performance signals, determines whether an employee is eligible for rehire or not,"" said the spokesperson.

Jamie Dimon fires back at return-to-office complaints … again

JPMorgan Chase (^JJQ) CEO Jamie Dimon is still irked by complaints over the company’s new return-to-office mandate, which went into effect this month. The new mandate requires employees to work in the office five days a week, which has heightened tensions at the company.

During a company town hall meeting last month, Dimon doubled down on the mandate (in a foul-mouthed rant) and said that employees should not be mad at him about it since they have the option to quit working for JPMorgan.

In a recent interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Dimon, once again, addressed the controversy. He told students that the “people in the middle” are often complaining about return-to-office mandates.

He also seemingly highlighted that during the COVID-19 pandemic, most Americans were working in person.

Your beef, your meat, your vodka? Where did you get the diapers from? You got UPS and FedEx, manufacturers, agriculture, hospitals, cities, schools, nurses, sanitation, firemen, and military. They all worked. It's only these people in the middle who complain a lot about it.""

He also said remote work isn’t beneficial for JPMorgan’s work culture.

The Fed signaled that it will stick to a wait-and-see approach to further policy moves, as uncertainty around the effects of President Donald Trump’s tariffs clouds the wider economic outlook. Meanwhile, quarterly earnings from a range of companies, including FedEx (NYSE: ) and Nike (NYSE: ), are due out, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) CEO Jensen Huang tells the Financial Times that the semiconductor titan will shell out hundreds of billions of dollars on U.S.-made chips over the next four years.

1. Fed decision

The Federal Reserve chose to leave interest rates unchanged as expected at its latest policy meeting, noting that it will take a cautious approach to future decisions due to uncertainty around President Trump’s tariff plans.

The comments reiterated a wait-and-see attitude the central bank adopted earlier this year as policymakers fret about the potential impact of the levies on inflation and the broader economy.

The Fed slashed its 2025 growth projection and flagged that the tariff turmoil was starting to increase wider uncertainty.

“Inflation has started to move up,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, warning that “there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.”

Still, the Fed chose not to price in a prolonged surge in prices or a slowdown in growth. Powell also stressed that the outcome of Trump’s tariffs remains murky, suggesting that officials will likely move to calibrate monetary policy based on the impact of the trade tensions.

2. Futures lower

U.S. stock futures pointed lower on Thursday, reversing earlier gains, with markets gauging the Fed’s cautious policy stance.

By 06:38 ET (10:38 GMT), the contract had decreased by 257 points or 0.6%, had fallen by 42 points or 0.7%, and had ticked down by 167 points or 0.8%.

The main averages rose in the prior session, as traders lifted their bets for Fed interest rate cuts this year. Investors are now pricing in 68 basis points worth of reductions, up from 56 basis points — or about two quarter-point drawdowns — ahead of the Fed’s announcement.

The Fed also moved to slow down the pace of a drive to shrink the size of its balance sheet, which analysts interpreted as a sign that the central bank is keen to maintain market stability.

However, stocks have yet to claw back recent losses that were sparked by Trump’s tariff threats. The has shed 8% over the past month, and has erased all the gains it notched shortly after Trump was elected to a second term in the White House in November. The spreads between corporate and Treasury bond yields has widened as well, in an indication of the concerns markets have around the tariffs.

3. FedEx, Micron, Nike earnings ahead

On the earnings calendar, investors will have the chance to parse through quarterly results from a range of companies, including logistics group FedEx, chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ: ) and shoe seller Nike.

For FedEx, investors will be on the lookout for any commentary around the state of the U.S. and how it could hit revenue, analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.”

Micron, meanwhile, could provide a fresh glimpse into demand for its artificial intelligence data center chips, although concerns have swirled around its processors for consumer-centric products like personal computers and smartphones.

Fears over a tariff-driven downturn in consumer sentiment and rising inflation expectations have threatened sentiment around Nike, while the sportswear retailer is seen posting its steepest quarterly drop in revenue in almost five years, according to industry data cited by Reuters.

4. Nvidia CEO speaks on U.S. spending plans

Nvidia will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on U.S.-made chips and electronics components over the next four years, CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview with the Financial Times.

Huang said Nvidia will procure “probably half a trillion dollars worth of electronics in total” over the next four years, and that the company sees itself manufacturing “several hundred billion of it here in the U.S.""

Huang told the FT that Nvidia was now able to manufacture its latest systems through U.S. suppliers such as TSMC and Foxconn (SS: ), and that he saw a growing competitive threat from Chinese electronics giant Huawei.

His comments mirror commitments from several other major tech CEOs to spend more money in the United States. Earlier in March, Apple (NASDAQ: ) had vowed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster its U.S. operations.

5. Gold touches record high

Gold prices rose to record highs on Thursday, benefiting from a softer dollar after the Fed signaled at least two more interest rate cuts this year.

The yellow metal extended a run of recent gains, as it continued to receive a boost from heightened safe haven demand due to the collapse of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, roller-coaster Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, and increased uncertainty over the U.S. economy under Trump.

Richard Haigh, managing director, Brand Finance, said: “Many restaurants have increased prices over the past few years in response to the pandemic, inflation, and supply chain disruptions.

“Brand Finance data shows a steady decline in average price premium acceptance across the sector since 2023. In 2011 with the rise of a more health-conscious zeitgeist, McDonald’s repositioned to project a healthier profile while still maintaining its core offering.

Starbucks contests a debated $50 million verdict awarded in California over hot beverage burns, sparking intense public and legal debate.

Growing national concern over increasingly large punitive damages raises critical questions about fairness, jury impartiality, and broader economic implications.

By Samuel A. Lopez – USA Herald

The American justice system delivered two dramatic and controversial verdicts recently, placing major corporate defendants Ford Motor Company and Starbucks Coffee Company at the center of heated discussions around punitive damages, jury impartiality, and economic fairness.

In an unprecedented courtroom outcome, Ford Motor Co. was slapped with a staggering $2.5 billion punitive damages verdict in a high-stakes wrongful death case involving a tragic rollover crash. Herman and Debra Mills lost their lives in 2022 when their Ford F-250 Super Duty truck rolled over, with jurors deciding the truck’s roof was defectively designed, leading to fatal injuries.

Ford immediately mounted an appeal, arguing significant jury misconduct had prejudiced the trial. The automaker claims that jurors improperly considered a prior, now-vacated $1.7 billion verdict from a similar rollover incident, despite explicit court instructions to disregard it. Ford presented compelling evidence, including juror testimonies revealing that discussion of the previous case significantly impacted deliberations.

According to court documents, “Juror 36” explicitly stated that knowledge of the earlier verdict unquestionably influenced the jury’s punitive decision. Another juror corroborated this claim, prompting Ford to demand either a retrial or a substantial reduction in damages. Ford argued that scientific evidence clearly demonstrated the Mills’ deaths resulted primarily from the frontal collision impact, not from roof failure.

Legal experts have emphasized the difficulty of Ford’s challenge. Georgia appellate attorney Scott Key commented, “While Ford has a strong factual basis for appeal, proving juror misconduct is extremely challenging, particularly due to the confidential nature of jury deliberations.”

Legal analyst Madeline Summerville added that Ford faces a significant hurdle: “Courts rarely penetrate jury deliberations unless clear misconduct can be conclusively proven. This appeal could set important precedents regarding how juries deliberate and the limits of punitive damages.”

Meanwhile, Starbucks confronts a controversial $50 million verdict awarded to Mr. Garcia, a delivery driver severely burned by hot tea spilled at a Starbucks drive-through in Los Angeles. Despite Starbucks proposing a settlement of $7.5 to $10 million, the jury awarded damages far exceeding expectations.

My initial reporting ignited significant public outcry questioning the scale of this award. Comments from readers frequently expressed disbelief, with one particularly vocal observer stating, “What? Did he lose a limb or something?”Critics widely described the $50 million verdict as disproportionate, labeling it “outrageous” and detrimental to businesses at large.

At trial, Starbucks contended that Garcia’s complications were heavily influenced by his pre-existing diabetic condition. Yet, jurors held Starbucks entirely liable.

Jaci Anderson, Director of Corporate Communications for Starbucks Coffee Company, reached out to USA Herald, providing the following statement:

“We sympathize with Mr. Garcia, but we disagree with the jury’s decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive. We plan to appeal. We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks.”

Both Starbucks and Ford’s cases underscore a critical national debate about the appropriateness of punitive damage awards. Legal and economic analysts alike express concerns over increasingly large jury awards, cautioning they may inadvertently cause economic harm, reduce corporate investment, and increase operational costs—ultimately passed onto consumers.

“Punitive damages should deter irresponsible corporate conduct but not jeopardize economic stability,” explained Scott Key. “These massive awards, if unchecked, may discourage innovation and growth, harming businesses and consumers alike.”

As courts deliberate these pivotal cases, their outcomes will reverberate far beyond their immediate circumstances, reshaping how American businesses operate and how jurors approach their profound responsibilities.

In a preview of Interpublic’s first-quarter financial results, Nomura Securities analyst Michael Nathanson is calling the company’s performance -- based on his research -- just “so-so” and is maintaining his “neutral” rating on the firm. The company will release its first-quarter results Thursday.

Nathanson predicts that IPG’s organic revenue growth for the quarter will be reported at just 2.6% -- below that of competitors. Omnicom Group for example, said its first-quarter organic growth rose 5.1%, Publicis Groupe and Havas reported comparable growth of 4.1% and 3.5%, respectively.

Nathanson also forecast an organic revenue decline of 2% for the company in the U.S., due to client losses including Microsoft and S.C. Johnson.

“While we don’t dislike IPG, we think its model is not optimal at this point of the business cycle,” Nathanson stated in a note to clients.

Predicting lower growth for the company in 2012 isn’t that tough a task. Earlier this year, IPG CEO Michael Roth said the company was targeting about 3% organic growth for the full year -- about half what it achieved in 2011. Roth said the slowing growth was due to lingering clouds over the macro economy -- particularly in Europe, the company’s poorest-performing geographic sector last year. He added that the company isn’t counting on a rebound in the region this year.

In its preview, stock analyst firm Zacks reported that it was “cautious on the upcoming [IPG] results, based on intense pricing pressures witnessed worldwide in a fiercely competitive ad world.”

The firm also noted that “fluctuating global [Gross Domestic Product] tainted with rigorous client spending cuts as well as rising operating expense may lead to uncertainty.”

The Oregon-based company that also makes athletic apparel has announced the departure of its top strategy and communications executives. This development adds to a series of leadership changes that have occurred since CEO Elliott Hill assumed the top role at the company last year.

Daniel Heaf, the Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, is leaving the company after management decided to eliminate his role. The teams that were under his supervision will now be integrated into Nike’s finance department.

Internal Upheaval

Additionally, Nike’s Chief Communications Officer KeJuan Wilkins is leaving the company. Wilkins, who has been with Nike for nearly 20 years, was promoted to his current position in 2023 under previous CEO John Donahoe. A successor for Wilkins was not immediately announced by Nike.

The management changes at Nike come as Hill tries to turnaround the struggling retailer, which has seen its share price decline sharply since the Coivd-19 pandemic struck five years ago. Hill has said that his focus is on reviving Nike’s innovation pipeline and resetting its relationships with wholesalers. He has also pulled back on several of the company’s key sneakers, including the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1.

NKE stock has declined 3% this year and is near a 52-week low. The company is scheduled to report its latest financial results on March 20.

Is NKE Stock a Buy?

Despite Nike’s challenges in North America, Citi said the brand is still perceived as the “Most Innovative” brand, followed by Adidas, which gained ground on Nike relative to its December survey.
“Nike outranked Adidas (again) in terms of intent to purchase; however, Adidas continued to outrank Nike in terms of NPS.
Our survey results indicate the Jordan brand remains weak in China (similar to December).” Europe Summary In Europe, Nike retook the No.
1 spot in Net Promoter Score, and Nike continued to score slightly better than Adidas in intent to purchase.","Citi Research released its quarterly Global Sporting Goods Survey last week to assess the overall market with a close eye on perceptions of the Nike and Jordan brands. The company surveyed 1,600 North American consumers, 1,000 Chinese consumers and 900 European consumers in early to mid-February to gauge the momentum of many Western and Chinese brands in North America, Greater China and Europe (UK, France and Germany).

North America Summary

In North America, Citi found that the macro/promotional environment looks very similar to previous quarters, suggesting the overall athletic/active environment is still promotional but does not appear to be improving or degrading from past quarters. The firm pointed out that the survey timing was before most of the tariff and layoff talks increased in the media.

Citi noted that its February survey results indicated that Nike remains top-of-mind with the consumer, getting top ranks in Net Promoter Score (NPS) and intent to purchase. As expected, Nike was followed closely by Adidas in the No. 2 spot, moving up from the No. 4 in December. Despite Nike’s challenges in North America, Citi said the brand is still perceived as the “Most Innovative” brand, followed by Adidas, which gained ground on Nike relative to its December survey.

Citi said brand perception is evaluated best with the Net Promoter Score (NPS) it established, which is the difference between respondents who would recommend a given brand to their friends and family and those who would not recommend a given brand to their friends and family. Citi noted that it only includes scores from survey participants who recently purchased from the brands. A positive NPS score means that more respondents would recommend a particular brand to their friends and family versus respondents who would not recommend a brand to their friends and family.

The February survey saw Nike retaining the highest NPS of all the brands surveyed at +43 in February (vs. +46 in December), followed by Adidas in the No.2 spot (up from No. 4 spot in December) at +36 (vs. +39 in December) and New Balance at +34 (vs. +30 in December). Lululemon took the No. 4 spot (from the No. 7 spot in December) at +34 (vs. +25 in December). Hoka’s NPS was +24 in February, up from +17 in December. On Running’s NPS was +5 in February vs. +16 in December.

“Intent to Purchase” is another key brand strength and perception indicator. Surveyed respondents, when asked which athletic brand they considered purchasing next, Nike again topped the list. Twenty-six percent of respondents in February said they planned to buy Nike, down slightly from 29 percent in December. Adidas was next at 18 percent (up from 12 percent in December), followed by New Balance at 9 percent (down slightly from 10 percent in December). Hoka was at 1 percent in February (down from 3 percent in December), and On was at 1 percent in February (in line with December), suggesting that most survey respondents still do not consider these growing brands highly.

In “Most Innovative,” Nike again took the No. 1 spot at 25 percent, down from 28 percent in December, and is still “significantly above” Adidas in the No. 2 spot at 11 percent, followed by New Balance at 10 percent and Under Armour at 8 percent (vs. 9 percent in December). Adidas and New Balance were both flat to their December by respondents.

“On the earnings call, we don’t expect to hear a major revelation on product, but we will listen for early product wins, whether it’s in running with the Vomero 18 or Pegasus Premium, or basketball,” BofA wrote in its note. “Signs of product wins will be the singular most important catalyst to reengage investors on the stock, in our view.”

China Summary

In China, Citi said its survey results suggest the region remains very promotional, consistent with past quarters, and the macro environment appears stable relative to the firm’s December survey.

In Citi’s February survey, 55 percent of Chinese respondents said they expect their disposable income to get somewhat or significantly better over the next 12 months relative to today, which is down from the 72 percent of respondents that answered that way in December but higher than 45 percent who provided that response in Citi’s September survey.

“While Nike and Adidas ranked in the top spots in terms of NPS and intent to purchase, we saw both Anta and Li Ning regain ground, sitting in the No. 3 and No. 4 spots, respectively,” Citi wrote in its summary. “Nike outranked Adidas (again) in terms of intent to purchase; however, Adidas continued to outrank Nike in terms of NPS. Our survey results indicate the Jordan brand remains weak in China (similar to December).”

Europe Summary

In Europe, Nike retook the No. 1 spot in Net Promoter Score, and Nike continued to score slightly better than Adidas in intent to purchase. Nike continued to rank the highest among European respondents who perceived the brand as “Most Innovative.” Citi said Europe’s macro/promotional environment looks similar to last quarter.

The question over U.S. tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico and China has created uncertainty for partners at the event, prompting HP to talk up the resilience of its supply chain.

Nicolas joined HP in 2022 to revamp the company’s supply-chain operations, post-pandemic. A big part of that was diversifying HP’s footprint from both a manufacturing and distribution perspective.

“Over the last two years, we’ve opened operations in Mexico and Thailand as well as in Indonesia, we expanded in India, and are in the process of expanding here in the U.S., all of that in the name of resiliency. What that’s meant for us, specific to tariffs, is that we don’t have to revamp our strategy,” said Nicolas.

“I can tell you very comfortably that [I] and my peers are confident that we can aggressively compete in the marketplace because of the change that we’ve made relative to resiliency,"" said Nicolas.

The company has already said it expects to move 90% of the production of its products sold in North America away from China.

At HP Amplify, CEO Enrique Lores said the question over tariffs is difficult to answer, as ”we don’t know yet what the final plan is.” However, he said HP’s more flexible supply chain will “minimize the impact.”

PC Market Faces Challenge From ‘Volatile Trade Policies’

The subject of AI PCs, alongside the potential for partners around the Windows 11 refresh, were high on the agenda at HP Amplify.

However, new Canalys – now part of Omdia and Informa TechTarget, Channel Futures' parent company – data indicates the U.S. PC market faces challenges from volatile trade policies. These, it said, will likely result in higher prices for consumers and businesses.

Total PC shipments to the U.S. are expected to fall just shy of 2% growth in both 2025 and 2026 with volumes hovering between 70 million and 72 million units each year.

“President Trump’s ongoing trade war with Canada, Mexico and China has had swift negative repercussions for the stock market and pushed the US GDP growth forecast for Q1 2025 into negative territory,” said Canalys analyst Greg Davis. “In addition to the direct impact of tariffs, the stop-start nature of announcements and delays have cast uncertainty around pricing for consumer electronics this year. The tariffs have prompted mitigating actions across the PC industry, with vendors and channel partners engaging in some recent stockpiling of devices.”

(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru and Nicholas P. Brown in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)","By Nicholas P. Brown and Ananya Mariam Rajesh

(Reuters) – Nike is expected to post its steepest revenue decline in nearly five years in its quarterly results on Thursday, as its new products failed to open the wallets of Americans reluctant to snap up non-essential items like sporting goods and clothing.

Downloads of Nike mobile apps for the quarter were down 35% from a year earlier, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Foot traffic at Nike stores was down 11%, according to data compiled by Raymond James.

Foot Locker, a major Nike retailer, disclosed in its earnings March 5 that promotional pressures would hurt its profit margins in the year ahead. This signaled the impact of discounts imposed by Nike to clear out unsold inventory.

Nike products comprise more than 60% of Foot Locker merchandise.

Those recent indicators illustrate the long road ahead for Nike and its new CEO Elliott Hill, who assumed the top job in October. Nike shares have slid 19% since September 20, following Hill’s appointment. Rival Adidas, meanwhile, has seen its stock tick up slightly over the same period.

Under Hill, Nike began an ambitious turnaround, though Morningstar analyst David Swartz said one or two snazzy new styles will not be enough to get the sportswear giant back on track for sales growth.

“It needs to create a whole new franchise, like a family of products that add billions in sales,” Swartz said. “That takes years.”

Nike is expected to post a revenue decline of 11.5% to $11.01 billion in the third quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG. It would be the steepest fall since the 38% decline Nike reported in fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 during the pandemic.

Its earnings per share is expected to come in at 29 cents, down sharply from 77 cents a year earlier. Investors told Reuters they were keen for details on Nike’s efforts to rebuild relationships with retailers and clear out unsold inventory.

“It continues to be a ‘show-me’ story,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at investment banking firm Freedom Capital Markets. “The question is, do investors have the patience?”

Nike’s inventories were $8 billion in the quarter ended November 30, according to the company.

Some of Hill’s moves so far – including the launch of running shoes Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 in January and February; a new partnership with womenswear company Skims; and its first Super Bowl ad in 27 years – drew praise from John Nagle, chief investment officer of Kavar Capital Partners LLC, which holds Nike shares.

The planned women’s line with Kim Kardashian-owned Skims “would be pretty good for the business,” said Nagle, “if they can even just step into that market and be a significant player alongside the Lululemons and Biores.”

The Super Bowl commercial, conceived with ad agency Widen + Kennedy, was intended to reach women shoppers, and to demonstrate Nike’s marketing prowess and regain its pop culture relevance.

The spot featured top female athletes like Caitlin Clark, the basketball superstar who has been central to the newfound surge in popularity of the Women’s National Basketball Association.

Under the new ""Surge Fee,"" millions of packages that meet select requirements will be subject to the $0.29 per pound surcharge.

The additional fee will apply to all US shipments coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau, UPS announced earlier this month.

The ""Surge Fee"" was first implemented on March 16 and will remain in effect until March 29.

It is applied based on the billable weight of the package and is also subject to the UPS fuel surcharge.

“Our goal is to ensure that we can continue to meet our customers’ shipping needs without compromising the quality or timeliness of service expected from us,” UPS stated.

The carrier also noted that the Surge Fee was subject to change, and shippers could reference ups.com/rates for updates.

The move comes as UPS works to manage increasing export demand from Asia.

However, it's not the first time that high demand has pushed the company to roll out a surcharge on Chinese shipments being sent to the US.

UPS implemented a Surge Fee last year, tacking on $0.50 per pound on packages from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

The fee was in response to the inundation of shipments from Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Shein and Temu.

The new $0.29 Surge Fee is just one of many surcharge changes consumers will face this year, such as a higher late payment fee and new charges for check and wire transfers.

RISING PRESSURES

As the new Surge Fee stacks on top of UPS' other surcharge changes, it is also exacerbating pressure on shippers and companies who send goods from China to US.

They are already facing higher tariffs under the new administration, which implemented a 10% tariff on Chinese imports on February 4.

One month later, the US rolled out another 10% levy on goods arriving from China, increased the tariffs to 20%.

The new Surge Fee is also an additional burden to shippers preparing for the impending end of the de minimis exemption for packages priced under $800.

Shipments below the threshold could enter the US free of duties or taxes thanks to the provision, which was heavily used by Chinese e-commerce companies to ship low-cost items.

In February 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order to eliminate the exemption for shipments originating from China to ensure that appropriate tariff revenues were collected.

However, the executive order has been temporarily paused as it would create logistical problems and disruptions.

The government needed time to implement the changes, pushing it to delay the exemption's elimination.

Trump's trade shifts have also pushed Temu to undergo a major switch as it sets out to become ""more like Amazon"" - and customers will see more products.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/cropped-shot-courier-person-standing-967651053.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-19 18:02:41.095362

In 2024, CVS reported total revenues of $173.6 billion for its health services segment, reflecting a 7.1% decline year over year. Fourth-quarter revenue stood at $47 billion.

The company’s financial difficulties are partially attributed to its 2023 acquisition of primary care company Oak Street Health for $10.6 billion, which has since been deemed a “money-losing asset,” according to The Wall Street Journal.

According to the Journal, shares in the company fell 24% in 2024, and CVS has cut its earnings guidance multiple times during the year. Rising costs within Aetna’s Medicare Advantage business have played a significant role in these cuts, with CVS anticipating up to a 10% decline in its MA membership in 2025.

In an effort to streamline operations, CVS announced a series of layoffs, which are part of CVS’ broader initiative to reduce costs by $2 billion.:

In September, the company laid off 2,900 employees, primarily in corporate roles.

An October WARN filing revealed 416 job cuts at Aetna’s Hartford, Conn., headquarters and 632 layoffs at CVS’ corporate headquarters in Woonsocket, R.I.

In March, CVS announced plans for laying off an additional 183 employees in Wellesley, Mass.

CVS Health’s board of directors has retained bankers to evaluate a potential company split, aiming to enhance shareholder value and improve financial performance, according to the Journal. The board has engaged hedge fund investor Glenview Capital Management to explore strategic options.

However, a split may present challenges, according to the Journal. CVS has invested over $88 billion in acquisitions over the last six years to transition from a traditional retail pharmacy to a comprehensive healthcare provider. Analysts warn that dismantling the company could leave some divisions struggling independently, risking customer retention and revenue streams.

CVS is adjusting its retail strategy to address financial difficulties and industry challenges:

The company is rolling out a dozen new pharmacy-focused stores while reducing retail offerings in response to declining retail sales.

The company exited its Medicare shared savings program, selling the business to Wellvana in March 2025.

In October 2024, CVS discontinued its infusion services business.

Other retail pharmacies, including Walgreens and Walmart, have struggled due to competition from discount retailers and increased theft.

Nike, which has been led by company veteran Elliott Hill since October, has made several moves in recent months to turnaround the business, which was struggling under its previous leadership.

Baird senior research analyst Jonathan Komp expects Nike to reach third quarter estimates on Thursday and will maintain a cautious sales and margin outlook for Q4.

Watch on FN

“While we have been encouraged by the leadership transition, early signs of successful new product introductions (in running, healthier Jordan releases), and more impactful branding and marketing, we now are modeling fiscal 2026 more conservatively given potential reinvestments and broader macro uncertainties (including tariffs),” Komp wrote in a note to investors last week. “Still, we believe the stock can work as investors gain confidence in the turnaround progress and pathway to much higher multi-year earnings potential.”

Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser agreed, adding in his note to investors last week that Nike should “come in as guided” in Q3. “Nike will continue to provide 90-day guidance until visibility improves enough to provide long term guidance,” Poser wrote. “As orders for October are due this month, we would not be surprised if fiscal year 2026 guidance is provided when Q4 2025 earnings are reported in June.”

Poser added that he expects the upcoming third quarter, as well as Q4, the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and the first month of Q2 2026 to “remain challenging but sequentially become less bad.”

“During aforementioned periods, Nike will take goods back from its wholesale partners, continue to promote to liquidate goods that were oversaturated in the marketplace, or should never have been made, and begin reestablishing a pull model,” Poser noted. “Nike is working to pull orders forward in order to offer compelling new product, especially for women.”

These sentiments follow Hill’s recent meetings with top industry analysts last month.

The overall consensus is that Nike management is making the right moves but still has a long way to go before the beleaguered brand returns to its glory days.

“I’m absolutely thrilled about what’s possible and look forward to growing our cash flows and growing our businesses,” Auchincloss said.
“It became clear that the two priorities in all countries where we operate is affordable energy and reliable energy,” he said.
“In each and every nation, they’re talking about more oil and gas.
During the interview, Auchincloss noted the company’s investments to boost oil and gas production in the Gulf of America, and onshore through its bpx business.","Speaking on the main stage at CERAWeek, the world’s most influential global energy conference in Houston, bp chief executive officer Murray Auchincloss discussed the company’s recent strategy shift and its plans to grow value in the coming years.

In an interview with Dan Yergin, chairman of CERAWeek and vice chairman of S&P Global, Auchincloss explained the rationale for bp’s renewed focus on increasing oil and gas production, disciplined investments in the energy transition and driving efficiency across businesses globally. “I’m absolutely thrilled about what’s possible and look forward to growing our cash flows and growing our businesses,” Auchincloss said.

Auchincloss explained that a series of global changes since 2020 influenced bp’s strategy shift. “It became clear that the two priorities in all countries where we operate is affordable energy and reliable energy,” he said. “In each and every nation, they’re talking about more oil and gas. Yes, lower-carbon – but they need oil and gas. So that was the first thing we started to do, was strengthen the upstream portfolio, and we’ve taken great strides in that.”

Auchincloss noted that bp has “gone back to the Middle East with vigor,” including by reaching an agreement in February 2025 with the Iraqi government to invest in the rehabilitation and redevelopment of several giant oil fields in Kirkuk.

Auchincloss also pointed to bp’s significant investments in America. In fact, the company has about 30,000 employees in the US – more than anywhere else in the world. During the interview, Auchincloss noted the company’s investments to boost oil and gas production in the Gulf of America, and onshore through its bpx business. “We see great growth out of the United States,” Auchincloss said.

In discussing bp’s low-carbon energy plans, Auchincloss said the company is using a “capital-light approach” to growing value, including forming joint ventures to keep investments in those businesses off bp’s balance sheet. “You still get the electron flow for your trading business,” he said. “So we're happy, and it enables you to scale these businesses much faster than you otherwise would have inside a constrained environment of a company like bp.” Auchincloss also noted that bp is focusing its capital investments for biogas and electric vehicle charging in places where the returns can compete with upstream.

Answering a question about the challenges involved with carrying out bp’s new strategy, Auchincloss emphasized that process safety remains top of mind for the company. “We always have to keep an eye on that as we drive change and scale up construction,” he said. “That’s the number one thing.”",https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/country-sites/en_us/united-states/home/images/features/bp-ceo-explains-renewed-oil-and-gas-focus-at-CERAWeek/dan-and-murray.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 18:02:35.707378

The apparel company faces a lower bar this quarter as revenue growth and margins are taking a hit due to turnaround efforts. Lowballed earnings expectations are nothing new, but this doesn’t mean easy going for Nike stock this week.

NKE bulls see an earnings beat putting the stock back on a bullish trajectory, but the company’s management team has started a major restructuring likely to cause shareholder pain. This includes resetting inventories, which may be necessary for the company to get back on track toward revenue growth.

While I don’t expect a quick turnaround, catalysts are lacking. With Nike trading at a substantial premium and offering little margin of safety, I believe investing in Nike right now will likely be dead money for the next few quarters. Therefore, I’m adopting a bearish stance on NKE stock.

Nike Stock in Reset Mode

Nike’s latest Fiscal Q2 results, reported in December, were in line with expectations. While the market was pleased with the revenue and EPS beat, the company also signaled that it’s entering a reset phase for the coming quarters.

Nike has said that its growth story pivot will take longer than expected, and the turnaround will be more profound. Revenues for the next quarter are expected to be down in the low double digits, and the same trend should continue into Q4. This means we’ll likely see a longer timeline before top-line growth picks up again, especially since the company is in the middle of a franchise product lifecycle transition. On top of that, global macroeconomic conditions are making things even more challenging.

So, Nike is telling the market that things will likely worsen in the next couple of quarters before they get better—essentially lowering expectations. For FY2025, estimates show that Nike will report revenues of $46 billion and EPS of $2.09, reflecting a drop of 10.3% and 47%, respectively, compared to FY2024.

At the time, this wasn’t exactly breaking news, but what caught my attention was the outlook for FY2026. Since December last year, analysts have revised their top line expectations downward by 2.6%, now estimating revenues of $46.52 billion and a 10.2% downward revision for EPS, predicting an EPS of $2.33 for FY2026.

I expected a more bearish reaction after the Q2 earnings announcement and the softer guidance for the next few quarters. However, the stock only dropped by nearly 3.5% in the past three months. I believe the less severe drop is probably due to investors anticipating a positive shift under new CEO Elliot Hill. He’s already changing the executive ranks, focusing on better-managing inventory and distribution channels, and refocusing on Nike’s core brand identity and innovation.

NKE’s Inventory Woes Pressurize Global Brand

When supply overextends beyond demand, retail companies can face huge problems. This mismatch has been a major factor behind Nike’s growth struggles in recent years.

A lot of this comes down to structural changes. Nike used to be all about innovation and marketing, and with its size and scale, it had the resources to outspend everyone else. However, with the rise of e-commerce and other global brands going online, the barriers to entry have dropped. Now, size doesn’t give the same advantage it once did. For example, ten years ago, Nike was primarily competing with Adidas (ADDYY), and others were on the outside. It’s a different ballgame today, with brands like New Balance, Hoka, On (ONON), and many others gradually taking market share.

This shift has led to declining demand for Nike products over the past few years, forcing the company to deal with excess inventory. Since Q4 2023, Nike has reported flat-to-negative inventory growth. The company acknowledges that its inventory situation isn’t ideal, especially considering recent sales trends on Nike Direct. While Nike is working to clear the excess inventory, it’s clear that current levels are higher than they’d prefer.

This suggests a combination of issues—a lousy channel mix, weak sales, and possibly some underperforming products. But it also looks like Nike is trying to clear the decks for a more meaningful rebranding. However, this liquidation strategy has downsides. It involves markdowns and less profitable sales channels, which results in lower gross margins—evident in the latest quarter when margins fell by 100 basis points to 43.6%.

What to Expect from Nike’s Earnings Call Tomorrow

Nike is setting a lower bar for Q3, as analysts have significantly revised their revenue and EPS targets downward over the past three months. To beat market expectations, the company must report EPS of more than 30 cents—representing a 70% year-over-year drop—and revenues of $11.02 billion, reflecting an 11.3% year-over-year decline.

The market seems to already be bracing for a tough Q3, with Nike forecasting gross margins to fall by about 300 to 350 basis points as part of the effort to clean up and reset the marketplace. So, I don’t see any short-term catalysts that could surprise investors. However, in the long term, investors may look for signs during the earnings call that a new dynamic under fresh leadership could take shape over the next two or three years.

Limited Margin of Safety Amid Turnaround Challenges

Further bearish sentiment comes from NKE’s valuation. The apparel company is trading at 35x its forward earnings, a significant premium compared to the industry average of 15x. But even so, at its current price, I think there’s a small but existing margin of safety for Nike stock going forward.

If we take the 5-year revenue CAGR projected by analysts at 4.4% and assume that operating margins will level out to the 11.9% average of the past 20 quarters, Nike’s market cap would be around $113 billion, assuming a 7.5% discount rate for future cash flows and a 2.5% perpetuity growth rate. This would imply an implicit share price of $76, assuming that depreciation and amortization relative to capex and capex as a percentage of revenues remain in line with the past 12 months, with no changes in working capital.

While this is a speculative exercise, it shows that despite conservative growth estimates, there’s little protection against significant downside risk at the current price. And that’s something I don’t particularly like for a slow-growth company like Nike, which is currently in the middle of its turnaround.

Is Nike Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

On Wall Street, NKE stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buy, 13 Hold, and zero Sell ratings over the past three months. NKE’s average price target of $87.62 per share implies ~20% upside potential over the next twelve months.

One Step Back and Two Steps Forward

Nike is set to report better-than-expected Q4 earnings tomorrow but on lowered expectations. Despite beating the headlines, the stock may find upward mobility difficult. NKE’s management is ready to take a step backward and focus on taking two steps forward over the coming three years. Aside from small moves toward a different dynamic under new management, I don’t expect much to change for Nike this quarter. Nike’s turnaround will likely take time, and it’s unclear whether investors will be willing to wait. Given the company’s premium valuation, which doesn’t offer much of a margin of safety for those looking to invest in hopes of a quick turnaround, I’m sticking with a bearish outlook on the stock.

(Reuters) -General Mills cut its annual sales and profit forecasts on Wednesday, as the Pillsbury owner takes a hit from choppy demand for salty snacks and pet food in North America amid competition from private-label rivals.

Shares of the Cheerios maker was down around 3% in early trading.

Several packaged food companies – including Conagra Brands, Campbell's and Kraft Heinz – have flagged a tough demand backdrop as price-sensitive shoppers spent mindfully on branded snacks and cut back on frequent restaurant trips.

""Even if tariffs don't materialize and consumer confidence improves, those who have turned to private label or other lower-cost alternatives are not certain to return to national brands,"" he added.

The Minnesota-based company expects full-year organic sales to be down 1.5% to 2%, compared with a prior forecast of flat to up 1%.

It said the annual outlook did not include any impact from recent tariff actions by the Trump administration, as the implementation dates and scope of the levies remained uncertain.

Adjusted profit for the full year is now expected to decline in the range of 7% to 8%, compared with a prior forecast of down between 1% to 3%.

The Betty Crocker parent said it plans new initiatives targeting cost savings of at least $100 million in fiscal 2026.

It reported net sales of $4.84 billion for the quarter ended February 23, missing analysts' estimate of $4.96 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

General Mills said an ""unexpected"" inventory reduction by retailers in its retail and pet food segment hampered its quarterly sales.

Adjusted profit came in at $1 per share, above estimates of 96 cents per share.

Here's a look at analyst estimates for the quarter, what analysts are saying and key items to watch.

Earnings Estimates: Analysts expect Nike to report third-quarter revenue of $11.01 billion, down from $12.43 billion according to data from Benzinga Pro.

The company beat revenue estimates in the second quarter and has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in six of the last 10 quarters overall.

Analysts expect the company to report third-quarter earnings per share of 29 cents per share, down from 77 cents per share in last year's third quarter.

The company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in six straight quarters and nine of the last 10 quarters overall.

What Analysts Are Saying: Needham analyst Tom Nikic sees minimal near-term risk to Nike estimates.

While he maintained a Market Perform rating and sees a strong near-term outlook, caution is given for fiscal 2026.

""We've realized upon building out our FY26 quarterly estimates that it will be difficult for NKE to achieve our prior out-year estimates,"" Nikic said.

The analyst lowered the price target from $84 to $80. ""For 1H26, we expect another period of YoY decline in sales, margins, and EPS, followed by a return to growth in fiscal 2H26.""

Nike stock may have found a floor with the hope that new CEO Elliott Hill can ""right the ship,"" Nikic said, adding that the turnaround could take six months longer than originally thought.

Jefferies analyst Randal Konik upgraded Nike stock from Hold to Buy and called the company a ""new top pick"" last month.

The analyst put strong confidence in Hill and a turnaround strategy that could improve the company's wholesale business and key partnerships, along with new product innovation.

Konik raised the price target on Nike stock from $75 to $115. He said the current valuation of Nike's stock is the lowest its been in ten years, creating a potential ""valuation floor"" for shares.

“With shares near a valuation trough, we believe now is the right time to aggressively buy shares,” Konik said.

Key Items to Watch: Nike recently announced a new brand called NikeSKIMS developed in partnership with shapewear company SKIMS, which was co-founded by Kim Kardashian.

The company could comment on how quickly these products will launch and what initial reception has looked like for the collaboration.

Nike aired its first Super Bowl commercial in more than two decades earlier this year. The commercial focused on female athletes. This could be a key topic for areas of growth for Nike going forward.

China could also be a key topic during the earnings release and management commentary. Greater China sales were down around 8% year-over-year in the second quarter, tied for the worse performing geographic region with North America.

Analysts and investors will be looking to see if China sales recover.

Tariffs will also be a key topic centered on China and other markets with Nike importing goods made in countries at risk to see higher tariffs in the future. Management will likely provide initial comments on being prepared for the higher costs and likelihood of short-term pressure.

If commentary is worse and provides details on higher costs for consumers or pressure on profit margins, the stock could take a hit.

NKE Price Action: Nike stock is down 0.6% to $72.88 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $68.62 to $101.92. Nike stock is down 1.1% year-to-date in 2025, while shares have fallen over 27% in the last year.

The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index declined 7 points in February to 98.3, showing ""pessimism about the future returned"" last month.

Last month, Kraft Heinz (KHC) also posted a cautionary outlook. It expects organic net sales to come in flat to down 2.5% compared to the prior year.

Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera said on its recent earnings call that consumers are shopping at more stores to get the best price and purchasing less per trip.

Campbell's (CPB) also expects organic net sales to come in flat to a 2% decline in 2025. CEO Mick Beekhuizen said the guidance reflects ""the slower-than-anticipated recovery of our snacking categories, impacting the outlook for our second half.""

Here's what General Mills posted in its fiscal 2025 third quarter, compared to Bloomberg estimates:

Adjusted earnings per share: $1.00, versus $0.97

North America Retail: -1%, versus -0.88%

International: 0%, versus -3%

Pet: -1%, versus -2.64%

North American Food Service: +2%, versus +1.79%

Harmening said in the release that lower-than-expected revenue is ""driven largely by greater-than-expected retailer inventory headwinds and a slowdown in snacking categories.""

Consumers spent less on snack bars, fruit snacks, and salty snacks. The company plans to focus on value, pack sizes, and innovation to retain shoppers.

The company, owned by husband-and-wife team Aaron and Valerie Byrne, first operated a McDonald’s outlet in Galway’s Shop Street, along with two other outlets in Galway City.

The couple expanded the business at the end of 2020 by acquiring four McDonald’s restaurants in Limerick.

The directors’ report for 2023 noted that, despite the jump in revenue, increased costs contributed to pre-tax profits falling slightly, from €1.645 million to €1.635 million.

This is a moment to celebrate, but also an opportunity to look ahead to what’s next.”

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer was talking about amid tariff chaos.

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the market rebound on Friday, and said that there’s still uncertainty ahead as consumers remain worried about the impact of tariffs.

“Right now people are scared. We saw a shocking decline in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey this morning. People fear inflation and worry about their savings, which happens to be, in many cases, the stock market. They don’t know what tariffs mean and they haven’t had them explained to them in any satisfactory way, so they figure the tariffs are yet another thing that raises prices in the supermarket — and that’s probably true.

Cramer predicted that retail sales numbers next week will be “dismal” as consumers are worried about losing their jobs and are cutting back on spending.

Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY)

Number of Hedge Funds Investors: 37

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC said Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) results were better than expected but the stock fell because of the management’s comments saying the company will have to raise prices due to the potential impact of tariffs.

“The numbers out today were much better than expected—not better than expected, not better than feared, much better than expected. There was without a doubt a shock when you saw how good these were, because what it said is that Corie Barry and raised the div to, in this environment, is just doing incredibly well. And then there was this paragraph at the end of her talk where she said, of course, tariffs are coming, get a lot of stuff from China and Mexico, and we’re going to have to raise prices. We’re not sure how much we’re going to have to raise prices.”

Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) posted fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street’s forecasts, while its FY26 outlook came in line with expectations. However, shares fell amid consumer environment headwinds.

“As we enter FY26, we believe consumer behavior will be largely similar to last year – remaining resilient but still dealing with high inflation that is driving expenses up across their lives, making them value focused and thoughtful about big ticket purchases,” said Best Buy CFO Matt Bilunas during the earnings call.

Best Buy sees comparable sales growth to range from flat to up 2% for FY26, with most of the growth likely in the second half due to product launches and new initiatives. Comparable sales for Q1 are projected to dip slightly from FY25.

“We expect wholesale will improve ahead of DTC over the next several quarters as partners purchase holiday newness in advance,” BofA wrote.
Keeping the Nike brand clean at its retail partners is also top-of-mind, as evidenced by the reaction to increased promotional activity during the quarter.
Key Consumer Survey Citi Research released its quarterly Global Sporting Goods Survey last week to assess the overall market with a close eye on perceptions of the Nike and Jordan brands.
“Nike outranked Adidas (again) in terms of intent to purchase, however, Adidas continued to outrank Nike in terms of NPS.","Nike, Inc. announced plans to report its fiscal 2025 third-quarter results tomorrow, Thursday, March 20, after the market closes. The market will keep a close eye on the comments from management regarding the company’s progress on inventory reduction, the impact of Nike’s shift in clearance activity to factory stores from e-commerce, managing supply vs. demand in key lifestyle franchises, including AJ1, AF1 and Dunk, the pace of Nike’s product innovation, the potential for new branded products and the timing of same, and any retro products the company plans to make a comeback that could help re-energize Nike’s brand heat.

While those factors are central to the story around the turnaround process at Nike, driven by new CEO Elliott Hill, the broader macro factors in the marketplace will also be watched and discussed when assessing the path forward for the largest athletic footwear and sportswear company worldwide.

Based on notes from several analysts, the consensus is an expectation that Nike will report a sales decline in the low teens for the fiscal third quarter ended February 28.

Tariffs, for one, appear to be on everyone’s mind as the media runs with continuous stories regarding trade wars. Even in footwear, there have been weekly hair-on-fire articles and multiple interviews from industry trade associations about tariffs causing footwear sales to fall — even before any tariff went into effect.

Athletic footwear has not been impacted much by tariff issues with Canada or Mexico, and China is the only country with increasing tariffs. Footwear companies are downplaying that impact as production has been moved to other countries since the last tariff fight during Trump 1.0, which former President Biden continued.

For instance, Telsey Advisory Group (TAG) said in a recent investor note that it did not expect a significant direct impact ojn Nike from tariffs given that “the majority of Nike products manufactured in China (15 percent of total) serve the Chinese market, with only a small portion of those imported into the U.S.” TAG further said that Adidas and Under Armour noted that only 3 percent to 4 percent of the products made in China are sold in the U.S. market.

TAG sees the challenges elsewhere.

“Nike faced several challenges in 3QF25 including lower consumer demand for its products, resulting in lower traffic to Nike stores and website, declines in orders from its wholesale accounts, a reduction in units of three key lifestyle franchises, and higher promotions to clear inventory,” the firm wrote in its pre-earnings note.

Bank of America Global Research said in its pre-earnings note that it would “focus more on words than the numbers” in Nike’s March 20 conference call for the fiscal third quarter. The company also noted that management is moving quickly to reset the marketplace and clear aged inventory to allow a pipeline of newness to hit. BofA is maintaining its “Buy” rating as it believes Nike’s third-quarter results will matter less than its message about the product reset cycle and evidence that the company’s new product is resonating with retailers and consumers.

“We expect wholesale will improve ahead of DTC over the next several quarters as partners purchase holiday newness in advance,” BofA wrote.

BofA also said a lack of visibility on the product reset and consumer spending more broadly could cause management to wait another quarter to offer a fiscal 2026 outlook.

Margins are a concern in the near term, given the need for Nike to liquidate inventory. While the company continues to pull back promotions on its website, outlet stores will continue to see increased pressure.

Keeping the Nike brand clean at its retail partners is also top-of-mind, as evidenced by the reaction to increased promotional activity during the quarter.

BofA noted that one of the inventory actions now being used at Nike is buying back products from retail partners, an action that will lead to elevated inventory on the company’s balance sheet.

“We argue greater near-term margin pain actually improves the set-up for the stock, as this is a sign that Elliot Hill’s emphasis on taking swift action to make way for new product is working as planned,” the firm wrote.

Citibank Research asked participants in its February Global Sporting Goods Survey (see more below) if they have observed any changes in the level of promotions of athletic footwear and/or clothing compared to the last time they shopped in the category. In February, 42 percent of respondents said they see somewhat to significantly higher promotions, similar to the 42 percent of surveyed in December and 40 percent in September 2024.

Key Consumer Survey

Citi Research released its quarterly Global Sporting Goods Survey last week to assess the overall market with a close eye on perceptions of the Nike and Jordan brands. The company surveyed 1,600 North American consumers, 1,000 Chinese consumers and 900 European consumers in early to mid-February to gauge the momentum of many brands, both Western and Chinese, in North America, Greater China and Europe (UK, France and Germany).

North America Summary

In North America, Citi said the macro/promotional environment looks very similar to previous quarters, suggesting the overall athletic/active environment is still promotional but does not appear to be improving or degrading from past quarters. The firm pointed out that the survey timing was before most of the tariff and layoff talks increased in the media.

Citi said its February survey results indicated that Nike remains top-of-mind with the consumer, getting top ranks in Net Promoter Score (NPS) and intent to purchase. As expected, Nike was followed closely by Adidas in the No. 2 spot, moving up from the No. 4 in December. Despite the challenges facing Nike in North America, Citi said the brand is still perceived as the Most Innovative brand, followed by Adidas, which gained ground on Nike relative to its December survey.

Citi said brand perception is evaluated best with the Net Promoter Score (NPS) it established, which is the difference between respondents who would recommend a given brand to their friends and family and those who would not recommend a given brand to their friends and family. Citi noted that it only includes scores from survey participants who recently purchased from the brands. A positive NPS score means that more respondents would recommend a particular brand to their friends and family vs. respondents who would not recommend a brand to their friends and family.

The February survey saw Nike retaining the highest NPS of all the brands surveyed at +43 in February (vs. +46 in December), followed by Adidas in the No.2 spot (up from No. 4 spot in December) at +36 (vs. +39 in December) and New Balance at +34 (vs. +30 in December). Lululemon took the No. 4 spot (from the No. 7 spot in December) at +34 (vs. +25 in December). Hoka’s NPS was +24 in February, up from +17 in December. On Running’s NPS was +5 in February vs. +16 in December.

Intent to Purchase is another key indicator of brand strength and perception. Surveyed respondents, when asked which athletic brand they considered purchasing next, Nike again topped the list. Twenty-six percent of respondents in February said they planned to buy Nike, down slightly from 29 percent in December. Adidas was next at 18 percent (up from 12 percent in December), followed by New Balance at 9 percent (down slightly from 10 percent in December). Hoka was at 1 percent in February (down from 3 percent in December), and On was at 1 percent in February (in line with December), suggesting that most survey respondents still do not consider these growing brands as highly.

In Most Innovative. Nike again took the No. 1 spot at 25 percent, down from 28 percent in December, and is still “significantly above” Adidas in the No. 2 spot at 11 percent, followed by New Balance at 10 percent and Under Armour at 8 percent (vs. 9 percent in December). Adidas and New Balance were both flat to their December by respondents.

“On the earnings call, we don’t expect to hear a major revelation on product, but we will listen for early product wins, whether it’s in running with the Vomero 18 or Pegasus Premium, or basketball,” BofA wrote in its note. “Signs of product wins will be the singular most important catalyst to reengage investors on the stock, in our view.”

China Summary

In China, Citi said its survey results suggest the region remains very promotional, consistent with past quarters, and the macro environment appears stable relative to the firm’s December survey.

In the February survey, 55 percent of Chinese respondents said they expect their disposable income to get somewhat or significantly better over the next 12 months relative to today, which is down from the 72 percent that answered that way in December but higher than 45 percent that provided that response in the September survey.

“While Nike and Adidas ranked in the top spots in terms of NPS and intent to purchase, we saw both Anta and Li Ning regain ground, sitting in the No. 3 and No. 4 spots, respectively,” Citi wrote in its summary. “Nike outranked Adidas (again) in terms of intent to purchase, however, Adidas continued to outrank Nike in terms of NPS. Our survey results indicate the Jordan brand remains weak in China (similar to December).”

Europe Summary

In Europe, Nike retook the No.1 spot in Net Promoter Score, and Nike continued to score slightly better than Adidas in intent to purchase. Nike continued to rank the highest among European respondents as the brand was perceived as “Most Innovative.” Citi said Europe’s macro/promotional environment looks similar to last quarter.

Polaris doesn't break out Timbersled sales, but it wasn't likely significant compared to the company's overall $7.17 billion in 2024 total revenue.","Polaris Inc. (NYSE: PII) is ending production of its Timbersled — a kit that turns dirt bikes into one-person snowmobiles — after this year.

The Medina-based powersports manufacturer told dealers and customers earlier this month that it would stop selling Timbersled kits after this year and not release a 2026 lineup. Polaris will close a facility in Sandpoint, Idaho, where the kits were manufactured, cutting eight jobs.

Timbersled kits sold this year will receive a one-year warranty.

""This was a difficult decision. Timbersled is a great brand, and we are proud of the product advancements we have brought to the snow-bike market,"" Polaris said in a statement. ""Polaris has invested millions of dollars in product engineering, design, technology and efforts to bring the sport of snow biking to the next level of popularity. However, the market has struggled over the last several years, and we no longer see a long-term path for growth within this niche snow-bike-kit market.""

Polaris bought privately owned Timbersled Products Inc. in 2015. The smaller company was founded in 2001, making front- and rear-suspension systems for mountain snowmobiles. In 2010 it introduced a motorcycle conversion system that attaches a sled and track to an existing motorcycle frame.

Most kits sell for between $4,500 and $7,500 apiece.

Polaris doesn't break out Timbersled sales, but it wasn't likely significant compared to the company's overall $7.17 billion in 2024 total revenue. Even in 2015, Timbersled accounted for well less than 1% of total sales, Polaris said at the time, and the company has added several major business lines since then, like its Slingshot three-wheeler and a boating segment.

Discontinuing the Timbersled is one of several moves by Polaris to retrench during a pronounced slowdown in the powersports market. Polaris' sales were down 20% in 2024 compared to 2023 as higher interest rates, inflation and several years of poor winters hurt demand for some of its key products.

The prospect of higher U.S. tariffs on imported products is also raising concerns. Polaris imports some of its best-selling products from Mexico, and shifting manufacturing back to the United States won't be easy.

It's not just Polaris that is feeling the pinch, CEO Mike Speetzen said at an investors conference earlier this month. ""It's a bit staggering when you look at the number of competitors who are either exiting categories, shutting down completely, or have filed for bankruptcy and gone through that process.""

Textron Inc., the maker of Arctic Cat snowmobiles, said in December that it was ""pursuing strategic alternatives"" for the business and would shut down two Minnesota facilities, for example.

Polaris has also moved to lower expenses by $250 million, cutting its total workforce from 18,500 at the end of 2023 to 15,000 at the end of 2024, according to securities filings. Its salaried workforce fell from 5,500 to 5,000 over the same period.

Metinvest Group increased its revenues by 8.8% – to $8.050 billion in 2024, mainly due to an increase in exports of mining products, which was made possible by the operation of the sea corridor. This is stated in the Company’s report.

However, Metinvest reported a net loss of $1.15 billion last year, primarily due to a $1.31 billion impairment provision for Metinvest Pokrovskvugillia, which was suspended at the end of the year.

Metinvest’s mining segment’s revenue increased by 26% in 2024, while the steel segment’s revenue remained unchanged. The company’s revenues grew last year despite falling prices in 2024. In particular, hot-rolled coil prices on the global market fell by 9%, while the benchmark price of Fe62% iron ore in China decreased by 10%.

“What is important is that we have restored our operational efficiency. When the full-scale war broke out in 2022, we focused all our efforts on restoring our supply chains and business processes.

In total, Metinvest will repay $620 million of its debt in 2022-2024, which has increased the company’s resilience and demonstrates its ability to continue to service debt efficiently – net debt was only 10% higher than annual EBITDA (debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.1).

About $50 million of the company’s capital investments in 2024, or 21%, were allocated to the development of Metinvest Pokrovskvugillia. Metinvest Pokrovskvugillia’s operations are currently suspended due to the deteriorating security situation and developments at the frontline, as well as power outages.

He says S&P Global believes the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs are a significant risk to the economy and discussions of a potential national recession are increasing, while noting Delaware’s economy historically follows national trends.

He says national forecasts for wage and salary incomes are weakening, which correlate directly to how much revenue Delaware earns from personal income tax — it's single largest revenue source.

“There is a weaker forecast for wage and salary income in the future, down almost a percentage point, so that does result in a $20 million reduction in the recommended estimate for fiscal 26 — growth slowing to 4.5%.”

On top of slowed personal income tax growth, the state is expected to pay $60 million more in personal income tax refunds over the next two years.

Roose adds the state is also awaiting the president’s solidified tax policy, which could affect Delaware’s general fund by anywhere from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.

The state remains on track to spend just under $7 billion this fiscal year — 12.2% more than last fiscal year — largely due to salary increases, rising healthcare costs and Medicaid spend and capital cash projects.

DEFAC is projecting the state will spend 3.1% more in fiscal year 26 at an estimated $7.2 billion.

As of now, Medicaid expenditures are only projected to increase by $19 million next fiscal year, bringing the program to $1.15 billion.

But Delaware Department of Health and Social Services Secretary Josette Manning says that number is likely to change if the Trump administration follows through with federal Medicaid cuts.

""We don't know what to expect yet — it's difficult to plan when you don't know what to expect. We have estimated the impacts of the menu of options that could be selected, but until we know what things are selected, there's really not a lot for us to do at this point, expect for monitor and obviously plan in a fiscally conservative way, recognizing that we may have some of these impacts and some very difficult policy and financial decisions to make,"" Manning said.

The 1.7% Medicaid expenditure growth is significantly less than the current year's growth of 8.3% — an $87.1 million increase.

But due to the Medicaid ""unwinding"" process, where states began returning back to regular Medicaid operations following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, Medicaid eligibles and Medicaid newly eligibles have both decreased by around 10% in Delaware compared to this time last year.

State leaders continue to look at budget cuts and the high likelihood of dipping into the state's $470 million Budget Stabilization Fund in fiscal year 27 and 28.

Gov. Matt Meyer is expected to propose his recommended budget in the coming weeks.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/76a8ebc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/650x341+0+29/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwdde%2Ffiles%2F202006%2FDEFAC.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 12:06:40.141662

Australia's trade minister Don Farrell revealed Americans could possibly see a rise in the cost of Big Macs due to new tax levies.
'We should be making more free trade, more fair trade, rather than less trade,' the trade administrator said.

Australia's trade minister Don Farrell revealed Americans could possibly see a rise in the cost of Big Macs due to new tax levies.

The news comes after US government officials hinted at imposing tariffs on Australian lamb and beef.

These tariffs could potentially devastate the farming industry, which accounts for over $5 billion in exports.

'The significance, of course, to the US about our beef exports is that most of it goes into McDonald's hamburgers,' the traded minister recently told Sky News.

'If you push up the price of those beef exports by 25% or 10% or whatever the figure is, then you simply push up the price of hamburgers in the United States. It doesn't make sense.'

Farrell continued by saying he doesn't know what to expect from Donald Trump's administration and suspects the American government doesn't know what to do.

Trump ignited the tariff discussion during his presidential campaign last year and called it 'the most beautiful word in the dictionary' in October 2024.

He later announced plans to add 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10 percent tariff on goods from China a month later.

The tariffs in Canada, China, and Mexico took effect on March 4 but were later paused on Canadian and Mexican goods affiliated with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA - a free trade agreement.

Building materials shipped to the US from those areas have risen due to the levies.

With this increase, the cost of single-family home construction in the US would go from $7,500 to $10,000, according to the National Association of Home Builders.

Farrell has shown strong opposition to the levies and has called the tariff imposition 'the wrong policy to adopt.'

'We should be making more free trade, more fair trade, rather than less trade,' the trade administrator said.

'And, of course, one of the things that we've done in government is diversity our trading relationship.'

McDonald's restaurants have been significantly raising its menu items' costs before the escalation of Trump's trade wars.

There had been news circulating social media that the costs of Big Macs rose by 100 percent compared to its 2019 prices last year.

Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, confirmed this to be false, and mentioned the correct percentage growth.

'The average price of a Big Mac in the US was $4.39 in 2019,' Erlinger wrote in a May 2024 letter.

'Despite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That's an increase of 21% (not 100%).'

The president confirmed in the same letter that all the restaurant chain's menu had a 40 percent increase 'over the past five years.'

McDonald's also raised prices for Egg McMuffins and hashbrowns, which were factors in a 7 percent profit increase in early 2024.

The company is continuing to work on drawing in customers and boosting profits after finishing off 2024 with over $130 billion in global systemwide sales.

'Accelerating the Arches continues to be the right strategy as we focus on growing market share,' Chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an earnings report published on February 10.

'We're playing to win, focusing on our customers with outstanding value, exciting menu innovation and culturally relevant marketing.'

It's also managed to stay on top of running its new McValue platform, which features its $5 Meal Deal offering.

McDonald's is expected to release its next earnings report on April 29.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/18/18/96324437-0-image-m-26_1742322098548.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 19:02:22.096379

“We argue Q3 results will matter less than the message about the product reset cycle and evidence new product is resonating,” analysts wrote in a note to clients.

“Management is moving quickly to reset the marketplace and clear aged inventory to allow a pipeline of new product to hit the market.”

While they do not expect to hear a “major revelation” on product during Nike’s earnings call, the analysts write they would be listening for early product wins, for example in running with the Vomero 18 or Pegasus Premium.

“Signs of product wins will be the singular most important catalyst to reengage investors on the stock, in our view,” they wrote.

For the third quarter, Bank of America expects Nike to report earnings per share of $0.22, below the Wall Street consensus of $0.28.

Nike’s margins could be at risk in the near-term as management remains committed to reducing lifestyle inventory, they added.

“One of the inventory actions is buying back product from retail partners; this will lead to elevated inventory on balance sheet,” they wrote.

“We argue greater near-term margin pain actually improves the set-up for the stock, as this is a sign that [new CEO] Elliot Hill's emphasis on taking swift action to make way for new product is working as planned.”

Management will likely stick with quarterly guidance, they added.

“A lack of visibility on the product reset and consumer spending more broadly could cause management to wait another quarter to offer a fiscal 2026 outlook,” they wrote.

“We think management may provide some context for the expected fiscal 2026 margin recovery, but we would be surprised if explicit fiscal 2026 earnings guidance is communicated.”

The analysts awarded Nike a ‘Buy’ rating and $90 price target. Shares traded hands at about $73 shortly before Tuesday’s closing bell.

FDX has a mixed earnings surprise history, as reflected in the chart below.

FedEx Price and EPS Surprise

FedEx Corporation price-eps-surprise | FedEx Corporation Quote

Demand Erosion Likely to Dent FDX’s Q3 Results

FDX continues to struggle due to the normalization of volume and pricing trends in the post-COVID scenario. Geopolitical uncertainty and higher inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment and growth expectations, particularly in Asia and Europe. The resultant weakness in package volumes is likely to have hurt FedEx's revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.

The performance of the Express unit, FDX's largest segment, is likely to have been hurt due to demand-induced volume weakness. We anticipate revenues from the Express unit to inch up 0.6% from third-quarter fiscal 2024 actual.

Cost Cuts to Aid FDX’s Results

Given the post-COVID adjustments in business, FedEx is realigning its costs under a companywide initiative called DRIVE. FDX’s cost-cutting efforts are likely to have aided its bottom-line performance in the quarter under discussion.

These cost-reduction initiatives include reducing flight frequencies, parking aircraft and cutting staff. We are impressed by FDX's efforts to control costs in the face of persistent revenue weakness. We anticipate expenses from salaries and benefits in third-quarter fiscal 2025 to decrease 0.8% from third-quarter fiscal 2024 actual. Adjusted operating expenses in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to inch down 0.1% from year-ago actuals.

Q3 Earnings Whispers for FDX

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FDX this time. A company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has a higher chance of beating estimates, which is not the case here.

NKE stock has declined 26% over the past year as investors are disappointed with the company’s weak sales and loss of market share to rivals due to the lack of innovation. Analysts expect Nike to report Q3 FY25 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.30, reflecting a 69% year-over-year decline due to multiple challenges.

Nike Under Pressure

Nike’s Q3 FY25 bottom line is expected to be impacted by an 11.3% decline in revenue to $11.02 billion and margin compression. The Q3 revenue is expected to fall due to subdued discretionary spending amid macro pressures, intense competition, and the short-term impact of the company’s turnaround efforts, including liquidation of excess inventory through less profitable channels.

Nike is aggressively pursuing several turnaround initiatives under the leadership of CEO Elliott Hill. The company’s business took a hit due to a lack of newness in its offerings and too much reliance on promotions to drive sales. Nike also realized its mistake of drifting too far away from wholesale partners and has been implementing measures to rebuild its relationship with them.

During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, management cautioned that the company’s Q3 revenue is expected to decline by low double digits, reflecting the near-term impact of strategic initiatives.

Analysts’ Views Ahead of Nike’s Q3 Earnings

Heading into the Q3 results, Morgan Stanley analyst Alexandra Straton lowered the price target for Nike stock to $72 from $74 and reiterated a Hold rating. The analyst sees the possibility for Q3 EPS upside and expects Q4 EPS guidance to be in line with or above the Street’s estimates. However, Straton cautioned that there is a risk to FY26 numbers and noted NKE stock’s “still-high valuation.”

Meanwhile, UBS analyst Jay Sole reiterated a Hold rating on NKE stock with a price target of $73. Sole said that UBS’ channel checks indicated that Nike’s global sales growth trends “deteriorated” over the last three months. The four-star analyst expects Nike to deliver in-line Q3 earnings and give an implied Q4 EPS outlook in the range of $0.22 to $0.34.

However, Sole sees a risk that Nike’s FY26 commentary could be meaningfully below expectations, causing market sentiment to worsen.

Options Traders Anticipate Major Move on Nike’s Q3 Earnings

Using TipRanks’ Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report. The expected earnings move is determined by calculating the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to expiration after the earnings announcement. If this sounds complicated, don’t worry, the Options tool does this for you.

Indeed, it currently says that options traders are expecting about 8.6% move in either direction in reaction to NKE’s Q3 FY25 results.

Is Nike a Good Stock to Buy?

Given the ongoing challenges, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Nike stock based on 16 Buys and 12 Hold recommendations. The average NKE stock price target of $87.62 implies about 19% upside potential from current levels.

FDX has a mixed earnings surprise history, as reflected in the chart below.

FedEx Price and EPS Surprise

FedEx Corporation price-eps-surprise | FedEx Corporation Quote

Demand Erosion Likely to Dent FDX’s Q3 Results

FDX continues to struggle due to the normalization of volume and pricing trends in the post-COVID scenario. Geopolitical uncertainty and higher inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment and growth expectations, particularly in Asia and Europe. The resultant weakness in package volumes is likely to have hurt FedEx's revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.

The performance of the Express unit, FDX's largest segment, is likely to have been hurt due to demand-induced volume weakness. We anticipate revenues from the Express unit to inch up 0.6% from third-quarter fiscal 2024 actual.

Cost Cuts to Aid FDX’s Results

Given the post-COVID adjustments in business, FedEx is realigning its costs under a companywide initiative called DRIVE. FDX’s cost-cutting efforts are likely to have aided its bottom-line performance in the quarter under discussion.

These cost-reduction initiatives include reducing flight frequencies, parking aircraft and cutting staff. We are impressed by FDX's efforts to control costs in the face of persistent revenue weakness. We anticipate expenses from salaries and benefits in third-quarter fiscal 2025 to decrease 0.8% from third-quarter fiscal 2024 actual. Adjusted operating expenses in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to inch down 0.1% from year-ago actuals.

Q3 Earnings Whispers for FDX

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FDX this time. A company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has a higher chance of beating estimates, which is not the case here.

Wheaton Precious’ Q4 Revenues Reflect Higher Prices

Wheaton Precious generated record revenues of around $381 million in the quarter, which rose 21.4% on a year-over-year basis. A 32% gain from the higher average realized gold equivalent price was offset by an 8% decline in gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) sold in the quarter. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $374 million.

Gold sales contributed around 62% to the quarter’s revenues. Silver contributed 35% to the company’s revenues, palladium accounted for 1% and cobalt contributed 2%.

In fourth-quarter 2024, the average realized gold price was $2,677 per ounce. The figure was 33.4% higher than the year-ago quarter. Silver prices were $31.28 per ounce, up 31.6% year over year. Palladium prices were $1,008 per ounce, down 6% from the prior-year quarter. Cobalt prices rose 6% year over year to $13.66 per pound.

WPM’s Gold Equivalent Production Rises, Sales Drop in Q4

Gold production in the fourth quarter was 117,526 ounces, a 4.1% increase year over year. The figure beat our gold production projection of 94,061 ounces for the quarter.Silver production rose 36.5% year over year to 5,740 thousand ounces, which came in higher than our estimate of 5,084 thousand ounces.

Attributable gold equivalent production in the quarter was 187,493 ounces, up 13.8% from the prior-year quarter’s output of 164,796 ounces. Our projection was 155,248 ounces. The outperformance was due to higher production from Salobo and Peñasquito.

The company sold 142,561 GEOs in the quarter, down 8% year over year.

WPM’s Margins Rise Y/Y in Q4

The total cost of sales was down 5.2% year over year to around $64.2 million in the fourth quarter. The gross profit was up 39.6% to $247 million. The gross margin was 65% in the reported quarter compared with 56.5% in the prior-year quarter.

General and administrative expenses increased 13% year over year to $10.5 million. Earnings from operations were $117.6 million, a 26.1% decrease from $159 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. This included the impact of the impairment charge of around $109 million.

Average cash costs in the fourth quarter of 2024 were $441 per GEO, up from $437 in the year-ago quarter. The cash operating margin increased 41% year over year to $2,228 per GEO sold due to a higher realized price per ounce.

Wheaton Precious’ Balance Sheet Updates

Wheaton Precious had around $818 million of cash in hand at the end of 2024 compared with $547 million at the end of 2023. The company reported an operating cash flow of $1.03 billion in 2024 compared with $0.75 billion in 2023.

WPM had a debt-free balance sheet as of Sept. 30, 2024. The company has a $2-billion undrawn revolving credit facility.

WPM’s Performance in 2024

Wheaton Precious reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 in 2024, marking a 20% year-over-year increase. The bottom line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45.

Including one-time items, WPM reported earnings per share of $1.17 compared with $1.19 in 2023.

Wheaton Precious generated revenues of around $1.28 billion in the quarter, which rose 26.4% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year increase was attributed to higher average realized gold equivalent price and increased gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) sold during the year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 billion.

Attributable gold equivalent production was 635,000 GEOs for the full year of 2024.

WPM’s 2025 Outlook

Gold production is expected to be in the band of 350,000-390,000 ounces. Silver production is projected between 20.5 million and 22.5 million ounces. The production of other metals is anticipated to be in the band of 12,500-13,500 GEOs.

Wheaton Precious projects an attributable production of 600,000-670,000 GEOs. The midpoint of the range suggests a 10% year-over-year increase in production. This factors in higher attributable production from Antamina, the start-up of several development projects (Blackwater, Goose, Mineral Park and Platreef) and a stable forecast for Salobo production. However, this will be somewhat offset by lower production from Peñasquito and Constancia.

The company has targeted 870,000 GEOs in 2029.

Analysts’ Views Ahead of FDX’s Q3 Earnings

Ahead of FedEx’s Fiscal Q3 earnings, Citi analyst Ariel Rosa lowered the price target on the stock to $317 from $347, while reiterating a Buy rating.

Rosa notes growing investor concerns over tariffs, weaker consumer demand, and a slowdown in industrial activity. He notes that market sentiment appears overly negative, with many expecting FedEx to lower its full-year F2025 earnings outlook again.

However, the analyst remains optimistic about the company’s long-term outlook, pointing to strong cost-control efforts that could lead to better-than-expected Q3 results. Also, Rosa sees the current valuation as attractive and believes FedEx has room to surprise investors positively.

Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst David Vernon cut his price target on FedEx to $282 from $320, keeping a Neutral rating. The analyst sees value in the stock at the current levels, but expects global trade uncertainty and integration challenges to pressure earnings, projecting 2026 profits 10% below consensus.

However, sustaining this momentum will depend on factors such as fiscal adjustments and inflation control. The industry’s outlook was presented by Eletros President Jorge Nascimento after a meeting with President Lula and key ministers in Brasília.

According to Mr. Nascimento, the sector saw R$5 billion in investments last year. Despite high interest rates and inflationary pressures, he projected that the same investment level could be maintained over the next two years, provided the macroeconomic environment remains favorable. In an optimistic scenario, the industry could grow between 8% and 10%, while a more conservative estimate places growth at 5%.

“Our conversation with [Finance Minister Fernando] Haddad focused on the importance of maintaining a prosperous economic environment,” Mr. Nascimento told reporters, speaking alongside Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, who also attended the meeting. “We’re talking about fiscal adjustments, inflation control, and benchmark interest rates. If these issues are managed as carefully as they were in the first half of last year, we expect to at least match 2024’s results.”

Another factor that contributed to the sector’s expansion last year was the weather, according to industry representatives. “Rising temperatures drove consumers to seek comfort and well-being, leading to increased purchases of air conditioners, fans, and white goods such as refrigerators, water filters, and coolers.”

Among electronics, air conditioners saw the highest growth, with a 38% increase in sales. Mr. Alckmin—who is also minister of development, industry, trade, and services—noted that Brazil has become the world’s second-largest air conditioner producer, surpassing its previous fifth-place ranking and trailing only China. In 2024, the country manufactured 6 million units.

Sales of stoves, refrigerators, and washing machines—classified as white goods—grew 17%, while television sales rose 22%. Fan sales increased by 33%, and overall appliance sales, including brown goods, climbed 29%. In total, the sector delivered 117 million units last year.

ArcelorMittal, a global steel behemoth reaping immense profits from Liberia’s rich mineral resources, is facing a growing storm of criticism over the shockingly poor living conditions endured by its workers and contractors. Reports and on-the-ground investigations reveal that many employees at the company’s sprawling mining sites are forced to reside in inadequate, makeshift shipping containers – a stark and unacceptable reality that casts a dark shadow over the company’s financial success.

This situation exposes a deeply troubling failure in labor rights enforcement and corporate accountability within Liberia. The central, unavoidable question is this: How can a company that generates millions of dollars from Liberia’s wealth fail to provide its workforce with even the most basic humane living conditions? It’s a question that demands urgent answers, not only from ArcelorMittal itself, but also from the Liberian government and the regulatory bodies tasked with protecting workers’ rights.

During a recent fact-finding visit to ArcelorMittal’s operational areas in Liberia, journalists and observers witnessed firsthand the deplorable state of these container homes. These cramped, uncomfortable metal boxes, often baking in the Liberian heat, lack essential amenities such as proper ventilation, sanitation, and adequate space for rest and privacy. Workers, some of whom have dedicated years of service to the company, voiced their deep frustration and disillusionment over unfulfilled promises of better housing and improved welfare conditions.

“The labor sector in this country is very weak,” lamented one contractor, encapsulating the pervasive feeling of helplessness. “They [authorities and companies] do not care about the well-being of ordinary workers. We are treated like machines, not human beings.”

This is not simply a case of corporate negligence; it is indicative of a systemic failure within Liberia’s extractive industry. Liberia’s abundant natural resources should be a source of prosperity and development for its people, particularly for those who toil tirelessly to extract those resources. Yet, instead of receiving fair wages, safe working conditions, and decent housing, these workers are relegated to substandard living conditions while company executives and a select few enjoy the lucrative financial windfalls generated by their labor.

Equally concerning is the apparent silence and inaction of the Liberian government on this critical issue. Labor laws exist on the books, designed to protect workers from exploitation and ensure their basic rights are upheld. However, their enforcement remains woefully inadequate, as evidenced by the fact that multinational corporations like ArcelorMittal continue to operate with seeming impunity, failing to be held accountable for the well-being of their workforce.

Residents in affected areas, including Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties, where ArcelorMittal’s operations are concentrated, have increasingly raised their voices in protest and condemnation. They accuse the company of neglecting its fundamental social responsibilities to the communities in which it operates, prioritizing profit maximization above the needs and rights of the people.

Community leaders have further alleged that while ArcelorMittal sometimes funds certain local development projects, these initiatives often fall short of addressing the immediate and pressing concerns of the workforce and the broader affected communities. Critics argue that these efforts are often a smokescreen, designed to deflect criticism and maintain a positive public image, while the core issues of worker exploitation and poor living conditions remain unaddressed.

“Our investigation has uncovered evidence that the company only provides financial incentives and favors to a select few individuals who are willing to advocate on its behalf, rather than addressing the broader, more systemic concerns of the workers and the affected communities,” a local activist alleged, highlighting the company’s alleged tactics to silence dissent and maintain control.

This pattern of exploitation is a familiar one in Liberia’s extractive industry, where large multinational companies often reap massive profits while workers and host communities bear the brunt of the social and environmental costs. But this reality is not inevitable. It doesn’t have to be this way.

Civil society groups, labor advocates, and human rights organizations are now calling for urgent and decisive intervention, demanding that the Liberian government take a firm and unwavering stance against worker exploitation and hold companies like ArcelorMittal accountable for their actions. They are calling for independent investigations, stricter enforcement of labor laws, and greater transparency in the operations of extractive industries.

As the investigation into this matter continues, the critical question remains: Will ArcelorMittal and the Liberian authorities finally step up to ensure justice and dignity for these workers, or will they allow this blatant exploitation to persist unchecked? The answer to this question will determine whether Liberia’s vast natural wealth is truly being harnessed for the benefit of its people, or whether it will continue to serve primarily to enrich a privileged few, leaving the majority of Liberians behind.

ArcelorMittal has announced the closure of its steel plant near Avellino, Italy, effective July 31, according to a report by Kallanish. The decision aligns with a broader contraction in the European steel industry, accessible in full here. The facility, which employs 70 workers, focuses on turning flat galvanized steel into pre-painted products for the construction and household appliance sectors.

The company cited a range of challenges, both specific to the plant's geography and part of a larger European market crisis, as pivotal in the closure decision. Despite efforts to maintain operations, the extent of these issues, coupled with sustained financial losses, rendered closure unavoidable. ArcelorMittal has committed to collaborating with trade unions to support affected employees, facilitating their transition following the plant closure.

The closure is part of ArcelorMittal's broader regional strategy, which includes a maintenance initiative exceeding EUR270 million. This program involves suspending operations at the company's French plants in Dunkirk and FOS-sur-Mer for several months, including halting the main blast furnace in Dunkirk as of April 15. Modernization work on blast furnace No. 1 in Fos-sur-Mer is set to commence by the close of the first quarter.

According to data from IndexBox, ArcelorMittal's European steel production saw an 8.3% rise in 2024, amounting to 31.2 million tons compared to the previous year. Production from blast furnaces surged by 10.8% year-on-year to 25.7 million tons, while output from electric arc furnaces slightly declined by 1.8% to 5.5 million tons.

But financial pressures could drive them to depart the sector as quickly as they arrived.

Rising medical expenses, unfavorable changes to federal policies and declining federal reimbursement dogged the Medicare Advantage industry in 2024, leading companies such as CVS Health’s Aetna and Humana to cut back where they sold policies. In some areas, Blue Cross plans were the only option left for consumers.

Related: Medicare Advantage enrollment 2025: Winners and losers

In this anticompetitive market, Blue Cross licensees such as Elevance Health, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Excellus Health shined. Cigna also gained members. This month, the company intends to close its $3.3 billion Medicare Advantage sale to Health Care Service Corp., which manages Blue Cross plans in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.

“In a high-cost environment, you would think you would not want to be growing severely over what the market is growing,” said Ryan Langston, director and senior analyst of healthcare research at investment bank TD Securities.

Elevance Health, for instance, added 35,000 more Medicare Advantage enrollees than targeted during the annual enrollment period. The for-profit company, which manages Blue Cross plans in 14 states, did not respond to an interview request.

The company continues to suppress marketing by refusing to pay brokers commissions for selling some Medicare Advantage policies, Chief Financial Officer Mark Kaye told investors at the Barclays 27th Annual Global Healthcare Conference on March 11. This month, Elevance also lost a state contract that will reduce its enrollment by 30,000, Kaye said. The insurer wants to end the year with no more than 2.25 million members.

“We feel good about our position in Medicare having seen a couple of months of results,” Kaye said.

Elevance reported Medicare Advantage costs and utilization were within its projections in 2024, a noteworthy contrast to what rivals such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Regence BlueCross BlueShield disclosed about unanticipated increases that dinged their finances.

Blue Cross of Michigan, for instance, reported an operating loss of $1.7 billion last year compared with $100 million in operating income in 2023. The nonprofit insurer anticipates member medical costs will outpace premium revenue by $432 million in 2025.

To constrain expenses, the company prioritized investments in its traditional Medicare Advantage plans over those designed for individuals dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, said Krischa Winright, president of Medicare Advantage. Still, national competitors exiting rural counties and adding deductibles to medical and pharmacy benefits drove growth at Blue Cross of Michigan toward the high end of expectations, she said.

“The special needs plan market is continuing to expand. But we have not put our emphasis on growing that population in 2025 simply because we were doubling down on our being able to serve the traditional Medicare Advantage market during this time of volatility,” Winright said.

Blue Cross of Michigan's strategy is just the opposite of how most insurers have approached Medicare Advantage this year.

Rather than making cutbacks, many companies are following the money, expanding where they sell Dual Special Needs Plan policies and maintaining generous supplemental benefits. D-SNPs generate an average pre-tax margin of 7.5%, compared with traditional Medicare Advantage margins of 3.6%, according to a June 2024 report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. The group makes policy recommendations to Congress.

At VNS Health Health Plans, inking agreements with providers that serve a specific ethnicity, employing a multilingual sales team and marketing at community events and food pantries drove D-SNP sign-ups higher than expected, said David Robinson, vice president of sales and partnership development. The nonprofit insurer aims to nearly double its D-SNP membership to 40,000 by 2027, he said.

“Adverse selection is not a concern. It's something I’m cognizant of, but it's not something that I'm overly concerned with because we built these products to be utilized,” Robinson said, referring to the possibility of adding too many members that need costly medical treatments.

However, not all Blue Cross insurers posted big enrollment growth.

Regence cut non-medical supplemental benefits and stopped selling policies in rural counties after larger rivals exited the market, said William Krenz, senior vice president of government programs. The strategy resulted in enrollment losses consistent with expectations, Krenz said. The company sells Medicare Advantage plans in Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washington.

In 2024, the nonprofit insurer reported a 33.4% year-over-year drop in net income to $86.9 million, according to a Modern Healthcare analysis of financial statements obtained from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Revenue rose 8.9% to $7.8 billion. Regence's insurance subsidiaries reported an average operating loss of 1.3%.

The company is watching how Medicare Advantage membership grows during open enrollment, which ends on March 31.

“We have no desire to grow dramatically,” Krenz said. “There are probably some specific places we can and will, but we also want to be cautious because I'm expecting another fairly challenging year.”",https://s3-prod.modernhealthcare.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/Blue-Cross-MA-0325.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 08:55:50.165948

Trump sparked a global trade war in February when he announced that steel and aluminum imports into the United States would be subject to a 25% surcharge.

The punishing tariffs, which took effect on Wednesday, have caused an economic turmoil, sending stock markets tumbling as world leaders weigh how to respond to the levies.

But despite concerns over the economy, Trump has maintained his stance that reciprocal tariffs will be implemented on foreign nations on April 2.

Don Farrell, Australia's trade minister, warned that levies on any of the country's agricultural products could affect the cost of McDonald's Big Mac's and other cheeseburgers in the United States.

Farrell said that most of Australia's beef exports are sent to the fast food giant.

""The significance, of course, to the US about our beef exports is that most of it goes into McDonald's hamburgers,"" the trade minister told Sky News.

""If you push up the price of those beef exports by 25% or 10% or whatever the figure is, then you simply push up the price of hamburgers in the United States. It doesn't make sense.""

Farrell said that he would seek to convince his US counterparts of moving against implementing tariffs on Australian goods.

""I wish I would tell you exactly what the American government is finally going to do,"" Farrell added.

""To be honest with you, I suspect they don't even know themselves.""

""Part of my job is to continue to put the arguments to the Americans that in fact this is the wrong policy to adopt.

""We should actually be doing the opposite. We should be making more free trade, more fair trade, rather than less trade.

""And, of course, one of the things that we've done in government is diversity our trading relationship.""

Farrell said Australia would not consider retaliatory tariffs against the United States.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese slammed the tariffs on his country, saying Americans will be the ones paying for the imposed levies.

""Tariffs are a tax on the American buyers of products from right around the world, regardless of where it's coming from, on steel and aluminium,"" Albanese told the outlet.

""There are these tariffs, which are a tax on Americans.

""They're not a tax on the producer, they're a tax on Americans, which is why we have seen the markets respond in the way that they have, in a very negative way, to these moves by the Trump administration.""

'LIBERATION DAY'

Meanwhile, Trump has declared his planned April 2 tariff implementation date as ""liberation day.""

""April 2 is a liberating day for our country,"" he told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.

""We're getting back to some of the wealth that very, very foolish presidents gave away because they had no clue what they were doing.""

Trump warned that friend and foe nations are in the crossfire of his tariffs threats.

""It's a liberation day for our country because we're going to be getting back a lot of the wealth that we so foolishly gave up to other countries, including friend and foe,"" he added.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/JL_TRUMP-MCD-OP.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-18 09:53:48.668651

NKE stock has declined 26% over the past year as investors are disappointed with the company’s weak sales and loss of market share to rivals due to the lack of innovation. Analysts expect Nike to report Q3 FY25 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.30, reflecting a 69% year-over-year decline due to multiple challenges.

Nike Under Pressure

Nike’s Q3 FY25 bottom line is expected to be impacted by an 11.3% decline in revenue to $11.02 billion and margin compression. The Q3 revenue is expected to fall due to subdued discretionary spending amid macro pressures, intense competition, and the short-term impact of the company’s turnaround efforts, including liquidation of excess inventory through less profitable channels.

Nike is aggressively pursuing several turnaround initiatives under the leadership of CEO Elliott Hill. The company’s business took a hit due to a lack of newness in its offerings and too much reliance on promotions to drive sales. Nike also realized its mistake of drifting too far away from wholesale partners and has been implementing measures to rebuild its relationship with them.

During the Q2 FY25 earnings call, management cautioned that the company’s Q3 revenue is expected to decline by low double digits, reflecting the near-term impact of strategic initiatives.

Analysts’ Views Ahead of Nike’s Q3 Earnings

Heading into the Q3 results, Morgan Stanley analyst Alexandra Straton lowered the price target for Nike stock to $72 from $74 and reiterated a Hold rating. The analyst sees the possibility for Q3 EPS upside and expects Q4 EPS guidance to be in line with or above the Street’s estimates. However, Straton cautioned that there is a risk to FY26 numbers and noted NKE stock’s “still-high valuation.”

Meanwhile, UBS analyst Jay Sole reiterated a Hold rating on NKE stock with a price target of $73. Sole said that UBS’ channel checks indicated that Nike’s global sales growth trends “deteriorated” over the last three months. The four-star analyst expects Nike to deliver in-line Q3 earnings and give an implied Q4 EPS outlook in the range of $0.22 to $0.34.

However, Sole sees a risk that Nike’s FY26 commentary could be meaningfully below expectations, causing market sentiment to worsen.

Options Traders Anticipate Major Move on Nike’s Q3 Earnings

Using TipRanks’ Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report. The expected earnings move is determined by calculating the at-the-money straddle of the options closest to expiration after the earnings announcement. If this sounds complicated, don’t worry, the Options tool does this for you.

Indeed, it currently says that options traders are expecting about 8.6% move in either direction in reaction to NKE’s Q3 FY25 results.

Is Nike a Good Stock to Buy?

Given the ongoing challenges, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Nike stock based on 16 Buys and 12 Hold recommendations. The average NKE stock price target of $87.62 implies about 19% upside potential from current levels.

But retail experts told Daily Mail that the iconic Canadian brand was in trouble before President Trump reclaimed the White House.
Across most of its stores, Hudson’s Bay has provided the shopper with a sub-par experience and this has created a situation in which traffic and spend has declined.
The company, which has ties back to 17th-century fur trades, has been a mainstay in Canadian retail for decades.
Hudson Bay went independent in December 2024, keeping both Saks-based brands under its wing.","An iconic 354-year-old Canadian retailer is going out of business and shutting down all of its stores.

And it's pointing the finger at America and the ongoing tariff war.

Hudson’s Bay, a retailer and an anchor to dozens of malls across Canada, is preparing for an 'immediate' liquidation after failing to secure enough money to stay afloat.

Clearance sales will begin as early as next week at all 80 Hudson’s Bay locations, as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue and 12 Saks Off 5th stores it operates in Canada.

Hudson’s Bay blames its collapse on sluggish consumer spending, post-pandemic declines in foot traffic, and even trade tensions between Canada and the U.S.

The two countries have been engaged in a brutal back-and-forth after President Donald Trump launched tariffs on Canadian imports.

Canada hit back with duties on $20 billion worth of American goods.

The tariffs, a cornerstone of President Trump's economic vision, are expected to raise prices for everyday Americans and Canadians who have already been hurt by inflation and high borrowing costs.

But retail experts told Daily Mail that the iconic Canadian brand was in trouble before President Trump reclaimed the White House.

'Bankruptcy is just the latest twist in a long running saga,' Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData's retail division, said.

'The central problem is one of experience. Across most of its stores, Hudson’s Bay has provided the shopper with a sub-par experience and this has created a situation in which traffic and spend has declined.

'The chain has basically become far less relevant to Canadian shoppers and even its heritage and iconic status have not been enough to offset this.'

Hudson Bay is in negotiations with some of its debtors. If the these fail, all stores may close by June 15.

The company owes more than $950 million to suppliers, such as Ralph Lauren and Chanel.

The collapse would leave 9,364 people out of work.

'Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward,' Liz Rodbell. the company's CEO, said.

The company, which has ties back to 17th-century fur trades, has been a mainstay in Canadian retail for decades.

Hudson Bay still sells an iconic striped wool blanket found in many Canadian households.

There has been a run on the blankets since rumors about the company's potential demise, according to the Times Columnist.

The company has also changed hands multiple times in the past decade, including partnerships with real estate mogul Richard Baker and Lord and Taylor.

In his nearly four-year tenure, Grieder revamped the Hugo and Boss brands with the goal of luring younger shoppers with more casual wear.
The outlook for 2025 sales, however, came in just below the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
“The road ahead comes with several challenges that all pose tangible risk to consumer sentiment in 2025,” Grieder said, citing tariffs and the weak economic situation in China.
Hugo Boss intends to pay a dividend of 1.40 euros per share, above analysts estimate.","[FRANKFURT] Hugo Boss’ plan to return to profit growth this year faces an initial hurdle as weak consumer sentiment in the US and China weigh on sales and profit in the current quarter.

“We expect a muted first-quarter performance trending somewhat below our full-year top line guidance range,” chief executive officer Daniel Grieder told journalists on a call.

The shares fell 5.3 per cent by 1.17 pm Frankfurt time in an up-and-down session that earlier saw them rise as much as 4.7 per cent. The stock has dropped about 35 per cent in the last 12 months, a worse performance than rival high-end apparel makers Burberry Group and Ralph Lauren.

The German fashion house has been suffering since last year from a decline in consumer spending, which Grieder is trying to address with efficiency measures, such as shifting transport from air freight to ships. Job cuts are “not in our intention as we speak”, he said on the call.

In his nearly four-year tenure, Grieder revamped the Hugo and Boss brands with the goal of luring younger shoppers with more casual wear. His goals initially set out for 2025 – sales of five billion euros (S$7.3 billion) and a profit margin of at least 12 per cent – were delayed last year. But they are still doable, he said on Thursday (Mar 13), without giving a specific time frame for reaching them.

The company expects earnings before interest and taxes of between 380 million euros and 440 million euros this year, it said, in line with analysts’ forecasts. The outlook for 2025 sales, however, came in just below the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

“The road ahead comes with several challenges that all pose tangible risk to consumer sentiment in 2025,” Grieder said, citing tariffs and the weak economic situation in China.

While the effect of tariffs imposed by the US administration is still unclear, Hugo Boss’s supply chain is flexible and sourcing from China has been reduced to below 5 per cent, chief financial officer Yves Müller said. The company does not plan price increases at the moment, “but we have to see how it develops in the next few weeks and months”, Grieder said.

Asked about Frasers Group, now the company’s largest shareholder, Grieder said the exchanges have been “very constructive”. The acquisitive sportswear-to-department-store retailer’s CEO, Michael Murray, is seeking a seat on Hugo Boss’s supervisory board at the May 15 annual meeting.

The risk of a criminal investigation into Grieder over media allegations of insider trading activities is over, with the German financial watchdog and a public prosecutor deciding after an initial examination that there was no sufficient evidence to launch such a procedure.

“This affair is behind us, it’s dealt with in a serious, transparent way,” Grieder said.

The company is expected to report earnings-per-share of $0.28 on $11.02 billion in revenue.

Both figures are lower than last quarter even though Nike exceeded both estimates

This will be the second earnings report under new CEO Elliott Hill.

This earnings season is coming to a close, and Nike (NKE) is one of the final household brand names that has yet to report. On Thursday, it will report quarterly earnings after the market closes. This will be the second earnings report under new CEO, Elliott Hill. Although Nike exceeded earnings-per-share (EPS) and revenue estimates last quarter, the expectation bar is lower this time.

Nike is expected to report an EPS of $0.28 on $11.02 billion in revenue, and both figures are lower than last quarter's estimates.

NKE stock is trading near five-year lows, hovering around $72 per share. This is slightly lower than the stock opened in 2025 at $76.25 per share. The stock has bounced to the upside around $70, so hopefully the world's largest athletic shoe and apparel company can find a way back to a better stock price. With that said, NKE stock realized a massive sell-off after the earnings report in June 2024, falling over 20% the next day. The realized volatility is real here, and traders are looking for some positive sentiment this week.

During the last earnings call, Nike executives offered words of encouragement for the future of the brand. CEO Elliot Hill had this to say: “After an energizing 60 days of being back with my Nike teammates, our clear priority is to return sport to the center of everything we do. ... We're taking immediate action to reposition our business, so we can get back to driving long-term shareholder value. Our team is ready to go, and I'm confident you will see more moments of Nike being Nike again.""

Matthew Friend, chief financial officer, said, ""Nike’s second-quarter financial performance largely met our expectations, as we continue to make progress in shifting our portfolio. ... Under Elliott's leadership, we are accelerating our pace and reigniting brand momentum through sport.""

When a new CEO takes over, even if it was someone who worked at Nike previously, there's going to be some turbulence along the way. We're seeing that now, and the market is pricing in a relatively large stock price range for earnings this week.

Based on current implied volatility, we're looking at a +/- $5.92 stock price range against a $72 stock price. This is about 8% of the notional value of the stock price, which is on the higher end of the typical 5%-10% range we see for earnings.

Looking to the May 2025 options cycle, we can see the market is only pricing in a range of +/- $8.22. That means the earnings announcement this week makes up for over 75% of the expected stock price range for the next 60 days.

Bullish on Nike stock for earnings

If you're bullish on NKE stock for earnings, you're looking for another strong report against lower estimates. If Nike can post two earnings beats in a row, we could see the stock price rally from lows. It could help that the general market volatility has come down a bit, which could entice investors to engage in products trading near multi-year lows, and Nike is certainly one of them.

Bearish on Nike stock for earnings

If you're bearish on NKE stock for earnings, you're looking for an earnings miss against lower estimates. If the company can't beat estimates, the stock retreat to levels we haven't seen in many years. High implied volatility going into an earnings announcement means there's plenty of uncertainty, and the market is waiting to see what is said on Thursday.

Turner, an Audacy board member and former managing director of Sun Capital Partners, had been serving as interim president and CEO since January when former CEO David Field stepped down. In addition to her appointment as chief executive on a permanent basis, Audacy named Chris Oliviero (formerly market president for New York) as chief business officer and Bob Philips (previously president of networks and multi-market sales) as chief revenue officer.

Mike Dash (previously the company’s deputy general counsel) has been named EVP and general counsel, succeeding Sutor, who will “stay on for a transition period,” Audacy said. The company said Dash has been with Audacy’s companies for nearly two decades.

Earlier this month, Audacy conducted a broad round of layoffs, cutting about 200 employees across divisions.

Audacy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year as it looked to reduce its debt load. The one-time publicly traded company emerged from bankruptcy in September 2024 under a new ownership group led by controlling shareholder Soros Fund Management.

“On behalf of the Audacy board, we are delighted that Kelli Turner has agreed to take on the permanent president and CEO role and lead Audacy through its next phase of reinvention and growth,” said Michael Del Nin, chairman of Audacy and the lead media investor in Soros Fund Management. “She is an exceptional media executive who, along with Chris Oliviero and the rest of the Audacy team, will ensure we continue to invest in high-quality content to engage our audiences and provide best-in-class solutions to our partners.”

Turner has served on the Audacy board since September 2024. She has also served on the boards of directors of several ad and music technology companies, including DoubleVerify, Downtown Music Holdings and Central European Media Enterprises. Turner most recently was managing director and CFO of private investment firm Sun Capital Partners. Prior to joining Sun Capital Partners, she was president and CEO of SESAC Holdings, a music licensing and rights management company owned by Blackstone. She has also served in various executive and leadership roles in the investment and media industries, including RSL Group, Martha Stewart Living, Time Warner, Allen & Co. and Citigroup.

“It’s a privilege to lead Audacy at this exciting moment in its impressive history and the evolution of audio,” Turner said in a statement. “This is one of the most dynamic businesses in media and entertainment, and I am looking forward to partnering with Chris Oliviero and all of our teams to build on our momentum with audiences, creators and advertisers. I’m especially excited by the appointments of Chris and Bob, who know Audacy’s businesses inside out and whose track records in management, programming and sales are second to none.”

Oliviero, Audacy’s new chief business officer, has served as market president in New York since 2020 and spent more than 23 years at CBS Radio (which became part of Audacy in 2017). He started his career as a production assistant on “The Howard Stern Show” and took on progressively more senior programming roles.

On the logistics front, a US$400m investment in a high-tech, 775,000-square-foot automated distribution centre in DeKalb, Illinois transformed supply chain efficiency.
Continued growth and innovation By 2024, Kraft Heinz had extended its partnership with Highbury Canco in Canada.","COVID-19 sent shockwaves through global manufacturing, forcing industries to rethink supply chains, operations and workforce management.

The US auto sector slumped, with car sales still struggling to reach pre-pandemic levels.

In Germany, automation accelerated, wiping out nearly 250,000 manufacturing jobs. But for Kraft Heinz, the crisis presented both challenges and opportunities, demanding rapid adaptation to unprecedented shifts in demand.

As lockdowns took hold, consumer panic buying fuelled a surge in demand for pantry staples. Products like Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Heinz Ketchup and Maxwell House Coffee flew off shelves, testing the limits of supply chains.

Kraft Heinz responded with an all-hands-on-deck approach—US factories ramped up to 24/7 production, attendance rates hit record highs and facilities like the Iowa plant achieved historic output levels.

The company doubled down on modernisation, automation and expansion to solidify its supply chain for the long haul.

Supply chain resilience and expansion

Kraft Heinz’s response to pandemic-driven demand spikes laid the groundwork for significant global investments.

In 2021, the company poured £140m (US$189m) into its Kitt Green facility in the UK, Europe’s largest food manufacturing plant. The initiative focused on modernisation, machinery upgrades and sustainability.

Notably, sauce production was repatriated, reducing reliance on imports while improving efficiency and environmental impact.

In the US, the company committed US$143m to expanding its Garland, Texas plant, increasing production lines and workforce capacity.

Meanwhile, a €70m (US$82.6m) investment in Alfaro, Spain boosted factory capacity by 50%, strengthening its European supply chain. This expansion allowed the site to process 25,000 tonnes of locally grown tomatoes annually, reinforcing Kraft Heinz’s commitment to regional sourcing and efficiency.

These strategic investments align with a broader shift toward Industry 4.0 technologies, integrating automation and AI to streamline operations and improve responsiveness to consumer trends.

Strategic acquisitions and distribution enhancements

Beyond physical expansion, Kraft Heinz sharpened its direct-to-consumer capabilities.

In 2022, the company acquired an 85% stake in Just Spices, a digital-first spice brand with strong online sales. The move strengthened Kraft Heinz’s foothold in the taste elevation market and enhanced its ecommerce strategy.

On the logistics front, a US$400m investment in a high-tech, 775,000-square-foot automated distribution centre in DeKalb, Illinois transformed supply chain efficiency.

With direct national railway access, the facility processed more than 60% of the company’s foodservice business and nearly a third of its dry goods.

Sustainability was also a key focus, with the site designed to reduce environmental impact while optimising speed and cost-effectiveness in product distribution.

Continued growth and innovation

By 2024, Kraft Heinz had extended its partnership with Highbury Canco in Canada. The Leamington, Ontario facility remains a critical part of operations, producing more than US$1bn worth of Heinz products through 2027.

Innovation also took centre stage, with new ketchup flavours and expanded condiment applications aiming to drive growth in evolving consumer markets.

The company’s investment strategy comes full circle in 2025 with the completion of the Alfaro expansion.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b8d87e31db2eea0c23764843987a91ae:a15ba7ea22eda5acb0e9d0f48ac889e7/alfaro-team-1.jfif.jpg,N,,2025-03-17 13:54:41.527541

The category's growth makes it attractive for Pepsi and its rival, Coca-Cola , which recently launched its own prebiotic soda brand, Simply Pop.
Pepsi had reportedly aimed to launch its own functional soda under its Soulboost brand, but it canceled those plans, likely paving the way to a deal with Poppi.
Pepsi said it plans to acquire the upstart Poppi for $1.95 billion.
Poppi and the plaintiff moved to settle the suit on Friday for $8.9 million, according to court filings.","PepsiCo said Monday that it is buying prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion.

While soda consumption has broadly fallen over the past two decades in the U.S., prebiotic sodas, fueled by industry newcomers Poppi and Olipop, have won over health-conscious consumers over the past five years.

The category's growth makes it attractive for Pepsi and its rival, Coca-Cola , which recently launched its own prebiotic soda brand, Simply Pop. Pepsi had reportedly aimed to launch its own functional soda under its Soulboost brand, but it canceled those plans, likely paving the way to a deal with Poppi.

Pepsi said it plans to acquire the upstart Poppi for $1.95 billion. The deal includes $300 million of anticipated cash tax benefits, making the net purchase price $1.65 billion.

Pepsi will also have to make additional payments if Poppi achieves certain performance milestones within a set time frame after the acquisition closes. The company did not say when the deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval.

Poppi's founders Allison and Stephen Ellsworth launched the brand back in 2018, the same year that Olipop was founded. Poppi's formula includes apple cider vinegar, prebiotics and just five grams of sugar.

By 2023, Poppi's annual sales reportedly crossed $100 million.

The company recently made its second straight Super Bowl appearance with an ad during the big game, demonstrating both its deep pockets and a desire to reach an even wider audience.

But as Poppi's sales have grown, it has also attracted backlash for its health claims. For example, the company faced a class action lawsuit that alleged that its drinks were not as healthy as its packaging claimed. Poppi and the plaintiff moved to settle the suit on Friday for $8.9 million, according to court filings.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108117095-1742235669976-gettyimages-2205568383-pepsi602024_ctf8xdjc.jpeg?v=1742235712&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-03-17 17:54:09.958457

Analysts already incorporated company challenges in the guidance. The results are likely to be broadly in line with expectations, according to Telsey Advisory Group.

The Nike Analyst: Analyst Cristina Fernández reaffirmed a Market Perform rating and price target of $80.

The Nike Thesis: Given lower demand for its products, a reduction in units of three key lifestyle franchises, and higher promotions to clear inventory, the company is likely to report a 12% decline in sales versus consensus of 11.3%, Fernández said in a note.

Check out other analyst stock ratings.

Gross margins are likely to have contracted to 41.5%, versus consensus of 41.8%, she added.

The analyst mentioned the key areas to watch during the earnings call:

Progress on inventory reduction

Impact of the shift in clearance activity from ecommerce to factory stores

Magnitude of further reductions in lifestyle franchise units

Pace of product innovation and potential for new products

Retro products making a comeback to offset declines in other parts of the business

The recently announced launch of the NikeSKIMS brand to broaden the reach for Nike in women's apparel

While Nike will announce the initial guidance for fiscal 2026, it had indicated that reductions in lifestyle franchise units, a mix shift toward lower margin products, and steps to improve relationships with wholesale partners will have adverse impacts on both sales and profitability in fiscal 2026, she stated.

""We don't expect a significant direct impact to Nike from tariffs given the majority of Nike products manufactured in China (15% of total) serve the Chinese market, with only a small portion of those imported into the US (both adidas and Under Armour have noted that only 3%-4% of the products made in China are sold in the US),"" Fernández further wrote.

The operator of Forever 21's U.S. unit said Sunday that foreign competition from fast-fashion rivals, rising costs, economic challenges and evolving consumer trends were to blame. For the time being, stores and the company's U.S. website will remain open as the company starts winding down operations and seeks a last-minute bidder for its assets.

Founded in 1984 by Korean immigrants in California, Forever 21 grew to $1 billion in annual sales by 2005. The store quickly became a mall staple for millennials looking for designer-inspired styles, alongside fellow low-cost retailer H&M and the pricier Abercrombie & Fitch. Forever 21’s sales peaked at more than $4 billion a decade later, and founders Jin Sook and Do Won ""Don"" Chang were estimated to hold a combined net worth of $5.9 billion.

Yet as the 2010s wore on, the brand began to be eclipsed by online rivals, including ultra-cheap fast-fashion retailers like Shein that shipped their garments to U.S. customers from overseas. In this environment, Forever 21's reliance on foot traffic at malls began to prove a liability as customers increasingly leaned into e-commerce.

Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy for the first time in 2019, hoping to become a more efficient operation. But the Covid-19 pandemic only accelerated the company's woes, even as it was bought out of bankruptcy by Authentic Brands, the operator of other major retailers and two major mall operators.

In a 2024 interview, the CEO of Authentic called the purchase of Forever 21 ""probably the biggest mistake I made.""

F21 OpCo, which runs Forever 21 stores, said late Sunday that it will wind down the business in the U.S. under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while determining if it can continue as a business with a partner, or if it will sell some or all of its assets.

“While we have evaluated all options to best position the company for the future, we have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,” Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.

The de minimis tax exemption lets shipments headed to U.S. businesses and consumers valued at less than $800 to enter the country tax free and duty free.

Forever 21 stores in the U.S. will hold liquidation sales and the website will continue to run while operations wind down. The retailer's locations outside of the U.S. are run by other licensees and are not included in the bankruptcy filing. International store locations and websites will continue operating as normal.

Authentic Brands Group owns the international intellectual property associated with the Forever 21 brand and may license the brand to other operators, F21OpCo said.

Forever 21 first filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019. It was acquired by a consortium of parties including Authentic Brands Group and mall owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners.

Forever 21 was founded in 1984 and, along with other fast-fashion chains like H & M and Zara, rode a wave of popularity among young customers in the mid-1990s. Their popularity grew during the Great Recession, when shoppers were seeking bargains. But Forever 21 went on an aggressive expansion just as shoppers were moving more online.

Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that part of the problem now is that Forever 21's stores are too big for its current needs and it's in malls with not enough foot traffic.

“Forever 21 was always a retailer living on borrowed time. Over recent years it has been hit with dual headwinds from a weak apparel market and stiff competition from cheap Chinese marketplaces,” he said. “Both things have eroded its standing and depleted its market share.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/37e83778-28a0-41e4-b6ca-79e58738ec11/wirestory_0c5e9bac07bf184988475a2b57842e08_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-03-17 12:09:22.364561

In its latest bankruptcy filing, Forever 21 listed assets of between $100 million and $500 million and liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion.","Forever 21, which a decade ago was seen as a leader in youth fashion retail, is set to permanently close all its U.S. stores as it files for bankruptcy for a second time.

The operator of Forever 21's U.S. unit said Sunday that foreign competition from fast-fashion rivals, rising costs, economic challenges and evolving consumer trends were to blame. For the time being, stores and the company's U.S. website will remain open as the company starts winding down operations and seeks a last-minute bidder for its assets.

Founded in 1984 by Korean immigrants in California, Forever 21 grew to $1 billion in annual sales by 2005. The store quickly became a mall staple for millennials looking for designer-inspired styles, alongside fellow low-cost retailer H&M and the pricier Abercrombie & Fitch. Forever 21’s sales peaked at more than $4 billion a decade later, and founders Jin Sook and Do Won ""Don"" Chang were estimated to hold a combined net worth of $5.9 billion.

Yet as the 2010s wore on, the brand began to be eclipsed by online rivals, including ultra-cheap fast-fashion retailers like Shein that shipped their garments to U.S. customers from overseas. In this environment, Forever 21's reliance on foot traffic at malls began to prove a liability as customers increasingly leaned into e-commerce.

Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy for the first time in 2019, hoping to become a more efficient operation. But the Covid-19 pandemic only accelerated the company's woes, even as it was bought out of bankruptcy by Authentic Brands, the operator of other major retailers and two major mall operators.

In a 2024 interview, the CEO of Authentic called the purchase of Forever 21 ""probably the biggest mistake I made.""

Ultimately, today's youth demographic simply moved on from the Forever 21 brand, experts said.

""Forever 21 was the brand that the former generation used,"" said Roger Beahm, a marketing professor and director of the Retail Learning Labs at Wake Forest University, told the Los Angeles Times. ""Today’s shoppers want their own brand, they want their own identity.""

In its latest bankruptcy filing, Forever 21 listed assets of between $100 million and $500 million and liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250317-forever-21-mn-0815-200051.jpg",N,,2025-03-17 10:03:12.409496

(Nasdaq: MBX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel precision peptide therapies for the treatment of endocrine and metabolic disorders, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate progress.

Finally, we look forward to initiating a Phase 2 trial evaluating MBX 1416 in post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) patients in the second half of 2025.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 and Recent Corporate Highlights

Hypoparathyroidism (HP): Canvuparatide (MBX 2109)

Completed Enrollment in Phase 2 Avail Trial in HP patients: In March 2025, MBX announced the completion of enrollment of 64 patients with HP in the Phase 2 Avail trial of canvuparatide, the Company's potential long-acting parathyroid once-weekly hormone (PTH) peptide prodrug. Topline results from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week trial are anticipated in the third quarter of 2025.

Published Phase 1 Trial Results: In December 2024, MBX announced the publication of a peer-reviewed article highlighting results from the Phase 1 study of canvuparatide titled ""MBX 2109, a Once-Weekly Parathyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy Prodrug: Phase 1, First-in-Human, Randomized Trial” in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (JCEM) and can be accessed here.

Post-bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH): MBX 1416

Positive results from MBX 1416 Phase 1 trial support Phase 2 advancement: In January 2025, the Company announced positive topline results from its Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trial of MBX 1416 in healthy adult volunteers. MBX 1416 is the Company's long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist in development for the treatment of PBH. MBX anticipates initiating a Phase 2 study of MBX 1416 in patients with PBH in the second half of 2025 following completion of an End-of-Phase 1 meeting with the FDA.

Obesity: MBX 4291

IND filing on track for Q2 2025: MBX expects to submit an IND application to the FDA in the second quarter of 2025 for MBX 4291, the Company's GLP-1/GIP co-agonist prodrug for the potential once-monthly treatment of obesity.

Forever 21 has been unable to keep up with Chinese e-commerce giants such as Shein and Temu, especially as online shopping boomed during the pandemic.
Forever 21 joins a long list of companies closing stores in the US.
Forever 21 currently has more than “540 locations globally and online,” according to its website.
The Forever 21 brand might live on through licensing agreements, but that would make the retailer a “a shadow of its former self, but a sale is possible as e-commerce and brand groups may show some interest,” Saunders added.","New York / London (CNN) — Forever 21 isn’t even cool enough to exist anymore.

The retailer’s US operating company filed for bankruptcy Sunday — for the second time in six years — in a court in Delaware, citing fierce competition from foreign fast fashion retailers. It marks the end of an era for a clothing brand that introduced many teens to fast fashion.

The company said in a statement that its stores and website in the United States will remain open and continue serving customers for now, but it is implementing an “orderly wind-down” of its business in the country. It added that it would conduct liquidation sales at its stores and that it was seeking a buyer for some or all of its assets.

Brad Sell, the company’s chief financial officer, said in the statement: “We have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast fashion companies… as well as rising costs, economic challenges impacting our core customers and evolving consumer trends.”

Many US businesses file for bankruptcy protection to wind down some operations, shed debt and cut costs. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a common route, allowing ailing companies to solve their financial problems by restructuring.

Forever 21 has been unable to keep up with Chinese e-commerce giants such as Shein and Temu, especially as online shopping boomed during the pandemic. The company is also sensitive to President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes on Chinese imports into the United States.

All three retailers are fast fashion brands, meaning they mass-produce cheap clothes that are often quickly discarded as consumers strive to keep up with the latest trends. The business model has also been criticized for its negative impact on the environment.

“Forever 21 has not helped itself through these challenges: merchandising and the assortment have been lackluster, and the brand has lacked any clear point of view for a long time,” said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData Retail, in a comment. “The net result is that more and more customers, especially those at the younger end of the market, have abandoned it.”

Forever 21 first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 and subsequently shut down 200 stores. A few months later, a team consisting of mall operators Simon Property Group and Brookfield Properties and brand management firm Authentic Brands Group bought Forever 21 for $81 million. That allowed the retailer to keep operating with a smaller retail footprint.

But years later, the outlook remained bleak.

Forever 21 joins a long list of companies closing stores in the US. Last year, major US retailers announced more than 7,300 store closures, up 57% from 2023, according to Coresight Research. These included Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS).

Forever 21 currently has more than “540 locations globally and online,” according to its website. At the time of its first bankruptcy filing, it had 800 locations worldwide.

The Forever 21 brand might live on through licensing agreements, but that would make the retailer a “a shadow of its former self, but a sale is possible as e-commerce and brand groups may show some interest,” Saunders added.

Artisan Mid Cap Value Fund stated the following regarding Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:

""Our biggest individual detractors in Q4 were Dentsply Sirona, Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII) and Baxter International. Polaris designs, engineers and manufactures power sports vehicles, operating in three segments: off-road, on-road and marine. This company missed earnings expectations and lowered FY2024 guidance due to continued weak demand for recreational vehicles. Additionally, with dealer inventories still too high, Polaris has had to pursue greater promotional activity through rebates as well as provide cheaper floor plan financing and advertising assistance to dealers—all of which are pressuring margins. Retail weakness is partly a hangover from robust sales during the pandemic that pulled forward demand. Additionally, as inflation has constrained consumer budgets, consumers are deferring big-ticket discretionary purchases and avoiding high financing costs at today’s interest rates. We admit that the challenging sales environment may continue, but with the stock drifting back toward its lowest prices since the pandemic selloff of 2020 and selling cheaply at 11X our estimate of normalized earnings, we added to our position in Q4. The company is well run historically, and current management has demonstrated operating discipline by divesting bad businesses acquired under old management, focusing on the company’s roots in power sports and continuing its history of returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. Returns over a business cycle are strong, with returns on tangible capital most years in the mid-to-high teens. Though cash generation has fallen—as expected in a tough retail backdrop—Polaris remains well financed.""

Hudson’s Bay attributed its financial struggles to subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the United States and Canada, and decreased foot traffic in downtown locations following the pandemic.
The company’s stores often occupy several floors and significantly more square footage than other retailers.
Ontario would be hardest hit, with 32 of the company’s stores located in the province.
Originally established as a fur trading business, Hudson’s Bay has been led by Americans for several decades.","Hudson’s Bay Co plans to liquidate its entire business as early as next week unless it secures additional financing, the 354-year-old Canadian retailer said in court filings, putting more than 9,000 jobs at risk across the country.

The iconic department store chain, which traces its roots back to 1670, announced late Friday that “exhaustive” efforts to secure financing had failed, forcing it to pursue a full liquidation of its 80 stores pending court approval on Monday.

“Without an immediate liquidation across retail stores, it is not expected that Hudson’s Bay would be able to repay its obligations under the financing it did secure,” Jennifer Bewley, chief financial officer for Hudson’s Bay’s parent company, said in an affidavit filed Friday.

The retailer owes more than $950 million to creditors including landlords, suppliers and fashion brands such as Chanel, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel, Estee Lauder, and Ralph Lauren.

Hudson’s Bay attributed its financial struggles to subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the United States and Canada, and decreased foot traffic in downtown locations following the pandemic.

“Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates…” Hudson’s Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell said in a statement.

Retail experts say the planned closure marks the end of an era for a company deeply woven into Canadian identity.

The liquidation would leave vacant anchor tenant spaces in malls and prime real estate in high-traffic shopping districts across Canada. The company’s stores often occupy several floors and significantly more square footage than other retailers.

Ontario would be hardest hit, with 32 of the company’s stores located in the province. British Columbia has 16 locations, while Alberta and Quebec each have 13. Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two stores each.

Union representatives for about 320 workers at three Ontario stores and a Toronto warehouse called on the company to “uphold its legal obligations to workers” and provide transparent communication about closures and severance protections.

The company’s history is intertwined with Canada’s development. Originally established as a fur trading business, Hudson’s Bay has been led by Americans for several decades. Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners purchased it in 2008 for $1.1 billion.

Baker took the company public in 2012 before privatizing it again in 2020 through a takeover bid that required multiple revisions to secure shareholder approval. The liquidation process is expected to conclude by June if approved by the court.

Chicago, IL – March 17, 2025 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Nike NKE, FedEx FDX, Costco COST, Oracle ORCL and Adobe ADBE.

Looking Ahead to Q1 Earnings Season

The Q1 reporting cycle will really get going when the big banks come out with their March-quarter results on April 11th, but the Q1 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with four S&P 500 members having come out with results for their fiscal quarters ending in February.

We have another 10 such index members on deck to report their respective February-quarter results this week, including bellwether operators like Nike, FedEx and others. We and other research organizations count these February-quarter results as part of our March-quarter tally.

By the time the big banks come out with their quarterly results about a month from now, we will have such Q1 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members.

The market has been unimpressed with the results we have seen in recent days, with three of the four stocks losing ground following the respective quarterly releases. We should note that these results from Costco, Oracle and Adobe coincided with a broad market sell-off, so one could attribute the post-release weakness in each of these stocks to broad market forces.

That said, we do know that while Costco, Oracle and Adobe came out with strong and better-than-expected results for their respective February quarters, their guidance for the current period was tentative and underwhelming. The weak guidance from these companies follows similarly soft outlooks from the likes of Walmart, Target, Delta Air Lines, and others.

These weak guidance releases are coming at a time of growing anxiety about the macroeconomic backdrop, with many in the market starting to worry about the U.S. economy’s near-term growth momentum. Uncertainty about the Trump administration’s tariff policies is starting to show up in business and consumer confidence measures, and some have begun to worry if the ongoing public sector job cuts will eventually seep into the private sector as well.

We discuss the earnings impact of the tariff question here >>>The Earnings Impact of the New Tariff Regime

While we acknowledge that near-term risks have increased for the economy, we remain sanguine in our outlook and see the ongoing market weakness as a buying opportunity. The U.S. economy defied skeptics during and after the extraordinary Fed tightening cycle and remains resilient enough to withstand the current bout of tariffs-centric uncertainty.

Importantly, for the first time in a long time, the U.S. economy enjoys the backstop of the Fed with more than enough ‘dry powder’ to jumpstart growth should investors’ worst fears come to fruition.

Depending on where the emerging tariff regime settles, earnings estimates will need to come down in response. But we all need to look past the daily noise around tariffs and remind ourselves that the overall corporate earnings picture has been steadily improving in recent quarters.

The earnings growth pace has been steadily accelerating in recent quarters, with the preceding quarter’s +13.7% earnings growth rate (+16.4% on an ex-Energy basis) reaching its highest level in three years.

We believe that these favorable growth trends will remain in place in the current and coming quarters, with the sectors contributing to the growth momentum expanding beyond the Tech core of the last couple of years.

Early Q1 Earnings Scorecard

As noted earlier, we have already seen February-quarter results from four S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these four index members are up +8.4% from the same period last year on an equivalent growth in revenues, with only one of the four beating EPS estimates and two of four beating revenue estimates.

Of the 10 index members reporting results this week, we will be closely watching for trends in the releases from Nike, FedEx, and Accenture, focusing on how they describe trends in their outlook.

Nike is expected to bring in 28 cents per share in earnings on $11.12 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of -71.4% and -10.6%. While estimates have been stable over the past month, they have been cut more than -50% over the past three months.

The stock has been a true laggard lately, underperforming the broader market and the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector by a wide margin.

Nike shares have lost more than -60% of their value from their all-time peak in November 2021, with a host of self-inflicted steps that have weighed on the outlook. Specifically, the company’s much-needed focus on the direct-to-consumer effort that helped the business gain share during Covid resulted in management failing to nurture the far bigger wholesale channel. On top of this has been the perception of new product innovation and weakness in the Chinese market that have weighed on Nike shares.

Q1 Earnings Estimates Under Pressure

The expectation is that Q1 earnings will be up +6.0% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues, which would follow the +13.7% earnings growth on +5.4% revenue gains in the preceding period.

We have been experiencing a relatively elevated magnitude of negative revisions to estimates for the current period (2025 Q1) even before the more recent signs of weakness in data that drove the recent run of soft guidance from several companies.

As noted earlier, there have been more negative revisions to Q1 estimates since the start of January compared to the comparable periods of the preceding few quarters. Not only is the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates more pronounced relative to the last few quarters, but it is also more widespread.

Since the start of the period in January, estimates have come down for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Conglomerates, Autos, Basic Materials, Aerospace, Consumer Discretionary, and others.

Medical and Construction are the two sectors whose Q1 estimates have increased since the quarter got underway.

The Tech sector, whose estimates have consistently been positive over the past year, is also suffering negative revisions to Q1 estimates. Optimism about the AI investment cycle suffered a psychological blow following China’s DeepSeek announcement. The resulting shift in market sentiment has weighed on the space ever since, causing the underperformance of AI-focused stocks this year.

You can see this in the performance of Oracle and Adobe, which reported strong quarterly results, but guidance was relatively weak.

A lot will be riding on the evolving earnings expectations for the Tech sector, which has been a pillar of growth over the last two years. The expectation is for Q1 earnings for the sector to be up +12.6% from the same period last year on +10% higher revenues, which will follow the sector’s +26.3% earnings growth in the preceding period.

""Loved by locals and visitors, our mix of boutiques, dining and experiences has become a Palm Beach favorite.","By December 2020, more than 40 vacant storefronts were seen throughout Palm Beach, from Worth Avenue, its vias and adjoining streets, and along South County Road, to the Royal Poinciana Plaza.

To help, the Town Council approved a plan to give restaurants and shops more outdoor space and hired a firm to conduct a retail study.

Five years later, the retail landscape is much different, with almost no retail vacancies in Palm Beach, although there is the usual turnover.

In March 2020, the coronavirus pandemic capsized the world, upended lives, and impacted the retail stores where people shopped.

By December 2020, more than 40 vacant storefronts were seen throughout Palm Beach, from Worth Avenue, its vias and adjoining streets, and along South County Road, to the Royal Poinciana Plaza.

That dire situation followed a March-to-May mandatory shutdown. The 2019-2020 season, referred to as “a season like no other,” was cut short. Supply chain issues affected retail offerings.

Some retailers made it through by pivoting towards more online and phone sales and offering in-store pickup and delivery. Others shut down and never reopened.

The local focus and service Palm Beach retailers are known for, plus the fact that the island has been a famous destination and homebase for the wealthy for decades, helped businesses survive.

“Certainly, we saw a tremendous increase in business during the pandemic. Sure, 2020 was scary, but signs of life returned during the season of 2021, and despite pandemic-themed news stories, we try not to look back,” said Michael Maus, treasurer of the Worth Avenue Association and owner of men’s store Maus & Hoffman.

“Unlike national department stores or global brands, we focus on curating collections tailored to the Palm Beach lifestyle and climate,” Maus said. “Our local approach has always set us apart, and in the years since the pandemic, and the decades before, it has served us well.”

Frank Steinhart, president of the Worth Avenue Association and production manager at shoe store Stubbs & Wootton, said five years after the pandemic began, what strikes him is the avenue's resilience. One standout change, he said, was how retailers introduced concierge-style service during the public health crisis, reached out to clients and delivered goods to their homes.

“Online sales surged amid supply chain chaos and closures, and while that trend lingers, the pendulum has swung decisively back to in-person shopping — people are eager to escape isolation and savor the experiential allure of the avenue,” Steinhart said. “In 2020, we faced a vacancy crisis with over 20 empty storefronts. Today, we’re at full occupancy, with brands clamoring on waitlists for a coveted spot. This journey highlights the enduring strength and adaptability of Worth Avenue.”

Katie Green, who works in sales at Worth Avenue shop DEA Fine Linens, said the business experienced a surge in sales and traffic as people flocked to Palm Beach to nest.

“Fortunately, we avoided supply chain disruptions, with Italian production resuming swiftly. The booming real estate turnover has brought more design professionals to the area, while the rising foot traffic on Worth Avenue reflects Palm Beach’s growing allure. Additionally, the new boat marina has sparked a noticeable uptick in the boating business,” Green said.

John Zoller, senior vice president-retail operations at The Breakers Palm Beach, said the pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge, but the hotel's retail division was supported by The Breakers guiding principles and a renewed appreciation of the importance of adaptability.

“Every decision made was rooted in the organization’s commitment to its team, guests and community, allowing the company to navigate uncertainty with purpose and agility,” Zoller said.

He said the division has seen record sales and strong growth in the newly remodeled boutiques Absolutely Suitable, Guerlain, Match at The Breakers, Polo Ralph Lauren Kids and Signature Shop.

Neiman Marcus was among the higher-profile closures in Palm Beach. It shut down permanently in September 2020. The company declared bankruptcy in May 2020, partially due to the pandemic’s effects.

In May 2020, the Palm Beach Town Council approved a plan to help protect restaurants and retail shops by allowing more outdoor space. Phased re-openings slowly began across the town, with precautions such as sanitizing, mask wearing and social distancing.

In February 2021, to help revive struggling shopping areas, the council hired an urban-growth firm based in Cincinnati to conduct a retail study to help Palm Beach revive struggling shopping areas and streamline town codes.

Five years later, the retail landscape is much different, with almost no retail vacancies in Palm Beach, although there is the usual turnover. The pandemic jump started an upward rise in demand and prices and with the newcomers came increased traffic.

The steady trickle of people moving into Palm Beach and nearby cities over the last few decades became a deluge, bringing higher-income individuals and families from other states and countries.

“The pandemic was an absolutely horrific thing to hit earth,"" said Jeff Cloninger, senior global real estate adviser for Sotheby’s International Realty in Palm Beach. ""My personal view was when it started, I thought it would be similar to after 9-11. Who would dream the pandemic would cause the biggest surge in real estate values that Palm Beach has ever seen?""

But as the pandemic began to ease, the climb in commercial and residential real estate prices was unprecedented.

“In Palm Beach prices climbed to a point I don’t think anybody would have imagined pre-pandemic,” Cloninger said.

After real estate prices climbed from 2004 to 2006, people thought that was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, Cloninger said, but it was not. Today there’s more demand than supply, which created an upward push.

“It has all settled down now. Prices are no longer rising in that double-digit category in residential. One of the most difficult things in the last few years is when someone says, ‘What is my property worth?’ In 2022 and 2023 that was a number on a rocket. It just kept going up and up,” Cloninger said.

“Since the pandemic, it has been a 180 as far as the commercial properties go,” Cloninger said. “I have a number of properties between the Breakers and Worth Avenue. Pre-pandemic, there were vacancies. Since the pandemic, I have probably got five or six qualified prospective tenants for every commercial space I have.”

People moved to Florida because of looser COVID restrictions, the lack of a state income tax, and of course, the weather and the lifestyle. Many were working remotely and considered Palm Beach a relatively secure haven.

By the start of the 2022-23 season, while some Main Streets around the country were still struggling and malls had empty stores, Palm Beach had zero retail vacancies, brokers said, and it was developing even more cachet on a global level.

Merchants characterized the 2022-2023 season as one of their best ever. Customers started buying formal wear again. A number of shops new to Palm Beach debuted, including jewelers David Yurman and Lisa Gozlan, watchmaker IWC Schaffhausen Boutique, luxury fashion brand Hadleigh’s, Mark Russell Custom Clothing, resort wear boutique Cou, and Summit Furniture.

“Florida benefited more than any other state in the country,"" said Orin Rosenfeld of Rosenfeld Realty Advisors in Boca Raton. ""It was a bonanza with all those high-net-worth (individuals) moving here. All those folks needed clothes, furniture and cars. The rest of the country did not fare so well.

“Everyone had a pause for a few months, then people started to move here, and that continued. There is a saying in real estate that retail follows rooftops,” Rosenfeld said.

The permanent closure of Saks Fifth Avenue in Worth Avenue’s Esplanade, set for next month after 99 years on the avenue, was largely due to the downturn experienced by department stores around the country as luxury goods consumers favored exclusive boutiques.

""The department stores have suffered greatly,” Rosenfeld said. “As far as what they are and what they represent, the last place there should be one of those is Palm Beach. People there are looking for very high-end exclusive items. The last thing they want is something everyone around the country can buy.”

When it comes to shoes, clothing, jewelry, home décor and other items featured in many Palm Beach stores, shoppers prefer an in-store experience and the ability to see merchandise, try it on and ask questions before they buy it.

“Our customers value the ability to see, feel, and be personally guided through their purchases, ensuring they receive something truly exceptional,” said Maus, of the Worth Avenue Association.

“Let’s be done talking about the pandemic,” Maus said, and “focus on building our lives and businesses and on being ready for the next macro-level disruption.”

For a major shopping destination such as the Royal Poinciana Plaza, the boost has brought continued success, said Lori Berg, its general manager.

“The Royal Poinciana Plaza keeps growing with more visitors and energy each year,"" Berg said. ""Loved by locals and visitors, our mix of boutiques, dining and experiences has become a Palm Beach favorite. We’re thrilled to keep the momentum going and see what’s next as we unveil more tenants at the Playhouse.”","https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/12/NPBD/82313972007-031225-french-exchange-students-clo-1.jpg?crop=2497,1405,x0,y199&width=2497&height=1405&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-03-17 09:02:37.603134

These compact stores, averaging under 5,000 square feet, will feature full-service pharmacies while limiting general merchandise like snacks, cosmetics, and household items.

The move comes as CVS faces growing competition from retailers like Amazon and Target, along with declining front-end sales.

Additionally, the company has struggled with increased theft and changing consumer shopping habits. By streamlining its offerings, CVS aims to enhance access to essential healthcare services, including prescription medications and immunizations, particularly in communities with limited pharmacy options.

As part of this strategic shift, CVS plans to open about a dozen of these smaller drugstores in select locations throughout 2025. However, this expansion coincides with a broader downsizing effort.

The company will close approximately 270 locations this year, continuing a trend of store closures that has resulted in around 800 locations shutting down over the past three years.

The new pharmacy-focused stores align with CVS’s long-term vision of transitioning into a healthcare-oriented company.

This move follows the company’s acquisitions of healthcare providers like Oak Street Health and Signify Health, reinforcing its commitment to expanding medical services beyond traditional drugstore operations.

Under pressure: Here's why Starbucks' broken supply chain is killing the global coffee giant

Starbucks is saddled with Stone Age supply chain technology, according to Brittain Ladd, a consultant and former Amazon executive.

In a LinkedIn post, he said that he had spent the last week communicating, off the record, with current and former executives, directors and managers from Starbucks, specifically, the individuals responsible for the supply chain part of the business.

He commented: ""I approached the discussions with a preconceived notion: Starbucks former CEOs; Howard Schultz, Kevin Johnson, and Laxman Narasimhan, all failed to invest the necessary capital to design and equip Starbucks with the optimal supply chain.”

“Based on the discussions, I was right. I place the blame for the Stone Age supply chain primarily at the feet of Schultz. Johnson had minimal understanding of the importance of supply chain technology, and Narasimhan was out of his depth the minute he became CEO.""

Over the years, former Chief Supply Chain Officers, VPs and SVPs, had clearly outlined the gaps in Starbucks supply chain related to technology and the sub optimised logistics network, Ladd observed.

""On multiple occasions, funding was promised to close the gaps only to be withdrawn. This forced the supply chain organisation to have to keep Starbucks mediocre supply chain operating without the right software tools, logistics facilities, and budget.""

Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol is making the right moves, Ladd believes. However, he has to do more than proclaim that it takes too long to get products to the stores, and that the stores run out of inventory too frequently. In short, he must invest in the supply chain

Starbucks should replace its antiquated supply chain software with best-in-class tech with a focus on DeepSeek AI, Manus, and Solvoyo. The company is using software from o9 Solutions. ""Why are Starbucks locations still running out of products so frequently? Is it the platform or is Starbucks not using the platform correctly? It’s inexcusable that it can’t keep products stocked in their stores,"" Ladd said.

He added: ""I strongly suggest that Brian Niccol meet with Leo Laranjieria of MIT, to discuss the supply chain that Starbucks must have to meet customer demand and eliminate stores running out of inventory. Dr. Laranjeira should be hired as an advisor reporting directly to Niccol.""

'Out of touch' Tesco under fire for large trolley checkout scales trial at grocery giant's Gateshead store

Tesco is testing out giant trolley checkout scales at its Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store.

The aim is to identify items that customers may have missed or duplicated while using the retailer's Scan as You Shop service, which is exclusive to Clubcard members.

In a LInkedIn post, Lee Coopersmith, Director of Business Development at Cleveron, said: ""Before joining Cleveron, I had the privilege of being a key contributor to this Tesco project, and like many, I find it tough to leave behind something I’ve invested so much effort into (over three years!), especially when I know it’s bound for success. A huge congratulations to Bizerba and Supersmart for making this happen in the UK. Excited to see where this journey takes them next.""

There have been mostly negative reactions to the trial among customers on social media, with one user on Reddit likening the experience to “border control”.

Another quipped: “No Clubcard? Deported!”

Over on X, meanwhile, @BradChuck said: ""Having fallen foul to the @Tesco policy of making you look like a criminal every time you use the scanner to shop, for them to then not belive you and rescan all your shopping again whilst making you look like a shoplifter, these new weight measuring gates are nothing new.""

And @ClareBeveridge commented: ""So now you have to have your trolley weighed after self scan in @Tesco, how much has that cost? You just don’t get it do you? Bring back proper checkout tills.""

Customers fume as Ocado once again cancels grocery delivery orders due to operation issues

Ocado experienced operation issues earlier this month, resulting in a large number of customers having their orders cancelled.

This followed on from issues at Christmas when long booked orders were binned due to major warehouse woes.

Customers have taken to social media to hit out at the online retailer, with one fuming on X: “Abysmal service @Ocado just cancelling orders, no explanation no reason just cancelled, you can rebook for tomorrow with a voucher. Great, but I need the shopping today! No answer from your customer service number either!”

Another commented: “@Ocado this is more than inconvenient. How do I tell my boss I didn’t make it to the mega important meeting because ‘Ocado was late’ lol I will be fired. There should be an option to change delivery to a convenient time or cancel the delivery.”

“Any @ocado orders in the midlands I’ve just spoken to customer service and their warehouse outside Tamworth has had operational issues, 5,000 orders cancelled! What a great start,” another said.

An Ocado customer service representative responded: “We are sorry to hear that your order has been cancelled due to operation issues and due to this your voucher has expired and you are unable to get another delivery. We would love to look into this further, if you could please send us a DM?”

Ocado lays claim to the most advanced grocery automation in the world and is well known in the retail tech world for its customer fulfilment centres (CFCs).

A spokesperson told RTIH: “Unfortunately, we’ve had an operational issue at one of our sites and this has resulted in the cancellation of some customer orders. We’re working hard to get this resolved as soon as possible and we’re really sorry about the inconvenience this has caused to customers.”

Sainsbury's Next Level strategy sees roll-out of new Local high street convenience store format

Sainsbury's has taken the wraps off a new look Local convenience store format.

This launched at its refurbished Pudsey Town Local store in Leeds, which reopened in late February. Variations were rolled out to two new openings in London last week, at Bermondsey Square and Sloane Avenue Locals.

Ocado Intelligent Automation announces debut of Porter AMR autonomous pallet moving robot

Ocado Intelligent Automation (OIA), part of Ocado Group, has introduced Porter AMR, a pallet moving AMR that navigates warehouses to automate several warehouse workflows such as cross-docking, bulk-item picking, putaway, and pallet movement.

OIA’s patented system directed software orchestrates each Porter autonomous pallet moving robot–or a whole fleet of them - to reduce travel times and avoid warehouse congestion. Ocado’s Fulfillment Execution System (FES) groups orders to maximise case picking, optimise route plans and reduce steps between picks. Meanwhile, machine learning prioritises and plans pallet stacking intelligently to avoid product damage.

“Porter from OIA automates low value, manual tasks and fosters a more productive workplace by supporting associates, increasing case picking rates, and automating the movement of high volumes of inventory,” says Jeff Larson, Director of Solutions Design for Ocado Mobile Robot System at OIA.

“Companies in third-party logistics, retail, e-commerce, distribution, and healthcare can maximise warehouse productivity and scale operations up or down easily without depending on manual forklifts and expensive certified forklift drivers.”

Reckon.ai powered Carrefour BuyBye interactive fridge deployed at Auderghem, Belgium hypermarket

Carrefour Belgium has developed a new autonomous micro-store concept, Carrefour BuyBye, in association with Reckon.AI, with the aim of tapping into opportunities beyond traditional retail.

The initiative has now seen a trial of an interactive fridge section at an Auderghem hypermarket.

""We’re proud to mark a new milestone with Carrefour Belgium, bringing smart stores to one of the largest hypermarkets in Auderghem - unlocking new revenue streams with ease,"" says Ana Pinto, CEO at Reckon.ai. ""Trusted by Carrefour, our solution is live at HQ, franchised stores, and Publicis, with roll-outs expanding to hospitals, stations, and universities, driving growth and creating value together.""

He adds: ""After successful technical tests, we’re now diving into financial viability assessments to measure its potential impact. The journey has already begun with Carrefour BuyBye units up and running at our Service Centre in Zaventem, in franchised stores, at our partner Publicis, and in other strategic locations such as hospitals, offices, and more.”

“We’re excited to see how the latest test at the Auderghem hypermarket unfolds. A huge thank you to all the teams who brought this idea to life. Your dedication is paving the way for a more innovative and effortless shopping experience. This is just the beginning as we continue to build the future for our customers.""

Retail media startup Thanks bags $2.6 million in seed funding and adds eBay and Zip to partner list

Fashion rules as Vinted CEO Adam Jay once again bags top spot in RTS Retail Disruptors Report

Adam Jay, CEO at controversial fashion resale platform Vinted, has once again taken top spot in the Retail Disruptors & Innovators report, released today by Retail Technology Show.

This is an annual report championing progressive individuals from across the sector, who are driving seismic change across the retail landscape.

Jay holds on to his number one position for the second year in a row, for continuing to grow Vinted’s pre-loved marketplace at pace while simultaneously putting second hand and circular retail models back at the forefront of fashion.

He was followed by Carl Pei, Founder and CEO at Nothing, a challenger smartphone and tech brand that’s aiming to make tech and gadgets “fun again” in second place, while third place was shared by brothers and co-founding duo of performance sportswear brand, Castore.

Soon to be launched at its Montego-Bay and Waterloo locations, the new segment will stock an elite line of skincare, make-up and perfume brands.
Orá, which represents Fontana’s strategic expansion into the premium beauty segment, the company’s management said aligns with its broader vision that seeks to enhance the retail experience while meeting a growing customer demand for luxury beauty products.
The introduction of the new product line is expected to redefine the beauty retail landscape in Jamaica.
“We recognise the evolving preferences of our customers and the increasing demand for globally renowned beauty brands.","PHARMACEUTICAL retailer Fontana Limited is expecting to push up revenues with the roll-out of its new luxury beauty and self-care Orá by Fontana segment.

Soon to be launched at its Montego-Bay and Waterloo locations, the new segment will stock an elite line of skincare, make-up and perfume brands.

Orá, which represents Fontana’s strategic expansion into the premium beauty segment, the company’s management said aligns with its broader vision that seeks to enhance the retail experience while meeting a growing customer demand for luxury beauty products. The introduction of the new product line is expected to redefine the beauty retail landscape in Jamaica.

Considered an investment in the future of beauty retail, the line aims to strengthen Fontana’s market position, introducing new, high-value categories as it enhances overall brand equity.

“Having already established ourselves as a leader in the beauty industry, this line comes as a natural extension, moving into more luxurious brands that customers will have access to there. We’ve seen a lot of success with much of what we’ve been doing recently as we added some new perfume lines and the customers still have been asking for more, so we’re just trying to meet the demand,” CEO Anne Chang told the Jamaica Observer of the rationale behind Orá’s onboarding.

“We recognise the evolving preferences of our customers and the increasing demand for globally renowned beauty brands. Orá allows us to create a more immersive and elevated shopping experience, reinforcing Fontana’s commitment to innovation and excellence in retail,” she also noted in a company release.

Among the international beauty brands to be sold in the curated portfolio of products are Hermès, Ralph Lauren, Armani, Lancôme, Prada, Viktor & Rolf, and several others. Some of these brands making their debut in Jamaica through Orá, Chang said, will offer beauty enthusiasts access to a wider range of premium products not usually available locally.

“The addition of these products will certainly augur well for revenue growth as they are usually sold at higher price points. Right now a Jimmy Choo perfume in our regular section costs about $13,000 but some of these we’ll be stocking for Orá will be priced from $20000 and upwards,” Chang further said to Sunday Finance.

“We know that as we get to higher price points, products in this segment are not expected to carry mass appeal, which is why we decided to launch first in our two larger and busiest locations as we seek to sort of test the market,” she added.

The roll-out of Orás due to come first for the two city locations precedes a longer-term plan to launch the segment in other stores across the Fontana chain, based on the rate of take-up. The segment will officially go live at the locations in April.

“The one at Waterloo will be housed in-store while that in Fairview will be adjacent to Fontana Fairview in Montego Bay. Both are to form part of Fontana’s larger operation and not to be seen as stand-alone businesses,” Chang said.

On the heels of its recent acquisition of the Monarch pharmacies, Fontana, which now operates approximately seven stores across six parishes, is now busy finalising plans to convert the Monarch outlets into Fontanas.

“We’re currently taking over the four Monarchs as we add these two new segments, which makes it technically about six projects that we have to be focused on right now so we have our hands full. Reconfiguring the Monarchs will take time — as we can’t convert all the stores immediately — so that’s what we’ll really be focused on this year as well as the two Orás that we’re bringing on stream,” the CEO said.

Fontana’s revenues climbing to $4.8 billion up to the end of the six-month December 31 period saw approximately $2.7 billion earned over the three-month period, driven by improved performance across all locations coupled with increases in all key metrics, based on sales by category, scripts, average scripts, and number of transactions. Net profit earned for the six months was $402.5 million and $326.6 million for the quarter. These follow revenues of $8.1 billion in 2024 and profit of $590 million.",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/jamaicaobserver/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/445389781a1bad0b5fe9690730df2d56.jpg,N,,2025-03-16 12:01:26.700332

The announcement, made late Friday night, revealed plans for liquidation could begin as early as the week of March 17, 2025, subject to court approval. The retail giant aims to complete the process by June 15, 2025.

Despite the grim outlook, Hudson's Bay executives expressed hope for financial assistance from key stakeholders. ""Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates,"" stated Hudson's Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell. Unfortunately, discussions around restructuring have failed to produce the necessary capital to avoid this unprecedented step.

On March 15, 2025, employees across Hudson's Bay locations were left reeling from the announcement. Staff members at the Hudson’s Bay Market Mall location in Calgary were seen reflecting solemnly on what this decision means for their futures. One long-time employee lamented, ""It’s pretty emotional for everyone; we were always hopeful."" Many others speculated openly about the company's fate, with thoughts of closing dates looming heavily over the workforce, comprised of about 9,364 staff members nationwide, who may soon find themselves unemployed.

Signs of distress within the company have been apparent for several months now. Reports indicate frequent disruptions, with some outlets struggling to maintain basic services; for example, the sliding glass doors at the north entrance at some locations are nonfunctional due to lack of maintenance. The Bay's troubles have hit home for many; customers and employees alike voiced their heartbreak over the potential loss of such a staple of Canadian culture.

The Hudson's Bay Company's history is steeped deeply within the fabric of Canada; not only has it served as a retail haven, but it's also held nostalgic significance for many citizens. Gary Long and his partner, Darlene Selby, who were at the Market Mall browsing familiar patterned blankets, expressed their sadness over the impending closure. “This chain was integral to our childhood and family traditions; it feels like losing part of our history.”

Hudson's Bay filed for creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) less than two weeks prior to the liquidation announcement, citing significant financial troubles. The company owes approximately $950 million to nearly 1,900 creditors, including notable brands such as Ralph Lauren and Estée Lauder, who are now facing potential losses of their own.

Experts predict the closure will leave significant voids within the shopping mall space, particularly as the Bay has been regarded as one of Canada’s retail anchors. Bruce Winder, a retail analyst, noted, ""It’s going to leave a significant-sized hole; the Bay from a legacy standpoint was an anchor and there isn’t an heir apparent to take their place.” With declining foot traffic and changing consumer habits favoring online shopping, the turn of events for Hudson's Bay seems almost emblematic of larger trends impacting traditional retailers.

Through this turmoil, the affect on employees is palpable, particularly for those who have dedicated decades to the company. Dwayne Gunness, president of Unifor Local 40, expressed concerns about what this means for the employees' pension plans and severance packages. “Some members have put 20, 30 years with the employer, and they fear they may not receive the compensation owed to them,” he pointed out.

Customers have already begun preparing for the worst, with many taking advantage of upcoming liquidation sales to secure mementos. Corey Gordon and his wife, who drove hours from St. Paul on March 14, expressed their commitment to benefit from the Bay's offerings, purchasing items like Hudson's Bay blankets and dishes. For Gordon, this store is steeped with memories: ""My uncle, who was more like a grandfather, was a Winnipegger. I have been coming here all my life.”

The emotional weight carried by shoppers and employees reflects not just the loss of income—it's about losing the heart of communal shopping and social connection often found within such historic establishments. Today, as customers flock to their local Hudson's Bay stores for what may be their final purchases, the sentiment is clear: the closing of Hudson's Bay is more than just another retail business disappearing; it’s the fading of shared experiences woven through generations.

Even amid all the uncertainty, there lies the potential for some restructuring. The company has reportedly secured $16 million of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, which could bolster the company’s last-ditch efforts to sidestep total liquidation, providing there is sufficiently positive engagement from landlords and investors. If there is even the smallest glimmer of hope for keeping parts of the company afloat, it would require significant backing.

Retail characterized by brick-and-mortar establishments is at several turning points; Hudson's Bay serves as both the cautionary tale and rallying point for what remains. The very fabric of shopping experience, relationships formed within these walls, brings with it the stark realization—retail is transforming, and the loss of such giants could signify the end of what many longtime shoppers cherished.

With the impending timeline for liquidations—marking the close of what many have regarded as their retail home—there is little time left for customers and employees alike to adjust to the reality of delivering final goodbyes to their beloved Hudson's Bay stores.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/Hu4li5YLGElo-rt-68DRjd4nei0=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F5a36d26b-d418-4262-9d0e-9e20e81dbda0.jpeg,N,,2025-03-16 13:00:38.987051

With the future of Hudson's Bay hanging precariously, all eyes are set on the legal proceedings and the required actions moving forward.","TORONTO — Hudson's Bay Company has announced plans to initiate immediate liquidation, beginning next week and projected to conclude by June 15, 2025, due to difficulties securing financial stability necessary for operation. The closure would affect approximately 9,364 employees across Hudson's Bay stores, three Saks Fifth Avenue locations, and 13 Saks Off 5th stores across Canada.

The company's recent statements indicate hope for securing the required capital to avoid full shutdown, pending court proceedings scheduled for Monday, March 17. ""Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates..."" said Liz Rodbell, President and CEO of Hudson's Bay, emphasizing the company's intention to explore all possible avenues to keep its doors open.

Founded in 1670, Hudson's Bay operates approximately 80 stores internationally. Despite its historical significance and long-standing presence within Canadian commerce, the company now faces dire circumstances, attributing the need for liquidation to inadequate financing and persistent economic challenges.

The imminent liquidation plan follows the company's filing for creditor protection with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which revealed staggering debts of over $950 million owed to various creditors, including landlords, suppliers, and partners like Ralph Lauren and Estee Lauder. The filing highlights significant struggles, reflected by the company's deferment of payments to suppliers, landlords, and service providers for months.

Factors leading to Hudson's Bay's financial turmoil include subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and shifts in consumer shopping behavior exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Store closures have not been uncommon for the retailer; the company had previously spun off its U.S. Saks locations to separate entities to address financial issues. By drawing attention to its most profitable divisions, Hudson's Bay attempted to inject needed capital and refocus its operational strategy.

Despite these previous adaptations, Hudson's Bay's predicament became increasingly severe as the flow of revenue continued to deteriorate. Issues peaked recently, as evidenced by landlords denying access to some storefronts due to nonpayment actions, with reports of attempts to seize merchandise from various locations.

The geographical distribution of Hudson's Bay's stores includes 32 locations concentrated in Ontario, where more than half of the workforce resides. Other provinces, such as British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec, also hold strategic stores, signifying the brand's extensive reach and historical constitution of the Canadian retail environment.

Richard Baker, the American businessman and owner of Hudson's Bay through his National Realty and Development Corp., acquired the retailer for $1.1 billion back in 2008. Under his leadership, Hudson's Bay went public, which proved challenging as its stock performance suffered, particularly nearing the onset of the pandemic. Baker has continually asserted the necessity of patience and long-term investment to manifest future value at the intersection of real estate and retail.

Recent events have incited discussions surrounding the nature of economic recovery, with many pointing to Hudson's Bay as indicative of wider issues facing the retail sector, particularly against fast-evolving consumer preferences and online competition. The potential ramifications of the liquidation extend beyond mere closures; it is expected to leave significant vacancies within premium mall spaces, displacing these anchor tenants and indicating shifts within established shopping districts.

While the outlook appears bleak for Hudson's Bay, not all hope is lost. Following its bankruptcy announcement, the company remains committed to exploring refinancing options and appealing for assistance from stakeholders. The responsibility now lies with Hudson's Bay to convince court officials and investors of the viability of its operations moving forward.

With the financial ramifications of this development poised to affect both consumers and employees alike, Canadian shoppers are reminiscing about the brand's legacy and the memories tied to Hudson's Bay. The company has continued to be recognized for its historical contribution to the fabric of Canada, dating back to its founding during the era of fur trading. Its demise would mark the end of significant Canadian retail tradition.

The outcome of the upcoming court ruling will play a pivotal role not only for Hudson's Bay Company but for the many individuals who depend on its economic success. Retail culture, particularly within Canada, is poised for significant changes should the company be unable to navigate through its challenges successfully.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.
It said that “without an immediate liquidation across retail stores, it is not expected” that Hudson’s Bay would be able to repay its obligations under the financing it did secure.
The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.
The bulk of the company’s stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work.","Analysts say the planned liquidation of Hudson’s Bay will leave a hole in the country’s retail landscape, as Canada’s oldest company prepares to wind down in the coming months unless it can find a last-minute solution.

Retail experts attribute a combination of missteps that led to Friday night’s announcement from Hudson’s Bay, which said it would begin liquidating its entire business as soon as next week, pending court approval.

The department store chain that dates back to 1670 and now spans 80 stores said it has been forced toward a full liquidation because “exhaustive” efforts haven’t turned up the financing it needs to keep at least some of its empire alive.

A closure of the entire business, which is planned pending a court appearance set for Monday, would mean job losses for 9,364 employees the company has in Canada across its Hudson’s Bay stores, as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations it owns through a licensing agreement.

The liquidation process would wrap up in June.

“It’s really, really sad, because of how many people are going to be impacted because of this,” said Liza Amlani, co-founder of the Retail Strategy Group.

“It is an iconic brand. It’s important to Canadians, and there will be a gap in the market if The Bay completely disappears.”

But Amlani said the writing had been on the wall for some time.

She said customers likely noticed the lack of investment by Hudson’s Bay into its physical stores, where it wasn’t uncommon to find non-functioning escalators that went unrepaired for long periods of time. Amlani also pointed to several stores in the Vancouver area that temporarily closed last summer related to problems with air-conditioning systems.

She said another problem the company ran into in recent years was that its stores’ hours didn’t always align with that of the malls where they are located.

“Considering a department store’s original function is to be an anchor store — a gateway to the mall, let’s say — the fact that the store hours were different, and that has continued to today, that is absolutely an issue,” said Amlani.

“In tourist destinations like the Eaton Centre, for example, if the store is closed and the mall is open, that is a problem. That is something that the customer will notice and then they’ll tell other customers.”

Though the situation looks bleak, the company said it remains optimistic it can drum up capital and find a solution with key stakeholders, particularly its landlord partners, to avoid a full shutdown.

“Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates who have shared heartfelt stories about Hudson’s Bay and what our stores have meant to them, their families, and their communities across the generations,” said Hudson’s Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell in a statement on Friday night.

While the company’s coast-to-coast footprint and its 17th century fur trade origins have made it a quintessential part of the fabric of Canada, it has been led by Americans for several decades.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

That marked “the point at which the company began its slow death,” said Joanne McNeish, an associate professor at Toronto Metropolitan University specializing in marketing.

“Investment firms are like house flippers … A house flipper rarely deals with the underlying business issues,” she said in an email.

“Investment companies don’t allow the management team to run businesses. Rather they take their profit, sell on the problems to the next company or break up the company to sell off its assets.”

Baker took the company public in 2012 and then turned it private again with a takeover bid that had to be boosted twice to earn shareholder approval in the weeks before Canada was hit with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Shareholders were difficult to appease in part because Baker presided over HBC while its stock was dropping — but many thought the company still carried immense value in its real estate.

“If we look at the Bay, I speculate that the management team has not been allowed to make the financial and effort investments in running the business for success for the past 17 years,” said McNeish.

“The result is a stagnation in the presentation of the company, and limited the changes that might have allowed the company to continue to be a strong competitor in the retail landscape.”

In documents filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on Friday, Hudson’s Bay said it plans to sell off its assets over the coming months, pending court approval, which could include an auction process if it receives multiple qualified bids.

The company said a store-by-store liquidation is necessary because it has only secured “limited” debtor-in-possession financing — a form of capital companies can seek for restructuring purposes after they make creditor protection filings.

It said that “without an immediate liquidation across retail stores, it is not expected” that Hudson’s Bay would be able to repay its obligations under the financing it did secure.

Given the company’s “limited liquidity,” it wants to conclude the liquidation process by June 15, Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson’s Bay’s parent company, said in an affidavit filed in court Friday.

The company’s plea for help comes roughly a week after it laid bare its financial struggles in a creditor protection application. The documents said it was facing financial struggles because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

The filings show the company owes more than $950 million to 26 pages’ worth of listed creditors: landlords, suppliers and other partners, including fashion heavyweights Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel and Estee Lauder.

On Saturday, the union representing approximately 320 workers at the company’s Windsor, Kitchener and Sherwood Gardens stores, and its Toronto e-commerce warehouse, called on Hudson’s Bay “to uphold its legal obligations to workers” and provide “clear communication” about potential store closures, layoffs and severance protections.

“HBC must act in good faith by ensuring workers receive the wages, benefits, and severance they are entitled to under their collective agreements,” Unifor national president Lana Payne said in a statement.

“Workers’ livelihoods are on the line — they’re rightfully concerned and deserve full transparency from HBC.”

A full liquidation in Canada would also leave anchor tenant spaces in malls and prestige real estate in high-traffic shopping districts in need of filling. The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.

The bulk of the company’s stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work.

But CVS shoppers don't need to worry, as the retailer is planning to open smaller stores with fewer products, targeting locations with higher traffic.

This comes after 900 store closures between 2022 and 2024, leaving CVS with 9,144 pharmacies across the U.S.

A spokesperson said: “Even after the realignment work, 85% of people in the U.S. will still live within 10 miles of a CVS Pharmacy.”

While CVS hasn't released a list of the stores set to close, locations with overlap or low footfall are expected to be the first one to go.

No timeline has been given yet either.

But it’s not all bad news as CVS is still expanding.

The company plans to open 30 new locations this year, including inside Target stores, and has added 100 new locations since 2022.

It comes after CVS confirmed it would be cutting around 2,900 jobs as bosses revealed they will be investing in technology.

the cuts will primarily impact those within the corporate sector, per the CBS affiliate WPRI-TV.

Mike DeAngelis, a spokesperson, explained that the job losses are a consequence of changing shopping trends, expectations, and disruption.

The cuts are part of a $2 billion cost-cutting drive intended to reduce business expenses.

Chiefs will also look at ways to boost efficiency within the company.

Execs have warned how vital it is for the company to remain competitive.

They also tried to give a reassuring message to shoppers.

""The reductions will not impact front-line jobs in our stores, pharmacies, and distribution centers,"" said DeAngelis.

Meanwhile, a CVS executive has admitted that one of the store’s policies to combat theft has not been welcomed among all shoppers.

Bosses at the drugstore chain have resorted to locking items away in cabinets.

CVS is not alone in implementing the measure as locked cabinets are a feature in Walmart, Walgreens and Target stores.

And, the measure has not been appreciated by all shoppers.

Tilak Mandadi, the executive vice president of ventures at CVS Health and its chief digital, data, analytics and technology officer, admitted the anti-theft tool had proved unpopular.

“People really, really dislike locked cabinets,” he told the Wall Street Journal.

The coffee chain has also recently simplified and refreshed its menu to ""help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company,"" Starbucks told USA TODAY in a statement last month. Earlier this year, the company also reversed its open-door policy regarding restrooms, now requiring people order something from the menu to use the restroom or hang out in the store.

All of these adjustments are part of the ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy, instituted by Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle CEO who left to become Starbucks' chief executive in September 2024.

“We’re working hard to ensure our coffeehouses have the right vibe,"" Niccol said Wednesday during a meeting with shareholders. ""We want to invite customers in, showcase our great coffee, provide a comfortable place to stay, and make them feel like their visit was time well spent.”

Starbucks wants to regain its 'third place' status

The idea of Starbucks as a ""third place,"" a destination beyond home and work, isn't new; it's a philosophy also touted by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. However, the expansion of mobile ordering and grab and go pickup has made coffee shops sometimes feel more like a waystation.

Starbucks hopes to strengthen and regain its connection with customers. “I'm happy to say the third place is alive and well. It's as needed as it ever was,” Niccol said. ""We're working hard to ensure our coffee houses have the right vibe. We want to invite customers in, showcase our great coffee, provide a comfortable place to stay, and make them feel like their visit was time well spent.

For instance, Starbucks is testing new store designs at ""select locations across the U.S.,"" Niccol said. At the same time, stores have brought back condiment bars and serving in-store coffee in ceramic mugs, as well as having baristas write on cups with Sharpies, he said.

""Imagine coffee houses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating options, power outlets, and abundant food displays,"" he said. ""Stores with more separation between the café and mobile order experience, featuring new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create an intuitive handoff, and cafes anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater to the experience and enhances the connection between our baristas and our customers.""

The company is also setting a goal of delivering ""a high-quality beverage in four minutes or less with a moment of connection,"" Niccol said.

'Back to Starbucks' strategy 'gaining traction'

Niccol is looking to turn a sales tide at the coffee houses. Starbucks reported comparable sales down 2% in the U.S. and worldwide in the 2024 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 29, 2024. And global comparable sales fell 4% in the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year, which ended Dec. 29, 2024, the company reported.

Starbucks isn't alone in seeing a year-over-year decline in visitation trends in February, said R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, which estimates visits to locations by tracking millions of devices and using machine learning. That trend has hit many restaurants ""amid economic uncertainty and unfavorable weather conditions,"" he said.

But Starbucks' efforts may be working, Hottovy said. ""Foot traffic has improved compared to the declines seen last summer, indicating that elements of the 'Back to Starbucks' strategy and improving the in-store experience are gaining traction,” he said.

Restructuring would save jobs and preserve tenancy in retail locations, but “would necessitate significant capital and immediate and substantial cooperation from landlords and other critical partners,” it said in a news release Friday evening.

Article content

A closure of the entire business would mean job losses for 9,364 employees the company has in Canada across its Hudson’s Bay stores, as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations it owns through a licensing agreement.

Article content

The company said store liquidations could start next week. During this process, Bay stores, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Saks Off 5th stores will remain open. The store’s online site will also stay open “for a limited time.”

Article content

The liquidation news comes after the beleaguered company sought creditor protection from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on March 7.

In its application, Hudson’s Bay said it was facing financial struggles because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

A closure of the entire business, which is planned pending a court appearance set for Monday, would mean job losses for 9,364 employees the company has in Canada across its Hudson’s Bay stores, as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations it owns through a licensing agreement.

Though the situation looks bleak, the company said it remains optimistic it can drum up capital and find a solution with key stakeholders, particularly its landlord partners, to avoid a full shutdown.

“Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates who have shared heartfelt stories about Hudson’s Bay and what our stores have meant to them, their families, and their communities across the generations,” said Hudson’s Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell in a statement on Friday night.

“These powerful experiences remind us why we must continue to pursue every possible opportunity to secure the necessary support from key landlords and other stakeholders to save The Bay.”

The department store chain dates back to 1670 and now spans 80 stores.

Store-by store liquidation ‘necessary’

Hudson’s Bay said it plans to sell off its assets over the coming months, pending court approval, which could include an auction process if it receives multiple qualified bids.

The company said a store-by-store liquidation is necessary because it has only secured “limited” debtor-in-possession financing — a form of capital companies can seek for restructuring purposes after they make creditor protection filings.

It said that “without an immediate liquidation across retail stores, it is not expected” that Hudson’s Bay would be able to repay its obligations under the financing it did secure.

Given the company’s “limited liquidity,” it wants to conclude the liquidation process by June 15, Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson’s Bay’s parent company, said in an affidavit filed in court Friday.

The company’s plea for help comes roughly a week after it laid bare its financial struggles in a creditor protection application it made with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

In its application, Hudson’s Bay said it was facing financial struggles because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

Company owes $950 million to many creditors

The filings show the company owes more than $950 million to 26 pages’ worth of listed creditors: landlords, suppliers and other partners, including fashion heavyweights Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel and Estee Lauder.

Bewley said in a March 7 court filing that the business had to defer certain payments to such companies for many months because it was having so much trouble making payments to landlords, service providers and vendors.

The situation was so severe that she said a landlord “unlawfully locked” Hudson’s Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S. and a team of bailiffs attempted to seize merchandise from another location it runs in Sherway Gardens, a suburban Toronto mall.

The March 7 filing was not meant to be the precursor to the closure of the business because Hudson’s Bay was intent to on keeping the company alive and as much of its sprawling footprint operational as possible.

One week later, the company finds itself in much more dire shape, saying its “exhaustive” efforts haven’t turned up the financing it needs.

Hudson’s Bay laid the groundwork for its creditor protection case when it spun its U.S. Saks locations off into a separate entity last year after it purchased luxury department stores Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, essentially saving them from the impending closures now set to engulf HBC in Canada.

A full liquidation in Canada wouldn’t just plunge a large portion of the country’s retail workforce into unemployment but would also leave anchor tenant spaces in malls and prestige real estate in high-traffic shopping districts in need of filling.

The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.

The bulk of the company’s stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16, Alberta and Quebec each have 13 and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.

Saks Fifth Avenue’s Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.

While the company’s coast-to-coast footprint and its 17th century fur trade origins have made it a quintessential part of the fabric of Canada, it has been led by Americans for several decades now.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

Baker took the company public in 2012 and then turned it private again with a takeover bid that had to be boosted twice to earn shareholder approval in the weeks before Canada was hit with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Shareholders were difficult to appease in part because Baker presided over HBC while its stock was dropping — but many thought the company still carried immense value in its real estate.

When he gained their approval, he admitted the brand had work to do.

“It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC’s potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,” he said in March 2020.

A handful of store closures and piecemeal layoffs over the last two years suggest that unleashing that potential was not easy as rivals like fellow Canadian department store Simon’s expanded and online giants such as Amazon gobbled up sales.

Corporate layoffs In late February, Starbucks laid off 1,100 corporate employees.
As part of the company turnaround, Starbucks was “creating smaller, more nimble teams,” he said in a letter to employees.","Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is focused on bringing the company back to its roots. During his first shareholders meeting this week he repeated two of the concepts guiding his changes: a simpler company, and feedback from customers and workers.

Some of the plans are already in motion. In Starbucks cafes, he’s dropped menu items. He’s created delineation between “to-go” and “for here” customers, the latter of whom get their coffee served in ceramic mugs. Niccol also announced sweeping layoffs in an effort to cut the corporate payroll.

But the company is dealing with a frustrated union representing its baristas, attacks on its diverse hiring practices and criticism for allowing its CEO to be based away from the Seattle headquarters.

Diversity

Corporations are facing public relations battles over diversity, equity and inclusion policies, with the Trump administration as one of the more prominent antagonists. Those skirmishes have slipped into board rooms and the courts.

Another Seattle-area retail company, Costco, faced a shareholders proposal earlier this year that targeted its DEI policies. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank, pitched a proposal that if approved would have had Costco probe its DEI practices for legal risks. Costco shareholders rejected it.

Starbucks faced a proposal this week from a shareholder represented by Houston-based financial adviser Patron Partners. In short, they asked Starbucks to depoliticize its charitable giving, Patron Partners managing partner Rick Figueroa said during the meeting on behalf of the shareholder.

Through its Giving Match program, Starbucks matches any financial donations made by its employees, and hours they’ve volunteered. It has a few stipulations, as only 501(c)(3) public charities and registered charities in Canada qualify. The company also does not allow donations to professional and political organizations or those listed on the Southern Poverty Law Center hate group list.

The proposal requested an analysis on how Starbucks’ “contributions impact its risks related to discrimination against individuals based on their speech or religious exercise.” It also opposed Starbucks’ corporate partnership with the Human Rights Campaign, a pro-LGBTQ+ organization.

Leading up to the meeting, Starbucks’ board urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. It was overwhelmingly voted down.

During the Wednesday meeting, Niccol was also asked about a lawsuit filed against Starbucks in February by the state of Missouri. The lawsuit claims the company’s hiring practices are discriminatory. Starbucks has said the allegations were inaccurate and that the company’s hiring practices are inclusive and competitive.

“I think it’s great that we reflect the diversity of our customers and we reflect the diversity of our team members and partners that are in every single one of our stores,” Niccol said. “Diversity is going to continue to be a key strength of our business and frankly, helps us connect with our customers at another level.”

Union contract

On Tuesday, six union-represented Starbucks locations staged walkouts, including one in Seattle. Baristas demanded a finalized contract. In December, unionized baristas launched strikes during the holiday shopping season, including at the Roastery in Seattle.

Niccol was asked during the meeting when Starbucks would finalize a contract with the union. He handed the question off to the company’s chief partner officer, Sara Kelly.

Kelly said the company and the union were committed to working with a mediator, and that the two parties have been at the table for nine months “making great progress.” She did not say when she expects a contract to be inked.

“That mediator is supporting us as we look to really negotiate a foundational framework that will serve for single-store contracts,” Kelly said.

In a news release Tuesday, Michelle Eisen with the Starbucks Workers United union bargaining committee called Starbucks’ most recent offer pitiful.

“We are still without a first contract from a company who can certainly afford to do right by its workers,” said Eisen, a Buffalo, N.Y.-based barista who’s been with Starbucks for 15 years.

Corporate layoffs

In late February, Starbucks laid off 1,100 corporate employees. Hundreds of workers based in the company’s Sodo neighborhood headquarters were affected.

In the announcement, Niccol called it a necessary change to position Starbucks for success. As part of the company turnaround, Starbucks was “creating smaller, more nimble teams,” he said in a letter to employees. The layoffs and elimination of hundreds of open roles were meant to target redundancy.

Niccol expanded on the rationale for the layoffs on Wednesday when asked. He said the company was focused on accountability and efficiency.

“I think it’s really important the corporate structure is set up to first and foremost serve the store, support the customer experience and support the partner experience,” Niccol said. “This was all about simplifying some complexity, getting clarity of who’s responsible for what.”

Layoffs weren’t the only part of Niccol’s corporate restructuring. The company is ratcheting up its in-person policy. Employees are only required to be in the office three days per week, but future roles will be based in Seattle or Toronto, signaling a departure from remote status options.

The company is also revoking remote status permission for executives at the vice president level and above.

Corporate aircraft

Niccol is based in Newport Beach, Calif. In Starbucks’ offer letter to him, the company said he wouldn’t be forced to move to the Seattle headquarters and would have use of the corporate jet for his travel to Seattle, other office locations and stores, according to an August regulatory filing. He’s also eligible for up to $250,000 worth of personal travel per year on the company’s aircraft.

In response to a question about his work and travel arrangements and any environment impacts, Niccol defended his use of the jet.

“Obviously Starbucks serves customers in over 88 markets,” he said. “The CEO, in this case myself, needs to be where the business needs to be.”

Starbucks’ chief legal officer, Brad Lerman, said the company is focused on mitigating any environmental impact from Niccol’s travel. He said Starbucks purchases low-emission fuel and aircraft that are more efficient.

“These are things that the board looks at, that management looks at carefully, and it’s carefully governed,” Lerman said.

Last year, Niccol incurred $72,398 in expenses related to his use of Starbucks’ aircraft traveling between Newport Beach and Seattle, according to a Jan. 24 regulatory filing. Another $19,367 in expenses were related to his personal use of the jet.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/03142025_tzr_tzr_133116.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-03-15 13:03:36.736488

The court proceedings set for March 17, 2025, will be pivotal, with expectations for Hudson’s Bay to apply for extensions and possibly clarify store closure strategies.","Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), Canada's oldest retailer, is on the brink of closure as it prepares to begin liquidations as early as next week. The announcement came late on Friday, March 14, 2025, putting over 9,000 jobs at risk across its operations. Origins of this predicament trace back to the company's longstanding financial struggles, which have worsened significantly amid subdued consumer spending and shifting market dynamics.

Founded in 1670, HBC operates 80 department stores across Canada, and its proposed liquidation threatens 9,364 employees associated with Hudson’s Bay stores as well as its three Saks Fifth Avenue and 13 Saks Off 5th locations. The company recently filed for creditor protection to stave off immediate bankruptcy, but it announced last week the serious difficulties it faces.

“The closure of the company could become inevitable,” stated Jennifer Bewley, chief financial officer for Hudson’s Bay’s parent company, during her court filings. The company, which owes over $950 million to creditors ranging from Ralph Lauren and Chanel to Estée Lauder, admitted needing to defer payments to vendors and landlords for several months due to its dire financial standing.

The initial creditor protection application was made on March 7, 2025, as HBC grappled with debts and operational costs, and highlighted the significant impact of trade tensions, reduced consumer spending, and declining downtown traffic post-COVID-19. Central to the company’s restructuring strategy is the urgent need for more liquidity to avoid total liquidation.

Hudson’s Bay continues to seek support from key stakeholders, particularly landlords, as it attempts to raise necessary capital. CEO Liz Rodbell expressed determination, stating, “Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates who have shared heartfelt stories about Hudson’s Bay.”

Despite these optimistic words, the outlook looks bleak. Due to limited debtor-in-possession financing available for restructuring, HBC acknowledged the imperative of moving to store-by-store liquidations.

Richard Baker, who purchased HBC for $1.1 billion back in 2008, took the company public and then private again, is no stranger to challenging circumstances. Since the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Baker's leadership has been closely tied to efforts meant to revive the company against competition from industry rivals as well as online giants like Amazon, which have gained significant market share.

Should Hudson’s Bay proceed with liquidation, it would not only lead to massive job losses but also leave substantial retail spaces vacant, impacting high-traffic shopping centers. Currently, the province of Ontario hosts the majority of HBC’s operations, with 32 stores, followed by British Columbia with 16, and both Alberta and Quebec with 13 stores each.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, HBC's financial documents detail roughly $920,000 owed to Vancouver Island creditors, with significant sums due to Central Walk—amounting to about $860,000—associated with mall properties where Hudson’s Bay stores operate. The Kingdom of British Columbia itself is owed approximately $2.88 million and is likely to prioritize loan recoveries over small unsecured creditors.

Creditors on Vancouver Island include AllFire Access Pro, owed around $30,940, and Haven Security, which is awaiting $19,400. The sentiment among these local businesses echoes the growing concern about HBC's solvency and operating future. Both creditors have noted delays and non-payments from HBC for over 18 months, severely impacting their operations.

Charles Schell, finance professor at Vancouver Island University, remarked on the situation: “Small unsecured creditors will likely not see any money from Hudson’s Bay as insolvency managers wind down operations.” His analysis indicates secured creditors, such as investment firms and banks, will take precedence during the debt resolution process.

The court proceedings set for March 17, 2025, will be pivotal, with expectations for Hudson’s Bay to apply for extensions and possibly clarify store closure strategies. While the fate of its numerous locations remains uncertain, the hope is for some path to maintain operations as the retail giant grapples with its historical significance and modern challenges.

HBC's long history, entwined with Canada’s early colonial days, has solidified it as more than just a retailer but also as part of the nation's fabric. The impending liquidation delivers stark reminders of how much the retail industry is changing and how traditional business models are under pressure, forcing companies like Hudson’s Bay to rethink their strategies dramatically.

Hong Kong: Chinese food and beverage brands are gaining ground across Southeast Asia, offering alternatives to big name American chains and expanding Beijing’s commercial and cultural influence in neighbouring economies.

The Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world’s largest F&B chain by number of outlets, overtaking Starbucks and McDonald’s. The company, whose brand name Mixue Bingcheng means “Honey Snow Ice City”, in Chinese, is capitalising on the region-wide sweet tooth with affordable offerings of ice cream, coffee and bubble tea drinks.

“Even on social media like TikTok and others, there is a joke that any empty shophouse would soon turn into a Mixue store,” Rahma Yuliana said, referring to a popular saying in Indonesia, where Mixue has more than 2,600 outlets.

The single mother, who runs an online business, takes her daughter for afterschool treats that won’t drain her wallet, such as a cup of brown sugar milk tea that costs USD 1.10, about one-third cheaper than similar offerings by rival Taiwanese tea chain Chatime. An ice cream sells for as little as 50 cents, undercutting McDonald’s.

As of September, the Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores carrying its Mixue tea drinks, ice creams and Lucky Cup coffee products, more than the store numbers of Starbucks and McDonald’s, industry analysts reported. About 40,000 of those are in China.

More broadly, by December, Chinese F&B brands had opened over 6,100 outlets in Southeast Asia, Singapore-headquartered research firm Momentum Works reported. India and Vietnam account for roughly two-thirds, while there are relatively more Chinese brands in Singapore and Malaysia, which have sizable Chinese-speaking populations.

Nearly all of Mixue’s stores are franchises that the company supplies with ingredients for drinks like Creamy Mango Boba, Mango Oats Jasmine Tea and Coconut Jelly Milk Tea.

Apart from Mixue, other market stars include hotpot giant Haidilao, Fish With You sauerkraut fish restaurants, and well-known beverage brands such as Luckin Coffee, Heytea and Chagee.

Mixue’s shares have doubled from their IPO price since their March 3 trading debut in Hong Kong.

Momentum Works CEO Jianggan Li said Chinese businesses are actively seeking new growth in Southeast Asia after facing fierce competition in their home market.

The push by food and drink retailers has raised awareness that China has more to offer than just cheap electronics. The companies are well-equipped, using automation to enhance their efficiency, and adept at online marketing, Li said.

Big Western brands sometimes take a long time to find local partners and develop long-term plans. The Chinese F&B companies are “much more impatient,” he said.

In Thailand’s capital Bangkok, Chinese entrepreneur Siya Han has invested over USD 1.37 million in 12 Mixue stores and about 10 other outlets selling spicy broth bowls, sauerkraut fish and fried chicken steaks in about six years.

Outlets in shopping malls take time to recover costs due to huge rent deposits, she said, but her other outlets typically break even within six months to a year, excluding their lease guarantees. “If you open Chinese restaurants slowly, you can’t survive,” she said.

In the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, Chinese sauerkraut fish chain Fish With You vice president Liu Liujun also spotted opportunity in Southeast Asia’s large ethnic Chinese population and growing economies.

The brand’s USD 2,35,000 investment in one of its Malaysian outlets paid off in just nine months, with lines out the door almost daily, said Liu, who oversees the company’s overseas expansion across the region.

A customer, Victoria Kovalan said the new Chinese brands made it easier for her to try new cuisines. “It’s opened up our palates,” she said, referring to the popularity of Sichuan hotpots, known for their spicy flavours.

Vietnamese student Nguyen Thu Hoài in Hanoi initially was sceptical about Mixue as a Chinese brand but has become a regular customer, she said, won over by its affordability and better-than-expected quality.

The expansion of Chinese food and beverage brands is part of a broader trend where Chinese goods are no longer seen as merely cheap but as having real value, said Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Recalling the cultural influence from McDonald’s global expansion, Mathews said he visited its first outlet in southern China’s economic hub of Guangzhou in the 1990s, where a clerk told him, “I want to go to America.”

If Chinese food brands exploded worldwide, they might have that influence, though the impact remains to be seen, he said. “China does have an uphill struggle to obtain soft power, but it’s doing an excellent job with its products,” he said.",https://media.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Mixue.jpg,N,,2025-03-15 16:04:01.677127

The situation was so severe that she said a landlord “unlawfully locked” Hudson’s Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S.
The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.
American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.
“It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC’s potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,” he said in March 2020.","Though the situation looks bleak, the company is holding out hope for a Hail Mary. It said it remains optimistic that it can drum up capital and find a solution with key stakeholders, particularly its landlord partners, to avoid a full shutdown.

“Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates who have shared heartfelt stories about Hudson’s Bay and what our stores have meant to them, their families, and their communities across the generations,” Hudson’s Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell.

“These powerful experiences remind us why we must continue to pursue every possible opportunity to secure the necessary support from key landlords and other stakeholders to save The Bay.”

The company’s plea for help comes roughly a week after it laid bare its financial struggles in a creditor protection application it made with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

In its application, Hudson’s Bay said it was facing financial struggles because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

The filings show the company owes more than $950 million to 26 pages’ worth of listed creditors: landlords, suppliers and other partners, including fashion heavyweights Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel and Estee Lauder.

Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson’s Bay’s parent company, said in a court filing made on March 7 that the business had to defer certain payments to such companies for many months because it was having so much trouble making payments to landlords, service providers and vendors.

The situation was so severe that she said a landlord “unlawfully locked” Hudson’s Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S. and a team of bailiffs attempted to seize merchandise from another location it runs in Sherway Gardens, a suburban Toronto mall.

The March 7 filing was not meant to be the precursor to the closure of the business because Hudson’s Bay was intent to on keeping the company alive and as much of its sprawling footprint operational as possible.

One week later, the company finds itself in much more dire shape. It said the store-by-store liquidation is necessary because it has only secured “limited” debtor-in-possession financing – a form of capital companies can seek for restructuring purposes after they make creditor protection filings.

Hudson’s Bay laid the groundwork for its creditor protection case when it spun its U.S. Saks locations off into a separate entity last year after it purchased luxury department stores Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, essentially saving them from the impending closures now set to engulf HBC in Canada.

A full liquidation in Canada wouldn’t just plunge a large portion of the country’s retail workforce into unemployment but would also leave anchor tenant spaces in malls and prestige real estate in high-traffic shopping districts in need of filling.

The sites Hudson’s Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.

The bulk of the company’s stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16, Alberta and Quebec each have 13 and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.

Saks Fifth Avenue’s Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.

While the company’s coast-to-coast footprint and its 17th century fur trade origins have made it a quintessential part of the fabric of Canada, it has been led by Americans for several decades now.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker’s National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson’s Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

Baker took the company public in 2012 and then turned it private again with a takeover bid that had to be boosted twice to earn shareholder approval in the weeks before Canada was hit with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Shareholders were difficult to appease in part because Baker presided over HBC while its stock was dropping – but many thought the company still carried immense value in its real estate.

When he gained their approval, he admitted the brand had work to do.

“It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC’s potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,” he said in March 2020.

A handful of store closures and piecemeal layoffs over the last two years suggest that unleashing that potential was not easy as rivals like fellow Canadian department store Simon’s expanded and online giants such as Amazon gobbled up sales.

While their core Coca-Cola business, spanning creative and production remained intact, losing the North American media account was a notable hit.
Meanwhile, Publicis Groupe celebrated.","In Atlanta’s quiet conference rooms, Coca-Cola’s headquarters became a battleground of digital strategy. At stake was the North American media planning and buying account, valued at an estimated USD 785 million in 2024 alone.

WPP had long ruled its $4 billion global account with Coca-Cola as a symbol of dominance. But three and a half years later, change was brewing beneath the surface.

Publicis Groupe, the former global runner-up, hadn’t stood still. Instead, it had strengthened its media portfolio, securing major wins with Pfizer and Hershey’s while mastering the shifting digital landscape. Now, with Coca-Cola’s closed-door review underway, Publicis saw a prime opportunity to take the lead.

The review was a high-stakes game of data, strategy, and persuasion. WPP, banking on its long-standing partnership, pitched continuity and global integration. Publicis, on the other hand, emphasised innovation, data-driven insights, and a localised strategy tailored to North America’s distinct market dynamics.

Tension ran high at WPP’s GroupM, where the review loomed large. As the backbone of WPP’s growth, any loss could shake the organisation, especially amid investor concerns over weak financials.

At Publicis Groupe, quiet determination took hold. Fuelled by ambition, their teams fine-tuned their strategy, highlighting proprietary data platforms and a deep understanding of North America’s fragmented media landscape.

The verdict, when it came, marked a shift. In a worded statement, Coca-Cola named Publicis Groupe a ""complementary partner"" for its US and Canada media business while reaffirming WPP as its ""only global marketing partner,"" with renewal talks in progress. Yet, the underlying message was unmistakable - a strategic transformation was in motion.

For WPP, the loss was a setback. While their core Coca-Cola business, spanning creative and production remained intact, losing the North American media account was a notable hit. Beyond the financial impact, it was a reminder that even the strongest partnerships weren’t untouchable.

Meanwhile, Publicis Groupe celebrated. The win validated their strategic investments and reinforced their media expertise. The USD 785 million account marked a major expansion in North America, strengthening their client portfolio, boosting confidence, even prompting an upward revision of their 2024 earnings forecast.

The impact of Coca-Cola’s decision sent ripples through the advertising world, signalling a shifting landscape where data, technology, and measurable results took centre stage. Established partnerships were no longer a given, and new contenders were rising.

Beyond strategy and numbers, the move highlighted the human element - relentless agency teams, the high-stakes decisions of executives and the vision driving change. Ambition, innovation, and resilience defined the contest.",https://static.businessworld.in/Picture 3 (18)_20250315124018_ogImage_30.jpg,N,,2025-03-15 05:02:41.773726

According to Rice, sensors are being installed at locations on the kitchen equipment that will instantaneously feed information to the edge computing system.
Some fans have already clapped back about the targeted promotions not working due to broken McFlurry machines.
Won't matter anyway, the machine is broken..."" a customer fumed on X. McDonald's hasn't disclosed how much the tech updates cost.","MCDONALD'S is in the middle of making some massive updates, and some are likely music to customers' ears.

Each of its over 43,000 locations is getting improved technology this year to help efficiency and the customer experience.

Some of that tech revolves around kitchen equipment like McFlurry machines, according to what Brian Rice, chief information officer at McDonald's, told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month.

The ice cream makers are infamous for breaking down frequently and have gotten a flood of complaints from consumers in recent years.

It's so known that Wendy's even made a jab at McDonald's for it during a marketing campaign in October.

Last February, a longtime fan complained about the espresso machines being broken at their local McDonald's in a post on X, and others were quick to call out the McFlurry machines as well.

CONTINUED CRITIQUES

""Try getting an ice cream cone!"" a peeved diner exclaimed.

""Just went to McDonald's and the mcflurry machine is broken. I'm going to crash my car now,"" another fumed earlier this year.

""Can I get a McFlurry or is the machine still broken?"" a third joked.

Even so, Rise assured that the tech advancements would eliminate the McFlurry machine issue and help McDonald's stay on top of other maintenance issues and resolve them quickly.

He also told WSJ that the company found that restaurants were becoming ""very stressful"" for workers due to overwhelmed and outdated systems, causing incorrect orders or broken machines.

""We have customers at the counter, we have customers at our drive-through, couriers coming in for delivery, delivery at curbside — that's a lot to deal with for our crew,"" he explained.

""Technology solutions will alleviate the stress.""

Pursuit of these improvements has been underway since the end of 2023, when McDonald's sought to implement Google Cloud for edge computing at its restaurants.

Edge computing allows McDonald's to look at data from its kitchen equipment and other electronic systems on-site rather than having it sent to a specific location like a data center for analysis.

Companies typically move to edge computing to improve efficiency, plus it's often cheaper.

KEEPING TRACK

Not to mention, a major advantage for McDonald's with edge computing is that it lets them know when kitchen equipment is getting worn down and might break soon to avoid order delays or an item having to be temporarily removed from the menu.

According to Rice, sensors are being installed at locations on the kitchen equipment that will instantaneously feed information to the edge computing system.

This allows for a ""real-time"" viewpoint into the states of any given location's operations.

With McDonald's including artificial intelligence in the upgrades, it can immediately analyze the data gathered by the sensors and notify staff of a potential maintenance issue, like for a McFlurry machine.

Other AI advances McDonald's is considering include computer vision, typically a facial-recognition based AI, but used instead in cameras to detect and analyze orders to ensure their accuracy before customers get them.

""If we can proactively address those issues before they occur, that's going to mean smoother operations in the future,"" Rice noted.

AI in the drive-thru is also moving forward, similar to recent decisions from competitors like Wendy's.

McDonald's has had voice-activated drive-thru tech since 2019 through International Business Machines, but ended its partnership last year.

MANAGER ASSIST

The fast food giant even seeks to use AI to assist staff as a ""generative AI virtual manager,"" per Rice.

That way the AI can make scheduling changes and select administrative decisions for managers, freeing them up to handle other responsibilities.

Customers could also start directly experiencing the impact of the AI updates at McDonald's soon through the mobile app.

Rice said McDonald's is tailoring promotional offers through AI's analysis of previous purchase history and even considering the weather.

""A customer who we know loves our sweet treats could get an offer through the app for a McFlurry on a hot summer day,"" he said.

Some fans have already clapped back about the targeted promotions not working due to broken McFlurry machines.

""They need facial recognition software to sell me a McFlurry in the summer? Won't matter anyway, the machine is broken..."" a customer fumed on X.

McDonald's hasn't disclosed how much the tech updates cost.

CEO Chris Kempczinski also recently confirmed the creation of a new team at the fast food giant that's ""devoted"" to taking on rivals like KFC.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/jwmconaldstech-op.jpg?1741957433&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-15 14:05:17.496503

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.
By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.
Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.
Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy — but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, “as soon as reasonably practicable.”","NEW YORK — Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.

The budget airline — known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes — said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.

The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.

While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be ""moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.”

In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.

In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said “let you choose how you want to fly.""

Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world's largest food and beverage chain by number of outlets, surpassing Starbucks and McDonald's.
As of September, Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores selling Mixue tea drinks, ice creams, and Lucky Cup coffee products, outnumbering Starbucks and McDonald's, according to industry analysts.
For Malaysian customer Victoria Kovalan, the influx of Chinese brands has made it easier to explore new cuisines.
“If Chinese food brands expand globally, they might have a similar influence, though the impact remains to be seen,” he said.","Hong Kong. Chinese food and beverage brands are gaining ground across Southeast Asia, offering alternatives to major American chains and expanding Beijing's commercial and cultural influence in neighboring economies.

Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world's largest food and beverage chain by number of outlets, surpassing Starbucks and McDonald's.

The company, whose brand name Mixue Bingcheng means ""Honey Snow Ice City"" in Chinese, is capitalizing on the region’s love for sweets with affordable offerings of ice cream, coffee, and bubble tea.

“Even on social media like TikTok, there’s a joke that any empty shophouse will soon turn into a Mixue store,” said Rahma Yuliana, referring to a popular saying in Indonesia, where Mixue has more than 2,600 outlets.

The single mother, who runs an online business, takes her daughter for after-school treats that won’t drain her wallet, such as a cup of brown sugar milk tea for $1.10—about one-third cheaper than similar offerings from Taiwanese tea chain Chatime. An ice cream costs as little as 50 cents, undercutting McDonald's.

As of September, Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores selling Mixue tea drinks, ice creams, and Lucky Cup coffee products, outnumbering Starbucks and McDonald's, according to industry analysts. About 40,000 of those stores are in China.

By December, Chinese F&B brands had opened more than 6,100 outlets in Southeast Asia, according to Singapore-based research firm Momentum Works. India and Vietnam account for roughly two-thirds of that number, while Singapore and Malaysia, which have sizable Chinese-speaking populations, have a relatively higher concentration of Chinese brands.

Nearly all Mixue stores operate as franchises, with the company supplying ingredients for drinks like Creamy Mango Boba, Mango Oats Jasmine Tea, and Coconut Jelly Milk Tea.

Beyond Mixue, other major players include hotpot giant Haidilao, Fish With You sauerkraut fish restaurants, and beverage brands like Luckin Coffee, Heytea, and Chagee.

Since its March 3 trading debut in Hong Kong, Mixue’s stock has doubled from its IPO price.

Momentum Works CEO Jianggan Li said Chinese businesses are looking to Southeast Asia for new growth opportunities after facing fierce competition at home.

The expansion of food and beverage retailers has also shifted perceptions of Chinese goods from being cheap to offering real value. The companies excel in automation to enhance efficiency and are skilled in online marketing, Li said. Western brands often take longer to find local partners and develop long-term strategies, while Chinese F&B companies are ""much more impatient,"" he noted.

In Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, Chinese entrepreneur Siya Han has invested more than $1.37 million in 12 Mixue stores and about 10 other outlets selling spicy broth bowls, sauerkraut fish, and fried chicken steaks over six years. While shopping mall outlets take time to recoup costs due to hefty rent deposits, her other locations typically break even within six months to a year, excluding lease guarantees.

“If you open Chinese restaurants slowly, you can’t survive,” she said.

In Kuala Lumpur, Chinese sauerkraut fish chain Fish With You sees opportunity in Southeast Asia’s large ethnic Chinese population and growing economies, said Liu Liujun, the company’s vice president.

The brand’s $235,000 investment in one of its Malaysian outlets paid off in just nine months, with lines out the door almost daily, said Liu, who oversees the company’s regional expansion.

For Malaysian customer Victoria Kovalan, the influx of Chinese brands has made it easier to explore new cuisines. “It’s opened up our palates,” she said, noting the popularity of Sichuan hotpots known for their spicy flavors.

Vietnamese student Nguyen Thu Hoài in Hanoi was initially skeptical of Mixue as a Chinese brand but became a regular customer, impressed by its affordability and quality.

Gordon Mathews, an anthropology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, sees the expansion of Chinese F&B brands as part of a broader trend where Chinese products are gaining global appeal. He recalled McDonald's cultural influence when it expanded worldwide, including its first outlet in Guangzhou in the 1990s, where a clerk once told him, ""I want to go to America.""

“If Chinese food brands expand globally, they might have a similar influence, though the impact remains to be seen,” he said. “China faces an uphill battle in gaining soft power, but it’s doing an excellent job with its products.”

In its application, Hudson's Bay said it was facing financial struggles because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker's National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson's Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.","TORONTO — The death knell is ringing for Canada’s oldest company.

Hudson’s Bay announced late Friday evening that unless it finds a more viable path forward, it will begin liquidating its entire business as soon as next week, putting more than 9,000 jobs at risk.

The department store chain that dates back to 1670 and now spans 80 stores said it has been forced toward a full liquidation because ""exhaustive"" efforts haven't turned up the financing it needs to keep at least some of its empire alive.

A closure of the entire business, which is planned pending a court appearance set for Monday, would mean job losses for 9,364 employees the company has in Canada across its Hudson's Bay stores, as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations it owns through a licensing agreement.

Though the situation looks bleak, the company is holding out hope for a Hail Mary. It said it remains optimistic that it can drum up capital and find a solution with key stakeholders, particularly its landlord partners, to avoid a full shutdown.

“Our team has worked incredibly hard to identify a viable path forward, and our resolve is strengthened by the overwhelming support from customers and associates who have shared heartfelt stories about Hudson’s Bay and what our stores have meant to them, their families, and their communities across the generations,” Hudson's Bay president and CEO Liz Rodbell.

“These powerful experiences remind us why we must continue to pursue every possible opportunity to secure the necessary support from key landlords and other stakeholders to save The Bay.”

The company's plea for help comes roughly a week after it laid bare its financial struggles in a creditor protection application it made with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

In its application, Hudson's Bay said it was facing financial struggles because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

The filings show the company owes more than $950 million to 26 pages' worth of listed creditors: landlords, suppliers and other partners, including fashion heavyweights Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel and Estée Lauder.

Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson's Bay's parent company, said in a court filing made on March 7 that the business had to defer certain payments to such companies for many months because it was having so much trouble making payments to landlords, service providers and vendors.

The situation was so severe that she said a landlord ""unlawfully locked"" Hudson’s Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S. and a team of bailiffs attempted to seize merchandise from another location it runs in Sherway Gardens, a suburban Toronto mall.

The March 7 filing was not meant to be the precursor to the closure of the business because Hudson's Bay was intent to on keeping the company alive and as much of its sprawling footprint operational as possible.

One week later, the company finds itself in much more dire shape. It said the store-by-store liquidation is necessary because it has only secured ""limited"" debtor-in-possession financing — a form of capital companies can seek for restructuring purposes after they make creditor protection filings.

Hudson’s Bay laid the groundwork for its creditor protection case when it spun its U.S. Saks locations off into a separate entity last year after it purchased luxury department stores Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, essentially saving them from the impending closures now set to engulf HBC in Canada.

A full liquidation in Canada wouldn’t just plunge a large portion of the country’s retail workforce into unemployment but would also leave anchor tenant spaces in malls and prestige real estate in high-traffic shopping districts in need of filling.

The sites Hudson's Bay operates in often contain several floors and make up significantly more square footage than other retailer businesses.

The bulk of the company's stores are in Ontario, where it has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16, Alberta and Quebec each have 13 and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.

Saks Fifth Avenue's Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.

While the company's coast-to-coast footprint and its 17th century fur trade origins have made it a quintessential part of the fabric of Canada, it has been led by Americans for several decades now.

American real estate kingpin Richard Baker's National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought Hudson's Bay in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

Baker took the company public in 2012 and then turned it private again with a takeover bid that had to be boosted twice to earn shareholder approval in the weeks before Canada was hit with COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Shareholders were difficult to appease in part because Baker presided over HBC while its stock was dropping — but many thought the company still carried immense value in its real estate.

When he gained their approval, he admitted the brand had work to do.

“It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC’s potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,” he said in March 2020.

A handful of store closures and piecemeal layoffs over the last two years suggest unleashing that potential was not easy as rivals like fellow Canadian department store Simon's expanded and online giants such as Amazon gobbled up sales.

“Pilgrim’s is confident in the future of our business, and we believe our capital allocation strategy positions the company for continued, disciplined growth and enhanced earnings potential across our diversified portfolio,” said Fabio Sandri, chief executive officer of Pilgrim’s. “The board’s decision to pay a special dividend reflects our strong balance sheet and our commitment to create long-term stockholder value. Today’s announcement is a testament to our team’s ability to execute our key customer strategy, unlock value through differentiated offerings, and relentlessly pursue quality and service.”

Pilgrim’s named other areas it continues to look at, including expanding prepared foods due to brand growth, adding small bird capacity to support key customer growth, converting a bird plant to a case-ready facility for continued growth in retail and expanding protein conversion capacity.

In the last five years, the poultry company made investments of more than $950 million in acquisitions, $1.8 billion in share repurchases and dividends and $2.2 billion in capital expenditures.

This seems to be a reflection of dissatisfied customers who have opted to get their morning ""cup of Joe"" at rival coffee shops instead.

Since taking over as Starbucks' new CEO, Brian Niccol has emphasized the need to bring the company back to its roots by focusing on its core products and personalizing the coffee shop experience like it once did.

“I made a commitment that we’d get back to Starbucks, focusing on what has always set Starbucks apart – a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas,” said Niccol in an earnings call.

To return the business to growth, Starbucks developed a turnaround strategy that aims to improve customers' overall experience by redesigning stores, optimizing efficiency, prioritizing coffee quality, simplifying its menu, and empowering its baristas.

Over the last six months, Starbucks (SBUX) has made multiple changes to its coffee shops as part of its turnaround plan to make them feel more like homes rather than establishments, creating a third place for customers.

These changes include reintroducing condiment bars after being banished during the pandemic, returning ceramic mugs for in-house sipping, and bringing back handwritten notes on to-go cups and bags to foster better customer connections.

Staying longer at Starbucks shops now comes with a few perks as well. The company has returned the free in-café refills on hot and iced brewed coffee and tea at participating locations for non-Starbucks Rewards members.

Starbucks has also refreshed its menu with a simpler version, discontinuing 13 items to focus on coffee and quality rather than the number of customizations, which tend to complicate orders.

As for the stores themselves, Starbucks will be closing underperforming shops to invest in building new locations, and revamping old ones to make them more welcoming, cozy, and warm, encouraging customers to stay longer.

On Mar. 12, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol provided a six-month update on the progress of the company's turnaround plan to revive Starbucks' coffeehouse and boost growth.

Although the turnaround plan is in its early stages, and true results will not be seen until all changes have been completed, more of its medium-term goals of bettering Starbucks' in-store experience have already been enacted and are showing signs of progress.

To improve mobile, in-store, and drive-thru ordering systems, Starbucks is currently testing new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create more separation between the café and mobile ordering.

Starbucks is also developing technological innovations to improve efficiency and has increased operating hours at 3,000 cafés based on demand to meet customers' coffee needs.

Not only is this turnaround plan focused on improving customers' experience, but also making its working experience better for employees.

""To deliver a great customer experience, we also have to deliver a great partner experience,"" said Niccol.

Over the last few months, Starbucks Workers United has filed several unfair labor practice charges against the company and staged multiple strikes, demanding higher wages and staffing.

Despite the fact that this is an ongoing issue that has yet to be solved, Niccol claims Starbucks has made recent changes to improve employees' work experience, including adding more benefits such as double parental leave and increased manager promotions to reward hard work.

Although Niccol says its turnaround plan has shown improvements in the business, Starbucks' stock has declined 1.6% in the past six months as of Mar. 14.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjEzNDgyNjMwOTU4NTU2NjIz/atlanta-georgia-starbucks-coffee-building-exterior-with-long-line-of-cars-at-the-drive-thru-2.jpg,N,,2025-03-14 20:09:51.758882

This included existing anti-obesity medication users who succeeded in nearly doubling their pre-program weight loss while working with program clinicians on diet and lifestyle.

Results are derived from a population of 265,000 members from 2023-2024.

The initial results demonstrate improved weight loss and high program satisfaction for CVS Caremark clients’ plan members trying a lifestyle-first approach, as well as additional clinical effectiveness and cost savings for members receiving clinical support while taking weight management medications like GLP-1s.

The program can integrate into a member’s existing pharmacy benefit with plan sponsors’ direction.

CVS Caremark clients who adopted the CVS Weight Management program spent up to 26% less on GLP-1 medications for weight loss than clients who did not adopt the program.

The program also has a lasting impact, with 92% of participating plan members expressing satisfaction after six months.

As of February 1, 2025, the CVS Weight Management program is now available to over 3.5 million CVS Caremark plan members.

Despite FDA prescription drug labeling recommendations to take GLP-1’s in combination with diet and physical activity, 70% of members were using a weight management drug without any lifestyle or nutrition support before enrolling in the CVS Weight Management program.

Before program enrollment, nearly 30% of members had lost less than 1% of their body weight on anti-obesity medication. These same members lost, on average, 11.7% of body weight after enrollment.

The program accelerated weight loss and delivered an average of 20% weight loss for those with moderate success before enrollment.

Members who chose to discontinue anti-obesity medication and retain lifestyle support maintained 94% of their weight loss after 6 months.

When United Airlines CEO Jeff Smisek was forced to step down over corruption charges, he was quickly replaced by legacy Continental Airlines board member Oscar Munoz.
The onboard coffee was much-hated Fresh Brew, still used by American Airlines.
If American Airlines wants to be a premium carrier, it is important to remember that most passengers fly economy.
Today, coffee on American Airlines serves just one purpose: covering up smells in the lavatory.","Dear American Airlines. One simple change to your service would signal a break from the past and a bright premium future. Change the coffee, and I have a specific suggestion for how you do this.

When United Airlines CEO Jeff Smisek was forced to step down over corruption charges, he was quickly replaced by legacy Continental Airlines board member Oscar Munoz. Munoz set to turn the airline around. While current CEO Scott Kirby is credited with much of the work elevating United as a premium airline and turning around its fortunes, a lot of the heavy lift was done by Munoz.

He traveled the system talking to employees, giving them hope for the future and motivating them to become a part of the airline’s turnaround. He spent tremendous time connecting with the front line.

He reversed Smisek-era cost cuts. While Smisek’s face was known to United flyers as the one promising ‘changes you’re going to like’ from the United-Continental merger, he was relentless in cheapening the product. His effort to cut $2 billion in costs was given the Orwellian name Project Quality.

The Polaris business class seat was green lit under Smisek, but it was Munoz who signed off on all of the service elements. This makes sense because Polaris is, above all else, the most efficient way to squeeze seats into a business class cabin while maintaining lie flat direct aisle access.

But Munoz didn’t start the turnaround with business class. The first thing he did – a real symbolic break from the past – was focus on two things in economy.

Coffee. The onboard coffee was much-hated Fresh Brew, still used by American Airlines. Flyers derided it as ‘fresh poo’. They didn’t just get rid of that coffee, the introduced a genuine premium brand in Illy.

Snacks. They brought out the Stroopwafel, beloved by flyers, and which pairs well with the coffee – demonstrating a real thoughtfulness in the product that had been lacking

I tell this story because American Airlines (1) says they want to be premium now (since competing at the low-end of the marketplace hasn’t worked out well, indeed with their high costs they need to earn a revenue premium) and (2) has focused on premium passengers exclusively so far – talking up the new business class suites that are coming, a new business class lounge in Philadelphia, and more first class seats that will trade off with coach legroom.

If American Airlines wants to be a premium carrier, it is important to remember that most passengers fly economy. They may see first class, and eventually buy up there – which is why seeing a beautiful cabin is important for sales, and seeing passengers enjoying themselves with an elevated service underscores how important simple things like predeparture beverages can be.

But they aren’t going to want to fly American if there aren’t little touches that make the experience just a bit more human. And why not start with the coffee, like United did?

Plus, if Eurowings can pull this off in Europe surely American Airlines can manage it:

European value airline Eurowings is taking in-flight coffee to new heights with the trial of this innovative self-contained coffee cart!

Cappuccinos, macchiatos, and espressos are no longer just for premium cabins—this game-changing cart prepares barista-style coffee and hot chocolate at the touch of a button, right at passengers’ seats. The fully autonomous cart comes equipped with its own battery, water, and milk supply, allowing cabin crew to serve fresh coffee on demand during the service in the cabin.

Today, coffee on American Airlines serves just one purpose: covering up smells in the lavatory.

But come on, wouldn’t you prefer an airline offering this for your next trip in economy, provided that price, schedule and legroom were constant?

And I actually think that flight attendants would love providing this service – it would give them something to be proud of. And if you give them the tools, and pride, they’ll be excited and provide excellent service.

That needs to be paired, of course, with the first Oscar Munoz lesson of getting out and spending time with the front line, motivating them and describing the bright future that they can be part of, that you need them to be part of.",https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/coffee.webp,N,,2025-03-14 18:59:28.834385

The company owes more than $1 million to Canada Post, and is in debt to over a dozen municipalities.
The list doesn't include the debt amount owed to some government agencies, figures that the filing says are unknown at this time.
At the beginning of the year, Hudson's Bay had just $3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the documents show.
The $1.1 billion it owes in secured debt includes $724.4 million in mortgages.","Hudson's Bay Company is nearly a billion dollars in debt, according to court filings that paint a dire portrait of the struggling Canadian department store chain's finances.

The documents were submitted as part of its creditor protection filing last week. The company owes a total of $950 million to nearly 2,000 secured and unsecured creditors, including well-known apparel and beauty brands like Adidas Canada, Estée Lauder, L'Oréal Canada, Levi Strauss Canada, Michael Kors Canada, Nike Canada and Ralph Lauren.

""The scale is certainly monumental for insolvency proceedings as far as Canada goes. It's a very large one,"" said Dina Kovacevic, editor-in-chief of Insolvency Insider Canada. But it's not a surprise, she said.

""Retailers in the last several years since the COVID pandemic have really been having a hard time with less foot traffic and all of the economic issues that have been going on in the world. So while it is monumental, I think we were probably expecting it. There have been a lot of retailer filings in the last several years.""

The company owes more than $1 million to Canada Post, and is in debt to over a dozen municipalities. The list doesn't include the debt amount owed to some government agencies, figures that the filing says are unknown at this time. The amount owed to employees is to be determined, per the filing.

At the beginning of the year, Hudson's Bay had just $3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the documents show. The $1.1 billion it owes in secured debt includes $724.4 million in mortgages.

Secured creditors are lenders, like banks, which give out loans to companies. To ensure they are paid back, the creditor takes on some of the company's assets as collateral. Unsecured creditors are usually employees and suppliers, ""and unfortunately they tend to be at the bottom of the food chain, so to speak,"" said Kovacevic.

""For any employees that get terminated throughout the process, unfortunately their termination and severance pay will be an unsecured claim, which means that they will likely receive cents on the dollar for those claims,"" she explained.

'The worker always comes out last'

The Bay announced last week that it was seeking creditor protection, with its chief executive pointing to the COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing trade war with the U.S. as external factors that have put financial pressure on the company.

Some experts say The Bay's decline began long before the pandemic, tracing its issues back to its 2008 acquisition by the American investment firm NRDC Equity Partners, and saying that the company's new ownership prioritized its real estate over a cohesive retail strategy.

The company's lack of investment in its stores became evident in recent years, with floors understaffed, escalators and elevators in disrepair and faulty HVAC systems leading to temporary closures last summer.

""I was in just before Christmas, and there are large parts of the floor that weren't stocked with anything, and it didn't have the hum of Christmases past,"" said Lawrence Archer, a Toronto resident who was leaving The Bay with a shopping bag in each hand.

""I feel sorry for the employees,"" he added. ""I've just talking to several of them inside there and they're worried. The worker always comes out last in these sort of situations.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7483642.1741959559!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/hudsons-bay-toronto.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-03-14 18:11:38.707356

The impact of these financial disclosures likely overshadowed positive movements in the broader market, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both experienced gains following a correction earlier in the week.

Over the past five years, Best Buy has delivered a total shareholder return of 53.50%, benefiting in part from consistent dividend increases and strategic stock buybacks. Notably, the company announced a 5% dividend increase in mid-2024, followed by a further 1% rise in early 2025, highlighting a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Additionally, Best Buy repurchased nearly $1.72 billion worth of shares from its buyback program, which ended in early 2025, further enhancing shareholder returns during this period.

However, the last year has presented challenges, with Best Buy underperforming the U.S. Specialty Retail industry. Key issues included a $475 million goodwill impairment related to its health unit, as reported in March 2025, and declining earnings, with net income falling from $460 million to $117 million for Q4 2025. Despite a sound return on equity and attractive dividend yield, these financial difficulties and a slower growth forecast than the broader market have influenced its recent stock performance.

This included existing anti-obesity medication users who succeeded in nearly doubling their pre-program weight loss while working with program clinicians on diet and lifestyle.

Results are derived from a population of 265,000 members from 2023-2024.

The initial results demonstrate improved weight loss and high program satisfaction for CVS Caremark clients’ plan members trying a lifestyle-first approach, as well as additional clinical effectiveness and cost savings for members receiving clinical support while taking weight management medications like GLP-1s.

GLP-1 products from Novo Nordisk A/S NVO and Eli Lilli And Co LLY have gained substantial traction. The CVS Weight Management program provides one-on-one support from a dedicated registered dietitian in a virtual setting, including personalized nutrition planning.

The program can integrate into a member’s existing pharmacy benefit with plan sponsors’ direction.

CVS Caremark clients who adopted the CVS Weight Management program spent up to 26% less on GLP-1 medications for weight loss than clients who did not adopt the program.

The program also has a lasting impact, with 92% of participating plan members expressing satisfaction after six months.

As of February 1, 2025, the CVS Weight Management program is now available to over 3.5 million CVS Caremark plan members.

Despite FDA prescription drug labeling recommendations to take GLP-1’s in combination with diet and physical activity, 70% of members were using a weight management drug without any lifestyle or nutrition support before enrolling in the CVS Weight Management program.

Before program enrollment, nearly 30% of members had lost less than 1% of their body weight on anti-obesity medication. These same members lost, on average, 11.7% of body weight after enrollment.

The program accelerated weight loss and delivered an average of 20% weight loss for those with moderate success before enrollment.

Members who chose to discontinue anti-obesity medication and retain lifestyle support maintained 94% of their weight loss after 6 months.

Price Action: CVS stock is up 1.33% at $66.64 at the last check Friday.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.
By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.
Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.
Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy — but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, “as soon as reasonably practicable.”","NEW YORK — Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.

The budget airline — known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes — said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.

“We’re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,” CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.

The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.

Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.

While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be ""moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.”

In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.

In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said “let you choose how you want to fly.""

Wednesday's announcement also noted plans to trade shares publicly again, although not immediately.

Nike (NKE) stock is among a group of widely held, large-cap issues on the earnings calendar, along with Micron (MU), FedEx (FDX) and Darden Restaurants (DRI).

Of the four, Olive Garden-parent Darden held up the best at the start of week. But support eventually gave way at the 10-week moving average. The weakness proved to be a sell signal for those who bought the earnings breakout during the week ended Dec. 20. Nike stock, Micron and FedEx have been trending lower for months.

It's also a busy week of earnings for several top performing China-based stocks. They include Qifu Technology (QFIN), GDS Holdings (GDS) and Kingsoft Cloud (KC), along with high-flying Chinese electric-vehicle makers Zeekr (ZK) and Xiaomi (XIACY).

Results from financial services firm Qifu will be out Monday before the open; GDS and Kingsoft report early Wednesday; Zeeker reports late Thursday and Xiaomi reports sometime Tuesday.

Nike Stock Struggles

Longtime Nike executive Elliot Hill took over as chief executive in October to help with a turnaround after several quarters in a row of weak revenue. Hill aims to refocus the company's attention on sports core to the company's brand like running and basketball.

The new tack comes after Nike's focus on direct-to-consumer sales resulted in bloated inventories and heavy discounting. Meanwhile, increasing competition from the likes of On Holding (ONON) and Deckers' (DECK) wildly popular running shoe brand Hoka hasn't helped Nike stock.

Revenue growth declined again for the November-ended quarter, falling 8% to $12.4 billion. Revenue in all four of its geographies — North America, Europe/Middle East/Africa, Asia Pacific/Latin America and China — declined, but the only area that missed expectations was China, which fell 8% to $1.7 billion.

Nike Stock: Converse Revenue Falls

Nike's Converse brand, acquired all the way back in 2003, is also struggling. In the latest reported quarter, Converse revenue fell 17% to $429 million.

Hill acknowledged that Nike has been focused too much on driving online sales, crimping its relationship with wholesale partners like Foot Locker (FL) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS).

Earnings and revenue are expected to decline again for the February-ended fiscal third quarter, with adjusted profit down 39% to 30 cents a share and revenue down 11% to $11 billion. Nike is scheduled to report Thursday.

Watching Sportradar, Ollie's Bargain Outlet

Sportradar (SRAD), which has held up better than a lot of other growth stocks during the recent sell-off, is due to release fourth-quarter results Wednesday before the open. The company, with a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion, provides data services for the sports betting market as well as other media.

The stock blasted out of a flat base on Nov. 7 after the company reported adjusted profit of 12 cents a share vs. 1 cent in the year-ago quarter. Revenue growth accelerated from the second quarter, rising 34% to $284.1 million. After a strong gain after the breakout, Sportradar settled into another flat base in November and scored another bullish breakout in early January.

Analyst chatter has been positive around the stock lately. Last month, Deutsche Bank maintained a buy rating and lifted Sportradar's price target to 24 from 19. Guggenheim, meanwhile initiated the stock with a buy rating and 27 price target.

In the retail sector, Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) reports early Wednesday as well. Growth has been slowing in recent quarters, but the company is still performing well as a provider of closeout merchandise and excess inventory from manufacturers and bankrupt retailers.

Ollie's is still on a downtrend, but it's been trading tightly while holding just above its 40-week moving average. The stock's relative strength line has started to turn higher as a result.

Ollie's fourth-quarter earnings report comes after some cautious comments from some high-profile retailers lately.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) on Friday became the latest retailer to caution about a possible slowdown in consumer spending, joining Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT).

Options Trading Strategy

A basic options trading strategy around earnings — using call options — allows you to buy a stock at a predetermined price without taking a lot of risk. Here's how the option trading strategy works:

First, identify top-rated stocks with a bullish chart. Some might be setting up in sound early-stage bases. Others might've broken out already and are getting support at their 10-week moving average for the first time. And a few might be trading tightly near highs and are refusing to give up much ground. Avoid extended stocks that are too far past proper entry points.

Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy

A call option is a bullish bet on a stock. Put options are bearish bets. One call option contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a specified level, known as the strike price.

Once you've identified a bullish setup in the earnings calendar, check strike prices with your online trading platform, or at Cboe.com. Also, make sure the option is liquid with a relatively tight spread between the bid and ask.

Look for a strike price just above the underlying stock price — that's out of the money — and check the premium. Ideally, the premium should not exceed 4% of the underlying stock price at the time. In some cases, an in-the-money strike price is OK as long as the premium isn't too expensive.

Choose an expiration date that fits your risk objective. But keep in mind that time is money in the options market. Near-term expiration dates will have cheaper premiums than those further out. Buying time in the options market comes at a higher cost. Also keep in mind that implied volatility tends to rise before an earnings report, which can push up the cost of options.

Kingsoft Option Trade

The stock market is in a correction where new buys should generally be avoided, but China-based cloud services provider Kingsoft Cloud continues to show relative strength after an explosive gain in recent months and could make sense as a call-option trade.

When Kingsoft traded around 16.70, a slightly out-of-the-money monthly call option with a 17.50 strike price and a March 21 expiration came with a premium of around $1.15 per contract. That was 6.9% of the underlying stock price at the time, and well above the 4% threshold.

One contract gave the holder the right to buy 100 shares of Kingsoft at 17.50 per share. The most that could be lost was $115 — the amount paid for the 100-share contract. To break even, Kingsoft would need to rise to 18.65, factoring in the premium paid.
