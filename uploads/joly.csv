This combination of a large-scale technology investment in a fast-growing beauty market and renewed analyst confidence highlights how L’Oréal is leaning into AI and digital capabilities to support its global beauty portfolio.

We’ll now examine how L’Oréal’s planned Hyderabad AI tech hub reshapes the company’s investment narrative and long-term competitive positioning.

The end of cancer? These like cancer and Alzheimer's.

What Is L'Oréal's Investment Narrative?

To own L’Oréal, you need to be comfortable paying a premium multiple for a global beauty leader whose growth profile is solid but not explosive, with earnings expected to rise in the high single digits and revenue in the mid single digits. Near term, the key catalysts remain the February 12 results, any color on the “Beauty Stimulus” plan, and how the refreshed leadership bench executes in North America. Against that backdrop, the new Hyderabad AI tech hub looks more like a long-term capability bet than a near-term earnings driver, although the size of the €350 million commitment underlines how seriously L’Oréal is treating data, AI and India as ingredients of its future. The main risk is that this level of innovation and capital spend does not fully justify the current valuation premium.

However, the premium price tag may already be baking in very optimistic execution. L'Oréal's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 6%. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly €286 to €409, underlining how differently private investors view L’Oréal’s premium pricing and AI push. You can weigh those views against the current reliance on upcoming results and execution in the US and India, which could influence how sustainable that premium really is over time.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 6% more than the current price!

Can custom chips like Maia 200 save OpenAI from its massive losses?","Microsoft just announced Maia 200, an AI chip set to compete with the best from Amazon and Google. The chip is designed specifically for large-scale AI workloads.

Maia 200 is made on TSMC's 3nm process. Microsoft claims the chip is ""the most performant, first-party silicon from any hyperscaler."" The tech giant added that Maia 200 has three times the FP4 performance of Amazon's third-gen Trainium chip and better FP8 performance than Google's seventh-gen TPU.

FP4 and FP8 refer to 4-bit and 8-bit floating-point formats. FP8 is generally used for low-precision AI work because it balances accuracy and speed. NVIDIA has a full explainer on Floating Point and how it relates to AI.

Latest Videos From Windows Central

Microsoft states that in addition to having better performance in certain areas, Maia 200 is more efficient than competing chips. Maia delivers 30% better performance per dollar than the previous generation of hardware used by Microsoft.

Maia 200 has already been deployed in Microsoft's datacenter region near Des Moines, Iowa. The US West 3 datacenter region near Phoenix, Arizona will be the next to see Maia 200 used.

In a video explaining the Maia 200, Microsoft Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie noted that the chip is designed to be cooled with water, which is more efficient than air cooling. Guthrie also highlighted ""zero water waste"" by the chip and noted that Maia 200 can be used in a way that ""protects the environment and the communities that [Microsoft runs] in.""

Microsoft has been criticized for how much electricity and water is used by data centers. The company announced plans to build ""Community-First"" AI infrastructure, though the tech giant was mocked for the announcement.

Why this matters

OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is one of the hottest names in tech. It is also on pace to lose billions of dollars in 2026. Reports suggest the company could lose as much as $14 billion just this year.

Training AI models takes a tremendous amount of computing power, but that is far from the only cost of operating LLMs. Even after a model is trained, running that model costs money for each use.

Microsoft claims that Maia 200 is the most efficient inference system the company has deployed and that it delivers 30% better performance per dollar than the latest generation of hardware used by the tech giant.

Those figures could drastically reduce operation costs for OpenAI and other companies that use Maia 200.

""Maia 200 is part of our heterogenous AI infrastructure and will serve multiple models, including the latest GPT-5.2 models from OpenAI, bringing performance per dollar advantage to Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft 365 Copilot,"" said Microsoft.

Maia 200 is an inference accelerator. It is engineered to make AI token generation more affordable. Training a model is a massive one-time expense. Inference is the process of the AI actually answering a user. This is a continuous daily cost. Microsoft optimized this chip specifically for that task. The goal is to slash the ""per-token"" cost of running services like ChatGPT and Copilot.

If Maia 200 delivers in the way Microsoft described, the chip will help reduce the costs of operating LLMs, which could significantly help OpenAI and other companies that use the chip.

Microsoft says this chip will save money in token costs. Do you think custom silicon is enough to make AI profitable by 2027? Let us know in the comments.

What do you think?

Can custom chips like Maia 200 save OpenAI from its massive losses?

Yes, efficiency is the key.

No, the costs are growing too fast.

Only if OpenAI starts charging more.

NEW YORK, NY – The New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) marks a workers justice milestone as key amendments to the City's Delivery Worker Laws go into full effect today, January 26, 2026.

The new laws strengthen rights for contracted grocery and food delivery workers. These include Local Law 113, which increases delivery worker pay transparency; Local Laws 123 and 124, which expand the minimum pay rate (MPR) to cover third-party grocery delivery workers, give timely and weekly payment rights to more contracted delivery workers, and improve bathroom access for contracted delivery workers; and Local Laws 107 and 108, which require restaurant and grocery apps to offer a tipping option at checkout. As a DCWP report revealed, DoorDash and Uber engineered design tricks in their interfaces that lowered workers’ tip earnings by $550 million. Those tricks are now illegal.

These reforms build on the City's pioneering 2023 minimum pay rate rule, which dramatically increased workers’ average hourly earnings without reducing deliveries. Today DCWP also announces a citywide inflation adjustment to worker pay under the framework established by Local Law 115 of 2021. The MPR will increase from $21.44 an hour to $22.13 an hour for both grocery and food delivery workers, a 3.2% increase that is set to take effect on April 1, 2026.

Key worker protection laws effective January 26, 2026 address:

Expanded minimum pay protections: Grocery delivery apps (including Instacart) must now pay workers at least $21.44 an hour (excluding tips) with annual increases, matching the rate for food delivery workers. In 2025, the City Council overrode Eric Adams’ initial veto of this legislation.

Timely payments and transparency: Apps must pay workers no later than seven calendar days after the end of a pay period and provide detailed, itemized written statements with compensation calculations.

Tipping fairness: Platforms must offer customers a clear tip option before or at checkout, including a suggested tip of at least 10% of the purchase price or a custom amount. This directly counters practices that hid or delayed tip prompts, which a recent DCWP report found cost workers over $550 million.

Today’s victory is buttressed by two recent federal court decisions. In 2025, DoorDash and Uber filed a federal lawsuit against DCWP challenging Local Laws 107 and 108 (tipping), while Instacart did the same to challenge Local Laws 123 and 124 (grocery delivery workers). On January 23, 2026, federal judges ruled decisively on the side of workers and denied the apps’ requests for a preliminary injunction in both cases.

These expanded Worker Protection Laws go into effect as the Mamdani Administration ramps up efforts to crack down on predatory delivery apps, reverse worker losses through aggressive enforcement of the Delivery Worker Laws, and hold companies and individuals accountable for ripping off the hardworking, majority immigrant deliveristas who keep New Yorkers fed. Earlier this month, Commissioner Levine announced a lawsuit against Motoclick and sent compliance warnings to over 60 companies including Instacart, DoorDash, Grubhub, Uber, and other app companies, warning them to adhere to the new laws.

The Minimum Pay Rate (MPR) for app-based delivery workers must be adjusted for inflation each year. The MPR will increase to $22.13 the first pay period on or after April 1, 2026. The $22.13 rate reflects a 3.2% adjustment for inflation between December 2024 and December 2025.

“Our administration has zero tolerance for corporate abuse, deceptive practices, or an economy that leaves working New Yorkers behind,” said Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani. “These laws move us closer to a city delivery workers can afford — a city where their labor is respected, their pay is fair and transparent, and they can earn tips without limitations. That’s what economic justice looks like in practice.”

""New York City refuses to let multi-billion-dollar corporations exploit hardworking deliveristas,"" said DCWP Commissioner Samuel A.A. Levine. ""Since we began enforcing the minimum pay rate in 2023, workers have taken home an additional $1.2 billion in earnings. The laws that go into effect today build on that success by closing loopholes, ending design tricks that depressed tips by hundreds of millions, and guaranteeing grocery workers the same baseline pay as food delivery workers. This is what a worker-centered economy looks like.""

The NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) is the nation’s leading municipal enforcement agency charged with delivering New Yorkers economic justice and an affordable city. DCWP leverages its authority to deliver real economic relief to New Yorkers and protect them from predatory, deceptive, and unfair practices that violate their consumer and workers’ rights. This includes pioneering cutting-edge protections, such as the City’s Consumer Protection Law, Protected Time Off Law, Fair Workweek Law, and Delivery Workers Laws, including the Minimum Pay Rate for delivery workers. While licensing more than 45,000 businesses in over 45 industries, we also ensure fair competition and a level playing field for responsible small businesses that are integral to New York City’s vibrant communities. DCWP also provides essential services, such as free tax preparation and financial counseling to ensure New Yorkers keep more of what they earn and can plan for their future. Across our mission, DCWP is committed to strengthening our communities and making New York City a fairer, more affordable place to live.

The fourth quarter earnings season kicks into high gear this week, with Big Tech results from Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL) headlining the earnings calendar.

An optimistic consensus is forming: As of Jan. 23, 13% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have reported fourth quarter results, according to FactSet data, and Wall Street analysts estimate an 8.2% increase in earnings per share for the fourth quarter. If that rate holds, it would represent the 10th consecutive quarter of annual earnings growth for the index.

Heading into the reporting period, analysts were expecting an 8.3% jump in earnings per share, down from the third quarter's 13.6% earnings growth rate. Wall Street has raised its earnings expectations in recent months, especially for tech companies, which have driven earnings growth in recent quarters.

Prediction Market powered by

Although Big Tech continues to set the tone, this earnings season promises to test the improved stock market breadth that has emerged at the start of 2026. Plus, the themes that drove the markets in 2025 — artificial intelligence, the Trump administration's tariff and economic policies, and a K-shaped consumer economy — will continue to provide plenty for investors to parse.

In addition to the reports from four of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, Wall Street will receive updates from a wide swath of companies across the economy, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), IBM (IBM), Starbucks (SBUX), Levi Strauss (LEVI), Visa (V), American Express (AXP), Mastercard (MA), Caterpillar (CAT), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), AT&T (T), and Verizon (VZ),

Nucor stock falls after steelmaker's earnings miss

Nucor's (NUE) fourth quarter results missed Wall Street expectations due to lower volumes and compressed margins from higher steel prices.

The Charlotte, N.C.-based steel manufacturer reported earnings per share of $1.64, compared to estimates of $1.77, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $7.69 billion also missed expectations for $7.9 billion in sales, led by quarter-over-quarter sales declines in the steel mills and steel products segments.

Nucor stock declined 3% in after-hours trading. The stock was down 2% during Monday's session following Steel Dynamics' (STLD) Q4 results.

Like Steel Dynamics, Nucor offered some optimism for the quarter ahead, saying that it's seeing ""robust demand"" in several end markets as well as ""strong backlogs."" The company also said it was encouraged by federal policies in place, such as import tariffs on steel and steel products.

The company said it expects earnings to rise in Q1 across all segments but did not offer specific guidance yet. Nucor's earnings call will take place on Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. You can listen to it on Yahoo Finance.

Baker Hughes stock rises on earnings beat

Houston-based oil field services company Baker Hughes (BKR) reported fourth quarter earnings on Sunday that beat analyst expectations as the company's focus on liquefied natural gas and industrial energy infrastructure paid off.

Baker Hughes reported earnings per share of $0.88, which was better than the $0.67 per share Wall Street was expecting, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $7.3 billion also came in higher than the Street estimate of $7 billion.

The stock rose more than 2% in premarket trading.

The Industrial & Energy Technology segment saw continued strength and secured a record backlog of $32.4 billion, the company said.

""Looking ahead, we expect IET orders to remain at robust levels, supported by continued momentum in LNG, a stronger year of FPSO [floating production storage and offloading] and gas infrastructure awards, and sustained strength for power systems,"" Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said in the earnings release. ""Against this favorable backdrop, we project similar levels of organic IET orders in 2026.""

Listen to the company's earnings call at 9:30 a.m. ET.

Big Tech expected to drive earnings growth for S&P 500 in Q4

Next week, four of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks report results: Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL).

There are a couple of reasons why markets will be closely watching these reports. For one, anything related to artificial intelligence continues to drive the markets. And for another, the Magnificent Seven names have been the top contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth in recent quarters.

Those trends are expected to continue in the fourth quarter reporting season. According to a note by FactSet's senior earnings analyst John Butters, analysts expect Magnificent Seven companies to report earnings growth of 20.3% in aggregate for Q4. For the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500, the aggregated earnings growth rate is expected at 4.1%.

Alaska Air stock jumps as airline touts growing demand for premium seats

Alaska Air Group (ALK) saw progress in its premium seat and international flight push in the latest sign of airline competition for high-income customers.

On Thursday, the airline reported adjusted earnings of $0.43, above consensus estimates of $0.11 per share, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $3.6 billion was roughly in line with analyst estimates on annual capacity growth of 2.2%.

Alaska Air primarily operates routes along the US West Coast and plans to expand its international flights from two to five to eventually 12, including flights to London and Rome. The stock rose 6.6% on Friday afternoon.

Echoing results from Delta (DAL) and United (UAL), Alaska Air said it saw strong demand in its premium segment in its earnings call on Friday.

First Class and Premium Class revenues grew 7.1% year over year, compared to a 2.4% decline for Main Cabin revenues. However, even Main Cabin sales saw some improvement from the third quarter, the company said.

""We've really seen the improvement in the demand profile across every segment of the business, ... certainly, premium and loyalty are the biggest drivers of that,"" CFO Shane Tackett said on the earnings call. ""But I think we actually like the trends we're seeing in Main Cabin right now.""

Booz Allen Hamilton stock jumps as civil government business starts to 'reignite'

Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (BAH) said its contract pipeline was accelerating again after a year of government cost-cutting efforts from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) pressured the defense consultancy's business.

""Our national security business continues to see good growth and very good prospects, but I think what's really exciting to us is our civil business is starting to reignite,"" CEO Horacio Rozanski said on the earnings call, adding, ""The market does feel like it's at an inflection point.""

The company's sales backlog rose 2% year over year to $38 billion in the third quarter.

Overall revenue in the third quarter declined 10% year over year to $2.6 billion, missing Wall Street estimates of $2.7 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. But adjusted profits rose to $1.77 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.27.

The stock jumped by 6% in premarket trading on Friday on Booz Allen Hamilton's upbeat earnings guidance.

The company slightly lowered the top end of its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $11.3 billion-$11.4 billion from $11.3 billion-$11.5 billion previously. But it raised its adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to $5.95-$6.15 from $5.45-$5.65 previously.

Alcoa stock gains as aluminum prices boost earnings

Aluminum producer Alcoa (AA) stock gained in after-hours trading following top- and bottom-line beats, as higher aluminum prices boosted results despite lower shipments.

Alcoa posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the fourth quarter, above estimates for $1.01, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Unadjusted earnings of $0.85 per share missed estimates, which the company attributed to an $337 million investment loss from its Saudi Arabian mining company Ma’aden, $144 million goodwill impairment charge, and currency fluctuations.

Revenue increased 15% year over year to $3.4 billion, above estimates of $3.27 billion. The company said its aluminum production increased 5% while alumina production decreased 4% year over year. The increase in aluminum prices, more than offset the higher tariff costs on Canadian aluminum imported to the US, the company said.

Alcoa stock rose 1.6% on Thursday afternoon and is up 18% year to date.

Capital One announces plans to acquire fintech Brex for $5.15 billion

Capital One (COF) stock slid in extended trading hours after the financial company announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire fintech company Brex Inc. for $5.15 billion in 50% cash and 50% stock.

Brex provides business credit cards, spending accounts, and expense management software. The acquisition is Capital One's latest expansion into fintech after it bought Discover for $35 billion last year.

News of the deal came as Capital One reported fourth quarter earnings that beat expectations. The Virginia-based company reported earnings per share of $3.26 per share, beating estimates of $3.23, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Total net revenue increased 1% year over year to $15.6 billion, also coming in above estimates for $15.4 billion in revenue.

“Our fourth quarter and full year results reflect solid top line growth and strong and stable credit performance"" CEO Richard D. Fairbank said in a statement. ""Years of strategic preparation and our choices to consistently invest to sustain long-term growth and returns enable our results and put us in a strong position going forward. I’m struck by the number and quality of the opportunities we have before us.”

Gold and copper miner Freeport McMoRan reports earnings beat but production decline

Freeport McMoran (FCX) beat adjusted earnings and revenue estimates for the fourth quarter, but reported lower production of the copper, gold, and molybdenum it mines. The stock fell fractionally in midday trading on Thursday.

Freeport McMoran said it produced 640 million pounds of copper, 65,000 ounces of gold, and 25 million pounds of molybdenum in the fourth quarter, down from the 1.04 billion pounds of copper, 432,000 ounces of gold, and 22 million pounds of molybdenum it produced in the same quarter a year ago.

Copper production was severely hit after a deadly mudslide in September took out the company's Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia, the world's second-largest copper mine. On the earnings call, CEO Kathleen Quirk said the closure impacted copper volumes by 10% for the year compared to its forecasts going into 2025.

Quirk said the company is on track to resume operations at the Grasberg mine in the second quarter of 2026, and Freeport McMoRan COO of the Indonesia business Mark Johnson added that he doesn't see ""any real hurdles at this point to be able to start up as we planned.""

For the fourth quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of $0.47 on revenue of $5.6 billion. Wall Street analysts were looking for adjusted earnings of $0.32 on revenue of $5.3 billion.

A rally in copper and gold prices last year helped boost the miner's results, though that boom is widely expected to slow or even backtrack in 2026.

""Global inventories of copper on exchanges have risen in recent months, during a period of sharp increases in copper prices,"" Quirk said on the earnings call. ""Most analysts are projecting that the market will be tightly balanced during 2026 with some projecting deficits and other small surpluses.""

Halliburton stock climbs after the oil services giant posts better-than-expected profits

Oil services provider Halliburton (HAL) posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, sending its shares up 2%.

The Houston-based company reported profits of $0.70 per diluted share, beating Wall Street estimates of $0.55 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Profits were flat from a year ago, when the company also posted earnings of $0.70 per share.

Revenue of $5.7 billion also came in stronger than the $5.4 billion estimated. It was also higher than the $5.6 billion in revenue reported a year ago.

Halliburton's revenue in its Completion and Production segment was roughly unchanged from a year ago at $3.3 billion, while revenue in the Drilling and Evaluation unit was $2.4 billion, also flat.

While the oil majors have shown reluctance in exploring Venezuelan oil following the US's removal of Nicolás Maduro (ExxonMobil's (XOM) CEO called it ""uninvestable""), oil infrastructure companies like Halliburton have shown more eagerness to revisit the country.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that the company has started looking at resumes for roles in the country, in a sign that Halliburton may be ready to reenter Venezuela.

Initial ads in ChatGPT are expected to cost about $60 per 1,000 views, comparable to live NFL games and targeted streaming inventory, per The Information.

The company is using premium pricing to do two things at once: Boost revenues to offset spending and set a high anchor price ahead of a larger advertising expansion.

Why it’s worth watching: OpenAI’s ad pricing comes in far above Meta’s, where CPMs average under $20. Meta’s typical CPM range is $10 to $15, with a “typical maximum” of $15 to $20 and an “extreme maximum” above $20, per Affect Group.

It can charge more because ChatGPT sits earlier in customers’ decision cycle. Prompts often show raw, brand-open intent, like “durable winter boots,” before a shopper commits to a retailer, keyword, or brand list.

OpenAI’s early advertiser outreach is going directly to large, established brands via agencies rather than building the business on small advertisers, per The Information. The ads, which will appear at the bottom of ChatGPT responses, will be clearly labeled and separated from organic answers—prioritizing trust while testing commercial viability.

The challenge: Early reporting is expected to include impressions and total clicks, not the deep context marketers use to justify premium spend at scale—like what prompt triggered the ad, what ChatGPT answered, and whether the ad led to a purchase.

Without query-level intent visibility and conversion tracking, brands can’t optimize confidently or validate what the channel is worth.

Implications for marketers: ChatGPT ads are expensive, but they put brands inside the moment a consumer is still deciding. That’s the benefit, but the risk is paying NFL-level rates for TV-style reporting.

Recommendations:

Test early to gain first-mover advantage. Low competition could make $60 CPMs tolerable.

Choose categories you want ads to appear in, test different creative for common prompts, and watch whether more people start searching for your brand or product by name.

Demand proof fast. If OpenAI can’t tie exposure to downstream outcomes, budgets won’t scale.

For more updates on the intersection of AI and enterprise tech, stay tuned to the Tech Buzz","As the ""AI-first"" era of enterprise technology moves from experimentation to massive deployment, IBM is doubling down on the engine that drives its market reach: its partners.

In a major strategic update announced today, Kareem Yusuf, Ph.D., IBM’s Senior Vice President of Ecosystems and Strategic Partners, unveiled a significant acceleration of the IBM Partner Plus program. The move is designed to streamline how businesses buy and deploy AI by empowering a global network of resellers, service providers, and ISVs with new incentives and AI-driven tools.

A New Blueprint for the AI Economy

The shift in how businesses consume technology—increasingly through hyperscaler marketplaces and automated platforms—has forced a rethink of traditional channel models. Yusuf noted that meeting current client demand requires ""more than great products,"" calling for an ecosystem that moves with ""speed, clarity, and shared outcomes.""

To meet this need, IBM is introducing several key enhancements for 2026:

AI-Driven Selling Experiences: Leveraging IBM’s own internal tech stack, partners will have access to new tools to identify opportunities and close deals with higher velocity.

Streamlined Routes to Market: IBM is prioritizing ""frictionless"" commerce by optimizing self-service, e-commerce, and major hyperscaler marketplaces.

The ""Agent Connect"" Initiative: A new focus on IBM Agent Connect aims to bridge the gap between IBM’s direct sellers and its partner network, ensuring better alignment on complex enterprise deals.

Scalable Co-Marketing & Incentives: Enhanced funding and automated incentive structures are being rolled out to help resellers and service partners scale their pipeline more aggressively.

Tailored Support for a Diverse Ecosystem

The 2026 strategy isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. IBM has recalibrated its coverage model to support different partner types:

For Resellers: The focus is on removing friction, automating business processes, and strengthening the product offers that drive high-volume pipeline.

For Service Partners: IBM is investing in resources to help consultants and integrators embed IBM technology (like watsonx) into their own proprietary service offerings.

For ISVs (Software Vendors): IBM is positioning itself as the foundational layer, providing the guidance and technical architecture for developers to build their own AI-competitive solutions on IBM tech.

Why This Matters for the Tech Sector

IBM’s aggressive pivot toward a partner-centric model highlights a broader trend in the industry: the complexity of GenAI deployment is too vast for any one company to handle alone. By tightening the bond between its technology and the thousands of partners who influence client decisions, IBM is positioning itself to be the ""infrastructure of choice"" for the next wave of AI adoption.

""The outcomes we’re driving toward—volume, velocity, and ultimately revenue growth and reach—remain straightforward and consistent,"" said Yusuf.

As we head further into 2026, the success of IBM’s AI ambitions will likely hinge on how well this ""vibrant ecosystem"" can translate raw AI power into real-world business results.

If the final underlier level on the determination date is greater than or equal to 87.50% of the initial underlier level (set on the trade date and is expected to be the closing level of the underlier on the trade date), you will receive the maximum settlement amount, which is expected to be the threshold settlement amount (expected to be between $1,108.80 and $1,127.90 for each $1,000 face amount of your notes).

To determine your payment at maturity, we will calculate the underlier return, which is the percentage increase or decrease in the final underlier level from the initial underlier level. On the stated maturity date, for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, you will receive an amount in cash equal to:

·if the underlier return is greater than or equal to -12.50% (the final underlier level is greater than or equal to 87.50% of the initial underlier level), the maximum settlement amount; or

·if the underlier return is negative and is below -12.50% (the final underlier level is less than the initial underlier level by more than 12.50%), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1,000 times (b) approximately 1.1429 times (c) the sum of the underlier return plus 12.50% (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Our estimated value on the trade date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the notes on the trade date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the notes and our estimated value of the notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

Our estimated value on the trade date is not a prediction of the price at which the notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another

PS- 2

affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the trade date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the initial issue date of the notes because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes and other costs in connection with the notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the notes at any time prior to the trade date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their trade date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the notes may have at law if

PS- 3

and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

KEY TERMS

Issuer: Barclays Bank PLC

Underlier: the EURO STOXX 50® Index (Bloomberg ticker symbol, “SX5E <Index>”), as calculated, maintained and published by STOXX Limited

Specified currency: U.S. dollars (“$”)

Face amount: each note will have a face amount of $1,000; $ in the aggregate for all the notes

Purchase at amount other than face amount: the amount we will pay you at the stated maturity date for your notes will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for your notes, so if you acquire notes at a premium (or discount) to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, it could affect your investment in a number of ways. The return on your investment in such notes will be lower (or higher) than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount. Also, the stated threshold level would not offer the same measure of protection to your investment as would be the case if you had purchased the notes at face amount. See “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Notes Generally—If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected” on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

Cash settlement amount (on the stated maturity date): for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, we will pay you on the stated maturity date an amount in cash equal to:

·if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the threshold level, the threshold settlement amount; or

·if the final underlier level is less than the threshold level, the sum of (1) $1,000 plus (2) the product of (i) $1,000 times (ii) the buffer rate times (iii) the sum of the underlier return plus the threshold amount (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Any payment on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC, and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Initial underlier level (to be set on the trade date): , the closing level of the underlier on the trade date

Final underlier level: the closing level of the underlier on the determination date, subject to adjustment in limited circumstances as provided under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement; and subject to market disruption events and non-trading days as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

PS- 4

Underlier return: the quotient of (1) the final underlier level minus the initial underlier level divided by (2) the initial underlier level, expressed as a percentage

Threshold level: 87.50% of the initial underlier level

Threshold amount: 12.50%

Threshold settlement amount (to be set on the trade date): expected to be between $1,108.80 and $1,127.90

Cap level (to be set on the trade date): expected to be between 110.88% and 112.79% of the initial underlier level

Maximum settlement amount (to be set on the trade date): expected to be the threshold settlement amount

Buffer rate: the quotient of the initial underlier level divided by the threshold level, which equals approximately 114.29%

Trade date:

Original issue date (settlement date): expected to be three scheduled business days following the trade date

Determination date (to be set on the trade date): a specified date that is expected to be between 16 and 18 months after the trade date, subject to postponement in the event of a market disruption event or non-trading day as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the determination date be postponed by more than five trading days.

Stated maturity date (to be set on the trade date): a specified date that is expected to be the second scheduled business day after the determination date. The maturity date will be postponed if the determination date is postponed due to the occurrence or continuance of a market disruption event or a non-trading day on the determination date. In such a case, the maturity date will be postponed by the same number of business days from but excluding the originally scheduled determination date to and including the actual determination date. The maturity date will also be postponed if that date is not a business day. See “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” on page S-46 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.

No interest: the notes will not bear interest

No listing: the notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or interdealer quotation system

No redemption: the notes will not be subject to redemption right or price dependent redemption right

Closing level: as provided on page S-86 of the accompanying prospectus supplement. The closing level of the underlier reported on the Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”) page may be lower or higher than the official closing level of the underlier published by the underlier sponsor. In certain circumstances, the closing level of the underlier will be based on the alternate calculation of the underlier described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Business day: as defined under “Terms of the Notes—Business Day” on page S-47 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Trading day: notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying prospectus supplement, with respect to the underlier, a day, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion, on which the underlier is calculated and published by the underlier sponsor. Therefore, a day would be a trading day

PS- 5

regardless of whether one or more of the principal securities markets for the underlier stocks of the underlier are closed on that day, if the underlier sponsor publishes the underlier level on that day

Use of proceeds and hedging: as described under “Use of Proceeds and Hedging” on page S-115 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Tax consequences: you should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the underlier. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the notes (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the notes. This gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the original issue price. However, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

ERISA: as described under “Benefit Plan Investor Considerations” on page S-101 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Supplemental plan of distribution: we will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “agent”), and the agent will agree to purchase from us, the face amount of the notes at the price specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The agent will commit to take and pay for all of the notes, if any are taken. The agent proposes initially to offer the notes to the public at the initial issue price set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment for the notes on the original issue date, which is more than one business day following the trade date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisor.

We have been advised by Barclays Capital Inc. that it intends to make a market in the notes. However, neither Barclays Capital Inc. nor any of our affiliates that makes a market is obligated to do so and any of

PS- 6

them may stop doing so at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity or trading market for the notes.

Calculation agent: Barclays Bank PLC

CUSIP no.: 06749FEW5

ISIN no.: US06749FEW59

Conflicts of interest: Barclays Capital Inc. is an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC and, as such, has a “conflict of interest” in this offering within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. Consequently, the offering is being conducted in compliance with the provisions of Rule 5121. Barclays Capital Inc. is not permitted to sell notes in this offering to an account over which it exercises discretionary authority without the prior specific written approval of the account holder.

FDIC: the notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS OF THE NOTES

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES

The following table and chart are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the impact that the various hypothetical closing levels on the determination date could have on the cash settlement amount at maturity assuming all other variables remain constant.

The examples below are based on a range of final underlier levels that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the closing level will be on any day throughout the term of your notes, and no one can predict what the final underlier level will be on the determination date. The underlier has been highly volatile in the past—meaning that the closing level has changed considerably in relatively short periods—and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.

The information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the notes assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the face amount and held to the stated maturity date. If you sell your notes in a secondary market prior to the stated maturity date, your return will depend upon the market value of your notes at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the table below, such as interest rates, the volatility of the underlier and our creditworthiness. In addition, assuming no changes in market conditions or our creditworthiness and any other relevant factors, the value of your notes on the trade date will, and the price you may receive for your notes may, be significantly less than the initial issue price. For more information on the value of your notes in the secondary market, see “Risk Factors” on page S-9 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, if Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes” on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement. The information in the table also reflects the key hypothetical terms and assumptions in the following box.

Key Hypothetical Terms and Assumptions Face amount $1,000 Cap level 110.88% of the initial underlier level Threshold settlement amount $1,108.80 Threshold level 87.50% of the initial underlier level Buffer rate approximately 114.29% Threshold amount 12.50% Neither a market disruption event nor a non-trading day occurs on the originally scheduled determination date No change in or affecting any of the underlier stocks or the method by which the underlier sponsor calculates the underlier Notes purchased on original issue date for the initial issue price noted on the cover page of this pricing supplement and held to the stated maturity date

Moreover, we have not yet set the initial underlier level that will serve as the baseline for determining the underlier return and the amount that we will pay on your notes, if any, at maturity. We will not do so until the trade date. As a result, the actual initial underlier level may differ substantially from the closing level of the underlier prior to the trade date.

For these reasons, the actual performance of the underlier over the term of your notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, if any, may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical closing levels of the underlier shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical closing levels of the underlier during recent periods, see “The Underlier—Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier” below. Before investing in the notes, you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the underlier between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the notes.

PS- 9

Also, the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your notes, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the underlier stocks.

The levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final underlier levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial underlier level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical cash settlement amounts, each based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level), and are expressed as percentages of the face amount of a note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical cash settlement amount of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $1,000 of the outstanding face amount of the notes on the stated maturity date would equal 100.000% of the face amount of a note, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) and the assumptions noted above.

Hypothetical Final Underlier Level

(as Percentage of Initial Underlier Level) Hypothetical Cash Settlement Amount

(as Percentage of Face Amount) 150.000% 110.880% 140.000% 110.880% 130.000% 110.880% 120.000% 110.880% 110.880% 110.880% 110.000% 110.880% 105.000% 110.880% 102.500% 110.880% 100.000% 110.880% 95.000% 110.880% 90.000% 110.880% 87.500% 110.880% 87.499% 99.999% 80.000% 91.429% 75.000% 85.714% 50.000% 57.143% 25.000% 28.571% 0.000% 0.000%

If, for example, the final underlier level were determined to be 25.000% of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be approximately 28.571% of the face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date at the face amount and held them to the stated maturity date, you would lose approximately 71.429% of your investment (if you purchased your notes at a premium to face amount, you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). In addition, if the final underlier level were determined to be 87.500% or more of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be limited to the threshold settlement amount, or 110.880% of each $1,000 face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date and held them to the stated maturity date, you would not receive more than the threshold settlement amount for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, regardless of the extent to which the final underlier level may be greater than 87.500% of the initial underlier level.

The following chart also shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical cash settlement amounts (expressed as a percentage of the face amount of your notes) that we would pay on your notes on the stated maturity date, if the final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The chart shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of less than 87.500% (the section left of the 87.500% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical cash settlement amount of less than 100.000% of the face amount of your notes (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and, accordingly, in a loss of principal to the holder of the notes. The chart also

PS- 10

shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of greater than or equal to 87.500% (the section right of the 87.500% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a capped return on your investment.

The cash settlement amounts shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on closing levels for the underlier that may not be achieved on the determination date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your notes on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell your notes, may bear little relation to the hypothetical cash settlement amounts shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the notes. The hypothetical cash settlement amounts on notes held to the stated maturity date in the examples above assume you purchased your notes at their face amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual issue price you pay for your notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your notes. If you purchase your notes for a price other than the face amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples.

Please read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes” on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.

We cannot predict the actual final underlier level or what the market value of your notes will be on any particular trading day, nor can we predict the relationship between the closing level of the underlier and the market value of your notes at any time prior to the stated maturity date. The actual amount that you will receive, if any, at maturity and the rate of return on the notes will depend on the actual initial underlier level, cap level and threshold settlement amount that we will set on the trade date and the actual final underlier level determined by the calculation agent as described above. Moreover, the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently, the amount of cash to be paid in respect of your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date may be very different from the information reflected in the table and chart above.

Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes

An investment in the notes involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the notes. Investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier or any of the underlier stocks, i.e. the stocks composing the underlier. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

You May Lose Your Entire Investment in the Notes

You can lose your entire investment in the notes. The cash payment on your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date will be based on the performance of the underlier as measured from the initial underlier level set on the trade date to the closing level of the underlier on the determination date (also referred to as the “final underlier level”). If the final underlier level is less than the threshold level, you will lose approximately 1.1429% of the face amount of your notes for every 1% that the final underlier level is less than the threshold level. Thus, you may lose your entire investment in the notes, which would include any premium to face amount you paid when you purchased the notes.

Also, the market price of your notes prior to the stated maturity date may be significantly lower than the purchase price you pay for your notes. Consequently, if you sell your notes before the stated maturity date, you may receive far less than the amount of your investment in the notes.

Your Maximum Payment on the Notes Is Limited to the Threshold Settlement Amount

Your ability to participate in any change in the value of the underlier over the term of your notes will be limited because of the maximum settlement amount (which is equal to the threshold settlement amount), which will be set on the trade date. The maximum settlement amount will limit the cash settlement amount you may receive for each of your notes at maturity, no matter how much the level of the underlier may rise beyond the initial underlier level over the term of your notes. Accordingly, the amount payable for each of your notes may be significantly less than it would have been had you invested directly in the underlier.

If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected

The cash settlement amount will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for the notes. If you purchase notes at a price that differs from the face amount of the notes, then the return on your investment in such notes held to the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. If you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, the return on your investment in the notes will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount or a discount to face amount. In addition, the impact of the threshold level and the cap level on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your notes relative to face amount. For example, while the threshold level will still provide for an increase in the return on the notes if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the threshold level but less than the cap level, if the final underlier level is less than the threshold level you will incur a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. Similarly, if you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount, the cap level will only permit a lower return on your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount.

The Stated Maturity Date of the Notes Is a Pricing Term and Will Be Determined By Us on the Trade Date

We will not fix the stated maturity date until the trade date. The term of the notes could be as long as the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. You should be willing and able to hold your notes for up to the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The stated maturity date selected by us could have an impact on the value of the notes.

Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Levels of the Underlier on the Dates Specified

Any payment on the notes will be determined based on the closing levels of the underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the underlier determined at any other time.

No Interest or Dividend Payments or Voting Rights or Rights to Receive Any Underlier Stock

As a holder of the notes, you will not receive interest payments. As a result, even if the amount payable on the stated maturity date exceeds the face amount of your notes, the overall return you earn on your notes may be less than you would have earned by investing in a non-index-linked debt security of comparable maturity that bears interest at a prevailing market rate. In addition, as a holder of the notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the underlier stocks would have. Furthermore, investing in the notes will not make you a holder of any of the underlier stocks. Your notes will be paid in cash and you will have no right to receive delivery of any underlier stocks.

The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain

There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS. Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described above under “Key Terms—Tax consequences.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

Credit of Issuer

The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the notes and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the notes.

PS- 13

You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the notes or receiving a different security from the notes, which may be worth significantly less than the notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier

Adjustments to the Underlier Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes

The underlier sponsor may add, delete, substitute or adjust the underlier stocks or make other methodological changes to the underlier that could affect its performance. The calculation agent will calculate the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to the underlier. In addition, the underlier sponsor may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of the underlier at any time. Under these circumstances, the calculation agent may select a successor index that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the underlier or, if no successor index is available, the calculation agent will determine the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the underlier and, consequently, the value of the notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement, as modified by “Supplemental Terms of the Notes” above.

No Direct Exposure to Fluctuations in Exchange Rates Between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro

The underlier is composed of non-U.S. securities denominated in euros. Because the level of the underlier is also calculated in euros (and not in U.S. dollars), the performance of the underlier will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the euro. In addition, any payments on the notes determined based on the performance of the underlier will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Therefore, holders of the notes will not benefit from any appreciation of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

Non-U.S. Securities Markets Risks

The underlier stocks are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available

PS- 14

information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

We and Our Affiliates, and Any Dealer Participating in the Distribution of the Notes, May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest

We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, if any dealer participating in the distribution of the notes or any of its affiliates conducts hedging activities for us in connection with the notes, that participating dealer or its affiliates will expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit will be in addition to any selling concession that the participating dealer realizes for the sale of the notes to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the participating dealer to sell the notes to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the notes. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

Lack of Liquidity

The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell

PS- 15

the notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the notes. The notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your notes to maturity.

Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes

In addition to the level of the underlier, the value of the notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including: the expected volatility of the underlier; the time to maturity of the notes; the dividend rates on the underlier stocks; exchange rates; interest and yield rates in the market generally; supply and demand for the notes; a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; and our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your notes and the estimated value of the notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes

The estimated value of the notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you

PS- 16

may be able to sell your notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions (described above under “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes”), and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the notes, secondary market prices of your notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your notes, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the notes on the trade date, as well as the secondary market value of the notes, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your notes.

PS- 17

The Underlier

The underlier is a free float market capitalization-weighted index composed of 50 of the largest stocks in terms of free float market capitalization traded on major Eurozone exchanges. For more information about the underlier, see “Indices—The STOXX Benchmark Indices” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

In addition, information about the underlier may be obtained from other sources, including, but not limited to, the underlier sponsor’s website (including information regarding the underlier’s sector weightings). We are not incorporating by reference into this pricing supplement the website or any material it includes. Neither we nor any agent or dealer for this offering makes any representation that this publicly available information regarding the underlier is accurate or complete.

Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier

You should not take the historical levels of the underlier as an indication of the future performance of the underlier. The closing level of the underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing level of the underlier during any period shown below is not an indication that the underlier is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the term of your notes. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the underlier or the underlier stocks will not result in a loss on your initial investment on the stated maturity date.

Neither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the underlier. The actual performance of the underlier over the term of the notes, as well as the cash settlement amount, may bear little relation to the historical levels shown below.

The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the underlier based on the daily closing levels from January 4, 2021 through January 23, 2026. The closing level of the underlier on January 23, 2026 was 5,948.20. The dotted line indicates a hypothetical buffer level of 87.50% of the closing level of the underlier on January 23, 2026. The actual buffer level will be equal to 87.50% of the initial underlier level.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-26 17:01:28.340624

And last year, federal agents detained 475 people during a raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.
Here's what we know about immigration enforcement in businesses.
And so can law enforcement agents — without a warrant,” said Jessie Hahn, senior counsel for labor and employment policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy nonprofit.
Still, she stressed the importance of speaking publicly about the impacts of immigration enforcement overall.","From family-run cafes to retail giants, businesses are increasingly coming into the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign, whether it's public pressure for them to speak out against aggressive immigration enforcement or becoming the sites for such arrests themselves.

In Minneapolis, where the Department of Homeland Security says it's carrying out its largest operation ever, hotels, restaurants and other businesses have temporarily closed their doors or stopped accepting reservations amid widespread protests.

On Sunday, after the U.S. Border Patrol shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, more than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies including Target, Best Buy and UnitedHealth signed an open letter calling for ""an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.""

Still, that letter didn't name immigration enforcement directly, or point to recent arrests at businesses. Earlier this month, widely-circulated videos showed federal agents detaining two Target employees in Minnesota. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has rounded up day laborers in Home Depot parking lots and delivery workers on the street nationwide. And last year, federal agents detained 475 people during a raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.

Here's what we know about immigration enforcement in businesses.

What ICE is allowed to do

Anyone — including ICE — can enter public areas of a business as they wish. This can include restaurant dining sections, open parking lots, office lobbies and shopping aisles.

“The general public can go into a store for purposes of shopping, right? And so can law enforcement agents — without a warrant,” said Jessie Hahn, senior counsel for labor and employment policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy nonprofit. As a result, immigration officials may try to question people, seize information and even make arrests in public-facing parts of a business.

But to enter areas with a reasonable expectation of privacy — like a back office or a closed-off kitchen — ICE is supposed to have a judicial warrant, which must be signed by a judge from a specified court, and can be limited to certain days or parts of the business.

Judicial warrants should not be confused with administrative warrants, which are signed by immigration officers.

But in an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press, ICE leadership stated administrative warrants were sufficient for federal officers to forcibly enter people's homes if there's a final order of removal. Hahn and other immigration rights lawyers say this upends years of precedent for federal agents' authority in private spaces — and violates ""bedrock principles"" of the U.S. Constitution.

Still, the easiest way for ICE to enter private spaces in businesses without a warrant is through consent from an employer, which could be as simple as letting an agent into certain parts of the property. The agency may also cite other “exigent circumstances,” Hahn notes, such as if they’re in “hot pursuit” of a certain individual.

Other actions ICE can take against employers

Beyond more sweeping workplace raids, enforcement against employers can also take the form of I-9 audits, which focus on verifying employees' authorization to work in the U.S.

Since the start of Trump’s second term, attorneys have pointed to an uptick in instances of ICE physically showing up to a place of business to initiate an I-9 audit. ICE has the authority to do this — but it marks a shift from prior enforcement, when audits more often began through writing like mailed notices.

David Jones, a regional managing partner at labor and employment law firm Fisher Phillips in Memphis, said he's also seen immigration agents approach these audits with the same approach as recent raids.

“ICE is still showing up in their full tactical gear without identifying themselves necessarily, just to do things like serve a notice of inspection,” Jones said. Employers have three days to respond to an I-9 audit, but agents behaving aggressively might make some businesses think they need to act more immediately.

The rights of businesses

If ICE shows up without a warrant, businesses can ask agents to leave — or potentially refuse service based on their own company policy, perhaps citing safety concerns or other disruptions caused by agents' presence. But there's no guarantee immigration officials will comply, especially in public spaces.

“That’s not what we’re seeing here in Minnesota. What we’re seeing is they still conduct the activity,” said John Medeiros, who leads corporate immigration practice at Minneapolis-based law firm Nilan Johnson Lewis.

Because of this, Medeiros said, the question for many businesses becomes less about getting ICE to leave their property and more about what to do if ICE violates consent and other legal requirements.

In Minneapolis — and other cities that have seen immigration enforcement surges, including Chicago and Los Angeles — some businesses have put up signs to label private spaces and set wider protocols for what to do when ICE arrives.

Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and vice president of HR at Engage PEO, says she's also seen a nationwide uptick in interest for I-9 self-audits across sectors and additional emergency preparation.

How the public is responding

ICE's increased presence and forceful arrests at businesses has sparked public outcry, some of it directed at the companies themselves for not taking a strong enough stand.

Some employers, particularly smaller business owners, are speaking out about ICE's impacts on their workers and customers. But a handful of bigger corporations have stayed largely silent, at least publicly, about enforcement making its way to their storefronts.

Minneapolis-based Target has not commented on videos of federal agents detaining two of its employees earlier this month — although its incoming chief executive, Michael Fiddelke, sent a video message to the company's over 400,000 workers Monday calling recent violence ""incredibly painful,"" without directly mentioning immigration enforcement. He said Target was doing ""everything we can to manage what's in our control."" Fiddelke also signed the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce's letter calling for broader de-escalation, which got support from the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of CEOs from more than 200 companies.

Target is among companies that organizers with ""ICE Out of Minnesota"" have asked to take stronger public stances over ICE's presence in the state. Others include Home Depot, whose parking lots have become a known site of ICE raids over the last year, and Hilton, which protestors said was among brands of Twin City-area hotels that have housed federal agents.

Hilton and Home Depot didn't respond to comment requests over the activists' calls. Home Depot previously denied being involved in immigration operations.

Several worker groups have been more outspoken. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for a chapter of the Culinary Union in Las Vegas, said members were shocked by a “widening pattern of unlawful ICE behavior” and “recognize that anti-immigrant policies hurt tourism, business, and their families.” United Auto Workers also expressed solidarity with Minneapolis residents ""fighting back against the federal government’s abuses and attacks on the working class.”

Hahn of the National Immigration Law Center noted some businesses are communicating through industry associations to avoid direct exposure to possible retaliation. Still, she stressed the importance of speaking publicly about the impacts of immigration enforcement overall.

“We know that the raids are contributing to things like labor shortages and reduced foot traffic,” Hahn said, adding that fears to push back on “this abuse of power from Trump could ultimately land us in a very different looking economy.”

Ultimately, the 'Zepbound Self Pay Journey Program' represents Eli Lilly's commitment to enhancing access to their weight management treatment.","It's no secret that the landscape of weight management medications has been rapidly evolving, and Zepbound, a medication from Eli Lilly, has been at the forefront of many conversations. For those considering Zepbound without insurance coverage, the 'Zepbound Self Pay Journey Program' offers a structured approach to managing the costs. This program, launched by Eli Lilly, aims to make this treatment more accessible to a wider range of patients who are facing the significant financial hurdles often associated with these groundbreaking therapies.

What does this 'journey' actually entail in terms of pricing? Well, Eli Lilly has recently made some notable adjustments to the program's pricing structure, a move designed to improve affordability. For instance, the starting dose of 2.5 mg is now available through LillyDirect, Eli Lilly's own online platform, for $299 per month. This is a reduction from the previous $349. For higher doses, the monthly average price has also seen a decrease, with the 5 mg dose dropping from $499 to $399, and even higher doses moving from $499 down to $449 per month. These adjustments are part of a broader effort by Eli Lilly to address the cost barriers that many patients encounter, as highlighted by their executives.

It's worth noting that the cost of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, can vary quite a bit. Without insurance, out-of-pocket costs can typically range from $300 to $600 per month, and this doesn't always include potential clinic membership fees, which can add another $40 to $100. This is where programs like Eli Lilly's become particularly relevant. They aim to provide a more predictable and potentially lower cost for those paying directly.

Beyond the brand-name medication and its specific programs, there's also the realm of compounded tirzepatide. While this can sometimes appear more affordable, it's crucial to approach it with caution. Compounded versions aren't FDA-approved, meaning their safety, quality, and potency aren't guaranteed in the same way as the name-brand drug. The FDA's temporary allowance for compounded GLP-1s has ended, and while some pharmacies can compound under specific regulations, it's still not the same as an approved medication. Prices for compounded versions can swing wildly, from under $100 to over $500, but extremely low prices should raise a red flag, as they could indicate unregulated sources. A more realistic price for compounded tirzepatide, when obtained through legitimate channels, is often in the $299-$399 range per month.

It's a step towards making the financial aspect of this journey more manageable for patients who are navigating their health and wellness without the benefit of insurance coverage for these specific medications.

According to a statement from the WCAA, authorities also arrested the driver but still had yet to determine the cause of the crash.
The Detroit Free Press reports that several videos posted on social media appear to show a man wearing a Detroit Lions jersey being taken into custody, but it can't confirm whether he was the driver who crashed into the airport.
Why didn't the Detroit airport have bollards in place to prevent a car from crashing into the terminal?
It's entirely possible there's a reason, but that also seems like pretty basic airport security stuff.","Air travel can be incredibly stressful, and it's understandable that you might get frustrated, but no matter how close you are to missing your flight, Jalopnik's official position is that you should not crash your car into the airport. Sure, you might be tempted, but you should resist that temptation. We'd also like to think that would be obvious, but ClickOnDetroit reports someone did exactly that on Friday night at the Detroit airport.

While airports usually place bollards to prevent something like this from happening, the driver reportedly crashed through the front doors and into the area that Delta Air Lines uses for check-ins and bag checks. Thankfully, the driver didn't kill anyone when they crashed their car into the airport, but the Wayne County Airport Authority did say in a statement that the fire department treated six people at the scene of the crash. According to a statement from the WCAA, authorities also arrested the driver but still had yet to determine the cause of the crash.

Even though the crash happened several days ago, information remains limited. The Detroit Free Press reports that several videos posted on social media appear to show a man wearing a Detroit Lions jersey being taken into custody, but it can't confirm whether he was the driver who crashed into the airport. Hopefully, we'll learn more in the next couple of days.

Initial reports also described the driver's car as a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but upon closer inspection, it appears to instead be a much less expensive C-Class. In fact, I'm pretty sure it isn't even a particularly fancy C-Class and would be willing to bet it's nothing more than a C300. If you're scrambling to escape a car crashing into the building you assumed you'd be safe inside, that probably doesn't matter to you all that much, at least in the moment, but as a transportation site, it's still important for us to point out. The facts matter, you know?

Also, while I can't imagine anyone at Mercedes is thrilled to see one of its cars in the news after someone drove it into an airport, on a certain level, you have to imagine the design team is pleased a C-Class got confused with an S-Class. After all, that's the whole reason the C-Class looks like a smaller S-Class, right? Same sausage, different length? It's not like a car with a roughly $40,000 base price could ever be considered cheap, but at the time, a new S-Class cost more than twice as much as a base C-Class, and people don't usually confuse a $40,000 car with one that cost more than $90,000 when it was new.

Still, that's far from the biggest issue here. Why didn't the Detroit airport have bollards in place to prevent a car from crashing into the terminal? It's entirely possible there's a reason, but that also seems like pretty basic airport security stuff. Whether this was an intentional attack, or the driver simply experienced a medical emergency, you'd think there would be measures in place to stop something like this from happening.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/crashing-out-at-the-detroit-airport-is-understandable-but-actually-crashing-into-it-is-still-inadvisable/l-intro-1769444644.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 18:02:26.072487

It said lending will be drawn from banks’ balance sheets and will primarily target smaller enterprises.
The banks and UKEF have also agreed to provide advisory support to borrowers.
UK business secretary Peter Kyle, who convened today’s discussion, said: “Strengthening Britain’s export potential relies on British businesses having the means, motive, and opportunity to succeed in new overseas markets.
In 2024, UKEF announced it planned to support 1,000 SMEs per year by 2029, up from just over 200 across the previous financial year.","UK Export Finance (UKEF) will grant automatic guarantees to working capital facilities provided by Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Santander, as part of an £11bn lending package targeting British SMEs.

The UK government announced today that following talks in Westminster, the five lenders, which collectively serve half of all British businesses, agreed to a funding commitment aimed at helping companies expand into international markets and benefit from new trade deals.

It said lending will be drawn from banks’ balance sheets and will primarily target smaller enterprises. The banks and UKEF have also agreed to provide advisory support to borrowers.

UKEF will provide guarantees of up to 80% for eligible loans, and banks can apply the cover automatically for working capital facilities up to £10mn in value.

The government said the agreement “is one of the largest collective moves by the banking sector in over a decade”.

HSBC, which has pledged to make £3bn in lending available through the scheme, said its research shows that 82% of businesses that trade internationally expect to grow over the next two years.

“Yet many face barriers to accessing the capital and support they need to go global,” the bank said.

UK business secretary Peter Kyle, who convened today’s discussion, said: “Strengthening Britain’s export potential relies on British businesses having the means, motive, and opportunity to succeed in new overseas markets.

“The £11bn these banks are making available will help meet the ambitions of smaller British businesses to fully export, expand and exploit these international market opportunities.”

UKEF chief executive Tim Reid added the agreement “unlocks billions of pounds to help UK businesses compete to win overseas contracts”.

The announcement follows last year’s move by Westminster to increase UKEF’s capacity by £20bn, bringing its lending and guarantee limit to £80bn, part of the government’s first trade strategy since leaving the EU in 2020.

In 2024, UKEF announced it planned to support 1,000 SMEs per year by 2029, up from just over 200 across the previous financial year.

John Baldwin, chief executive of Santander’s corporate and commercial banking division, said the bank’s most recent Trade Barometer, its bi-annual research study, found UK businesses have “an ever-growing interest in international expansion – despite the various geopolitical challenges they face”.

“I’m proud to have worked with UKEF on the lending packages announced today, which will help power the overseas growth ambitions of businesses across the UK – and in turn boost the UK economy,” he said.",https://www.gtreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Felixstowe-port_resized.jpeg,N,,2026-01-26 15:09:40.055012

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Just last month, the chatter was that OpenAI was in another round of talks to raise another $100 billion which would value it at $750 billion.
Similarly, Anthropic is on the verge of being given a $350 billion price tag as it happily raises $10 billion or more.
While public markets might raise eyebrows, none of this uncertainty is putting off the private markets.
At least until OpenAI or Anthropic decide they want public-market money badly enough to tolerate public-market questions.","Yet launching on to the AI-thirsty equity markets is not yet necessary for the makers of ChatGPT and Claude, because the cash continues to gush into them with the intensity of a firehose.

OpenAI was valued at $500 billion in October after an employee share sale saw investment by Softbank and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. Just last month, the chatter was that OpenAI was in another round of talks to raise another $100 billion which would value it at $750 billion. Similarly, Anthropic is on the verge of being given a $350 billion price tag as it happily raises $10 billion or more.

These businesses still have far too many unanswered questions to go public. Staying private keeps a comfortable cloak of secrecy over their operations and gives them time to unpick their devilishly complex corporate structures.

Being a listed business would require an unprecedented level of transparency, not least over whether their revenues can catch up with their spending.

Sure, they are growing at a rate of knots, but we are not quite sure at what cost. Anthropic’s revenues doubled from $4 billion to $9 billion last year. OpenAI’s annualised revenues (what the company is earning right now, scaled up as if that pace continued for a full year) rose above $20 billion in 2025, up from $6 billion in 2024.

Yet the mammoth outgoings on computing capacity dwarfs sales, and they need to keep spending because bigger models create more user demand and support more paying customers.

While public markets might raise eyebrows, none of this uncertainty is putting off the private markets. Asked by Brad Gerstner, his own investor, how OpenAI could commit to spending trillions while earning merely billions, Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, shut him down with sharp confidence.

“If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” Altman snapped on the BG2 Pod. Who needs retail shareholders when private buyers are baying for equity?

• Will AI bubble trouble the stock markets in 2026?

A listing would mean the grind of quarterly reporting, exposing their detailed financials or as OpenAI’s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, called it, getting “wrapped around an IPO axle”.

Unlike their private British counterparts who make annual filings with Companies House, the Americans need to reveal very little of what goes on beneath the bonnet to anyone, except their leading investors.

Perhaps more crucially, a float would mean revealing the details of the complex circular deals which have raised the spectre of the dotcom boom and bust. It would provide an answer to that well-worn question “are we in a bubble?” and it may not be an answer they want to give.

There’s a nervousness about being the first mover and suffering a spectacular flop. Then there’s the force majeure. The US federal government shutdown last year hurt IPOs as the administrative machine stalled while President Trump’s erratic behaviour is churning up the markets.

In the meantime, anyone keen to get exposure to these shares can do it the long way round, by buying into their heavyweight partners, Amazon or Microsoft. At least until OpenAI or Anthropic decide they want public-market money badly enough to tolerate public-market questions. Right now, that feels some way off.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Ff2a96e27-320f-4e9b-960b-a3765bc3efc8.jpg?crop=1500%2C844%2C0%2C78&resize=1200,N,,2026-01-26 13:03:27.556895

CEOs of more than 60 Minnesota-based organizations released a joint statement Sunday, through the state’s Chamber of Commerce, urging “immediate de-escalation of tensions” that have plagued Minneapolis for weeks amid the flood of Immigration & Customs Enforcement actions in the city. Tensions soared in the wake of the Jan. 6 killing of legal observer Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer, with many fearing more escalation after Saturday’s shooting death of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent.

The CEOs took a neutral tone in their letter, referencing how the “recent challenges facing our state have created widespread disruption and tragic loss of life.” But they urged definite action, including better collaboration among local, state and federal officials to find “real solutions.”

Pressure from employees is building

The coalition includes some of the state’s largest employers, such as Target, Cargill, 3M, Medtronic, Land O’ Lakes, United Health Group, Delta Dental and General Mills.

While the letter came on the heels of Pretti’s death, it also followed increasing pressure from employees for leadership to take a stand on ICE and the Trump administration’s targeting of Minneapolis.

Organizers of the Jan. 23 “ICE out of Minnesota” action say more than 75,000 residents walked out of work and school—and 700 businesses closed down—to take part in a march calling for the agency to vacate the state. Hundreds of Target workers issued a letter before the protest to the company CEO, urging the organization to take a stance.

Hilton has also found itself under intense scrutiny after one of its Minneapolis-area franchisees cancelled the reservations of a group of ICE officers. The chain severed ties with the property, prompting protests at its locations across Minneapolis and elsewhere.

The growing backlash, including from employees, mirrors the calls for organizations to speak out in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd. That pressure led to significant growth in corporate DEI investments and agendas, much of which has abated in the last few years.

“The message to those most affected was clear: When the news cycle moves on, so do you,” Dr. Marcelle Moncrieffe-Newman recently wrote for HR Executive about DEI rollbacks.

Yet, many workers, particularly Gen Z, expect their employer to be unequivocal about cultural issues, including hot-button political topics.

A survey from Bentley University and Gallup last year found that 51% of Americans want companies to take a public stance on current events—a 13-point jump from 2024. In particular, 41% of those surveyed believe organizations should speak out on immigration, and 58% want to see companies comment on free speech issues—both 10 points higher than the previous year.

In an interview with The New York Times about the Minnesota CEO letter, New York University Professor Alison Taylor said the companies have been “backed into a corner.”

“Because obviously the situation going on is starting to have commercial consequences,” she said, noting, however, that the letter—which does not express outright opposition to ICE or tactics being used in Minneapolis—is likely going to draw criticism. Commentary in Axios has already labeled the effort “milquetoast.”

“Is it better than doing nothing?” Taylor questioned. “Probably. Is it sufficient? I don’t think anyone’s going to think this is sufficient.”

Calling for cooperation

While the CEOs’ open letter struck a neutral tone, it did suggest leaders are involved—albeit in a less visible way—in efforts to reduce the potential for further conflict. They wrote that representatives of the coalition have been working “every day behind the scenes” with local, state and federal officials, including remaining in “close communication” with Minn. Gov. Tim Walz, the White House, Vice President J.D. Vance and local mayors.

“There are ways for us to come together to foster progress,” they wrote, calling for “peace and focused cooperation” among leaders to achieve a “swift and durable solution that enables families, business, our employees and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future.”",https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/Immigration-Enforcement-Minnesota-2-AP-Photo-Adam-Gray-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:03:18.278572

Hours before I slid into Celine’s presentation on Saturday, a designer who had already seen the clothes relayed to me that Mr. Rider’s first full men’s collection for Celine was cunning, inviting, good. He was right.

On the wall at Celine HQ were outfits rigged up by Mr. Rider. What stood out? An ivory field jacket with sleeves in a slightly different shade of cream, a navy half-zip with a key holder looped onto the zipper and a collarless overcoat that landed at the knees, like a Bar jacket that underwent limb-lengthening surgery.

I lingered over a black wool jacket, the offspring of a sport coat and a Harrington. It was dressy with roped shoulders, yet chopped straight across. I wanted to grab it off the wall and try it on, to feel its swing. I was less sold on the white jeans it was styled with. Great in theory, thorny to pull off. Ditto the ballet plimsolls, which looked too lithe for the cobblestones in the courtyard below.

Mr. Rider is making something fresh at Celine. It can’t be lumped in with the masses of vintage-ripping collections I’ve seen in Paris this week. It’s winky but wearable. Or in Mr. Rider’s words from the press notes: “Classics with bite.”

My one quibble: It would have been nice to see that field jacket swish by in motion or understand how loose those dress pants were on a person. Perhaps next time he’ll stage a runway show.

The distribution expands the algorithm’s accessibility to AWS users, providing a direct software-to-hardware pathway for industrial chemistry applications. HI-VQE is designed to execute on multiple quantum modalities available through Braket, including trapped-ion, superconducting, and neutral-atom processors from IonQ, IQM, QuEra, AQT, and Rigetti.

The HI-VQE algorithm utilizes a hybrid quantum-classical architecture specifically optimized for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Unlike traditional VQE methods that rely on extensive Pauli word measurements—which often introduce significant overhead—Qunova’s “Handover” iteration reduces resource demands by simplifying the quantum-to-classical data transfer. This mechanism allows for molecular modeling and material reaction simulations to achieve “chemical accuracy” with fewer quantum resources, reportedly improving computational efficiency by several orders of magnitude compared to standard variational solvers.

The algorithm is strictly hardware-agnostic and has been validated on various quantum systems with scales reaching up to 56 qubits. By offering the tool via a cloud-native marketplace, Qunova aims to remove integration barriers for enterprises in the pharmaceutical, petrochemical, and materials science sectors. The platform supports multiple commercial models, including pay-as-you-go, annual subscriptions, and custom short-term project plans, intended to fit standard industrial R&D workflows.

The AWS launch follows the algorithm’s 2025 debut on the IBM Qiskit Functions catalog, marking a second major cloud distribution milestone. Qunova has also introduced a secondary optimization algorithm capable of handling up to 100,000 combinatorial variables on current NISQ hardware. These developments are precursors to a planned demonstration of “Industrial Quantum Advantage” scheduled for February 2026, which intends to show quantum-enhanced precision for computational chemistry tasks that are currently intractable for classical-only high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

The Maia 200 comes as major cloud computing firms such as Microsoft, Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services - some of Nvidia's biggest customers - are producing their own chips that increasingly compete with Nvidia.

Google, in particular, has garnered interest from major Nvidia customers such as Meta Platforms, which is working closely with Google to close one of the biggest software gaps between Google and Nvidia's AI chip offerings.

For its part, Microsoft said that along with the new Maia chip, it will be offering a package of software tools to program it. That includes Triton, an open-source software tool with major contributions from ChatGPT creator OpenAI that takes on the same tasks as Cuda, the Nvidia software that many Wall Street analysts say is Nvidia's biggest competitive advantage.

But Microsoft has also taken a page from the playbook of some of Nvidia's rising competitors by packing the Maia 200 chip with a significant amount of what is known as SRAM, a type of memory that can provide speed advantages for chatbots and other AI systems when they field requests from a large number of users.

Cerebras Systems, which recently inked a $10 billion deal with OpenAI to supply computing power, leans heavily on that technology, as does Groq, the startup that Nvidia licensed technology from in a reported $20 billion deal.

Should Medtronic’s (MDT) Pulsed Field Ablation Milestones Reshape Its Cardiac Rhythm Management Strategy?

January 26, 2026

In recent weeks, Medtronic reported multiple milestones for its Affera Sphere-360 pulsed field ablation catheter, including CE Mark approval in Europe and completion of first procedures in the U.S. Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial for treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

This progress highlights Medtronic’s push to integrate an all-in-one mapping and rotation-free ablation approach, potentially improving procedure efficiency and reinforcing its position in cardiac rhythm management.

We’ll now examine how this advancement in pulsed field ablation technology shapes Medtronic’s broader investment narrative and future growth priorities.

What Is Medtronic's Investment Narrative?

For Medtronic, you really have to buy into a story of steady, innovation-led growth backed by dependable cash returns. The company is already executing on mid single-digit revenue expansion and earnings growth in the high single digits, while funding a rising dividend and ongoing buybacks. The latest Affera Sphere-360 pulsed field ablation milestones fit neatly into that narrative as a potential medium-term growth driver in cardiac rhythm management, but probably do not change the near-term earnings catalysts that investors are watching, such as upcoming results and margin progress in diabetes and cardiovascular. More incrementally important, the MiniMed Go clearance and the Anteris and Precision Neuroscience deals underscore Medtronic’s push into higher-tech adjacencies, which can support its competitive position but also add integration, execution and capital allocation risk at a time when debt levels are already elevated.

However, one risk in particular could matter more than many shareholders might expect. Medtronic's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Ten Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates for Medtronic span roughly US$95 to just over US$110, underscoring how differently investors view the stock. Layer that dispersion over the company’s expanding pipeline in cardiac, diabetes and neurosurgery, and you get very different expectations for how much execution risk is acceptable.

- why the stock might be worth 6% less than the current price!

This commitment is embodied daily by its Corporate Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting equal opportunities and forstering a more inclusive and equitable society.

Why is education central to our mission?

Education is one of the main drivers of equal opportunity. It broadens horizons, enabling everyone to envisage their future and find their place, regardless of their background or personal journey. This is why the Societe Generale Corporate Foundation dedicates more than 50% of its budget to education.

Nearly 70 projects are supported in France and internationally each year. These projects support young people in vulnerable situations by helping them to acquire fundamental skills and financial literacy, and by providing them with opportunities to participate in sports, arts and music. These activities promote education and inclusion, as well as facilitating professional integration into careers related to ecological or digital transitions.

Underpinning all these activities is a shared ambition: to help every young person believe in their potential and build their future.

Fundamental skills: an essential foundation

Mastering the foundamental skills of reading, writing and arithmetic is essential for individual empowerment and social progress. This is why the Foundation supports initiatives led by associations such as 1001 Mots and Coup de Pouce that focus on prevention.

These foundational skills are not just academic; they are also vital for lifelong learning, developing autonomy and critical thinking, and adapting to a constantly changing environment.

In this spirit, Lumières sur l’info, a Foundation partner, offers media literacy workshops and carries out initiatives to combat misinformation and fake news.

Financial education: a pathway to autonomy

Knowing how to manage a budget, understand a contract, and evaluate the consequences of financial decisions is essential for gaining autonomy. However, not all young people have access to this kind of education. Societe Generale supports educational workshops and practical tools alongside associations such as Crésus, designed to help young people better understand daily financial issues and make informed choices.

Music and culture: disciplines of confidence and self-expression

Classical music and modern and contemporary art have long been central to Societe Generale’s cultural commitment. Since 1987, the Group has recognised the educational value of music, believing in its ability to foster skills that extend far beyond artistic practice. For many young people, access to culture and artistic activities can be a powerful driver of empowerment and is sometimes decisive in shaping their personal and professional journeys.

The Foundation supports several initiatives, including the Maîtrise Populaire de l’Opéra-Comique, the DEMOS orchestra led by the Philharmonie de Paris, the Classes Culture at the Musée d’Orsay and the Orchestre à l’École programme. These initiatives offer young people sustained access to challenging musical and cultural opportunities, fostering strong links with local communities and educational institutions.

Sport, a powerful educational and inclusive tool

Through practice and teamwork, it teaches valuable life lessons such as respect for rules, commitment, cooperation, and perseverance. The Societe Generale Foundation supports educational and social inclusion projects through sport, particularly those aimed at young people who are not on traditional pathways. These initiatives provide a structured environment, boost confidence, and open up new opportunities.",https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/image/2026-01/visuelsport-musique-1200x630.png.jpg?itok=y_EwG4XZ,N,,2026-01-26 15:10:04.678748

Key Facts

Key Background

Nvidia has been a major backer of CoreWeave, previously agreeing to buy over $6 billion in services from them, according to a September filing. CoreWeave, which went public in March after raising billions in debt and equity, has rapidly expanded its AI infrastructure, striking deals to supply more than $14 billion in AI cloud capacity to Meta and expanding its agreement with OpenAI to as much as $22.4 billion.

“Fortitude is at the forefront of a new era in therapeutic innovation,” said Chen, who serves as the biotech’s CEO.","What do you get when you insert a molecular glue degrader into an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)? Fortitude Biomedicines is in the process of finding out.

The Waltham, Massachusetts-based biotech is launching with $13 million in seed funds, which are earmarked for the company’s lead preclinical immune cell targeting biologic program. Cash will also be used for GLUE-DAC, a drug discovery engine designed to attach molecular glue degraders as the payload in ADCs.

K2 Bio Partners and Shanghai Healthcare Angel Capital co-led the seed financing, while Elikon Venture, Everjoy Fortune and Taihill Venture also joined.

GLUE-DAC’s origins can be traced back to the Baylor College of Medicine lab of Jin Wang, Ph.D., where he directs the center for next-gen therapeutics. The concept is to “integrate the precision targeting of ADCs with the catalytic power of targeted protein degradation,” Fortitude explained in a Jan. 26 release.

Wang founded Fortitude alongside fellow Baylor Professor Michael DeBakey, M.D., and entrepreneur Jesse Chen, Ph.D., who has previously co-founded both Triana Biomedicines and Avilar Therapeutics.

“Fortitude is at the forefront of a new era in therapeutic innovation,” said Chen, who serves as the biotech’s CEO. “With proprietary antibody-based technology, we are unlocking the ability to precisely target diseases while engaging the body’s own biology in powerful, transformative ways.”

While ADCs like Enhertu are now a key part of the cancer treatment portfolio—and new options continue to attract Big Pharma buyers—the emergence of drug resistance has limited the efficacy of this modality.

Fortitude’s hope is that GLUE-DAC can meet this challenge by combining the validated delivery capabilities of antibodies with what Wang described as the “transformative potential of targeted protein degradation.”

“GLUE-DAC has the potential to expand the therapeutic window of ADCs, overcome resistance mechanisms and unlock new therapeutic targets,” the company explained in this morning’s release.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-1473569087.jpg?VersionId=crtpsH0hlqBvWi6w3vQ5BICujFJwGCrS,N,,2026-01-26 14:02:17.709721

The Successful Year 2025 CEZ Group also performed well with other international rating agencies last year.
CEZ Group opened its first credit line tied to ESG rating in the summer of 2023, and currently has the opportunity to draw up to CZK 30 billion from six banks under ESG loans.","CEZ Group continues to gradually improve its ESG rating, i.e. the assessment of non-financial criteria related to the environment, social activities and transparent corporate governance. In recent years, investors, banks and insurance companies have been focusing on these types of parameters because they are an important indicator of whether a company’s business is sustainable in the long term. A better ESG score therefore opens the door to, for example, more favourable financing terms or insurance policies.

CEZ Group’s most recent rating success was achieved with the international non-profit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), which evaluates more than 22,000 companies from 130 countries and whose data is crucial for hundreds of global investors. In the area of combating climate change, CEZ Group jumped three places, from a C to an A- in 2025.

“Producing clean and affordable energy better for the environment and better for people is one of the pillars of our strategy. I’m very happy that renowned foreign organisations appreciate our steps. With an A- score, we can proudly compare ourselves to the best-rated European energy companies,” said Michaela Chaloupková, Member of the Board of Directors and Chief Sustainability Officer at CEZ.

The improvement in the “climate grade” was mainly due to information from the 2024 Sustainability Report, prepared in accordance with the new European standards, and the detailed mapping and description of risks and opportunities in relation to the Clean Energy for Tomorrow strategy. CDP also appreciated the more detailed reporting of indirect emissions from energy consumption.

Last year, CDP also evaluated CEZ in terms of efficient and sustainable management of water resources—in this area, the company received a B score, which is also an improvement up from its last rating of C. The last area evaluated was forest care and protection, where the rating remained unchanged at a C. CEZ meets all the legal requirements in this category, but focuses primarily on the aforementioned areas of climate protection and water management.

The Successful Year 2025

CEZ Group also performed well with other international rating agencies last year. For example, S&P Global, which rates approximately 4,600 global companies, recognised an improvement of 9 points to 62 out of 100.CEZ also maintained its high AA rating with MSCI and saw a slight improvement with Morningstar Sustainalytics last year. According to CSRHub, which evaluates more than 43,000 companies by aggregating ratings from dozens of agencies and organisations into a single parameter, CEZ currently ranks among the top 6% of the best-rated companies in the world (value published in December 2025).

ESG ratings from international rating agencies and clear plans for decarbonisation are important, for example, for banks. CEZ Group opened its first credit line tied to ESG rating in the summer of 2023, and currently has the opportunity to draw up to CZK 30 billion from six banks under ESG loans. Since 2022, CEZ has also implemented a total of four sustainability-linked bond issues (specifically, a GHG emissions intensity target in 2025 or 2030) with a total value of EUR 2.9 billion.",https://www.cez.cz/webpublic/file/edee/2026/01/fve_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 14:02:33.584008

What is brelovitug?
A potential biologics license application submission and launch are expected in 2027 and are dependent on trial outcomes.1 “This program fits squarely within our core strengths in rare disease and builds on our deep expertise in rare liver conditions.
We believe Mirum’s global development and commercial synergies position us well to deliver for patients living with HDV,” Peetz said.
What are the financial details of the acquisition?","Mirum Pharmaceuticals announced the completion of its acquisition of Bluejay Therapeutics, adding a late-stage liver disease program to its pipeline and positioning the company for potential entry into the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a rare and severe condition with no approved therapies in the United States.1

HDV is a coinfection occurring in select people infected with the hepatitis B virus and is the most severe form of viral hepatitis due to its potential for rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver-related death.1 The disease affects an estimated 230,000 people in both the United States and Europe, with estimates suggesting that more than 50% of individuals with HDV will die of liver-related causes within 10 years of diagnosis.1

The transaction brings Mirum the worldwide rights to brelovitug, a monoclonal antibody currently in Phase III development, reflecting Mirum’s strategy to expand within rare liver diseases through assets approaching potential registration.1

Brelovitug is currently undergoing evaluations for the treatment of HDV, and with no approved treatments for HDV in the United States and most countries worldwide, it marks the indication as an area of significant unmet medical need.

“With the acquisition now complete, our focus shifts to execution –adding the talented Bluejay team to Mirum as we complete the AZURE Phase 3 program for HDV and prepare for potential registrations and launches,” said Chris Peetz, chief executive officer of Mirum.

What is brelovitug?

Brelovitug received both Breakthrough Therapy designation from FDA and PRIME designation from the European Medicines Agency, signifying regulatory recognition of its potential based on earlier clinical data.1

Brelovitug is currently undergoing study in the global AZURE Phase III registrational program which is expecting topline data in the second half of 2026.1 The AZURE program consists of multiple open-label studies designed to evaluate a combined virologic and biochemical response, with the primary goal of supporting regulatory submissions in the United States and Europe.

In Phase II studies, brelovitug demonstrated strong antiviral activity in HDV, including a complete HDV RNA response, improvements in liver enzyme levels, and a safety profile characterized primarily by injection-site erythema.1 While Phase III data is expected to determine the drug’s ability to get approved, its existing dataset has continued to support its advancement into registrational studies.

A potential biologics license application submission and launch are expected in 2027 and are dependent on trial outcomes.1

“This program fits squarely within our core strengths in rare disease and builds on our deep expertise in rare liver conditions. We believe Mirum’s global development and commercial synergies position us well to deliver for patients living with HDV,” Peetz said.

What are the financial details of the acquisition?

Per the terms of the acquisition agreement, Mirum is set to acquire all outstanding shares of Bluejay Therapeutics through a combination of cash and Mirum common stock, with the potential for additional tiered sales-based milestone payments.1

In accordance with the acquisition, Mirum has also completed its previously announced private placement financings across both existing and new healthcare investors, generating upwards of $268.5 million in gross proceeds.1 The capital is expected to help support ongoing clinical development and future commercial activities related to brelovitug.

AI works the same way. If you treat it as the driver, it can feel intimidating. If you treat it as the vehicle, it becomes empowering. My role at Monks is to help steer AI with purpose and combine it with HI – human intelligence, so our solutions for brands feel clearer, warmer and more human.”",https://www.brandinginasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mihir-Dhairyawan-.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:07:02.970121

Why it matters: Health care AI has the potential to help improve patient outcomes and lower the risk of physician burnout.
What they're saying: Trust in health care AI is particularly low, said Vanessa Parli, managing director of programs and external engagement at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI).
""Trust is a narrative problem first, and a technology problem second,"" added Hugh Taggart, CEO of Weber Shandwick's EMEA region.

Why it matters: Health care AI has the potential to help improve patient outcomes and lower the risk of physician burnout.

Axios' Courtenay Brown moderated the Expert Voices conversation, which was sponsored by Philips.

What they're saying: Trust in health care AI is particularly low, said Vanessa Parli, managing director of programs and external engagement at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI).

Using the word ""productivity"" about AI can be a deterrent to providers because it may imply less time seeing patients, according to Eric Cioè Peña, Northwell Health vice president and the founding director of its Center for Global Health.

""Trust is a narrative problem first, and a technology problem second,"" added Hugh Taggart, CEO of Weber Shandwick's EMEA region.

By the numbers: A survey from Philips found a gap between providers (63%) and patients (48%) when it came to optimism about AI improving patient outcomes.

Yes, but: Keeping humans in the loop has been key to successful implementation strategies at Mayo Clinic, said Matthew Callstrom, physician lead of AI and strategy at Mayo Clinic.

""When you start to explain to patients how we're using AI, they're like, put me in,"" Callstrom said.

This has helped on the provider side as well, he said. For instance, a volunteer innovation team at Mayo built and tested an AI-driven handoff tool for the transition between nurse shifts. It has since been adopted by 75% of the nurses, generating hundreds of thousands of summaries.

What's next: The industry should ""think about it in terms of what we know, from research, drives trust: accountability [and] transparency,"" American Psychological Association CEO Arthur Evans said.

Anthropic's Claude for Healthcare is ""building connectors to key data sources that we know are trusted, like the CMS coverage database or the National Provider identification registry,"" said Elizabeth Kelly, head of beneficial deployments.

""The systems should be very forthcoming with what they will not do,"" Peloton CTO Francis Shanahan said.

""You need to design [the technology] in a way so that the consumer understands what the implications of the technology are,"" Parli added.

Nvidia will invest $2 billion more in CoreWeave, which could further stoke concerns about circular financing in the AI ecosystem

CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said the expanded partnership with Nvidia reflects strong demand.

Shares of CoreWeave were climbing in Monday's premarket trading after Nvidia raised its bet on the cloud provider.

The companies are expanding their partnership to more quickly build out artificial-intelligence data centers. Additionally, Nvidia (NVDA) is investing $2 billion in CoreWeave's (CRWV) common stock at $87.20 per share.

The cloud-infrastructure provider aims to build more than 5 gigawatts' worth of AI data centers by the end of the decade. The data centers, which will be operated by CoreWeave, will run future generations of Nvidia's AI systems, including its upcoming Rubin AI chip platform and Vera central processing units. The data centers will also use the chip maker's Bluefield storage systems.

""This expanded collaboration underscores the strength of demand we are seeing across our customer base and the broader market signals as AI systems move into large-scale production,"" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said in a statement.

Nvidia was already a major CoreWeave investor, owning about 6.6% of the company's shares outstanding as of the end of September, according to FactSet data.

The latest investment underscores a polarizing aspect of the AI trade. While Nvidia's move could be interpreted as a sign of confidence that the AI era is only just getting started, critics have deemed past moves as examples of ""circular financing,"" taking issue with how Nvidia has become so intertwined with some of its partners.

CoreWeave's stock is up more than 8% in premarket trades on Monday, while Nvidia's stock is down fractionally.

But as mainframes move deeper into these hybrid environments, developers cannot just rely on mainframe expertise alone. Integrating AI — especially agentic AI — in mainframe environments before your people and processes are prepared can create or worsen existing problems. A recent report found that even as companies invest in technology and skills to prepare mainframe developers for the future, 35% of those already working with AI on the mainframe say existing skills gaps are hindering progress, underscoring the need for a more multiskilled approach.

Developers need to be on top of the latest rules around AI deployment, build on their existing skills and technical fluency, and develop the confidence to experiment safely as new technologies enter the enterprise landscape.

Like learning to drive, deploying AI on the mainframe requires more than just knowing the mechanics. It takes confidence, real-world practice and trust in the system.

Learning the rules of the road

Enterprise security teams are increasingly concerned about AI-driven threats, which Gartner identifies as the fastest-growing category of attacks. However, governance and compliance efforts have not kept up with the rapid pace of AI development. Limited understanding, low prioritization and gaps in technical oversight are creating significant risks, especially since AI systems depend on sensitive data and continually evolving code. As with any transformative technology, the rules and regulations around AI are evolving, and developers must stay current, especially in regulated environments.

By gaining a better understanding and awareness of the latest information, developers will be able to monitor the mainframe using the latest organizational guardrails designed to protect systems and vulnerable data. Effective guardrails and governance frameworks ensure employees use AI responsibly, helping organizations avoid regulatory breaches, legal exposure, security risks and the financial or reputational damage that can result.

As experienced professionals retire and misconceptions around “legacy” systems persist, organizations face a growing skills gap. Investing in mainframe education isn’t just a technical necessity; it’s a strategic move to safeguard key business applications and infrastructure, ensure continuity and maintain competitiveness in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Security as the seatbelt for AI

As with any major technology shift, security must be a cornerstone of agentic AI adoption. These systems need robust safeguards to ensure safe and reliable operations. One critical measure is role-based access control, which limits agent permissions based on their specific functions, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions. This is reinforced by secure credential storage, encryption and multi-factor authentication to protect both system integrity and user authorization.

Equally important are controls governing how agents interact with data and execute tasks. Techniques such as input validation, output monitoring and behavioral constraints help prevent misuse of language model components, while human oversight for high-impact actions adds an extra layer of protection. Prompt engineering is equally critical, as poorly structured prompts can lead to unpredictable or unsafe actions by AI agents. By applying disciplined prompt design alongside input validation, organizations can ensure that AI-driven processes remain accurate, secure and aligned with business objectives. This ensures that sensitive or disruptive operations are carefully reviewed before execution.

Finally, continuous monitoring, observability and auditing provide transparency and accountability across the lifecycle of agentic systems. These practices strengthen trust and integrity, enabling organizations to deploy AI confidently while maintaining compliance and control.

Driving readiness through core skill integration

To succeed in the AI era, developers need a blend of core and future-ready skills grounded by foundational training. When used responsibly and thoughtfully, AI tools can be used for closing that gap and fast-tracking modernization efforts — provided they are deployed intentionally.

Mainframe fluency anchors AI deployments in deep system knowledge. AI literacy and agentic AI fluency enable developers to build, train and manage AI agents that align with business logic and enterprise goals.

The challenge isn’t a lack of educational resources — there’s an abundance of training available. The real barrier is perception: mainframe skills are often seen as outdated or ‘untrendy.’ Yet these skills remain highly valuable. In fact, specialized expertise in areas like COBOL often commands higher salaries than more common languages such as Java because qualified professionals are in short supply.

A study by the Futurum Group revealed that while educational institutions are producing more mainframe-trained graduates, 61% of the respondents still report a significant skills gap between what’s taught and what’s needed in practice. Showing the need for continued skill integration, and not just foundational training.

Confidence behind the wheel

In the same way drivers can know the rules of the road, without confidence out on the road, they are just as much at risk. The same goes for developers dealing with deploying a new technology like AI.

Mentorship, simulation tools and community learning can all help close the confidence gap, by giving mainframe developers safe-play zones where they can explore AI deployments without fear of impacting production.

Organizations can be critical enablers by creating the infrastructure and culture that support experimentation and skill growth. Building confidence is just as vital as building a strong skillset; both are necessary to move beyond cautious pilots to confident production-scale deployments.

Driving isn’t just about moving forward, it’s about being prepared for the unexpected, knowing when to accelerate and trusting your tools.

The rise of AI isn’t just about automating tasks, it’s about empowering people to engage with systems they once found intimidating. For many, mainframe modernization has been slowed not by lack of vision but by a lack of confidence, uncertainty around where to start, what might break or how to fill gaps left by retiring experts. But when AI agents become part of daily workflows, that fear starts to fade. Developers begin to trust their footing. And teams start making decisions with clarity instead of caution.",https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4121590-0-87822200-1769428943-shutterstock_2671163531.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2026-01-26 11:06:11.286735

Steve Wylie, vice president and general manager, Northeast, for Cisco partner Trace3, is “excited” for the launch of Cisco 360.
Cisco first unveiled the new program in October 2024, 15 months ahead of Cisco 360 going into effect.
In its place will be two new designations: Cisco Portfolio Partner and Cisco Preferred Partner.
Additionally, Cisco Preferred partners will be eligible to earn two new specializations, Secure AI Infrastructure and Secure Networking, beginning next month, according to Cisco.","‘All along, [Cisco] stated their approach was to provide better capabilities to the customers and reward the partners that are investing in helping companies be successful with Cisco’s technology.

Cisco 360, the overhaul of the networking giant’s nearly 25-year-old partner program, officially went live Sunday.

The objective of the new program, stacked with new resources, tools, and partner designations, is to help customers reach transformative AI outcomes faster through their trusted channel partners, Cisco said in a release issued Monday morning.

Steve Wylie, vice president and general manager, Northeast, for Cisco partner Trace3, is “excited” for the launch of Cisco 360. That’s because a positive byproduct of the new program is that it has required partners to uplevel their skills and training, a very important factor for partners in the age of AI and managed services.

“All along, [Cisco] stated their approach was to provide better capabilities to the customers and reward the partners that are investing in helping companies be successful with Cisco’s technology,” Wylie said. “The world that Cisco plays in is massively more competitive today than it’s ever been [and] the last thing they probably need is people out there selling Cisco that don’t have the core understanding of the in-depth capabilities and are just trying to push quotes. Pushing quotes doesn’t sell the AI factory-type things, it sells the things they’ve always sold, but Cisco is trying to get to a different place [and] to embrace new technology.”

Trace3 is going into the launch feeling prepared. The firm has dedicated resources in place for renewals, Cisco Black Belt trainings, and even a person on staff that was tasked with deeply understanding the requirements of the new program to ensure that Trace3 would be coming into Cisco 360 with the right skills. Trace3 is a Preferred Partner in each of the five core architectures that Cisco identified as part of the new program: Security, Networking, Cloud and AI, Collaboration, Services and Splunk/Observability.

“By requiring us to go through the process [or] discipline areas, it’s an opportunity to go and say: ‘OK, where are your gaps? Where can you go and improve? And also, where can you go and push your teams to train more?’” Wylie said.

Cisco first unveiled the new program in October 2024, 15 months ahead of Cisco 360 going into effect. Cisco’s early communications about 360 was beneficial for both Cisco and its partner community, said Wylie (pictured above).

“The runway was long. If you’re not prepared for it, you just haven’t put the time in,” he said. “I’m excited about it because with what we’re trying to do, the more knowledge our teams have the better. And I think this was a catalyst that pushed us towards that.”

Cisco 360 Details

Cisco 360 is simplifying the previously complex program structure via two new features: the Partner Value Index (PVI) to measure partners and the Cisco Partner Incentive (CPI), which will reward the investments that partners are making in Cisco’s broad portfolio, according to the company. Partners will receive a PVI measurement or score in each of the five core architectures.

The new Cisco Partner Locator tool will let customers search across the Cisco portfolios, such as security, networking, or Splunk, to identify the right partner, according to Cisco.

“With our partners, we’ve strengthened what is already a world-class ecosystem to deliver even greater value and help our mutual customers connect, protect and thrive,” Tim Coogan, Cisco’s senior vice president of global partner sales, said in a statement.

Also to be added soon to the PVI will be dedicated indexes for Developers/Advisors, Distributors, and Mass Scale Infrastructure, a portfolio that focuses on very large data center buildouts and service provider business, Cisco said.

The program will eliminate separate partner programs and incentives such as VIP—the company’s flagship rebate incentive program—Perform Plus and the Cisco Services Partner Program, or CSPP. These will be folded into a single structure, the CPI, which will measure partners across four areas: foundational, capabilities, performance, and engagement.

Another significant part of the new program is that Cisco is removing its illustrious Cisco Gold partner designation. In its place will be two new designations: Cisco Portfolio Partner and Cisco Preferred Partner. Cisco partners will be able to earn these designations for each technology portfolio. Additionally, Cisco Preferred partners will be eligible to earn two new specializations, Secure AI Infrastructure and Secure Networking, beginning next month, according to Cisco.

Cisco’s support for partners ahead of the launch has included frequent webinars and custom marketing programs. For Long View Systems, a Calgary, Alberta-based MSP and Cisco partner, work behind the scenes to ready the firm for the launch of the new program has included a focus on Black Belt trainings and PVI reviews to determine where the company will land within the new measurements.

Long View, a former Gold partner within Cisco’s former program, has achieved “Preferred” partner status in each of the five core architectures in Canada. While the firm is overall optimistic about Cisco 360 and its roadmap, Lane Irvine, network business solutions director for Long View, said the new program is currently lacking a way to recognize multi-architecture Preferred Partners.

“There isn’t a branding that helps customers see that you’ve got five Preferred [designations], something that highlights it as a different level of support than an individual Preferred Partner,” he said. “[A partner] who’s got Preferred in security, or Preferred in networking, is different than a partner that has Preferred in all five.”

He stressed that marketing activities will be important to educate customers on the new Preferred vs. the former Gold designation.

“Part of this is marketing it to our customers as well. What does this mean to them and helping them understand why it’s important for them,” Irvine said.

The focus has so far been on PVI, partners need Cisco to now switch gears and focus on CPI, or the incentive side, Irvine said.

“We generally understand PVI, but there’s a lot of information and data that’s got to come to out now to get this really dialed in … because of course the incentives, that’s a critical part of our profitability,” he said.

The good news is that the new program’s incentives and rebates so far “look pretty similar” to what Cisco’s VIP program previously offered, partners told CRN.

Now live, the CPI will simplify past program elements while offering partners clearer, more predictable earnings across Cisco’s portfolio. The CPI structure will help partners plan for growth by aligning forecasts and strategies with Cisco’s roadmap, according to the San Jose, Calif.-based company.",https://www.crn.com/news/networking/2026/media_1ade25d1dc0085cbacfca1b2bf0b0a697e2fa21a0.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-26 11:06:06.667607

On Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn.
“Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said.
“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.
The $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn.","A British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.

Synthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.

On Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.

Synthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.

The company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.

The startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.

Synthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”

Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.

“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.

Synthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.

The $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.

The company, based in Danvers, Massachusetts, said the additions come as DemandScience grows its customer base and broadens its product suite aimed at helping B2B marketers navigate what it describes as “phantom signals,” fragmented tools, and one-size-fits-all content that can undermine campaign performance.

Wright joins DemandScience with more than a decade of experience building cloud and data platform products. Most recently, she served as vice president of product management at EDB, where she helped scale enterprise cloud offerings during a period of growth and transformation. Earlier, she held multiple product leadership roles at IBM, including work on Db2 Warehouse on Cloud and IBM Cloud Databases.

The global downstream processing market is poised for significant growth, increasing from USD 40.78 billion in 2025 to USD 84.25 billion by 2031, with a CAGR of 12.88% from 2026 to 2031. This growth is fueled by capacity expansions worth over USD 50 billion in 2024-2025, driven by major players like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The surge in demand for biologics has intensified competition for skilled labor and equipment.

Technologies such as single-use systems, continuous bioprocessing, and digital twins are reshaping the industry by reducing operating costs and shortening validation timelines, while suppliers work swiftly to introduce PFAS-compliant membranes in anticipation of new regulations. Outsourcing trends are also influencing pricing and technology adoption as CDMOs commit to multi-year slots for specialized modalities like viral vector and lipid nanoparticle production. Manufacturers are focusing on supply-chain resilience, adopting regional sourcing strategies, and dual-supplier frameworks for filters, bags, and resins.

Global Downstream Processing Market Trends and Insights

Rapid expansion in global biologics manufacturing capacity is evident, with Samsung Biologics completing its fifth plant in April 2025, boosting the global capacity to 784,000 L. This growth accelerates demand for large-scale chromatography systems and single-use bioreactors. Newly constructed lines favor continuous modalities, reducing buffer consumption by up to 40% and minimizing water-for-injection needs. Regional governments view biomanufacturing as a strategic growth sector, as seen in Saudi Arabia's plan to contribute USD 34.6 billion to non-oil GDP by 2040. An oversupply in capacity among some CDMOs has temporarily reduced utilization below 50%, but the flexibility provided by intensified downstream skids allows for quick rescheduling without compromising quality. Vendors are bundling columns, resins, and analytical sensors to offer integrated platforms capable of switching between monoclonal and viral-vector products within hours.

Rising R&D Spending Among Big Pharma & Emerging Biotech

Large companies are increasing R&D budgets, while smaller firms face capital constraints. Eli Lilly allocated USD 4.5 billion to the Lilly Medicine Foundry to speed up clinical supply, resulting in increased demand for modular chromatography and tangential flow filtration systems. Venture-backed startups are focusing on cell and gene therapy pipelines, which require unique clarification and nuclease removal steps, contrasting significantly with traditional antibody workflows. This shift leads to diverse demand that benefits suppliers offering configurable skids and disposable flow paths. Continuous multicolumn chromatography is increasingly adopted, mitigating resin cost spikes with reduced bed volumes per kilogram of product.

High Capital Cost of Large-Scale Chromatography Skids and Resins

Protein A resin remains costly, consuming as much as 60% of downstream capital budgets. While Purolite's USD 200 million investment in a Pennsylvania plant aims to stabilize supply and prices, smaller firms remain challenged by costs. Intensified multicolumn operations cut resin usage by 50% and boost output per square foot, albeit with increased automation complexity. A bifurcation in the market is forming, where large pharma pays premiums for capture resins, while cost-sensitive companies seek mixed-mode or continuous alternatives.

Additional market drivers and restraints detailed in the report include:

The CMO/CDMO outsourcing surge and multi-year capacity agreements

mRNA and viral-vector vaccine platform scale-ups post-COVID

The purification bottleneck compared to upstream titers

Segment Analysis

The downstream processing market report segments include Technique (Purification Techniques, Solid-Liquid Separation, and others), Product (Chromatography Columns and Resins, among others), Application (Antibodies Production, Vaccines Production, etc.), End User (Biopharmaceutical & Bio-Similar Manufacturers, etc.), and Geography (North America, Europe, etc.). Market forecasts are presented in USD terms.

Purification techniques accounted for 32.05% of downstream processing market revenue in 2025, emphasizing their importance to biologics quality. Cell disruption is the fastest growing segment with a 14.88% CAGR, driven by the adoption of microbial and intracellular expression systems. The downstream market for purification is set to surpass USD 14.75 billion in 2026, potentially reaching USD 27 billion by 2031, supported by resin capacity expansions and innovations like multicolumn chromatography. Meanwhile, low-frequency acoustic methods gain traction in pilot-scale cell disruption trials due to reduced heat generation. Continuous chromatography's role in minimizing buffer usage supports sustainability goals that increasingly influence European procurement. Innovations such as single-use centrifuges and depth-filtration cassettes enhance throughput while reducing contamination risk in CDMO operations, contributing to improved facility productivity.

Chromatography columns and resins had a 35.10% revenue share in 2025, remaining the standard for antibody capture. However, filtration and membrane devices show the highest CAGR of 14.12%, driven by advancements in PFAS-free polymers, prompting replacement cycles. The market for filtration products achieved a size of USD 12.2 billion in 2026 and is expected to reach USD 23.6 billion by 2031. Multi-layer depth filters streamline processes by combining clarification and fine filtration, improving facility efficiency. Adaptive control valves and gamma-stable flow paths facilitate modular skids' reconfiguration, appealing to CMOs managing diverse client molecules. Chromatography suppliers are responding with high-throughput resin screening kits that cut development time by 30%. Despite debates over disposability costs, the adoption of single-use hardware continues to rise due to the reduced validation demands it offers.

Geographic Analysis

North America secured 32.50% of the revenue share in 2025, driven by substantial investments like Johnson & Johnson's USD 2 billion project in North Carolina. Continuous manufacturing processes were implemented in 75% of new lines, with plans for AI integration within three years. The downstream processing market benefits from the FDA's supportive stance on innovative manufacturing, boosting investor confidence in advanced purification platforms.

Asia-Pacific is the fastest growing region at a 14.35% CAGR, aided by large facilities in South Korea, China, Singapore, and India. With Samsung Biologics adding 180,000 L of capacity and Novartis expanding its Singapore site, a trend toward mega-facilities supporting global supply is manifesting. In response to the US Biosecure Act, Indian CDMOs are positioning themselves as alternatives. Regional governments are investing in workforce training to address process-engineering talent gaps and encourage local sourcing of essential supplies like filters and bags.

How Investors Are Reacting To CRH (CRH) Buybacks Amid Institutional Moves And US Infrastructure Push

January 26, 2026

In recent weeks, CRH plc has continued its US$300 million share buyback programme on the New York Stock Exchange, while the State of Alaska’s Department of Revenue disclosed an US$8.30 million new position in the company alongside other institutional portfolio adjustments.

At the same time, CRH Americas’ leadership has publicly pressed Congress to modernize US infrastructure, linking long-term economic activity to renewed investment in roads and bridges.

Against this backdrop of active buybacks, we’ll examine how CRH’s capital return focus shapes the company’s investment narrative for investors.

What Is CRH's Investment Narrative?

To own CRH, you need to be comfortable with a large, acquisitive building materials group whose fortunes are closely tied to construction cycles, public infrastructure spending and disciplined capital allocation. The ongoing US$300 million buyback, layered on top of years of sizeable repurchases and a growing dividend, reinforces a story built around returning cash while managing a high debt load and a relatively new executive team. The latest buyback trades and the State of Alaska’s US$8.30 million position do not materially change the near term catalysts, which still center on execution against 2025 earnings guidance and the health of North American construction. However, CRH Americas’ public push for renewed US infrastructure funding highlights a key swing factor: how quickly Congress acts on transportation bills could influence demand visibility and investor confidence over the next few years.

However, CRH’s reliance on policy support and leverage is something investors should not ignore. CRH's share price has been on the slide but might be up to 9% below fair value. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five Simply Wall St Community members place CRH’s fair value between about US$56.66 and US$140.00, underscoring how far opinions can diverge. Set that against CRH’s heavy buyback activity and policy sensitive earnings profile, and you can see why understanding different scenarios for US infrastructure spending and balance sheet risk really matters.

Doctors’ takes on the Medtronic Sphere-360 catheter Dr. Tobias Reichlin, director of electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland, said: “The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes.
Now with Sphere-360, we have a new and differentiated single-shot PFA catheter with the potential to deliver the next phase of innovation.","Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) Medtronic plc $100.885 0.71% Open 100.229 Day High 102.041 52 Week High 87.67 52 Week Low 67.11 announced two new milestones for its Affera Sphere-360 catheter for pulsed field ablation (PFA) procedures.

First, the medtech giant received CE mark approval for the first-of-its-kind, all-in-one mapping and single-shot PFA catheter. It also completed the first cases for the paroxysmal AFib treatment system in the Horizon 360 U.S. FDA investigational device exemption (IDE) trial.

It marks further milestones for Medtronic as it competes in the hot PFA space against the likes of Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, Abbott and Kardium, all of whom have commercially available PFA systems.

“The achievement of CE Mark for Sphere-360, as well as the first cases in the U.S. IDE trial, mark two major achievements in our effort to deliver new and better treatments to AFib patients,” said Rebecca Seidel, president of the Cardiac Ablation Solutions business at Medtronic. “We’re committed to leading in PFA and bringing meaningful innovation at a regular cadence.”

Sphere-360, an investigational single-shot mapping and ablation catheter, uses pulsed field energy to treat patients with paroxysmal AFib. It integrates with the Affera mapping and ablation system. The Affera technology makes up a key component of Medtronic’s PulseSelect PFA system. It became the first such system FDA-cleared for treating AFib in 2024. Medtronic brought in these technologies through its $1 billion acquisition of Affera in August 2022.

Medtronic designed Sphere-360 with the goal of simplifying the AFib procedure while enhancing efficiency and providing high lesion durability. Sphere-360 features a large, tissue-conformable lattice tip for energy delivery. It requires no catheter rotation multiple times in one location as the entire lattice tip delivers PF energy. The company says it features the smallest sheath (8.5 Fr) in any single-shot PFA technology.

Other key features include the delivery of circumferential, consistent lesions and adaptation to the vein through the lattice tip. The all-in-one catheter can deliver navigation, mapping and ablation through a single transseptal puncture and zero catheter exchange. It provides easy access to pulmonary veins and enhanced stability with its over-the-wire design, too.

Medtronic supported its CE mark with data from its Sphere-360 European study, presented in April 2025. Findings demonstrated efficacy, safety and durability for the system.

The Horizon 360 IDE study, a prospective, single-arm clinical study across the U.S., will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.

Doctors’ takes on the Medtronic Sphere-360 catheter

Dr. Tobias Reichlin, director of electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland, said:

“The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes. Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter. With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it’s an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.”

Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of Cardiac Arrhythmia Services for the Mount Sinai Health System, New York, said:

“Advances in electrophysiology over the past several years are having a significant impact on care for arrhythmia patients, and Affera has been a key part of that impact. Now with Sphere-360, we have a new and differentiated single-shot PFA catheter with the potential to deliver the next phase of innovation. It’s an exciting time for physicians and patients and we’re not slowing down.”",https://wtwh-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/massdevice/2026/01/26062227/Medtronic-Affera-PFA-Sphere-360-catheter-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 09:01:12.454980

When do ​I get the AI drug?""","By Maggie Fick and Michael Erman

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence has yet to deliver on the ‌most ​challenging aspect of drug development -- finding new molecules that lead ‌to major medical advances -- but it is already streamlining less glamorous parts of the process, industry executives say.

AI is helping find participants and ​sites for clinical trials and drafting documents for regulators, shaving weeks off these labor-intensive processes, seven large drugmakers and six smaller biotech companies said at the recent JP Morgan Healthcare Conference.

It can take a decade and $2 ‍billion to bring a new drug to market, pharmaceutical ​companies say. Many, including Eli Lilly, which has partnered with leading chipmaker Nvidia, are betting AI can also improve the success rate of new drugs.

Drug companies have announced a slew of deals for tools to ​unleash the promise of ⁠AI, seen as the biggest technological upheaval since the internet, much as other industries are doing.

Agentic AI - or AI that is autonomous requiring little human intervention - could increase clinical development productivity by about 35% to 45% over the next five years, consultancy McKinsey predicted last year.

Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said it is utilizing AI in multiple ways so it can focus on the big picture goal of successfully bringing new drugs to market.

""Everything else that's around that needs to be as efficient and as small as possible,"" Teva CEO Richard Francis said. ""This is where I ‌think AI digitization, modernization, process improvement, all the unsexy stuff that we get actually quite excited about, makes a difference.""

THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS

Executives from global pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca, Roche and ​Pfizer, ‌as well as smaller biotechs like Spyre and ‍Nuvalent, described tracking thousands of pages of ⁠documents for regulators, including clinical, safety and manufacturing records.

The documents must be compiled, cross-checked and kept consistent across geographies, often requiring the costly use of outside contractors, AstraZeneca Chief Financial Officer Aradhana Sarin explained.

Jorge Conde, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, is investing in fixes to what he calls drug development's ""messy middle,"" including putting $4.3 million into startup Alleviate Health.

He described trial enrollment as a ""leaky funnel"" in which participants drop out along the way, and sees Alleviate using AI technology to help with patient outreach, education, screening and scheduling.

TD Cowen analyst Brendan Smith said the use of AI, including large language models like Microsoft Copilot, for administrative tasks has become fairly common in the pharmaceutical industry.

But it may take another one to three years before investors can measure how AI has begun speeding up drug development, he said. Quantifying savings ​is difficult, Smith said, as it depends on how and where the tools are deployed.

NOVARTIS USES AI FOR HEART DRUG

Swiss drugmaker Novartis turned to AI in 2023 when it was starting a 14,000-person, late-stage cardiovascular outcomes trial for its cholesterol drug Leqvio, Chief Medical Officer Shreeram Aradhye said.

The typical four- to six-week site selection process became a two-hour meeting, as AI helped identify higher-performing sites and allowed Novartis to close participant enrollment with only 13 patients above its trial target, Aradhye said.

""AI becomes augmenting intelligence, not artificial intelligence,"" he added.

A Novartis spokesperson said the time savings afforded by AI can add up to months over a drug-development program.

GSK, GENMAB, ITM PLAN FOR SAVINGS

British drugmaker GSK said it's using a mix of digital and AI tools to reduce manual data collection and aggregation and trial enrollment, and aims to speed up all clinical trials by 15% this way.

That helped save about 8 million pounds ($10.87 million) in costs for late-stage studies of asthma drug Exdensur last year, according to a GSK spokesperson. The drug won U.S. approval last month.

Danish antibody developer Genmab said it plans to deploy Anthropic's Claude chatbot-powered agentic AI to support clinical development priorities.

Hisham Hamadeh, Genmab's head of AI, said ​the goal is to automate post-trial work, including analysis of data and its transformation into graphs, tables, figures and clinical study reports.

German radiopharmaceuticals firm ITM told Reuters it has figured out how to use AI to convert long trial reports into U.S. FDA template formats, potentially saving weeks of effort requiring several staff, but has yet to deploy it.

Amgen research chief Jay Bradner said AI is delivering on multiple fronts in the drug development and regulatory document preparation process.

“What everybody's waiting for is the AI drug. When do ​I get the AI drug?"" he said. ""I actually think those molecules are in pipelines right now.""

The Trump-Carney détente is over

It wasn’t just large swaths of the country getting snowed in this weekend — the relationship between Ottawa and the White House also went back into deep freeze.

What happened: Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on “all Canadian goods and products” if “Canada makes a deal with China,” and later suggested he would stop a Chinese “takeover” of Canada. Trump also referred to Mark Carney as “governor” for the first time, hauling that old chestnut out of storage.

What constitutes a “deal” is not clear. Canada’s minister responsible for U.S. trade tried to cast the recent agreement with China as a “resolution” and denied that the government was pursuing a broader free trade pact.

For Trump, it’s a sharp reversal from his initial reaction that “it’s a good thing for [Carney] to sign a trade deal” with China.

Elsewhere: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blasted Carney over the China agreement, saying, “We can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.”

Bessent seemed to suggest that the tariffs would only apply if Canada struck a free trade deal with China, but — as is usually the case with this crew — his meaning was not totally clear.

Why it matters: Canada is back in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, and the escalation over the weekend is a preview of what’s to come as CUSMA comes up for renegotiation.

Our take: Unfortunately, the threat of ripping up CUSMA — which has so far kept most of our exports to the U.S. tariff-free — gives the Americans enormous leverage over Canada. Preserving that deal with a volatile administration in the White House while also expanding trade with other large economies, like China’s, will be a dangerous high-wire balancing act.—TS

LOOKOUT

What’s happening this week

Source: Shutterstock.

🏦 Interest rate decisions in Canada, U.S. Both the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the U.S. Federal Reserve are expected to hold interest rates steady on Wednesday. BoC Governor Tiff Macklem said last month that the BoC would hold rates at 2.25% so long as inflation continued to stabilize, and that’s more or less what has happened since. There is more pressure for the Fed to cut rates, both from the Trump administration and some FOMC members, but Jerome Powell hasn’t shown much appetite to indulge demands from those quarters.

🇨🇦 Conservative Party convention. Pierre Poilievre faces a leadership review at his party’s convention later this week, with around 4,000 delegates voting on whether he should stay on as leader. Poilievre only needs the support of a majority of delegates to keep the job, but a close vote would certainly weaken his position. That’s a possible outcome, but without any obvious successor waiting in the wings, it would be a surprise.

🇺🇸 U.S. government shutdown deadline. The U.S. federal government could partially shut down (again) if a spending package isn’t approved by Friday. Odds of a shutdown increased dramatically (now around 75% on prediction markets) after a man was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis over the weekend. Democrats responded by promising to block any bill that includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security without reforms to the agency.

BUSINESS

Little League has turned into big money

Source: mTaira / Shutterstock.

It turns out, parents will pay a lot of money to watch their nine-year-old's soccer game on TV.

Driving the news: Montreal-based live sports streamer LiveBarn has been acquired by U.S. private equity (PE) firm GTCR for ~US$400 million, the latest in a string of PE buyouts in the youth sports space.

LiveBarn is kind of like ESPN for youth sports, with cameras capturing live games in over 4,000 arenas, courts, and fields across North America.

The company offers a streaming subscription that includes live game feeds, highlight packages of individual players, and even data analysis — a feature we’re confident has made life more difficult for the children of overly intense hockey parents.

Why it matters: Youth sports have evolved from a primarily non-profit-run space to become a US$40 billion a year industry, larger than the recorded music, box office, and sports betting sectors.

Eager parents have been a driving factor in this shift, paying tens of thousands of dollars for personal coaching, academies, scouting tournaments and other services that give their kid a better shot at going pro.

Whether it’s delusion or aspiration, one study found that ~20% of American parents believe their kid could play Division I college sports, while 10% believe their kid will make it to a pro league or the Olympics.

Our take: Canadian families already spend an average of over $3,000 a year on their kids' athletic endeavours. As private equity continues to move into the space, the goal of maximizing profits could make youth sports less accessible for Canadians.—LA",https://beehiiv-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/446339a1-b302-43de-a95b-6cdec78763df/Newsletter_Graphics.png?t=1769371540,N,,2026-01-26 07:00:27.963280

Fitch has also assigned a 'B+' rating with a Recovery Rating of 'RR3' to the proposed first lien $1.25 billion senior secured term loan B issued under Industrial F&B Investments III, Inc. The ratings assume an additional $550 million of pari passu secured debt. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The ratings reflect the company's weak performance trends, execution issues, high leverage, and modest scale with EBITDA in the high-$300 million range. The ratings consider the company's leading position in the North America private-label category.

Following the take-private transaction of Treehouse by Investindustrial, pro forma leverage is expected to be around 4.9x, with modest incremental debt, which is largely leverage neutral. Fitch expects leverage to trend around 5.0x over the medium term with ongoing investments in the business driving topline and volume stabilization, funded by anticipated operating efficiencies.

Key Rating Drivers

Execution Issues, Weak Volume Trends: Over the past decade, TreeHouse has undergone multiple transformations in efforts to reshape its portfolio for growth, with volume pressure since 2016. It acquired businesses to gain scale but struggled to achieve synergies. Despite various strategic efforts to reduce complexity through divestitures and shifting to higher-growth, higher-margin product categories, volumes declined in 2023 and 2024, driven by supply chain disruptions and product recalls. Fitch forecasts a 4% decline in organic sales in 2025, reflecting ongoing volume pressures and continued operational inefficiencies, driven by recalls and margin management initiatives.

Private-label products typically perform well during periods of financial strain, as consumers trade down from branded products for affordability and value. Industry private-label penetration grew in 2024 and 2025 given increased consumer focus on value following several years of high inflation. Despite this tailwind, Treehouse's volumes declined due to temporary facility closures and quality control issues. Fitch expects TreeHouse's organic sales to be relatively flat in 2026 as volume declines moderate to low single digits versus a projected 8% decline in 2025, driven by resolution of supply chain issues, investments in innovation and go-to-market strategies.

Take Private Acquisition: On Nov. 10, 2025, TreeHouse agreed to be taken private by Investindustrial in an all-cash deal valued at $2.9 billion, or around 8x Fitch-adjusted LTM September 2025 EBITDA. This is the second deal between the companies in four years, following Investindustrial's $950 million acquisition of the majority of TreeHouse's Meal Preparation business in August 2022.

The post-acquisition capital structure is expected to be largely leverage neutral, consisting of a $1.25 billion proposed Term Loan B and $550 million of other secured debt issued to repay the existing $1.7 billion debt, which includes outstanding borrowings under its A/R securitization program. Fitch believes that, under new management with experience in its legacy business, TreeHouse could realize cost savings and improve profitability over the medium term.

Relatively Small Industry Player: Although TreeHouse is a leader in the North American private label space, it is smaller than many branded packaged food competitors. The Campbell's Company (Campbell; BBB-/Stable), a direct competitor in broth and snacks, generated $10.3 billion of total net revenue and over $1.8 billion of EBITDA in fiscal 2025 (ended August 31), compared with Treehouse's 2024 revenue and EBITDA of around $3.5 billion and $370 million, respectively. Fitch expects TreeHouse's EBITDA to remain in the high-$300 million range over the next 12-24 months as the company focuses on improving supply chain capabilities and reducing business complexity.

Stable Margins, Modest FCF Generation: In 2025, Fitch expects margins to remain relatively flat at 11% versus 10.9% in 2024, driven primarily by ongoing cost-saving initiatives offsetting volume declines. With new management, Fitch expects margins to remain in 11% range with topline stabilization and investments in operational efficiencies. The company has historically generated positive FCF, excluding working capital swings from divestitures, due to minimal capex. Fitch expects FCF to be around $100 million in 2025 and modestly positive thereafter, driven by higher cash interest expenses, restructuring costs, and higher capex to fund operational capabilities.

Elevated Leverage: Fitch expects pro forma leverage for 2025 to be around 4.9x, in line with 2024, reflecting flattish EBITDA and modest incremental debt from the transaction. Beginning 2026, Fitch expects leverage to be flat at around 5.0x, reflect stable EBITDA and debt levels.

Peer Analysis

Treehouse's 'B' rating and Stable Outlook reflects the company's weak performance trends, execution issues, high leverage, and modest scale, with EBITDA in the high-$300 million range. Other rated peers include The Kraft Heinz Company (Kraft Heinz; BBB/Rating Watch Negative), The Campbell's Company (Campbell; BBB-/Stable), and Conagra Brands, Inc. (Conagra; BBB-/Stable).

Kraft Heinz's rating reflects its portfolio of strong brands and actions taken to strengthen its market position through portfolio optimization and repositioning efforts. The Negative Rating Watch reflects the company's announced plan to separate into two entities: Global Taste Elevation Co. (Remain Co) and North American Grocery Co. Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch when there is greater clarity on RemainCo's pro forma capital structure, operating and cash flow prospects and long-term financial policy.

Campbell's ratings reflect the company's strong brands, significant market share in several product categories and leverage sustained in the high-3x range. Fitch expects EBITDA could decline in the low- to mid-teens in fiscal 2026, driven by the weak topline, higher input costs and ongoing reinvestment into the business and recover modestly thereafter. Leverage is expected to be around 4.2x in fiscal 2026 and in the high-3x range in fiscal 2027, assuming FCF is used towards debt reduction.

Conagra's ratings reflect its position as one of the largest players in the U.S. packaged foods industry, with a strong presence in the frozen, refrigerated and snacking categories. Fitch expects EBITDA to trend toward the high $1 billion range in fiscal 2026, with EBITDA leverage approaching 4x.

Fitch's Key Rating-Case Assumptions

2025 organic sales is expected to decline by 4% driven by high-single digit volume declines offset by mid-single digit pricing actions. Beyond 2025, organic sales is expected to be flattish from volume stabilization.

EBITDA is expected to be $370 million in 2025 relative to $366 million in 2024 and remain relatively flat thereafter. EBITDA margin is expected to be 11% in 2025, a modest increase from 10.9% in 2024, as the company manages inflationary pressures with cost-savings initiatives. Margins are expected to remain in the 11% range from ongoing supply chain optimization and increased investment into marketing and innovation.

FCF is expected to be around $100 million in 2025 with capex of $125 million. Beyond 2025, FCF is expected to be minimal, driven by higher cash interest burden and capex of $150 million- $170 million annually.

Leverage is expected to improve in 2025 to 4.8x from 4.9x in 2024, before increasing to 5.0x in 2026, as the company continues to invest in operational excellence to stabilize topline and position for growth. Leverage is expected remain in the 5.0x range over the forecast period from flattish EBITDA and debt levels.

Corporate Rating Tool Inputs and Scores

Fitch scored the issuer as follows, using our Corporate Rating Tool (CRT) to produce the Standalone Credit Profile (SCP):

Business and financial profile factors (assessment, relative importance): Management (b+, Moderate), Sector Characteristics (b, Higher), Market and Competitive Positioning (b+, Moderate), Diversification and Asset Quality (b+, Moderate), Company Operational Characteristics (b, Higher), Profitability (b+, Moderate), Financial Structure (b+, Moderate), and Financial Flexibility (bb, Lower).

The quantitative financial subfactors are based on custom CRT financial period parameters: 20% weight for the forecast year 2025, 40% for the forecast year 2026 and 40% for the forecast year 2027.

B+ to CC considerations apply in our analysis and result in no adjustment.

The Governance assessment of 'Good' results in no adjustment.

The Operating Environment assessment of 'aa-' results in no adjustment.

The SCP is 'b'.

Recovery Analysis

Fitch conducts a bespoke recovery analysis when assigning and monitoring instrument ratings for issuers with IDRs of 'B+' and below. The recovery analysis assumes that TreeHouse would be reorganized in bankruptcy as a going concern (GC) rather than being liquidated. The recovery analysis further assumes the RCF will be fully drawn.

TreeHouse' recovery analysis is based on a going concern enterprise value. Fitch assumes a $250 million going concern EBITDA. The going concern EBITDA reflects a scenario of continued market share losses given ongoing execution issues and/or increased competition in its portfolio categories, which results in revenue declining about 25% to $2.5 billion from $3.4 billion of revenues estimated for 2025. EBITDA margins are assumed to be around 10%, reflecting continued operational issues and marketing efforts to improve sales, offset partially by cost cutting and supply chain optimization efforts achieved through bankruptcy.

TreeHouse's recovery analysis uses a 6.0x EV multiple. This compares to the 6.4x median bankruptcy multiple for food, beverage and consumer companies. The EV multiple considers the company's diversified product offerings, offset by its relatively small scale with a focus on private label compared to other branded peers.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade

Revenue and EBITDA declines due to market share losses or margin pressures, operational issues or debt-financed dividends or acquisitions that would cause leverage to be sustained above 6.0x.

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade

Stabilization in volume trends with EBITDA improvements such that leverage is sustained below 5.0x.

Liquidity and Debt Structure

Fitch views TreeHouse's post-closing liquidity as satisfactory, with approximately $400 million of ABL capacity. This is viewed relative to 1.0% amortization on the $1.25 billion term loan B, with payment commencing after the first full fiscal year. TreeHouse's proposed capital structure consists of approximately $400 million ABL revolver, a first-lien $1.25 billion term loan B, and $550 million of other secured debt. Proceeds are expected to be used towards repaying existing debt and outstanding borrowings under its A/R securitization program.

Prior to the announcement of the acquisitions, as of Sept. 30, 2025, TreeHouse had around $400 million in liquidity, including $21 million in cash and $372.2 million available under its $500 million secured RCF due Jan. 17, 2030 (netting $95 million of borrowings and $32.8 million of letters of credit). In addition to the revolver, the company's capital structure included a $422.9 million secured term loan A-1 due January 2030, a $480 million of secured term loan A due January 2030, and a $500 million unsecured bond due September 2028. The company also has a A/R securitization program in place and as of Sept. 30, 2025, the total outstanding borrowings on the facility was $221.7 million.

Issuer Profile

TreeHouse is the leading manufacturer and distributor of private label packaged foods and beverages in North America. The company has 24 production facilities and distributes both private label and regionally branded products to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and specialty retailers.

Constellation, owner of auction giant BCA, first announced the deal to buy Aston Barclay in April 2025.

However, the deal has been subject to competition clearance through the CMA and was referred to a phase 2 investigation in October last year.

Now, the CMA’s interim report has said: “The CMA has provisionally found that the completed acquisition by Constellation of Aston Barclay…has not resulted, and may not be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of business-to-business (B2B) used vehicle auction services in Great Britain.”

The CMA report also mentions that Aston Barclay was ""facing financial challenges prior to the merger"", so would most likely have exited the market without the deal with Constellation.

The CMA said that its provisional indication is “not our final decision” and has invited any interested parties to comment on the findings and its phase 2 report before the acquisition is fully cleared.

Further details from the report show: ""The CMA found that the merger does not raise competition concerns at a local or regional level, as there are a large number of B2B used vehicle auction providers with local or regional coverage.

As the company's stock price grapples with technical weakness, prominent asset managers are making substantial, yet contrasting, moves, highlighting a battle of convictions over the software giant's future.

Recent regulatory filings reveal a stark divide in how large investors are positioning themselves. In the most notable development, the renowned growth-oriented investment firm Baillie Gifford & Co. established a brand new position, acquiring 50,514 shares valued at approximately $17.82 million. This substantial entry signals a clear long-term confidence vote from the Scottish manager, despite the stock's recent performance.

This bullish stance was echoed by other institutional buyers. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft FI increased its holdings by 25.4%, bringing its total to 18,144 shares. Similarly, Investment House LLC expanded its position by 7.1% to 95,506 shares.

Conversely, a separate cohort of investors is scaling back exposure. Quilter Plc reduced its stake by a significant 42.8%, selling 12,670 shares. Y Intercept Hong Kong Ltd also cut its position, executing a 30% reduction.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

Solid Fundamentals Meet Technical Headwinds

This institutional tug-of-war unfolds against a backdrop of robust business performance juxtaposed with challenging market mechanics. Adobe's latest quarterly results surpassed expectations, with earnings per share coming in at $5.50 against a forecast of $5.40. Revenue climbed 10.5% year-over-year to $6.19 billion, also exceeding the $6.11 billion consensus estimate. Looking ahead, the company has set an ambitious target for fiscal year 2026, guiding for earnings per share in the range of $23.30 to $23.50.

Technically, however, the equity faces pressure. The current share price trades notably below key moving averages, residing under both the 50-day average near $331 and the 200-day average around $344. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 32.38, the stock is technically in oversold territory. This disconnect between double-digit revenue growth—fueled in part by AI products like Firefly—and the weak price action reflects broader market skepticism regarding software valuations in the current AI-focused investment climate.

Analysts Maintain a Constructive Outlook

The analyst community remains largely optimistic. Consensus ratings from 25 to 34 covering analysts point to a ""Moderate Buy"" recommendation. Their average price targets, ranging from $421 to $450, suggest substantial upside potential from current trading levels. Institutional ownership of the float stands at 81.79%, indicating that despite the recent portfolio adjustments, the vast majority of institutional capital remains committed.

The critical question now is whether new large-scale investors like Baillie Gifford can help establish a support level around the $300 mark. Upcoming quarterly earnings reports will be pivotal in determining if Adobe can reaffirm its annual targets and demonstrate that its AI strategy is delivering the anticipated results.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2444315_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 01:59:20.783863

The project also supported the overall growth of the company by linking industry-academic cooperation institutions and professional support institutions.
In addition, technological competitiveness was enhanced through the recruitment of research personnel and joint R&D of industry-academia research and development.
In the second year of the project, which is being promoted this year, the connection between global expansion and technology commercialization will be further strengthened.
""The Legend 50+ 2.0 project is a corporate growth support model that organically links technology development, commercialization, exports, and digital transformation,"" said Kim Hyun-gon, head of the Korea Research Institute.","Gyeonggi Province's Advanced BioHealth Small and Medium Business Project Legend 50+ 2.0"" promoted by Gyeonggi-do Province and the Gyeonggi-do Economic Science Promotion Agency achieved the highest S grade among 16 participating regions in the regional specialization project 2.0 performance evaluation organized by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups.

According to the Korea Research Institute on the 26th, the ""Legend 50+ 2.0"" project is a mid- to long-term corporate growth support project that strengthens the growth base of the bio-health industry in the province for three years from 2025 to 2027 in connection with the regional specialization project of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups.

The Korea Research Institute selected 27 promising companies in the pharmaceutical, medical devices, and digital healthcare sectors in the province as participating companies and provided intensive support for the first year in 2025. The project also supported the overall growth of the company by linking industry-academic cooperation institutions and professional support institutions.

Over the past year, the Korea Economic Research and Extension Service has pushed for a total of 47 cases, worth about 3.2 billion won, in connection with the core policy projects of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups and the self-support projects of Gyeonggi Province.

It supported technology advancement and business expansion by linking innovation vouchers, export vouchers, and policy funds. In addition, technological competitiveness was enhanced through the recruitment of research personnel and joint R&D of industry-academia research and development.

It is characterized by a support structure that encompasses the entire business growth cycle from technology development to commercialization and export, such as AX and DX vouchers, participation in overseas exhibitions, support for overseas expansion of medical device companies, and response to trade crises.

This is expected to generate results such as an increase in sales of 37 billion won, an increase in exports of 9.8 million dollars, and job creation of 60 people, and is expected to lead to a growth base and strengthening industrial competitiveness of participating companies.

With the support of AX and DX vouchers, Korea BioSelf has advanced circulatory tumor cell analysis and counting technology in cancer patients' blood. It promoted the development of liquid biopsy-based AI analysis software to improve technology completion. In this process, three patents were applied and one was registered. Employment in related fields, including partner companies, has also been expanded.

Subsequently, medical device company Suil Development achieved entry into the European market by supporting participation in overseas exhibitions. He participated in the Society for Diabetes (EASD) held in Austria and signed a $500,000 field contract with Germany's Mediq. It also discussed cooperation with France's Air Liquide company in multi-regional expansion. This laid the foundation for European market expansion.

Gyeonggi-do Province and the Economic and Social Development Institute will manage sales growth, job creation, and export expansion of participating companies as key indicators and check policy effects based on performance indicators. In the second year of the project, which is being promoted this year, the connection between global expansion and technology commercialization will be further strengthened.

""The Legend 50+ 2.0 project is a corporate growth support model that organically links technology development, commercialization, exports, and digital transformation,"" said Kim Hyun-gon, head of the Korea Research Institute. ""We will continue to foster high-tech bio-health small and medium-sized companies with global competitiveness by upgrading corporate-tailored support based on the first year's performance.""",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202601/26/news-p.v1.20260126.2f16635b26d04e119449f3e646dca8f6_P1.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 03:00:31.595948

But if an agent is going to make decisions in a newsroom, it can’t be a black box.
This isn’t just about getting information—it’s about the context it relies on when taking action.
For organizations to truly advance into the agent era, they’ll need to adopt an old adage: trust, but verify.","The last couple of months have seen a lot of progress on this front. While I was at CES, I attended Lenovo’s keynote, which unveiled Qira, an always-on AI that will be built into its devices going forward. As I wrote about at The Media Copilot, the innovation with Qira is that the assistant is now an “orchestrator of agents,” seamlessly passing off the user to other services like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or others, depending on the user’s request.

The reason a device maker like Lenovo can do that is because it doesn’t compete with those services—Qira is a facilitator, not a do-everything AI service. It appears Apple has also finally woken up to that strategy now that it’s announced a multi-year deal to integrate Google’s Gemini models into a revamped Siri later this year.

Apple has colossally overpromised and underdelivered on AI over the past two years, partly because of its reluctance to rely on partners for parts of its AI experience. Now that there’s more clarity on the orchestrator vision—and on how AIs talk to each other—it looks like we’re past concerns over empowering competitors.

Assistants evolve into agents

Into all this come agentic tools like Claude Code and Claude Coworker. The buzz around these tools in the AI world has been insane, and a big part of the reason is they can do much more than code and build websites. They are effectively agents, able to take instructions, turn them into plans, and then execute on them, often with minimal guidance from the user. Whether it lives in the OS (Qira/Siri) or in a desktop app (Cowork), the effect is the same: decision-making moves closer to the interface people actually use.

Several people on X say the experience using Coworker is closer to working with a colleague rather than prompting an AI. But there are new worries, too: Anthropic is warning users about safety risks—like unclear instructions leading to file deletion—because that’s what happens when the model can act, not just talk.

All this is pointing in the same direction. Sometime soon, it seems likely that a significant and growing amount of device interactions will be essentially telling agents what to do. No apps, no browser—just the answer, output, or outcome you were looking for. It’s the Enterprise computer, just not on the bridge of a starship but in millions of pockets worldwide.

There are huge implications for the media, brands, and other content providers. In my Qira piece, I talked about how the battle for context is going to play out in the information space in the coming year, but agent-based work will also have an effect on information-based work itself, especially journalism. Embedding an agent—essentially a decision-making computer—into your workspace is potentially a huge accelerant, but it poses difficult questions around attribution, access, and how it treats sensitive data.

Auditability in the agent era

Sounds serious, and there’s a simple solution to those concerns: don’t use it. But that’s not a strategy. Like any tool, those who learn it, use it, and master it will have an advantage over those who don’t. As agentic work grows in popularity, the workplaces that figure out how to implement it safely and securely will have the best chance of success.

The media is particularly challenged, though, since information is their business. We’ve already seen this play out with regard to hallucinations. The propensity of AI systems to make things up out of the blue continues to persist, and it keeps many newsrooms from adopting AI, at least in any way that touches content.

The danger of a workplace agent is more insidious. The AI isn’t creating content per se, but it is making decisions such as what information sources to use, what services to help with a task, and what company knowledge to apply to any specific request. But if an agent is going to make decisions in a newsroom, it can’t be a black box.

Even without the AI making a mistake per se, the question of how the AI makes its decisions matters. Look at the corollary in search: When Google made a deal with Reddit, which led to Reddit appearing at the top of many more search results. That unquestionably had an influence on where people got their information, especially since Google is an effective monopoly on search.

Well, a device or workplace agent will have a similar monopoly. How an agent goes down a tree of decisions can’t be a black box. Certainly, steering workers toward sanctioned services and company software is an obvious first step. Following style guides and company policy in the actions it takes is another. But it’s in the parts of workflows that aren’t covered by that where things get strange. This isn’t just about getting information—it’s about the context it relies on when taking action.

The need for AI governance

While actions need to be seamless to the user, there needs to be an auditable paper trail for them. How the agent gets context from the web, and from which services, should be clear and traceable. When asked, in plain language, why it took a specific action, there should be a rabbit hole the user can go down if they wish, along with a method to correct any problems in its thinking (including bias). Disclaimers won’t cut it on agents—training how to both use them and audit your own use, should be standard.

In other words, governance matters. Agents like Qira and Claude Coworker might deliver on the dream of true AI assistants. But the potential they promise to unlock requires an equal amount of deference. If AI has shown anything over the past few years, it’s that it can do incredible things, but it can’t be trusted to always get it right. For organizations to truly advance into the agent era, they’ll need to adopt an old adage: trust, but verify.",https://fastcompanyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/The-agent-era-is-coming.-Newsroo.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 01:59:40.415509

Through the successful Soul Lot prototype and gaining certainty in 2nm production, I realized that miracles are not something that simply happens—they are created.
What must never be done in engineer development is damaging an engineer's confidence.","Rapidus is advancing at an extraordinary pace toward the mass production of the world's most advanced 2nm semiconductors. With mass production scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2027 and the pilot line having started operation in April 2025, time is of the essence. What supports the successful completion of this extremely challenging development within such a short time frame, are the engineers working on the front lines. Shigehiro Fujino, senior executive officer and deputy director of the Rapidus Engineering Center, shares the story of their struggles, growth and the path that led to confidence in achieving 2nm technology.

Career Path and Technical Goals Expected by the Company

――Can you tell us about your career and what Rapidus expected from you?

I come from a background in materials science. After working at a company in South Korea, I went to the United States to pursue my Ph.D. After earning my doctorate, I joined my previous employer—a flash memory manufacturer—because I was told I would be directly involved in materials development.

At the time, the company was still a small venture. It later formed a joint venture with a major Japanese manufacturer and established operations in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture.

After joining Rapidus, I was given two missions.

The first was to learn the gate-all-around (GAA) technology developed by IBM and establish the corresponding manufacturing processes for Rapidus. The second was to transfer the technology established at IBM's research facility in Albany, New York, to IIM-1 in Chitose, Hokkaido, and make it ready for production.

IBM's cooperation was essential to achieving this, and my experience in joint ventures is what led to my selection for this role.

Engineer Development Through Collaboration with IBM

――What do you tell engineers when they are first dispatched to Albany?

I always talk about three things: integrity, respect and perseverance.

Integrity means being honest with data and results. People sometimes feel tempted to make themselves look better, but I emphasize the importance of reporting results exactly as they are.

Respect is equally important. Achieving results requires cooperation with other engineers. Since someone else's success ultimately leads to your own success, I ask engineers to approach their work with a strong spirit of collaboration.

Perseverance might better be described as grit—the ability to persist until success is achieved. An engineer's job is to make what was once impossible possible, so I stress the importance of continuing until you grasp success.

――For many engineers, collaboration with IBM must have been a first-time experience. What kind of support did you provide?

The engineers assigned to Albany came from a wide range of backgrounds in terms of age and specialization. To move the project forward, we needed everyone aligned in the same direction.

After clearly showing that direction, I told them, ""I want you to think for yourselves about what needs to be done and act accordingly.""

IBM's cooperation was indispensable. To break down organizational barriers and truly function as one team, we named the project Titans, after a famous movie. We deliberately avoided dividing roles between Rapidus and IBM so that we could advance development as a single team.

We also arranged desks in an island layout, commonly seen in Japanese companies, to encourage open communication.

――For Japanese engineers, the language barrier can be a major challenge. What was necessary to overcome it?

You must never give up, and you must persist in communicating your own opinions.

At first, your English may be limited, and you may think you have communicated your point. However, to truly convey your opinion, you need to keep at it—sometimes repeating yourself several times. Only after that should you consider whether the issue lies with your own understanding or with the other person.

Through trial and error, opportunities for communication increase. That leads to the next action and creates a positive cycle. This is not limited to English—engineers who deliver results are those who persistently repeat their efforts.

When Confidence Turned into Certainty in 2nm Development

――Can you share an example that left a strong impression during the challenges leading up to 2nm development?

The most memorable moment occurred in July 2024.

At that time, we were forced to significantly revise our development strategy. We had to choose whether to pursue both the existing and new approaches in parallel, or to integrate them into a single approach.

The engineers made a committed decision themselves, fully aware of the risks, and chose the latter. Despite the limited time remaining, they ultimately achieved the required results within the deadline.

Had we pursued two approaches in parallel—one led by Rapidus and the other by IBM—the team we had built might have fallen apart. The engineers were able to make this decision because they shared a clear understanding that the goal was to develop the world's most advanced 2nm semiconductors at IIM-1. This achievement was possible only because we came together as one team—Titans.

――At what moment did you feel confident that 2nm development using Rapidus' unique approach was on track?

First, we confirmed transistor performance in Albany. At that moment, I felt that the core technology had been established.

Beyond that, we had a critical milestone to achieve by March 2025. When we reached it, my confidence deepened further.

Another major milestone was the Soul Lot, announced on July 18. We developed GAA transistors at IIM-1 and confirmed that their characteristics met expectations.

Four engineers who joined the company after completing their doctoral programs in 2024 returned to IIM-1. When I asked them, ""Can you really make 2nm semiconductors?"" they answered clearly, ""You don't need to worry. We will see this through to the very end."" Hearing that from engineers who had once seemed uncertain made everything feel attainable.

Engineers Grown in New York Shine at IIM-1

――Can you tell us about the engineers' achievements during the manufacturing of the Soul Lot?

First, I must express my gratitude to all the partners involved. The construction company that built IIM-1, the equipment manufacturers who installed tools and the materials suppliers who provided essential materials—all played vital roles in completing the Soul Lot.

Within Rapidus, the process engineers worked particularly hard. Producing 2nm semiconductors involves processes such as film deposition, lithography, etching and polishing. Each process has dedicated engineers, and their dedication truly stood out.

In December 2024, the EUV lithography equipment arrived from ASML in the Netherlands—like a long-awaited Christmas gift. However, production requires many other tools as well. Within just two and a half months, we installed more than 200 pieces of equipment and brought them online—making it possible to run lots, all without major incidents.

I am deeply grateful to the process engineers who made it possible to begin lot operations on April 1, 2025, exactly as planned.

――Do you have any memorable examples regarding the growth of engineers dispatched to New York?

Two engineers, in particular, exemplified the remarkable growth we witnessed through this project.

The first was an engineer who was entrusted with full responsibility for overseeing prototype operations while an IBM team member was away on a week vacation. This role required sound judgment, focus and a strong sense of ownership, which he embraced the opportunity with immense commitment.

Reflecting on the experience, he later told me, ""At Rapidus, the value of even one second feels completely different. I can truly feel myself growing at an incredible pace."" To me this really drove home, that by being given responsibility at a critical moment and delivering results within a limited time frame significantly accelerated his development as an engineer.

The second was a manager who demonstrated impressive growth over the course of his assignment.

From the early stages, he approached his role with a strong desire to improve the working environment and strengthen the team.

As the engineer responsible for lithography, he returned early to IIM-1 and, just as he had confidently stated—""We have built a strong team and we will run lots as scheduled on April 1.""—We accomplished this and proudly carried out Japan's first EUV lithography exposure.

Beyond this technical achievement, he consistently recognized the contributions of those around him, saying, ""This success was made possible by the engineers from the equipment manufacturer and by team members who prioritized the analysis of our lots."" Through his deep engagement with the project, he grew into a leader who actively fosters collaboration and values the collective strength of the team.

Future Outlook and the Mindset Needed for Success

――What would you like to focus on going forward?

Our primary goal is to begin mass production of 2nm semiconductors in fiscal year 2027. Beyond that, we aim to connect this achievement to mass production of the next generation of semiconductors.

We have established a roadmap for the next ten years, but the challenge of racing against time never disappears.

IIM-1 is a fab that enables the world's fastest production of advanced semiconductors through AI. Leveraging this strength, we are considering the development of a Virtual Fabrication Process. By fully utilizing simulations to predict semiconductor performance before production, we expect to reduce production time by 30 to 40 percent. Our goal is to complete basic development within three years and achieve practical application within five years.

――What do you value most in developing engineers who succeeded in prototyping within such a short period?

Through the successful Soul Lot prototype and gaining certainty in 2nm production, I realized that miracles are not something that simply happens—they are created. And it was engineers with passionate commitment who created this miracle.

What must never be done in engineer development is damaging an engineer's confidence. Challenges inevitably bring failures, but if a supervisor criticizes an engineer by saying, ""Why can't you do this?"" the engineer becomes discouraged and stops taking on challenges.

Innovation is not driven by factories or equipment. Ultimately, it is driven by people—engineers.

――You seem to enjoy challenges. How do you maintain motivation? And how do you apply that to organizational management?

No matter how difficult the situation, you have to endure it, share the facts with your team with a smile and solve problems together. It is precisely because the situation is difficult that people grow, and that is what gives challenges their value.

I like the phrase, ""Do or do not. There is no try."" When you decide to do something, you commit to it and see it through to the end.

I want engineers to become people who can work—but not people whose lives are only about work. About 150 engineers were assigned to Albany. Including their families, roughly 500 people moved to the United States.

We are able to work with smiles because we have families who support us.

Rapidus can realize the convenient and prosperous future we envision thanks to engineers who absolutely never give up. Looking ahead toward mass production in 2027, we will continue advancing technology at extraordinary speed together with engineers who embody integrity, respect and perseverance.",https://www.rapidus.inc/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/og.png,N,,2026-01-26 05:00:34.792037

Key Takeaways on FastCampus’ OpenAI Edu Adoption Milestone: FastCampus becomes the first private enterprise in Korea to adopt OpenAI Edu.","Korea’s AI education landscape has reached a new turning point. FastCampus, under Day1 Company, has become the first private enterprise to introduce OpenAI Edu — joining Seoul National University as only the second institution in the country to do so. This move strengthens Korea’s industry-led AI upskilling strategy, embedding advanced AI models directly into workplace-oriented training.

FastCampus Integrates OpenAI Edu for Advanced Practical AI Learning

FastCampus, the professional education brand of Day1 Company, officially announced on January 26, 2026, that it will introduce OpenAI Edu, the institutional version of OpenAI’s learning platform, to power its new AI education programs.

This adoption, celebrated at Day1 Company’s headquarters in Gangnam on January 23, marks the first private-sector implementation of OpenAI Edu in Korea. Previously, the platform had only been adopted by Seoul National University.

FastCampus will operate OpenAI Edu through a dedicated institutional workspace, providing learners with hands-on access to OpenAI’s most advanced models and functions, beyond what standard public users can access. The integration is designed to enhance real-world application of AI tools in research, documentation, and workflow automation across professional settings.

Background & Context: Extending Korea’s AI Upskilling Infrastructure

This development comes just days after Day1 Company signed an MOU with AI startup Upstage to jointly train industry-ready AI professionals. Together, these moves reveal a clear corporate direction: building an AI education–employment bridge that aligns academic learning, workplace training, and government-backed programs.

With OpenAI Edu, Day1 Company expands its role beyond workforce connectivity to AI learning infrastructure development, offering scalable, standardized training environments.

This dual approach — domestic collaboration through Upstage and global integration through OpenAI — illustrates how private-sector operators are increasingly complementing Korea’s national AI workforce initiatives.

The curriculum at FastCampus will include Deep Research, Reasoning, and Agent-based automation, enabling participants to go beyond prompt interaction and gain applied skills relevant to modern industries. Upon completion, participants will receive certificates verifying OpenAI Edu-based training, serving as proof of their proficiency in AI tool application.

A Samsung spokesperson declined to comment, while Nvidia was not immediately available for comment.

South Korean newspaper Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday that Samsung passed HBM4 qualification tests for Nvidia and AMD and will start shipping to Nvidia next month, citing chip industry sources.

SK Hynix said in October it has completed HBM supply talks with major customers for next year.

SK Hynix plans to begin deploying silicon wafers next month into a new fab, M15X, in Cheongju, South Korea, to produce HBM chips, an executive at the company told Reuters earlier this month, without elaborating on whether HBM4 will be part of the initial production.

Both Samsung and SK Hynix are set to announce their fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday when they are expected to share details of HBM4 orders.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said early this month that the company’s next-generation chips, the Vera Rubin platform, is in “full production,” as the U.S. company prepares to launch the chips, to be paired with HBM4 chips, later this year.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--1VgE7kYb--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2026-01-26T000955Z_2_LYNXMPEM0O0HU_RTROPTP_3_SAMSUNG-ELEC-RESULT.JPG?itok=0y6boZzt",N,,2026-01-25 23:59:22.821595

What Is U.S. Bancorp's Investment Narrative?

To own U.S. Bancorp here, you really have to believe in a steady, relatively low‑drama banking story that combines disciplined lending with growing fee income. The Q4 and full‑year 2025 beat, together with management’s 2026 guidance, keeps near‑term catalysts centered on net interest income trends, fee growth and expense control, rather than any single “home run” initiative. The BTIG acquisition and the US$2.25 billion of new fixed‑to‑floating senior notes fit that script: they point to a bigger push into capital markets and a tidier balance sheet, but do not look like thesis‑changing moves on their own. The recent buybacks and dividend track record also reinforce the role of capital returns, while credit quality, funding costs and integration risk around BTIG remain the main things I’d watch from here.

But the BTIG deal brings a new kind of risk that investors should not ignore. U.S. Bancorp's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 40%. Find out what it's worth.

The chatter began on Friday, when one of the many prediction models forecasters use showed a classic nor’easter: a storm that would take shape in the Gulf of Mexico, sweep across southern Georgia and hug the Atlantic Coast as it trekked north. The hypothetical simulation bore a striking resemblance to the “Storm of the Century” in 1993, which brought widespread heavy snow and paralyzed the East Coast for days.

But hold on a moment.

First, an explanation of how meteorologists build a forecast. There are two main computer models used around the world — the American (GFS) model and the European (ECMWF) model — that can visualize the overall weather pattern up to 14 days in advance. That far ahead, most of the information they spit out is hypothetical, though not always.

The storm showed up on several runs of the American model on Friday. By Saturday and Sunday, that same model failed to replicate the scenario. Other models, including the European one, began to hint at a similar system, but they placed it too far offshore to produce meaningful precipitation.

Dylan Lusk, a meteorologist with the Atlanta office of the National Weather Service, addressed the speculation on Saturday in his morning forecast. After giving a brief summary of the ice expected in his region this weekend, he turned to what he called his “favorite PSA.”

“Friends don’t let friends share single model runs of 10:1 snow totals 8 to 9 days out on social media,” he scolded. “From any model. Yes, I am judging you for posting that GFS run.”

Luke Culver, also with the Atlanta Weather Service office, expressed similar skepticism that afternoon: “Storm Threat Late Next Week? (Spoiler: Very Unlikely),” he wrote.

Mr. Culver, too, sought to tamp down online speculation:

“You may have heard about or seen posts on social media regarding a snow or winter weather threat in Georgia late next week or next weekend,” he wrote. “Well, at this time, that threat appears to be very low.”

But with Arctic air bringing usually cold temperatures across the South this week, forecasters acknowledge that the atmosphere is primed for more winter weather.

They are currently navigating what Eric Fisher, the chief meteorologist for WBZ-TV in Boston and an author of a book on major storms, called a “funnel” of uncertainty. Seven days out, meteorologists rely on pattern recognition to suggest what a storm is likely to do. As a storm draws closer — within 24 to 48 hours of arrival — and its specific physics become clearer, meteorologists can focus on the most likely scenarios.

For now, the only circumstance forecasters are confident about is the bitter cold that is settling in across the United States that will remain in place for days.

Freezing temperatures are the primary ingredient for winter weather, and they will be present across the Southeast. While Sunday’s model runs show weak signals for snow in cities from Atlanta to New York during the first two days of February, these models are outliers in what is otherwise a dry, cold outlook.

The takeaway: Be wary of the snowflake icons on your weather app seven days out, and be skeptical of social media posts that promise feet of snow a week in advance.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/arts/25winter-storm-future-storm/25winter-storm-future-storm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 23:59:04.723585

Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation.

Humans& will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model.","AI chatbots are getting better at answering questions, summarizing documents, and solving mathematical equations, but they still largely behave like helpful assistants for one user at a time. They’re not designed to manage the messier work of real collaboration: coordinating people with competing priorities, tracking long-running decisions, and keeping teams aligned over time.

Humans&, a new startup founded by alumni of Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, thinks closing that gap is the next major frontier for foundation models. The company this week raised a $480 million seed round to build a “central nervous system” for the human-plus-AI economy. The startup’s “AI for empowering humans” framing has dominated early coverage, but the company’s actual ambition is more novel: building a new foundation model architecture designed for social intelligence, not just information retrieval or code generation.

“It feels like we’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals, and now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things,” Andi Peng, one of humans&’s co-founders and a former Anthropic employee, told TechCrunch.

Humans&’s pitch centers on helping usher people into the new era of AI, moving beyond the narrative that AI will take their jobs. Whether or not that’s just marketing speak, the timing is critical: Companies are transitioning from chat to agents. Models are competent, but workflows aren’t, and the coordination challenge remains largely unaddressed. And through it all, people feel threatened and overwhelmed by AI.

The three-month-old company, like several of its peers, has managed to raise its startling seed round off the back of this philosophy and the pedigree of its founding team. Humans& still doesn’t have a product, nor has it been clear about what exactly it might be, though the team said it could be a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (think Slack) or collaboration platforms (think Google Docs and Notion). As for use cases and target audience, the team hinted at both enterprise and consumer applications.

“We are building a product and a model that is centered on communication and collaboration,” Eric Zelikman, co-founder and CEO of humans& and former xAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the focus is on getting the product to help people work together and communicate more effectively — both with each other and with AI tools.

“Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like,” Zelikman continued, chortling with his team as they recalled the time-consuming tedium of getting everyone to agree on a logo for the startup.

Zelikman added that the new model will be trained to ask questions in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you. Chatbots today are programmed to ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question. He says this is because they’ve been optimized for two things: How much a user immediately likes a response they’re given, and how likely the model is to answer the question it receives correctly.

Part of the lack of clarity around what the product is could be that humans& doesn’t exactly have an answer for that yet. Peng said humans& is designing the product in conjunction with the model.

“Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense,” she said.

What is clear, though, is that humans& isn’t trying to make a new model that can plug into existing applications and collaboration tools. The startup wants to own the collaboration layer.

AI plus team collaboration and productivity tools are an increasingly hot field — for example, the startup AI note-taking app Granola raised a $43 million round at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman today argued that companies are implementing AI wrong by treating it like isolated pilots and that the real leverage is in the coordination layer of work — that is, how teams share knowledge and run meetings.

“AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is,” Hoffman wrote on social media. “They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned.”

That’s the space where humans& wants to live. The idea is that its model-slash-product would act as the “connective tissue” across any organization — be it a 10,000-person business or a family — that understands the skills, motivations, and needs of each person, as well as how all of those can be balanced for the good of the whole.

To get there requires rethinking how AI models are trained.

“We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a humans& co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).

Long-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in recent academic work as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps.

“The model needs to remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding,” He said.

Despite the stellar crew running the show, there are plenty of risks ahead. Humans& will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model. That means it will be competing with the major established players for resources, including access to compute.

The top risk, though, is that humans& isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows.

Crucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives humans& a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&A is certainly a risk.

Humans& told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired.

“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”

Stocks are considered an inflation hedge.

It makes sense when you think about it.

Consumers and businesses experience inflation through the higher prices of goods and services. And those goods and services are sold by companies. And many of those companies comprise the publicly traded corporations listed on the stock market.

These companies aren’t always raising prices. But when they do, it’s because they believe it’ll support earnings growth. Often, the increase occurs in the context of passing on their own rising costs to their customers.

All this speaks to how companies have been dealing with tariffs. From Morgan Stanley’s Jan. 13 research note addressing tariff costs:

US Corporates Are Leveraging Pricing Power — Bullish for Earnings and Supportive of the Labor Market

Hidden in the depths of the Q3 US GDP print was evidence that firms are now starting to raise prices. The data in the GDP release is corroborated by data from the National Federation of Independent Businesses. We believe that companies are raising prices to pass through tariff costs to consumers rather than absorb a hit to margins. We view this as bullish for corporate earnings, while also reducing downside risk to labor markets.

This is consistent with what companies had been saying for much of last year.* And analysts expect margins to expand this year and earnings to grow at a double-digit rate through at least 2027. Notably, earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.

This dynamic between inflation and stock prices is not new.

Last October, Deutsche Bank published a study on asset prices over the past 200 years. They considered the relationship over 25-year periods. From the report:

Nominal equity returns rise almost linearly with inflation, suggesting that equities serve as an effective inflation hedge—particularly relative to cash. However, real returns tend to decline slightly as inflation increases, indicating that equities perform best in lower-inflation environments. Over a 25-year horizon though, the difference in real returns between moderate deflation (around 0% to -2% inflation) and fairly strong inflation (around 8–9%) is relatively small; the sharp decline occurs only at very high inflation levels.

Therefore, if you expect a structurally higher inflation regime ahead, equities should remain a reasonable good nominal hedge over the long run, with real returns likely to stay relatively well protected.

In the context of stocks acting as a hedge against inflation, the key finding here is that nominal returns have moved “almost linearly with inflation.” The fact that real returns (i.e., returns adjusted for inflation) have held up under most inflation scenarios is a bonus.

In the words of Ritholtz Wealth’s Ben Carlson, it’s a “pretty darn good long-term hedge to me.”

The big picture 🖼️

Publicly traded companies are not charities.

Their approach to pricing — whether it’s lowering them or raising them — is about maximizing earnings.

Sometimes that means raising prices on the goods and services they sell to you.

And you don’t have to like it.

But if you are invested in the stock market, you have exposure to the side that’s raising those prices.

-

*A popular reaction to the claim that tariffs have boosted prices is to ask, “Then why hasn’t inflation been higher?” While inflation rates have generally been steady, they remain above the Fed’s 2% target rate. We have to consider the possibility that inflation rates would be much lower if not for tariffs.

10 truths about the stock market 📈

🎲🎰 See me in Las Vegas!

I’ll be leading a breakout session at The MoneyShow TradersExpo in Las Vegas. The conference runs from Feb. 23 to 25. Sign up here!

Review of the macro crosscurrents 🔀

There were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:

🎈 Inflation could be cooler. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index in November was up 2.8% from a year ago. The core PCE price index — the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation — was up 2.8% during the month, up from October’s 2.7% rate. While it’s above the Fed’s 2% target, it remains near its lowest level since March 2021.

On a month-over-month basis, the core PCE price index was up 0.16%. If you annualize the rolling three-month and six-month figures — a reflection of the near-term trend in prices — the core PCE price index was up 2.3% and 2.6%, respectively.

⛽️ Gas prices tick higher, but remain relatively low. From AAA: “As winter weather grips much of the nation and fewer drivers hit the road, gas prices remain low with the national average at $2.85. Gasoline demand is lowest during this time of year, keeping the price of crude oil in the high $50 – low $60 range. Demand begins to ramp up toward the end of February and early March as the weather starts getting milder, and travelers take Spring Break trips.”

🛍️ Consumer spending ticks higher. According to BEA data, personal consumption expenditures increased 0.5% month-over-month in November to an annual rate of $21.4 trillion, an all-time high.

Adjusted for inflation, real personal consumption expenditures increased 0.6% from the prior month to another all-time high.

💳 Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: “As of 16 Jan 2026, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 5.5% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 16 Jan 2026, our estimate of the US Census December control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.47%.“

From BofA: “Total card spending per HH was up 3.3% y/y in the week ending Jan 17, according to BAC aggregated credit & debit card data. Lodging & grocery saw the biggest rise in y/y spending growth since last week. Furniture & clothing saw the biggest decline. 2026 is off to a good start. Part of the uptick in spending may be driven by HHs anticipating larger tax refunds this year.“

Consumer spending data has looked a lot better than consumer sentiment readings. For more on this contradiction, read: We’re taking that vacation whether we like it or not 🛫 and Consumer finances remain in good shape 💵

👎 Consumer vibes remain poor, but improve marginally. From the University of Michigan’s January Surveys of Consumers: “While the overall improvement was small, it was broad based, seen across the income distribution, educational attainment, older and younger consumers, and Republicans and Democrats alike. However, national sentiment remains more than 20% below a year ago, as consumers continue to report pressures on their purchasing power stemming from high prices and the prospect of weakening labor markets. Aside from tariff policy, consumers do not appear to be connecting foreign developments to their views of the economy.”

💼 New unemployment insurance claims remain low, total ongoing claims decline. Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose marginally to 200,000 during the week ending Jan. 17, up from 199,000 the week prior. This metric remains at levels historically associated with economic growth.

Insured unemployment, which captures those who continue to claim unemployment benefits, declined to 1.845 million during the week ending Jan. 10.

🔨 Construction spending ticked higher. Construction spending increased 0.5% to an annual rate of $2.175 trillion in October.

🏠 Mortgage rates tick higher. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.09%, up from 6.06% last week: “With the economy improving and the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage nearly a percentage point lower than last year, more homebuyers are entering the market. Buyers always should shop around for the best rate, as multiple quotes can potentially save them thousands.”

As of Q3, there were 148.3 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.9 million were owner-occupied and about 40% were mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to the small weekly movements in home prices or mortgage rates.

👎 Activity survey signals growth. From S&P Global’s January U.S. PMI report: “The survey is signalling annualised GDP growth of 1.5% for both December and January, and a worryingly subdued rate of new business growth across both manufacturing and services adds further to signs that first quarter growth could disappoint. Jobs growth is meanwhile already disappointing, with near stagnant payroll numbers reported again in January, as businesses worry about taking on more staff in an environment of uncertainty, weak demand and high costs. Increased costs, widely blamed on tariffs, are again cited as a key driver of higher prices for both goods and services in January, meaning inflation and affordability remains a widespread concern among businesses.”

Keep in mind that during times of perceived stress, soft survey data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data.

Putting it all together 📋

Earnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.

Demand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, appears to be modestly positive, and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.

But growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less “coiled” these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.

Actions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.

Stocks are not the economy: There’s a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.

Mind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.

Investing is never a smooth ride: There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.

Think long-term: For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.

Key insights about the stock market 📈

Here’s a roundup of some of TKer’s most talked-about paid and free newsletters about the stock market. All of the headlines are hyperlinked to the archived pieces.

10 truths about the stock market 📈

The stock market can be an intimidating place: It’s real money on the line, there’s an overwhelming amount of information, and people have lost fortunes in it very quickly. But it’s also a place where thoughtful investors have long accumulated a lot of wealth. The primary difference between those two outlooks is related to misconceptions about the stock market that can lead people to make poor investment decisions.

The makeup of the S&P 500 is constantly changing 🔀

Passive investing is a concept usually associated with buying and holding a fund that tracks an index. And no passive investment strategy has attracted as much attention as buying an S&P 500 index fund. However, the S&P 500 — an index of 500 of the largest U.S. companies — is anything but a static set of 500 stocks.

The key driver of stock prices: Earnings💰

For investors, anything you can ever learn about a company matters only if it also tells you something about earnings. That’s because long-term moves in a stock can ultimately be explained by the underlying company’s earnings, expectations for earnings, and uncertainty about those expectations for earnings. Over time, the relationship between stock prices and earnings has a very tight statistical relationship.

Stomach-churning stock market sell-offs are normal🎢

Investors should always be mentally prepared for some big sell-offs in the stock market. It’s part of the deal when you invest in an asset class that is sensitive to the constant flow of good and bad news. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has seen an average annual max drawdown (i.e., the biggest intra-year sell-off) of 14%.

How the stock market performed around recessions 📉📈

Every recession in history was different. And the range of stock performance around them varied greatly. There are two things worth noting. First, recessions have always been accompanied by a significant drawdown in stock prices. Second, the stock market bottomed and inflected upward long before recessions ended.

In the stock market, time pays ⏳

Since 1928, the S&P 500 has generated a positive total return more than 89% of the time over all five-year periods. Those are pretty good odds. When you extend the timeframe to 20 years, you’ll see that there’s never been a period where the S&P 500 didn’t generate a positive return.

What a strong dollar means for stocks 👑

While a strong dollar may be great news for Americans vacationing abroad and U.S. businesses importing goods from overseas, it’s a headwind for multinational U.S.-based corporations doing business in non-U.S. markets.

Stanley Druckenmiller's No. 1 piece of advice for novice investors 🧐

…you don't want to buy them when earnings are great, because what are they doing when their earnings are great? They go out and expand capacity. Three or four years later, there's overcapacity and they're losing money. What about when they're losing money? Well, then they’ve stopped building capacity. So three or four years later, capacity will have shrunk and their profit margins will be way up. So, you always have to sort of imagine the world the way it's going to be in 18 to 24 months as opposed to now. If you buy it now, you're buying into every single fad every single moment. Whereas if you envision the future, you're trying to imagine how that might be reflected differently in security prices.

Peter Lynch made a remarkably prescient market observation in 1994 🎯

Some event will come out of left field, and the market will go down, or the market will go up. Volatility will occur. Markets will continue to have these ups and downs. … Basic corporate profits have grown about 8% a year historically. So, corporate profits double about every nine years. The stock market ought to double about every nine years… The next 500 points, the next 600 points — I don’t know which way they’ll go… They’ll double again in eight or nine years after that. Because profits go up 8% a year, and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it.

Warren Buffett's 'fourth law of motion' 📉

Long ago, Sir Isaac Newton gave us three laws of motion, which were the work of genius. But Sir Isaac’s talents didn’t extend to investing: He lost a bundle in the South Sea Bubble, explaining later, “I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.” If he had not been traumatized by this loss, Sir Isaac might well have gone on to discover the Fourth Law of Motion: For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motion increases.

Most pros can’t beat the market 🥊

According to S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPDJI), 65% of U.S. large-cap equity fund managers underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024. As you stretch the time horizon, the numbers get even more dismal. Over three years, 85% underperformed. Over 10 years, 90% underperformed. And over 20 years, 92% underperformed. This 2023 performance follows 14 consecutive years in which the majority of fund managers in this category have lagged the index.

Proof that 'past performance is no guarantee of future results' 📊

Even if you are a fund manager who generated industry-leading returns in one year, history says it’s an almost insurmountable task to stay on top consistently in subsequent years. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, just 4.21% of all U.S. equity funds in the top half of performance during the first year were able to remain in the top during the four subsequent years. Only 2.42% of U.S. large-cap funds remained in the top half

SPDJI’s report also considered fund performance relative to their benchmarks over the past three years. Of 738 U.S. large-cap equity funds tracked by SPDJI, 50.68% beat the S&P 500 in 2022. Just 5.08% beat the S&P in the two years ending 2023. And only 2.14% of the funds beat the index over the three years ending in 2024.

The odds are stacked against stock pickers 🎲

Picking stocks in an attempt to beat market averages is an incredibly challenging and sometimes money-losing effort. Most professional stock pickers aren’t able to do this consistently. One of the reasons for this is that most stocks don’t deliver above-average returns. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, only 19% of the stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the average stock’s return from 2001 to 2025. Over this period, the average return on an S&P 500 stock was 452%, while the median stock rose by just 59%.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MfOx!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6a26a81-511f-4644-a168-6369eaa59c16_2426x1666.png",N,,2026-01-26 03:00:36.033334

Each Stargate site receives a community plan tailored to local needs

Cloud hosting and web hosting can benefit from predictable operational energy costs

OpenAI has unveiled a plan aimed at limiting the impact of its Stargate data centers on local electricity costs.

The new guidelines will see each site will operate under a community plan developed with input from residents and regulators.

This approach includes funding new power and storage infrastructure directly or investing in energy generation and transmission resources as needed.

Electricity investments aim to ease local energy strain

The goal is to ensure that local utility bills do not rise due to the operations of these large-scale data centers.

The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion, multi-year program to build AI data centers across the United States to support both AI training and inference workloads and handle some of the most demanding computational tasks in the industry.

OpenAI’s efforts mirror moves by other technology firms, such as Microsoft, which recently announced measures to reduce water usage and limit electricity cost impacts at its own data centers.

By funding energy infrastructure and working closely with local utilities, these companies aim to prevent added financial burdens on surrounding communities.

Each Stargate site will have a tailored plan that reflects the specific energy requirements of its location.

This could involve funding the installation of additional energy storage systems or expanding local generation capacity.

OpenAI claims it will fully cover energy costs resulting from its operations rather than passing them on to residents or businesses.

Cloud hosting and web hosting at these sites should benefit from predictable operating costs, while AI tools can run at scale without disrupting local infrastructure.

Reports indicate AI-driven data centers could nearly triple electricity demand in the United States by 2035, placing strain on regional power grids and pushing utility bills higher for consumers.

US lawmakers have criticized tech companies for relying on public utilities while residential and small business customers absorb the cost of grid upgrades.

Volatile demand from AI workloads, such as running large language models or other cloud-based AI services, further complicates energy planning.

Without proactive investment, electricity costs could rise sharply in regions that host multiple data centers.

OpenAI’s community plan also reflects the growing challenge of energy access for AI development.

Large-scale AI tools consume far more power than typical cloud services or web hosting workloads, making infrastructure planning essential.

By directly funding energy improvements and coordinating with local utilities, OpenAI aims to reduce risks to both the power grid and nearby communities.

Across the industry, a quiet tokenization wave is already reshaping how investors access private markets.

Still, its early entry into the tokenized‑equity space reflects a broader momentum that Forbes and others have begun to track as private‑equity giants experiment with tokenized funds and secondary liquidity.","As late-stage private giants stay off the public markets, a new class of tokenized products is emerging to give investors indirect exposure to the world’s most valuable startups.

In the 1980s, startups raced to ring the bell. In the 2010s, they raced to stay private. Today, they’re racing to tokenize and that shift could decide who gets into the next era of wealth creation, and who is left watching from the sidelines.

For decades, the IPO marked the moment a company “made it” from the passage from private innovation to public participation. Then cheap money and deep private markets changed the script. From 2012 to 2022, global private‑equity assets under management more than tripled to over $13.4 trillion, concentrating enormous financial clout in illiquid private companies.

That evolution has created a stark access gap. On one side: institutions and insiders with allocations into late‑stage giants like SpaceX and OpenAI. On the other: everyday investors locked out of the growth curve until much later, if ever. Private‑equity markets now run into the tens of trillions globally, yet only a tiny sliver is accessible via tokenized products, underscoring how early this market still is.

Some builders are now trying to turn that access gap itself into an index: a single instrument tied to a basket of late‑stage private tech companies worth more than $100 billion each. One emerging idea is to treat these giants as an indexable category, bundling exposure to several of them into a single tokenized product; Hecto Finance is one of the more aggressive experiments in that direction, testing a pre‑launch index built around a small set of these so‑called “Hectocorns.”

“We used to talk about unicorns, then decacorns,” says CEO Ultan Miller. “Now we’re in a world of $100 billion private companies and most people still can’t participate in their value.”

The Rise of the Hectocorns

Just as FAANG stocks once symbolized the dominance of public tech equities, a new informal club is taking shape behind the scenes. Call them the Hectocorns, OpenAI, SpaceX, ByteDance, Stripe, xAI and Anthropic, all privately held firms that have surpassed or are widely reported to be approaching $100 billion valuations without going public.

“Founders today don’t need to go public to scale. They can raise tens of billions privately while maintaining control,” says Miller. “For many, public markets are no longer where you go to grow; they’re where you go to exit.”

That inversion, public markets as endgame, not launchpad, is what Hecto is trying to price into a single instrument. Rather than betting on one name, the project aims to build a diversified, tokenized index that captures exposure to top private firms before they list.

A Structural Innovation, Not a Speculative One

Hecto Finance isn’t pitching a meme coin here. It is designing a regulated index product, with exposure built through tools like direct equity, forwards and total‑return swaps, all which are administered on Canton, a privacy‑focused blockchain backed by institutions including Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities and HSBC.

The token is planned as a security offering under Dubai’s VARA framework, with the team aiming for distribution across both crypto exchanges and, eventually, traditional brokerages. Miller’s wager is that the infrastructure for global, compliant securities distribution has finally matured at the same time as investor appetite for high‑growth private equity has gone mainstream.

“The moment it clicked for me was getting offered a co‑investment in OpenAI—opaque fees, messy structure, and I still felt lucky,” Miller recalls. “Most people never get that text message. Tokenization, done right, is how we change that.”

The Quiet Tokenization Wave

Hecto’s strategy doesn’t emerge in a vacuum. Across the industry, a quiet tokenization wave is already reshaping how investors access private markets.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has publicly described tokenization as “the next generation for markets,” and the first wave has largely centered on real‑world assets like Treasuries, credit and real estate, where fractional ownership structures pair blockchain rails with regulated wrappers.

On the private‑equity side, companies like Securitize have partnered with managers including KKR, BlackRock, Apollo and Hamilton Lane to tokenize interests in private funds, presenting tokenization as a way to “democratize capital markets by making them more accessible, transparent and efficient.” Its launch of tokenized feeder structures for flagship strategies marked some of the earliest large‑scale institutional tokenization efforts in private markets.

In Singapore, ADDX CEO Oi‑Yee Choo has argued that tokenisation can “democratise access to private investments” by cutting minimum tickets from around $1 million to as low as roughly $5,000 equivalent and automating issuance, custody and secondary trading for accredited investors across more than 30 jurisdictions.

Ondo Finance, which focuses on tokenized securities like Treasuries, has framed tokenized assets as part of a broader “transformation for financial assets.” In a public letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October last year, it urged regulators to adopt a “same activity, same risk, same regulatory outcome” framework rather than treat tokenized assets as a separate category, a stance that helped validate tokenized Treasuries and credit as viable on‑chain products as the SEC closed a probe into the project.

Other regions are taking a similar approach, with the recently announced amendments from South Korea’s National Assembly to the Capital Markets Act and the Electronic Securities Act, Singapore regulating tokenized assets under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA), Hong Kong integrating tokenization into its traditional securities framework under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) and Japan regulating tokenized securities under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA).

While Hecto targets the high‑risk, high‑reward world of pre‑IPO giants, this infrastructure layer has already reached operational scale. Securitize runs a regulated stack of tokenized funds with blue‑chip partners; ADDX serves accredited investors across Asia; and Ondo has obtained U.S. registrations as it builds a network for tokenized Treasuries and securities. Together, they show that compliant, liquid tokenized securities can work, so far with mostly bonds, credit and diversified funds. The leap to late‑stage private equity introduces harder questions about cap tables, transfer restrictions and what it really means to “own” a pre‑IPO share onchain.

Despite real‑world assets totaling approximately $18–34 billion on‑chain in 2025, tokenized private‑equity exposure remains a tiny fraction of a multi‑trillion‑dollar PE market—underscoring how early experiments like Hecto still are. Analysts now routinely project tokenized assets could reach $2–4 trillion by 2030 in base‑case scenarios, with more aggressive estimates ranging much higher depending on regulation and infrastructure.

The Case for Access — and the Caveats

The upside is obvious: tokenization could unlock global access to an asset class historically reserved for pension funds, elite venture firms, family offices and sovereign wealth funds. Trillions of dollars in private markets sit structurally out of reach for ordinary investors; whoever cracks compliant, liquid exposure to late‑stage private equity will help redraw the line between “Wall Street” and everyone else.

But the risks are real. Pre‑IPO equity is illiquid, often highly concentrated, and legally complex. Tokenized exposure must grapple with custody, compliance and settlement—plus the reality that many jurisdictions still lack clear rules for secondary trading of security tokens. And if a structure fails, the question of who truly holds the bag: token holder, intermediary or issuer, remains largely untested in court.

Miller argues that’s precisely why the infrastructure needs to be designed with regulation in mind, not added later.

“We’re not just building for crypto‑native investors. We’re building for a future where a 23‑year‑old in Jakarta can access the same pre‑IPO exposure as a fund manager in Zurich,” he says. “But we only get there by embedding compliance into every layer—tech, legal, operational.”

To that end, Hecto plans to publish cryptographic proof of reserves and is exploring dual issuance under both VARA and a major European regulator to support cross‑border distribution.

A Generational Shift in What Gets Indexed

Beyond the plumbing, Hecto is tapping into a broader cultural shift. For much of the 20th century, innovation was measured by public stock tickers. Today, many of the companies shaping AI, fintech, space and digital infrastructure are years, or decades, from IPO.

“Each generation has its defining asset class,” says Miller. “In the 80s it was equities. In the 2000s, tech IPOs. In the 2010s, crypto. The 2020s could be defined by tokenized pre‑IPO access—where value is created before it’s public, and ownership starts earlier.”

Hecto Finance remains early‑stage, with a waitlist of over 25k people. No token has launched, no assets are held on‑chain, and the company has not yet disclosed its cap table or full go‑to‑market roadmap. Still, its early entry into the tokenized‑equity space reflects a broader momentum that Forbes and others have begun to track as private‑equity giants experiment with tokenized funds and secondary liquidity.

Whether Hecto or another player gets there first, the direction of travel is clear: more of the growth curve is happening off‑exchange, and investors, and regulators, are searching for a way in. If it works, Hecto won’t just give investors a new way into the next generation of great companies. It may blur the line between “private” and “public” so thoroughly that, by the time a ticker finally appears on screen, most of the real action will already have happened.

S&P Global's forecasts imply 2026 global economic conditions will be similar to that in 2025—remarkable resilience of economic activity and ﬁnancial markets, i.e., a continuation of near-potential real GDP growth. Continued resilience of growth to geopolitical developments is not guaranteed. S&P Global continues to expect slowdowns in China, India, Canada, Brazil, the eurozone and the UK in 2026.

One escalating concern is that developments that S&P Global would have previously considered to be ‘tail’ risks—for example, US-European Union (EU) tensions over Greenland—have become more probable. Another is the US administration introducing another layer of tariffs to those ‘doing business’ with Iran.

At the same time, the artificial intelligence (AI)-spending-related boost to growth could be giving a misleading impression of how resilient economic conditions would be to additional adverse shocks, S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a note.

The near-term prospects for commodity and ?nancial markets have become more uncertain accordingly and, in the case of the recent rise in crude oil prices, run counter to some key aspects of S&P Global’s predictions for 2026—namely, supply-driven oil price declines leaning down on in?ation rates, extending monetary policy easing cycles and supporting growth.

While our forecasts did not change materially in January’s update, S&P Global continues to expect slowdowns in China, India, Canada, Brazil, the eurozone and the United Kingdom this year.

National growth prospects differ, as do some of their drivers, although there are some common factors contributing to the expected slowdowns. Most are trade-related, including unfavourable base effects stemming from 2025’s tariff front-loading.

S&P Global’s purchasing managers indices (PMIs) have already shown some loss of momentum. While there were ups and downs over the course of 2025, the global composite index generally remained indicative of near-potential global real GDP growth.

Output expectations have been persistently weak, although this was not exerting a signi?cant drag on current activity. December 2025’s PMI data showed some tentative signs that this might be changing for the worse.

However, the stocks have been on two different paths lately.

If you're interested in investing in a retail stock and have to choose between the two for the long haul, Walmart stands out as the better choice.

Walmart has a few advantages over Target when it comes to long-term success. First, it has always positioned itself as the place to go for value and bargains, helping it cater to lower-income and budget-conscious shoppers. This helps Walmart thrive in both a thriving and a slumping economy.

Target, on the other hand, has positioned itself as a more premium brand, and many of its prices reflect that. If money is tight, consumers have no issue skipping Target and heading to Walmart for deals.

Target also can't compete with Walmart's overall reach. It has over 5,200 U.S. stores, compared to Target's roughly 2,000.

Will Earnings Upside and Aggressive Buybacks Change Medpace Holdings' (MEDP) Capital Allocation Narrative?

January 25, 2026

In its fourth-quarter 2025 investor letter, Vulcan Value Partners highlighted Medpace Holdings’ strong free cash flow, solid balance sheet, and management quality, following an earnings report that surprised Wall Street with faster growth.

The letter also underscored Medpace’s active share repurchase program, including buying back more than 8% of its shares at what Vulcan viewed as attractive valuations, illustrating how capital allocation is shaping the company’s profile for long-term shareholders.

Next, we’ll examine how this combination of earnings upside and disciplined share repurchases influences Medpace’s broader investment narrative.

What Is Medpace Holdings' Investment Narrative?

For Medpace, the big-picture belief is that its focused contract research model, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation can keep compounding value in a competitive CRO market. Vulcan Value Partners’ recent letter reinforces that story, highlighting robust cash generation, a solid balance sheet and management that is willing to buy back more than 8% of the company at what it views as attractive prices. That kind of repurchase activity, on top of earnings that recently surprised Wall Street, increases the near term catalyst around capital allocation and any further upside surprises in bookings or margins when Q4 2025 results land on February 9. At the same time, after a very strong share price run and insider selling, valuation risk and expectations risk feel more front and center than before.

However, investors also need to weigh how richer expectations could magnify any disappointment. Despite retreating, Medpace Holdings' shares might still be trading 20% above their fair value. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Twelve Simply Wall St Community estimates span roughly US$288 to almost US$733 per share, underscoring very different views. Set against Medpace’s buyback-fueled momentum, this spread invites you to weigh capital allocation benefits against rising expectations risk.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 25% more than the current price!

Lawmakers’ blueprint—stress tests, oversight of third parties, and clear rules—aims to fortify the system without stifling growth, positioning Britain as a leader in responsible fintech.","LONDON—Britain’s financial regulators face mounting pressure to overhaul their approach to artificial intelligence after a parliamentary panel warned that the current “wait and see” stance exposes consumers and markets to serious harm. The Treasury Committee’s report, released January 20, 2026, calls for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Bank of England (BoE) to launch AI-specific stress tests, designed to simulate market shocks triggered by automated systems.

“Based on the evidence I’ve seen, I do not feel confident that our financial system is prepared if there was a major AI-related incident and that is worrying,” said Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury Committee, in a statement quoted by Reuters. The report highlights that about three-quarters of British financial firms now deploy AI in core operations, from insurance claims processing to credit assessments, amplifying risks like opaque decision-making and algorithmic exclusion of vulnerable customers.

Experts testifying before the committee pointed to threats from heavy reliance on a handful of U.S. tech giants for AI and cloud services, warning that outages—such as the October 2025 Amazon Web Services disruption affecting banks like Lloyds—could cascade into systemic failures. AI-driven trading could exacerbate “herding behaviour,” where imitative decisions amplify market crashes, the panel noted.

Treasury Committee Targets Regulatory Gaps

The cross-party group criticized the FCA, BoE, and HM Treasury for inadequate oversight, urging the FCA to issue guidance by the end of 2026 on applying consumer protection rules to AI and clarifying senior managers’ responsibilities for understanding these systems. “By taking a wait-and-see approach to AI in financial services, the three authorities are exposing consumers and the financial system to potentially serious harm,” the report stated, as covered by The Guardian.

Firms struggle with AI’s “lack of explainability,” conflicting with requirements for executives to control risks, according to trade group Innovate Finance’s testimony reported by The Register. The committee also slammed delays in implementing the Critical Third Parties (CTP) regime, introduced in January 2025, which empowers regulators to oversee non-financial providers like AI and cloud firms. “Over a year since the regime was established, it is not clear to us why HM Treasury has been so slow,” the report said.

The FCA, which has resisted AI-specific rules due to technology’s rapid evolution, plans to review the recommendations. A spokesperson told The Paypers the regulator welcomes the focus but favors principles-based oversight. The BoE, meanwhile, has assessed AI risks and will respond formally.

Agentic AI Emerges as New Threat

A race among banks to adopt “agentic AI”—systems that autonomously make decisions, unlike basic generative models—poses fresh dangers to retail customers, the FCA warned Reuters late last year. This shift from chatbots to operational influencers in lending and fraud detection raises concerns over “black box” outcomes hard to challenge, potentially discriminating against vulnerable groups.

Fraud risks and unregulated advice from AI chatbots compound consumer perils, while financial stability hangs on diversified infrastructure. “If something has gone wrong in the system, that could have a very big impact on the consumer,” Hillier told Reuters. The report advocates incorporating AI scenarios into system-wide stress tests to probe resilience.

In parallel, HM Treasury appointed Starling Bank CIO Harriet Rees and Lloyds Banking Group’s Rohit Dhawan as unpaid “AI Champions” on January 20, 2026, to guide safe adoption, as announced via government channels and echoed in Ground News aggregation.

Global Echoes and Industry Pushback

The UK push mirrors international concerns, with India’s RBI voicing similar AI governance needs in financial services, per Economic Times BFSI. Jonathan Hall, BoE Financial Policy Committee member, endorsed tailored AI stress tests to spot risks early, cited in coverage by MEXC News.

Industry voices like EY’s Preetham Peddanagari stress defined regulation for competitiveness, as noted by Mortgage Strategy. The FCA’s existing tools, including its April 2025 AI live testing service and a planned June 2025 code with the Information Commissioner’s Office, represent steps forward but fall short of lawmakers’ demands.

Financial services, a cornerstone of the UK economy, must balance innovation with safeguards. The Treasury Committee insists proactive measures, including designating AI providers under CTP by year-end, to avert crises where tech failures morph into economic shocks, drawing from TechRepublic.

Path Forward for Regulators

The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee should monitor CTP progress and recommend acceleration if needed, the report urges. With no dedicated AI laws, reliance on legacy rules leaves gaps, especially as 75% of firms embed AI deeper than other sectors.

David Geale, FCA Executive Director for Payments and Digital Finance, emphasized individual accountability for AI-induced harm, yet committee evidence reveals governance shortfalls. Upcoming FCA guidance could bridge this, mandating executive AI literacy.

Carrier underwriting tightening is likely to remain part of the insurance landscape as insurers adapt to evolving risks.","Underwriting decisions today are influenced by broader market conditions, long-term loss patterns, and forward-looking risk models. These changes are structural, not temporary”

— Dan Burghardt

METAIRIE, LA, UNITED STATES, January 9, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — Insurance markets across the Gulf South are undergoing notable shifts as carriers adjust underwriting standards in response to changing risk conditions. Underwriting tightening refers to a more conservative approach insurers take when evaluating applications, renewals, and coverage terms. These changes affect how policies are written, priced, and maintained, particularly in regions exposed to weather-related and property risks.

Underwriting guidelines serve as the framework carriers use to assess risk. When those guidelines tighten, insurers may require more detailed property information, limit coverage options, increase deductibles, or decline certain risks altogether. These adjustments are often driven by loss history, reinsurance costs, regulatory pressures, and broader economic conditions rather than individual policyholder behavior.

In recent years, carriers operating in Louisiana and Mississippi have faced increased claims activity related to hurricanes, flooding, wind damage, and secondary losses such as water intrusion and mold. Even properties that have not experienced direct losses can be affected, as underwriting decisions are often made using regional data and modeling rather than isolated histories.

One of the most visible effects of underwriting tightening is increased scrutiny during renewals. Carriers may request updated property inspections, roof age documentation, mitigation details, or confirmation of building materials. Properties with older roofs, outdated systems, or deferred maintenance may encounter coverage restrictions or non-renewal notices as carriers attempt to limit exposure.

Another common outcome involves changes to deductibles and policy terms. Higher wind or named-storm deductibles have become more frequent, particularly in coastal and near-coastal areas. In some cases, coverage limits may be adjusted or endorsements added to clarify exclusions that were previously broader in scope.

Underwriting tightening also affects new policy applications. Certain property types, construction styles, or geographic zones may face limited carrier availability. This can result in fewer options for placement and longer processing times as carriers evaluate submissions more carefully. Documentation accuracy becomes increasingly important in these conditions, as incomplete or inconsistent information can delay decisions or lead to declinations.

Commercial policies are similarly impacted. Businesses may see changes in property valuations, occupancy classifications, or risk control requirements. Carriers may require updated appraisals, loss control recommendations, or operational details to better understand exposure. These steps reflect an effort to align coverage with actual risk rather than assumptions made years earlier.

According to Dan Burghardt, owner of Dan Burghardt Insurance, underwriting tightening has become a defining characteristic of the current insurance environment.

“Carriers are reevaluating how risk is measured and priced,” said Burghardt. “Underwriting decisions today are influenced by broader market conditions, long-term loss patterns, and forward-looking risk models. These changes are structural, not temporary.”

Burghardt noted that policyholders often first encounter underwriting tightening through renewal changes rather than initial applications. “Renewals that look different from prior years are becoming more common. Increased documentation requests or adjusted terms usually reflect carrier-wide guideline changes rather than individual account issues,” he said.

Geographic considerations play a major role in underwriting decisions. Areas with repeated storm activity, flood exposure, or aging infrastructure tend to experience tighter standards more quickly. This includes many communities throughout Southeast Louisiana and coastal Mississippi, where insurers must balance continued participation with long-term sustainability.

After more than four decades of operation, Dan Burghardt Insurance has observed multiple market cycles. Over that time, the agency has grown to be licensed in both Louisiana and Mississippi while maintaining a strong focus on communities including New Orleans, Metairie, Kenner, Gretna, St. Bernard, Slidell, Mandeville, Covington, Baton Rouge, Hammond, Houma, Thibodaux, LaPlace, Lake Charles, Bossier City, Central, Lafayette, Monroe, Shreveport, and Alexandria.

These regional patterns highlight why underwriting tightening often feels uneven. One area may see limited disruption, while another experiences significant carrier pullback. The variation reflects how insurers apply models to localized data, sometimes resulting in different outcomes across relatively short distances.

Understanding underwriting tightening helps set realistic expectations. Policyholders who recognize these trends are better prepared for documentation requests, inspections, or policy adjustments. Clear records, updated maintenance, and accurate property details support smoother underwriting reviews, even as standards become more restrictive.

Carrier underwriting tightening is likely to remain part of the insurance landscape as insurers adapt to evolving risks. While guidelines may continue to shift, awareness of the underlying factors provides context for changes that might otherwise seem abrupt. In a constrained market, understanding how and why underwriting decisions are made becomes an essential part of managing coverage continuity and long-term planning.

By combining Smart lock home access technologies with Al Ghomlas’ extensive experience in local construction projects and market operations, the partnership seeks to deliver more integrated and reliable access solutions tailored to Saudi Arabia’s evolving building requirements

Expanding presence across leading offline retail channels

Over the past two years, Kiwi has steadily expanded its channel presence in Saudi Arabia, with Philips Home Access solutions entering leading offline retail chains such as SACO and EXTRA. These partnerships have enhanced product visibility, in-store experience, and consumer engagement across major cities.

Kiwi’s progress with SACO and EXTRA underscores its focus on offline-led growth, where hands-on product interaction, professional consultation, and localized services play a critical role in shaping consumer purchasing decisions in the Saudi market.

Online channels complementing broader market reach

In parallel, Kiwi has expanded online exposure for Philips Home Access solutions through selected e-commerce platforms, including Noon, while also co-presenting its solutions at Big 5 Construct Saudi 2026. This approach broadens consumer reach and complements Kiwi’s offline and project-focused channel strategy.

Building a sustainable local smart access ecosystem

Backed by a professional installation network and after sales system, Kiwi will keep expanding cooperation in key physical retail channels. It will also gradually integrate online points to boost consumer awareness and conversion.

Since entering the Saudi market, Kiwi has advanced its localization strategy for Philips Home Access solutions, focusing on channel, project, and service. The 2026 Big 5 Construct Saudi progress shows Kiwi's dedication to the sustainable growth of Saudi's smart home and building sectors.

Pooja Dhingra and Palak Shah have both carved their unique paths to success, asserting themselves in fields where few dared to tread. Their stories exemplify the power of vision, determination, and a willingness to push boundaries. They are both part of the coveted Forbes India under 30 alumni, a testament to their achievements and influence.

""It was never just about the macarons; it was about proving that a dream can reshape an entire industry,"" shares Pooja Dhingra, the founder of Le15 Patisserie, brought a taste of Paris to Mumbai with her macarons, an idea that took root during her time in France. She broke away from the conventional path when she left law school to pursue her love for desserts. She defied societal norms of following a 'safer' career path, choosing to enter a bold industry often considered unconventional for women. After realizing that India lacked the delicacies she had come to love abroad, she set out to change that, overcoming the challenges posed by local ingredients and climate.

Her success didn’t come overnight; it took years of innovation, blending international techniques with local elements. Today, Dhingra is a pioneer in the Indian patisserie industry, growing her business with passion and precision, and setting the standard for aspiring entrepreneurs. Ms Dhingra proved that innovation and persistence can overcome obstacles.

""For me, it was about honoring tradition while simultaneously evolving it for the modern world,"" remarks Palak Shah, who stepped into her family’s traditional textile business but redefined its direction with her brand Ekaya. Shah challenged the conventional role women were expected to play, turning her vision into a thriving business that merged heritage with modernity.

Rather than simply continuing the legacy, she transformed it by bringing Indian handloom into the global fashion space. Her vision allowed her to step beyond expectations, facilitating collaborations with leading designers and creating contemporary collections that made heritage textiles relevant in modern wardrobes. Her outfit has managed to deliver output that is both timeless and modern in equal measure.

Both women have not only achieved success but have also created spaces where others can thrive. They defied convention, trusted their instincts, and followed their passions, proving that perseverance and innovation are the keys to longevity in competitive industries. While their paths were different, the driving force behind their success was the same: an unwavering belief in their ability to shape their future.

Their journeys reflect a shared belief that success comes from doing what is right for oneself, regardless of convention. L'Oréal Paris, along with Forbes India, celebrates the journey of these enterprising women. As they continue to grow their ventures, they remind us that no matter what choices we make, we are worth it.

Recent collaborations in autoimmune disease and oncology, along with preliminary fourth quarter revenue reported above guidance, have coincided with a sharp rebound in sentiment. The 30 day share price return is 35.72% and the 1 year total shareholder return is 51.11%, even though the 3 year and 5 year total shareholder returns of 54.00% and 86.92% respectively indicate a much weaker longer term record.

If this kind of research driven story interests you, it could be a good moment to widen the net and look at as potential ideas to research next.

After reaching a 52-week high, delivering a 51.11% 1-year total return, and reporting revenue of about US$642.8 million alongside a US$76.32 million loss, is 10x Genomics still underappreciated, or are markets already pricing in years of future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 22.8% Overvalued

With 10x Genomics last closing at $22.38 and the most followed fair value sitting at about $18.23, the narrative is clearly more cautious than the market.

The acquisition of Scale Biosciences broadens 10x Genomics' technical capabilities in single cell analysis, allowing integration of foundational innovations like combinatorial indexing and quantum barcoding, which may accelerate innovation, reduce costs, and open up new high value markets, positively impacting future revenue growth and margins.

Want to see what kind of growth and margin profile has to line up for that fair value? The narrative connects modest top line expansion with a very different earnings picture and a specific future earnings multiple. Curious how those ingredients combine to imply a lower value than today?

Result: Fair Value of $18.23 (OVERVALUED)

However, it is still worth remembering that softer 2026 outlooks across the tools group and ongoing operating losses could quickly challenge expectations if demand or margins disappoint.

Another Angle On Valuation

On simple price targets, 10x Genomics looks 22.8% above the US$18.23 fair value implied by the consensus narrative. Yet on a P/S of 4.4x, it trades below peers at 5.6x, although above the 3.5x fair ratio that our model suggests the market could gravitate toward. Is that a margin of safety or a warning sign if sentiment cools?

This isn't the first Nvidia Arm chip, since the Switch and the Switch 2 already use them.","Hi, hello, and welcome to a new edition of the overkill digest newsletter.

First things first, some housecleaning:

I'm slowly moving this website from Ghost to Kirby and Buttondown. Ghost is great, but it's limiting for what I want to do. Kirby is fully modular and, combined with Buttondown, lets me do some cool things. My personal blog runs on Kirby, too.

Using Buttondown for mailing also saves me around $350 a year. And since I don't run ads or other income here (Ko-Fi is the only money I accept for overkill), saving money is always welcome!

Another reason is that I want to write more during the week. I often hold thoughts for this newsletter, but I could publish them during the week and then pull them into the email. With Kirby and Buttondown, I can automate that workflow.

The switch to Kirby will take at least a few months. There will be a full redesign and, knowing me, a lot of custom development.

But I decided not to wait to start my ""link blogging"" (if you never heard of that term, read this). Instead, I'm doing it now on overkill. Here's what that means:

Whenever I find something interesting, I'll write a link post. You can read them on the website, via RSS, or on Bluesky or Mastodon.

My longer posts, be it a review, a guide, or an opinion piece, will appear on social and RSS, and I'll also share them via email to people signed up for the Full Feed list.

overkill digest still goes out every Sunday. It'll include that week's link posts, longer posts, weekly updates on what I'm up to, and the occasional extra commentary. The layout will change as I experiment with a cool format. I appreciate feedback. Just hit reply!

If you want everything as soon as I publish, the best way is RSS. (If you have no clue how to use RSS, get in touch. I'll personally help you set it up.) If you want all the content but don't mind waiting, overkill digest is the way to go.

This week was gaming-heavy for me.

For starters, I had my first round of Dungeons and Dragons on Monday, and I'm hooked. It was incredibly fun, despite (or because of?) all the shenanigans of our play group. I have the 2024 rulebooks in my cart, but haven't ordered them yet. I want to play a bit more of our DnD campaign before splurging. Also, I really wanna try my hand at being a Dungeon Master.

Yesterday, after a 10-hour session (don't ask), I finished Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. What a game. Truly. Immediately after finishing I went down a theory rabbit hole (spoilers, obviously!) and my hype levels for the third installment went through the roof.

Today, I'll be playing some Magic: The Gathering Sealed and Commander at a friend's place, and depending on how late it gets, I'll continue my Clair Obscur playthrough. Busy busy!

Ok, now to this week's updates. I changed the layout a bit, so hit reply with feedback.

📬 The Link List

Nvidia is about to challenge ‘Intel Inside’ with as many as eight Arm laptops Lenovo leaked six laptops with two Arm-based Nvidia chips, the N1 and the N1X, with the latter rumored to have as many CUDA cores as a desktop RTX 5070.

This isn't the first Nvidia Arm chip, since the Switch and the Switch 2 already use them. But putting them in real computers is intriguing, and I wonder if we'll see them in handhelds, too. Maybe one running SteamOS, thanks to FEX?

CachyOS releases first big update of the year. CachyOS is my main distro at the moment, and after hitting schedule on this newsletter, I'll update my machine. The big changes here are a switch to the new Plasma Login Manager (instead of SDDM), Limine as the default bootloader, and a whole bunch of quality-of-life improvements.

Nexus Mods is working on a Linux version after all. From a recent blog post:

We’re also committing to supporting Vortex on SteamOS. We’ll be targeting vanilla Steam hardware like the Steam Deck and Steam Machine. We won’t be officially supporting any other configurations, but as Vortex is an open source project community developers will be free to extend support for their preferred Linux distros as they please.

Since this is Linux, ""won't be officially supporting"" just means the community will make it work on other distros. I doubt that's an issue.

The new Fable has me excited. This looks great. It's still just a trailer, and there is a longer overview, but what I see looks good.

For all the other games shown, check out the full Xbox Developer Direct stream.

Moving beyond consoles. From Matt:

This video from Brendon Bigley resonated with me. A PC is really the ideal gaming platform in 2026, and it's only getting better.

I agree, but I don't think a living room PC is for everyone. There are just too many moving parts for some people.

The advantage of a console is that it's a plug-and-play experience. You don't have to mess with graphics drivers, launchers, or settings. The console handles that for you. Distros like Bazzite solve some of this, but you still need to dial settings in, which may already be too much for some.

I'd love to see a tool that actually works. (There's the Nvidia app on Windows, but I honestly don't know if it's any good.) Something that knows your hardware and changes the settings for you. Maybe it offers two options like on the PS5, performance and quality, and relies on the community for the right tweaks.

But with so much hardware, pulling this off might be impossible. Maybe on the Steam Machine it would be doable, since its specs are always the same. But in this case, I prefer devs to ship their games with a preset (like how Cyberpunk2077 has a Steam Deck preset).

The JDE Peet’s board has reportedly fully backed Keurig Dr Pepper’s acquisition and recommended that shareholders accept the deal.
For Keurig Dr Pepper, a company already known for its diverse portfolio including Dr Pepper sodas and Keurig single-serve coffee systems, the acquisition of JDE Peet’s would represent a significant expansion.
Investors in Keurig Dr Pepper (NasdaqGS:KDP), currently trading at US$27.55, are closely monitoring these developments.
Potential synergies from the JDE Peet’s acquisition are expected to come from procurement, overlapping back-office functions, and selective store consolidation.","SAN FRANCISCO (Azat TV) – Peet’s Coffee is set to close approximately 27 locations across California, with a significant concentration in the Bay Area, by the end of January 2026. These closures coincide with Keurig Dr Pepper’s pursuit of an US$18 billion takeover of Peet’s parent company, JDE Peet’s, signaling a broader strategic realignment within the global coffee and beverage industry.

California Locations Affected by Closures

The impending shutdowns will impact numerous Peet’s outlets, particularly within the greater Bay Area, including some in San Francisco. While specific details on all affected stores were not immediately available, reports from the San Francisco Chronicle and SFGATE confirmed closures across various downtown shops, with the notable exception of the Embarcadero location. Employees from at least two Market Street Peet’s outlets confirmed they were informed of their closure last week, despite some stores still displaying hiring signs.

A representative from Peet’s Emeryville headquarters confirmed the figure of approximately 27 closures across California. This represents a portion of the company’s 283 nationwide locations, with 135 stores currently situated in the Bay Area alone. The reasons cited for these specific store closures include performance issues and lease factors, according to local reports.

Keurig Dr Pepper’s US$18 Billion Bid for JDE Peet’s

The store rationalization comes amidst Keurig Dr Pepper’s substantial US$18 billion all-cash bid to acquire JDE Peet’s. This proposed buyout was initially announced in August 2025 and subsequently financed through a US$7 billion raise from private equity firms in October 2025. JDE Peet’s, formed in 2019 from a merger between Jacobs Douwe Egberts and Peet’s Coffee, is currently the largest pure-play coffee entity globally, operating from Emeryville with its roasting facility in Alameda. The JDE Peet’s board has reportedly fully backed Keurig Dr Pepper’s acquisition and recommended that shareholders accept the deal.

For Keurig Dr Pepper, a company already known for its diverse portfolio including Dr Pepper sodas and Keurig single-serve coffee systems, the acquisition of JDE Peet’s would represent a significant expansion. The company recently completed a major acquisition of GHOST Energy, adding an energy drink and functional beverage line, and has seen its Dr Pepper brand gain traction through a viral TikTok jingle now featured in a national TV campaign, as reported by Simply Wall St.

Strategic Implications for the Coffee Market

Industry analysts suggest that the Peet’s store closures may foreshadow broader portfolio pruning by Keurig Dr Pepper. While closures often incur near-term restructuring charges, they can also lower fixed costs, lift average unit volumes for remaining stores, and support a more optimized channel mix. For Keurig Dr Pepper, a tighter retail footprint for Peet’s could support out-of-home profitability and facilitate a strategic shift towards its Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) segment, focusing on packaged coffee products like capsules, pods, and instant coffee, where volumes are often steadier and pricing power more robust.

Investors in Keurig Dr Pepper (NasdaqGS:KDP), currently trading at US$27.55, are closely monitoring these developments. While the stock has shown mixed performance over the past year, these strategic moves raise questions about how KDP could reshape its mix of brands and channels. Potential synergies from the JDE Peet’s acquisition are expected to come from procurement, overlapping back-office functions, and selective store consolidation. However, restructuring costs are anticipated before savings are realized, as noted by Meyka.com.

A Legacy of Coffee Innovation

Peet’s Coffee holds a significant place in American coffee culture, having been founded in 1966 by Alfred Peet in Berkeley, California. Peet is famously credited with mentoring three young entrepreneurs in the 1970s who later went on to start Starbucks, even supplying them with roasted beans for their initial venture.

The strategic closures of Peet’s Coffee locations appear to be a calculated move by Keurig Dr Pepper to streamline its newly acquired coffee assets, indicating a pivot towards optimizing profitability and enhancing its CPG presence rather than maintaining an extensive brick-and-mortar retail footprint.

Endowed with €100million over five years, L’AcceleratOR issued a first call for the new programme in June 2025.

Initially pitched to scale sustainable beauty solutions, the profile of companies involved now includes scalable sustainable solutions to solve the most urgent challenges in climate, nature, and circularity.

The first 13 change-makers are developing solutions using seaweed for packaging (Kelpi, UK); producing novel bioplastics from sugarcane (Bioworks, Japan); and creating fibre-based caps and lids as alternatives to plastic packaging tops (Blue Ocean Closures, Sweden).

Other companies in this initial grouping are start-ups from Brazil, the US, Estonia, France and Belgium.

And among these13 participants are two Cambridge companies: Sawston-based Pulpex is developing next generation recyclable paper bottles, and cleantech Neutreeno – based at CISL on Regent Street – has developed a digital system to help companies calculate and cut emissions in their supply chains.

Pulpex’s fibre-based bottle solution is plastic-free and manufactured from sustainably– sourced wood pulp which can be recycled in standard household recycling streams.

Pulpex was spun out of US-based premium drinks company Diageo in 2020 – the goal was to scale its plastic-free, recyclable fibre bottles innovation with major partners of the likes of Unilever and PepsiCo. The incorporation of Pulpex has proved to be a huge success. The now 50-strong company has already made waves, not least via a £62m Series D investment round led by the National Wealth Fund which closed in February 2025.

Managing director Scott Winston, noting that Pulpex’s customisable paper-based bottle is already in production at its Accelerator Park premises, told the Cambridge Independent: “Making a genuine impact on the challenge of delivering a sustainable answer to the 1.5 trillion glass and plastic bottles used per annum on the planet at present is no small task, but our team is fully focused on the goal.

“With the Series D investment supported through the National Wealth Fund and Scottish National Investment Bank we are completing our factory in Glasgow, now the ramp to billions of bottles being available over the coming few years truly begins and the focus expands to L’Oréal to gain the volumes they need to make a sustainability impact.”

What was the strategy behind joining the L’AcceleratOR programme?

“L’Oreal are recognised for advancing Green Sciences and have clearly signposted their need and intent in packaging to delivering their 2030 sustainability goals, [so] it became a natural fit to our working approach to join L’Accelerator and help drive their plastic reduction goals in the beauty product market for 2030.”

He adds: “With our production unit online we enable brands of any size to start their packaging transitions to fibre bottles from plastic and glass whilst simultaneously catalyse the global deployment of Pulpex technology via Manufacturers Under License.”

Neutreeno, meanwhile, has a headcount of 17 and closed an oversubscribed seed round last year.

“Neutreeno helps companies cut emissions and costs by identifying more efficient ways to manufacture products,” said Tom Bingham, marketing & communications manager. “We pinpoint inefficiencies in supply chains, particularly Scope 3 emissions that represent 75-95 per cent of a company’s carbon footprint.

“By using less materials and energy, manufacturers can dramatically reduce emissions and save money without changing their end products. People usually think being more sustainable is costly and complex. We make decarbonisation simple and profitable.”

And the motivation for joining L’AcceleratOR?

“L’Oréal’s commitment to sustainability and the scope of their supply chain transformation creates the ideal partnership to demonstrate our technology at scale,” replies Tom. “L’AcceleratOR will help us prove that engineering-led decarbonisation, not just better measurement, can deliver both real emissions mitigation and tangible business value in the beauty industry and beyond.”

Neutreeno has developed The Process Network, a system that combines 20 years of climate research data, covering 80 per cent of global industrial emissions and best efficiency practices.

“We’re empowering this with advanced AI and machine learning,” notes Tom. “It’s the most comprehensive system for tracking production efficiency while reducing both emissions and costs.”

For L’Oréal, the partnership with CISL is already yielding dividends.

For 115 years, L’Oréal Groupe has fulfilled the beauty aspirations of consumers around the world. It defines its approach to beauty as “essential, inclusive, ethical, generous and committed to social and environmental sustainability”.

“To accelerate sustainable solutions to market, we are being even more intentional and inclusive in our pursuit of partnerships through “L’AcceleratOR”, said Ezgi Barcenas, L’Oréal Groupe’s chief corporate responsibility officer.

“We are really energised to be co-designing the future of beauty with the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, and these 13 change makers.”

The progress being made during the first cohort’s induction has also been instructive for CISL.

“At CISL, we are proud to partner with L’Oréal, a group with a long track record of delivering disruptive innovation at scale”, said James Cole, chief innovation officer at CISL. “By identifying the most promising scalable solutions benefitting people, nature and climate, and elevating them to world stage, we are making a sustainable future not just a goal, but a reality.”

Prediction Market powered by

China has reportedly indicated willingness to approve NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 chips for import. The timing, conditions, and competitive dynamics present a complex situation for the company's China market strategy.

The Approval That Isn't Really an Approval

Jensen Huang is currently in Shanghai. China is ""poised to approve"" H200 imports. Questions remain about whether this represents full H200 capability or a version with performance caps, volume quotas, or end-use restrictions limiting commercial deployment.

Nvidia's Q3 FY2026 earnings call revealed China data center revenue grew sequentially on ""export-compliant copper products,"" but CFO Colette Kress noted it ""remains well below levels prior to the onset of export controls."" Nvidia has been selling export-compliant chips to China for two years, and China previously represented 20-30% of revenue share.

NVDA is up 0.77% over the past week while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged 12%. Nvidia's stock has shown limited movement following the news, while AMD has captured significant momentum.

AMD's Market Response

AMD's MI400 accelerators are shipping alongside Nvidia systems. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated Intel was ""caught off guard"" by AI data center demand and cannot meet supply.

AMD trades at 41x forward earnings with 60% YoY earnings growth and a PEG ratio of 0.56. Nvidia's forward P/E stands at 25x. The companies show different valuation metrics as the market assesses geopolitical factors.

The Geopolitical Landscape

China's approval of advanced chip imports occurs amid ongoing technology competition. Domestic alternatives include Alibaba's T-Head and Baidu's Kunlunxin processors.

Nvidia insiders have been active sellers. CEO Huang sold 9.9 million shares between October and December 2025. CFO Kress sold over 200,000 shares in the same window, with concentrated selling in mid-December around the approval timeline. No executives purchased stock during this period.

Market Response

The market's reaction shows uncertainty about whether China's H200 approval represents sustainable revenue opportunity. Insider selling activity, AMD's stock surge, and Nvidia's limited price movement have occurred alongside the approval news. Geopolitical tensions and China's regulatory stance remain variables in how this approval impacts Nvidia's business.

Data Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement

Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.

And no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that.

How grocery giants control who can sell food in your neighbourhood

Canada’s biggest grocery giants — including Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro — are using property law to control how other grocery stores, dollar stores, pharmacies and gas stations can compete with them, an investigation by CBC’s Marketplace has found.

Property controls are deals made between a land owner and retailer that restrict what kinds of businesses can operate nearby, and what the competitors are able to sell. The terms are negotiated to incentivize the business to open their store on the land.

Known in legal terms as restrictive covenants or exclusivity clauses, property controls are common across industries. In a plaza, for example, they could limit the number of veterinary offices or dental practices. While they aren’t unusual, there is criticism about their use in the grocery sector.

“These are not mom and pop shops,” said Jim Stanford, an economist and grocery industry critic. “They are not subject to the same competitive constraints as firms in other industries.”

Marketplace obtained legal documents for dozens of properties across Canada — locked behind opaque systems and paywalls — and found several property controls buried in lease agreements or even registered directly on property titles. The scope of the terms negotiated by grocery giants varied significantly from property to property.

While some contracts stipulate the giants cannot “unreasonably” withhold permission for competitors to open up or to sell food, others explicitly grant them any and all discretion.

For example, the property control attached to a Sobeys in Winnipeg states no one can sell food on the adjacent land unless Sobeys says so, and that permission can be withheld “unreasonably and arbitrarily.”

Meanwhile, a Metro property control in Waterloo, Ont., restricts what food products a Shoppers Drug Mart can sell in the same plaza and prohibits restaurants with a 50-seat capacity or more from opening within 61 metres of Metro’s store.

Metro and Sobeys have both denied that property controls are a barrier to competition, while Loblaws acknowledged last year that property controls restrict competition, but wouldn’t agree to eliminate all of them unless other major grocery retailers do the same.

Uber called out by service dog users fed up with ride rejections

Salome Solomon, who is legally blind, relies on two things to get around Ottawa: her guide dog, Zurich, and Uber.

But she says Canada’s dominant ride-hailing service keeps letting her down by failing to uphold her legal right to ride with a service animal.

Solomon, a frequent Uber user, says she was denied service around 20 times last year by drivers who refused to transport her guide dog. She has filed numerous complaints with the company, and says she’s now reaching her breaking point.

“Every rejection breaks you down, so, for me, it basically hits deep. It's like a dagger to my heart,” said Solomon, wiping away tears.

Under Canada's human rights legislation, people with disabilities have a legal right to travel with a service animal. Even so, rideshare denials remain an ongoing problem. A survey done by the advocacy group Guide Dogs for the Blind found that of the 185 U.S. and Canadian members surveyed, 83 per cent reported rideshare rejections in the first two months of 2023.

In line with Canadian legislation, Uber’s corporate policy states its drivers must accommodate service animals. But CBC’s Go Public interviewed several customers in Ontario who say they’ve been denied rides by Uber drivers within the past few months, because of their service dogs.

Uber Canada spokesperson Keerthana Rang says the company is committed to accessible service, and, over the past several years, has taken concrete steps to remedy the problem.

Efforts include an educational video, launched in 2024, that all of Uber's more than 100,000 drivers must watch. They also get periodic email reminders about their legal obligations, she said.

Rang added that drivers caught breaking the rules are barred from the ride-hailing app.

“We take this issue seriously,” she said. “We believe in equal transportation for all Canadians.”

Chinese EVs are coming to Canada. How soon will they be here? How much will they cost?

Buckle up! The electric vehicle market in this country is about to take a sharp turn.

Prime Minister Mark Carney is reopening Canada to Chinese-made EVs, lowering a 100 per cent tariff on imports, imposed in 2024, to six per cent.

There's demand for more affordable and climate-conscious EVs and, for an average customer, having Chinese EVs in the market means ""more choice"" and ""greater tech,"" said Max Morris, sales manager at Shift Electric Vehicles in Burlington, Ont.

But there has also been criticism of the deal with China from Canada’s automotive industry, saying it may put the domestic market on shakier ground.

China has shaken up the global EV landscape in recent years, offering more affordable cars, SUVs and other battery-powered and hybrid electric automobiles.

Chinese EVs can cost $10,000 to $15,000 less than those of similar size and range that are already popular in Canada.

While some are applauding the EV market opening up, others are raising other concerns about the safety and security of vehicles from companies tied to the Chinese government.

MDGC is comprised of a broad group of stakeholders from across Missouri’s agricultural community. A strong dairy industry benefits all involved — from producers and agribusinesses to local communities —

by creating jobs, supporting infrastructure and driving long-term economic growth.

Brandt brings decades of dairy experience to the organization, having spent his career working directly with dairy producers, industry organizations and agricultural leaders. His deep understanding of dairy operations, policy and producer needs positions MDGC for continued success as it works to grow and strengthen the state’s dairy industry.

“We are excited for the new direction of MDGC and the clarity, leadership and momentum this collaboration has brought to dairy economic development in Missouri,” Brandt said. “The new structure and website provides MDGC the tools to support our existing dairies, while looking for new opportunities to grow the sector.”

The new website, GrowMODairy.Org, showcases the benefits of Missouri dairy production with the goal of attracting new dairies and supporting existing dairies.

“Missouri offers a compelling combination of natural resources, economic advantages and processing infrastructure, making it a smart choice for dairy producers,” says Matt Amick, director of market development for Missouri Soybeans and MDGC board chairman. “For dairy producers looking to relocate or expand, Missouri has affordability, abundant feedstuffs and a supportive agricultural environment.”

The website provides deeper insights into Missouri’s dairy advantage. The site provides information on economic and industry development; government and regulatory agency contacts; technical assistance; and input procurement and processing.

Summary

Novo Nordisk was excessively punished by the market, trading at a significant discount to Eli Lilly despite robust fundamentals and global leadership in metabolic disease.

NVO’s global infrastructure, especially outside the U.S., and its oral GLP-1 program position it for long-term relevance as obesity pharmacotherapy expands worldwide.

Recent valuation divergence was more amplified by retail-driven narrative momentum than by fundamental business deterioration; the stock’s drop below $50 represented an overreaction.

Valuation discipline is critical—NVO offers opportunity at current levels, but reassessment is warranted if the price rises above $75 without substantial earnings expansion.

Quick Insights

NVO’s entrenched international infrastructure and decades-long relationships with health systems provide durable advantages, making it less U.S.-dependent and better positioned for global obesity pharmacotherapy expansion.

The oral semaglutide program could unlock mass-market adoption by removing injection barriers, potentially reaching tens of millions globally and generating multi-tens-of-billions in annual revenue even at lower price points.

If NVO rises to $75 without confirmed earnings expansion, the thesis changes; above that level, gradual reduction and redeployment are advised, emphasizing the need to avoid sentiment-driven overvaluation.

(IBM) as it prepares to release its quarterly financial results this week. The technology conglomerate is set to report on January 28, with the announcement serving as a pivotal moment for investor sentiment following recent share price volatility and amid a major strategic acquisition.

Recent regulatory filings from institutional investors reveal a notable lack of consensus regarding IBM's near-term prospects. Activity detailed in the latest 13F reports paints a picture of divided opinion. On one side, firms like Symphony Financial significantly reduced their holdings by approximately 30%, with First Citizens Bank & Trust also paring back its position.

Conversely, other major market participants have viewed the recent price movement as a buying opportunity. Global Assets Advisory aggressively expanded its stake by more than 33%, while CIBC Asset Management engaged in counter-cyclical purchasing. This investor disagreement unfolds against a backdrop of recent pressure on the stock. Shares closed Friday's session at 259.25 euros, marking a weekly decline of about 15 percent.

Strategic Acquisition Clears Key Obstacle

Beyond the quarterly figures, IBM's planned strategic expansion remains a central focus. The company's proposed $11 billion acquisition of the data-streaming platform Confluent has passed a significant milestone. A key U.S. antitrust waiting period expired on January 13, clearing a regulatory path for the deal to conclude by mid-2026. Market experts interpret this development as a positive signal for the company's strategic planning certainty.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Market Experts Maintain Bullish Outlook

Despite the stock's recent turbulence, analyst sentiment remains largely positive. Several investment firms have reaffirmed or raised their assessments in January. Analysts at Jefferies and Evercore ISI have increased their price targets, seeing potential for the stock to reach the $330 to $360 range. JPMorgan also confirmed its rating just ahead of the earnings release.

The immediate market focus is squarely on the fourth-quarter performance. Consensus estimates project earnings per share (EPS) to land between $4.28 and $4.31. Following an earnings beat in the third quarter, the upcoming report is seen as a critical test of whether IBM's growth narrative remains intact in the current economic environment.

The release on Wednesday, January 28, is expected to dictate the stock's short-term trajectory. Investors will scrutinize whether the company meets or exceeds ambitious profit targets and if management provides further clarity on the integration roadmap for Confluent.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2443682_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:02:04.710793

Parker-Hannifin has a three-year median payout ratio of 28% (where it is retaining 72% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like Parker-Hannifin is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.

Moreover, Parker-Hannifin is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years.

Missile solutions will then be spun off and taken public as a separate company in the second half of 2026.
After the initial public offering (IPO), the Department of Defense is expected to convert its preferred stock into common stock in the new company.
That's ""missile solutions"" -- although I presume L3 will come up with a catchier name for it once it's a stand-alone company.
The third company will be what remains of L3Harris after it's shed all its engines and motors businesses.","It's been a busy couple of weeks for L3Harris (LHX 0.29%), the defense contractor that transformed itself into a defense contractor-cum-space company when it bought Aerojet Rocketdyne back in 2022.

The excitement began on Jan. 5, when L3Harris announced it would reorganize its current four main business divisions into just three:

Space and mission systems (satellite and payload capabilities, including missile warning and defense, as well as maritime, air, special missions, and other global defense and civil government programs).

Communications and spectrum dominance (communications and electronic warfare).

Missile solutions (propulsion, hypersonics, and other advanced missile technologies).

The second shoe drops

One day later, L3 announced that private equity firm AE Industrial Partners will buy a 65% stake in L3's ""space propulsion and power systems business,"" which was part of the Aerojet Rocketdyne division before the aforementioned reorganization. Reclaiming the historic name Rocketdyne, this business has ""developed the upper-stage rocket engines used in national security, civil, and commercial missions for more than 60 years, as well as in-space propulsion, nuclear power and avionics assets."" In particular, Rocketdyne builds the R10 engine, which powers the second stage of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur rocket and NASA's Space Launch System.

L3Harris will retain a minority interest in Rocketdyne, but AE's investment is being characterized as an acquisition. So essentially, what we have here is L3 spinning off and selling its non-military rocket engine division to AE.

The plot thickens

L3Harris announced its latest big move just this past Tuesday. In what management termed ""a first-of-its-kind proposed partnership with the Department of War"" -- President Trump's name for the Department of Defense -- the company will accept a $1 billion investment, in the form of the purchase of preferred stock, in its missile solutions business, which it's also spinning off.

The investment part of this plan is expected to happen this quarter, the first quarter of 2026. Missile solutions will then be spun off and taken public as a separate company in the second half of 2026. After the initial public offering (IPO), the Department of Defense is expected to convert its preferred stock into common stock in the new company.

To be clear, we're talking about two separate businesses here. Rocketdyne, which builds non-military rocket engines for ULA and NASA, is the L3 division getting spun off and sold to AE Industrial. Missile solutions builds motors for military missiles such as the Patriot PAC-3, THAAD, Tomahawk, and the Standard Missile family of missiles -- and, despite being described as one of three L3 divisions that L3 is reorganizing just last week, it seems the missile solutions division is also being spun off.

And to make the situation even more crystal clear, L3 CEO Christopher Kubasik confirmed that once its missile solutions business IPOs, it will be a ""pure-play missile solutions provider"" with a mission to be part of America's ""Arsenal of Freedom.""

What this means for investors

What's the upshot for investors here? Clearly, big changes are afoot, and an investment in just L3Harris today could end up meaning you own three separate companies a few months from now -- so be careful if that's not your intent.

One of these companies will produce engines for non-military rockets. That's Rocketdyne.

Another will produce motors for military missiles. That's ""missile solutions"" -- although I presume L3 will come up with a catchier name for it once it's a stand-alone company.

The third company will be what remains of L3Harris after it's shed all its engines and motors businesses. What remains of L3 will include two businesses: space and mission systems, and communications and spectrum dominance.

It's not 100% clear at this point how big any of these businesses will be, or which specific product lines they will take with them or keep. But reviewing the latest data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, I'm guessing is that Rocketdyne and the missile solutions business will be dividing up approximately $9.3 billion in annual revenue and a little more than $1.1 billion in operating profit, while rump L3Harris will keep about $12.3 billion in business, with about $2.2 billion in operating profit. When all's said and done, L3Harris should come out of this restructuring significantly smaller, but also considerably more profitable, after shedding its engine businesses.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851601%2Fdelta-iv-heavy-rocket-launch-at-night.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-25 11:02:19.647696

The Hype is Real: S&P Global Inc on TikTok and Beyond

Here’s the funny part: S&P Global doesn’t trend the way Tesla, Nvidia, or the latest crypto pump does. It’s not a meme. It’s not a ""to the moon"" moment. But on finance TikTok and YouTube, the stock keeps popping up in content around ""sleep-well"" compounders, boring-but-rich portfolios, and long-term dividend plays.

Creators who are deep into fundamentals and not just chasing quick spikes are calling out S&P Global as one of those stocks that just quietly grinds higher over time. Think: recurring revenue, essential data, and a business that huge banks, funds, and corporations literally rely on to function.

Is it viral in the ""everyone’s talking about it"" way? Not really. Is it viral in the ""smart money keeps mentioning it"" way? Absolutely.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

S&P Global Inc is not a gadget, not a consumer app, not something you download. It’s the company behind the credit ratings, market indices, and financial data that fuel the money world. Here are three core things you actually need to know:

1. It owns some of the most powerful brands in finance

S&P Global is the name behind the S&P 500 index that basically everyone uses to track the US stock market. Its credit ratings business is one of the go-to sources when governments and corporations borrow money. Its data and analytics tools feed traders, banks, asset managers, and corporations with info they literally cannot function without.

Translation: this is not some nice-to-have subscription service. It’s infrastructure-level finance. When you’re embedded this deep, you don’t just disappear when trends shift.

2. It’s a recurring-revenue machine

Instead of chasing one-off sales, S&P Global leans on recurring contracts, subscriptions, and long-term relationships. That means more predictable cash flow and less ""boom and bust"" drama. The business sells information, analytics, benchmarks, and ratings that companies and investors need constantly, not just once.

For you as an investor, that kind of business model usually means more stability and more room for long-term growth, not just hype-driven spikes.

3. It’s riding the data and analytics megatrend

The world is drowning in data, but the winners are the companies that can structure it, verify it, and sell it in a way that matters for big money decisions. S&P Global plays right in that lane.

From climate and ESG data to risk analytics, indices, and real-time market insights, S&P Global is leaning into the whole ""data is the new oil"" wave, but for serious institutional money. It’s not a flashy AI story, but it absolutely taps into the same forces that are driving the tech boom.

S&P Global Inc vs. The Competition

You can’t talk about S&P Global without mentioning its biggest rival: Moody’s.

Both companies live in the same world: credit ratings, research, risk analysis, and financial data. If you’re building a portfolio of ""financial infrastructure"" stocks, these two are usually side by side on the list.

S&P Global’s edge

S&P doesn’t just do ratings. It owns major indices and market benchmarks, which act like a toll booth every time investors use products linked to those benchmarks. It also leans heavily into broader market and sector data and has been expanding into more analytics and workflow tools.

Moody’s edge

Moody’s is laser-focused on ratings and risk analytics. It’s also a strong compounder and widely respected, but it doesn’t have the same iconic index footprint as S&P Global.

Who wins the clout war?

On pure name recognition among everyday investors, S&P Global wins because of the S&P 500 brand. On TikTok and YouTube, you’ll often see people mention Moody’s in the same breath, but the ""S&P"" label just hits different because it’s literally printed on charts, ETFs, and financial news every single day.

In terms of vibe, S&P Global feels like the more diversified, platform-style play, while Moody’s feels like the highly focused specialist. If you’re chasing broad data and index exposure, S&P Global usually gets the nod.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Here’s the real talk.

Is it worth the hype?

S&P Global isn’t meme-stock hype. It’s ""grown-up money"" hype. The kind of stock that long-term investors flex when they show how their portfolios aged well over years, not weeks.

The clout doesn’t come from viral price spikes. It comes from consistency, brand power, and the fact that this company is wired into the plumbing of global finance. If you’re after a must-have, blue-chip style data name rather than a quick flip, S&P Global is absolutely in that conversation.

Price-performance: is it a no-brainer?

That depends on how you think about price. S&P Global often trades at a premium because of its quality, its dominant position, and its recurring revenue model. You’re not buying it because it’s cheap on a chart. You’re buying it because it’s built like a long-term compounder.

For short-term traders, that premium can feel painful. For long-term investors, it can be the cost of admission to a high-quality franchise. It’s not a guaranteed win, but it’s also not some speculative gamble on an unproven business.

Game-changer or total flop?

In your portfolio, S&P Global is more ""foundation"" than ""lottery ticket."" It’s a game-changer in the sense that its business model quietly supports the whole market. As a stock, it’s more likely to be a steady wealth-builder than a viral rocket ship.

So is it a cop or drop? For short-term hype-chasers, probably a drop. For long-term, fundamentals-first investors who want exposure to financial data and indices, it looks a lot more like a cop – if you’re cool with paying up for quality and riding it out.

As always: this is not financial advice. Do your own research before you throw money at any ticker.

The Business Side: SPGI

Now let’s zoom in on the actual stock: SPGI, tied to ISIN US78409V1044.

Using live market data from multiple sources, the latest available quote for SPGI as of the most recent trading session shows the last close price, not an intraday move, because real-time streaming data is not accessible here. That means you should always double-check the live price on your own before buying or selling.

What stands out when you look at SPGI over time is how the market treats it: this is typically priced like a high-quality growth compounder, not a bargain-bin value stock. The market is effectively saying, ""We believe this company will keep growing, keep printing cash, and keep being essential.""

Investors generally watch a few key angles with SPGI:

1. Revenue growth and margins

Because S&P Global sells high-value data and analytics, the focus is on how fast that revenue is growing and how strong the profit margins stay. The more it leans into scalable digital products, the better its margin story tends to look.

2. Cycles in credit and capital markets

When companies and governments issue more debt, the ratings business gets busy. When markets are active, data and indices get even more use. So while S&P Global is built on recurring revenue, parts of the business still move with financial cycles. You’ll see that reflected in how the stock trades around big macro headlines.

3. Competition and regulation

As one of the dominant players in ratings and benchmarks, S&P Global always has a target on its back from regulators and competitors. Any major shift in how ratings are used, how benchmarks are managed, or how data is regulated can impact the story. That’s part of the risk baked into the ticker.

So where does that leave you?

If your watchlist is full of AI demos, EV startups, and small-cap gambles, SPGI is the opposite energy: boring on the surface, quietly powerful underneath. You’re not buying a trend. You’re buying a core piece of how markets actually run.

Real talk: if you want your portfolio to have at least one ""adult in the room"" stock that lives in the financial infrastructure space, SPGI deserves a hard look. If you only want fast pumps and viral charts, this probably won’t scratch that itch – but the people quietly holding it might be the ones still winning in ten years.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405049_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 08:59:25.697336

Flutter Entertainment (FLUT) Is Down 7.2% After Tax And Regulatory Pressures Intensify - Has The Bull Case Changed?

January 25, 2026

Flutter Entertainment has faced a series of developments, including the appointment of Best Buy chairman David Kenny as a future independent non-executive director, regulatory scrutiny culminating in a £2 million social responsibility settlement, and growing concern over UK plans to raise gambling taxes.

These governance and regulatory shifts, combined with criticism of recent management performance, are reshaping how analysts and investors evaluate Flutter’s long-term positioning in global betting and gaming.

We’ll now examine how concerns over UK gambling tax increases and regulatory pressure are influencing Flutter Entertainment’s investment narrative.

The end of cancer? These like cancer and Alzheimer's.

What Is Flutter Entertainment's Investment Narrative?

For Flutter to make sense in a portfolio, you need to believe in its ability to turn strong global betting and gaming positions into sustainable profits despite current missteps. The stock has sold off hard in recent months even though consensus targets still sit well above the current price, suggesting the market is wrestling with near term earnings pressure, governance questions and regulatory risk rather than writing off the business outright. The UK tax proposals and the £2 million settlement add to that regulatory overhang, while the analyst downgrades point to lower conviction around short term upside. At the same time, the refreshed board, including the incoming appointment of David Kenny, hints at a more assertive oversight of management execution and US listing ambitions, which could become a key catalyst if performance stabilises.

However, the UK regulatory direction and tax burden could have a bigger impact than many expect. Despite retreating, Flutter Entertainment's shares might still be trading above their fair value and there could be some more downside. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Seven members of the Simply Wall St Community see fair value anywhere from about US$160 to a very large figure near US$1,000, underlining just how far opinions can stretch when regulatory risk, recent downgrades and governance changes all sit in the mix; it is worth weighing several of these perspectives before deciding how much of Flutter’s current uncertainty you are comfortable with.

Nichanian will be succeeded by , 36, the first lady of color to direct a major Pairs fashion house. She will make her debut collection one year from now for Hermès, the most profitable luxury label in the world, bar none.

In a remarkable career, the 71-year-old Nichanian has guided the men’s division of the classiest brand of them all for nearly two generations. Her debut collection for the house dates to 1988. Unthinkable nowadays that anyone could have such staying power when the career expectancy of most fashion designers is to become a hired gun at a name brand for a decade at most.

Instead, Véronique Nichanian deservedly kept her position since 1988, when she was appointed by Hermès. Sending out one hit collection after another until she decided at her own behest, apparently, to take her retirement.

These clothes were an excellent way to exit. Full of quiet luxury, but quiet with panache - like the wonderful tricks she played on lapels. Placing a single strip of leather behind multiple lapels, whether on topcoats, mohair suits, or super tuxedoes, adding zest with a deft hand.

Her sense of raffish elegance was exceptional, as was her sense of triumph. At the finale, there was a brilliant flourish of three naval or black crocodile coats and suits that one dreamed of owning. The whole show worn by a multi-racial cast.

Presented before a front row packed full of admirers, including Sir , Usher, actors James McAvoy and Chace Crawford, and rapper Travis Scott before drama rock like ""Bed Stuy ’79"" by Vanessa Van Ness.

At the end, everyone was on their feet, applauding, cheering, yelling, stamping the parquet. As Nichanian took an extended tour of the three runways in the Palais Brongniart.

Plug Power Aktie Chart

Bald kommt es zum Schwur

Die Gesamtbilanz der Woche ist immer noch ausgesprochen erfreulich, zumindest aus Sicht der bestehenden Aktionäre. In den vergangenen fünf Tagen ging es um knapp 12 Prozent aufwärts. Damit hat sich die Plug Power im Laufe des bisherigen Jahres auf 31,40 Prozent nach oben geschoben. Das ist relativ erstaunlich. Denn die neue Woche hat einen wichtigen Termin parat:

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Plug Power?

Das Papier wird sich sicherlich massiv bewegen. Am 29. Januar findet eine außerordentliche Aktionärsversammlung statt. Dann geht es um die Erhöhung des Grundkapitals. Sollte dieser Beschluss gefasst werden, dann wird das amerikanischen Unternehmen neue Aktien emittieren.

Dies verwässert den Kurs alter Aktien, verbessert aber die finanzielle Basis. Wie das Unternehmen dann weiter bewertet wird, hängt davon ab, welchen Umstand die Börsen höher bewerten. Einen ersten Aufschlag hat die vergangene Woche ja bereits gebracht.

Sollte es weiter nach oben gehen, würden sich zumindest Analysten sicherlich nicht überrascht zeigen. Die gehen derzeit immer noch davon aus, dass die Kurse deutlich steigen können. Die Kursziele sind oberhalb der aktuellen Bewertungen. Die neue Woche wird sehr herausfordernd und spannend, am 29. Januar entscheidet sich viel.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was spotted by many local residents after arriving in Shanghai on Friday, according to ThePaper.cn, as the US chip giant faces fierce competition from local rivals. Chinese experts said Huang’s visit is aimed at projecting a “China-friendly” image and boosting morale among local employees, while also seeking to engage Chinese authorities and key clients in an effort to secure large buyers capable of making prompt payments for H200 chips.

On Saturday, Huang was seen visiting the Rushan Road local vegetable market in Shanghai’s Lujiazui area, where he sampled and bought fruits and handed out New Year red envelopes to several vendors, according to ThePaper.cn.

Huang attended an Nvidia event on Saturday, according to posts by some users on Chinese lifestyle-sharing platform Xiaohongshu, who claimed the oranges he bought at a local wet market were intended to be handed out to employees at the company’s annual gathering.

Ma Jihua, a veteran industry observer, told the Global Times that that Huang’s increasingly frequent visits to China in recent years — whether wearing traditional Chinese attire or visiting local markets — reflect a carefully calibrated form of expression aimed at conveying a more China-friendly image while navigating political sensitivities in the US, a practice also seen in visits by other US technology executives.

Ma added that Huang’s latest trip is widely viewed as an effort to engage Chinese authorities and key customers, with the aim of identifying large buyers able to move forward quickly on purchases of H200 chips.

After his Shanghai trip, Huang is set to travel to Beijing, Shenzhen and the island of Taiwan, according to Reuters, citing a person familiar with the issue.

Huang traveled to China at least three times in 2025 and met with China’s commerce minister in July, and returned again at the start of 2026. Experts said his repeated visits highlight the importance he places on the Chinese market and his hope to maintain stable and constructive trade engagement with China.

Zhou Mi, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times that Huang’s visits to China around Nvidia’s New Year events have become a routine, especially as Nvidia’s position has grown more sensitive amid a complex external environment. Huang has repeatedly signaled his desire to stay engaged with the China market. Zhou noted that this trip is primarily aimed at boosting morale within Nvidia’s China team, reassuring staff and partners, and gathering first-hand feedback on market demand to help guide the company’s future development.

Zhou added that the H200 chip is another key issue, as China has compliance and security concerns that Nvidia needs to address. He said that strong computing performance alone is not enough if related risks remain unresolved, and that meeting regulatory and compliance requirements is essential. Given the strong appeal of the China market, how Nvidia responds to these concerns will be critical to its ability to pursue stable, long-term development in China.

The US administration in January cleared sales of Nvidia's H200 chips, one of its most advanced products, while taking a 25 percent government cut from those sales, according to the BBC.

However, due to the deeply rooted anxiety held by some US politicians about China's progress in high-tech sectors, the US has displayed a contradictory approach toward exports of high-end chips to China.

On Wednesday, a US House committee focused on foreign affairs approved bipartisan legislation calling for arms-sale-style congressional oversight of advanced AI chip exports, Bloomberg reported.

According to Bloomberg, under the legislation, the administration would be required to notify Congress of advanced AI chip sales before they are approved, giving lawmakers the power to review and block export licenses to China, Russia, Iran and other so-called adversaries through a joint resolution.

On January 15, in response to a question regarding that US President Donald Trump said earlier that the US government would approve Nvidia H200 AI chip sales to China and would collect a roughly 25 percent fee on the chip sales, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China has repeatedly made its position clear on US chip exports to China and related tariff issues.

Commenting on reports that the Chinese government has told some technology companies it would approve purchases of H200 chips only under special circumstances, He Yongqian, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce, said on Thursday, “I am not aware of the situation you mentioned. ”

While China's semiconductor industry welcomes positive China-US exchanges in technological innovation and industrial development in line with both sides' regulations, it must remain highly vigilant regarding the US' erratic stance on exports of high-end chips, Wei Shaojun, a deputy head of the China Semiconductor Industry Association, told the Global Times in a recent exclusive interview.

Wei pointed out, the US’ stance – alternately easing restrictions and applying pressure on high-end chips – makes it difficult for others to discern its true strategic intentions: Is the recent ""relaxation"" a genuine signal to promote positive interaction, or is it a new tactic aimed at disrupting our development pace and lulling us into complacency?

“China's semiconductor industry must remain highly vigilant toward this, resolutely refuse to be deceived by superficial appearances, and, even more importantly, must not waver in its confidence and determination to persist on the path of indigenous development in advanced process technologies and other key areas,” Wei said.

China welcomes all foreign companies, including Nvidia, to deepen their presence in the Chinese market, but core concerns on China’s side must also be addressed by Nvidia for cooperation to be sustainable, experts said.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2026/2026-01-25/fd67ba7d-e1df-416a-ab51-490558fe5930.jpeg,N,,2026-01-25 01:58:56.579262

India's highest court has delivered a significant verdict impacting foreign investment structures, reversing a Delhi High Court judgment that had favored Tiger Global. The Supreme Court's decision aligns with the Authority for Advance Ruling's initial stance, classifying Tiger Global's 2018 sale of shares in Flipkart Singapore to Walmart as a transaction designed to circumvent tax obligations. This ruling is the first major Supreme Court interpretation to apply India's General Anti Avoidance Rules (GAAR) to structures established prior to the legislation's enactment.

GAAR's Evolving Frontier

Implemented on April 1, 2017, India's GAAR provisions have seen their effective scope significantly broadened by this judgment. The Supreme Court has signaled that the grandfathering provisions, intended to protect investments made before 2017, do not shield the underlying transactional structures from scrutiny if their primary purpose was tax avoidance. This challenges the presumption that investments predating GAAR were immune to challenges based on avoidance. The court clarified that tax authorities can now reject applications for advance rulings based on a prima facie assessment that a transaction was designed to avoid taxes, even without a conclusive finding.

Substance Over Form Prevails

The Supreme Court's decision centers on the principle of economic substance over legal form. Investigations revealed that Tiger Global, registered in Mauritius, was controlled by a single individual from the United States. The entity functioned as a conduit for investments made between 2011 and 2014 into Flipkart India via Flipkart Singapore. Critically, the value of Flipkart Singapore's shares was derived solely from Indian assets, making the transaction subject to indirect transfer provisions under Indian tax law. The court determined that the investment structure was engineered to ensure no tax liability would arise in any jurisdiction upon future share sales, thereby constituting an impermissible tax avoidance arrangement.

Tax Treaty Scrutiny Intensifies

This ruling marks a notable shift in India's tax jurisprudence, moving away from a strict reliance on documentation like Tax Residency Certificates (TRCs) to determine eligibility for treaty benefits. The judgment implies that while a TRC is important, tax authorities can delve deeper into the factual matrix of a case to ascertain an entity's true residency status and the substance of its operations. The emphasis on GAAR and economic substance suggests that treaty benefits, particularly under agreements like the India-Mauritius Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, may be denied for transactions found to be abusive. This underscores India's commitment to protecting its tax base and asserting its fiscal sovereignty.

Market Resonance for Investors

The verdict introduces a more rigorous regulatory environment for foreign investors operating in India. While established entities such as Walmart Inc. (WMT), which boasts a market capitalization of approximately $465 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio around 28.1 as of January 24, 2026, function within a broad financial ecosystem, this ruling highlights the need for verifiable economic substance in all inbound investments. The trend indicates that tax planning strategies must be intrinsically linked to genuine commercial objectives to avoid challenges from tax authorities. Investors must now ensure that their structuring of investments not only adheres to legal requirements but also demonstrates tangible economic rationale to mitigate risks of prolonged tax disputes.",https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6974a35e2f8dded575717f8a_1769251728424.jpeg,N,,2026-01-25 00:58:43.360594

LAVAL — Maureen Murphy scored twice as the Montreal Victoire defeated the Ottawa Charge 3-1 in front of a sold-out crowd at Place Bell on Saturday afternoon.

Ann-Renee Desbiens made 23 saves for the Victoire (6-3-0-5), who moved into second place in the Professional Women’s Hockey League with the win. Abby Roque added an empty-net goal.

Faduza Kadirova scored for the Charge (3-5-0-7). Gwyneth Philips made 33 saves.

Montreal opened the scoring 12:52 into the first period.

Amanda Boulier caused a turnover at the Montreal blue-line, leading to a two-on-one. Hayley Scamurra brought the puck in, and while her shot was stopped by Philips, Murphy put away the rebound after trailing the play.

Murphy scored her second of the game on the power play with 14.4 seconds left in the first when she wired a one-timer from the left face-off circle into the top corner of the net off of a pass from Erin Ambrose.

Ottawa appeared to cut the deficit in the first half of the second period, but the play was ruled a no goal because of incidental contact with Desbiens before the puck crossing the line.

With 5:46 remaining in the second period, Ottawa finally got on the board when a Michela Cava shot from the top of the slot hit off of Kadirova to make it 2-1.

The Charge pulled their goaltender with just over two minutes left in regulation to try and find the tying goal.

Takeaways

Victoire: Desbiens was once again outstanding for Montreal. She has yet to allow more than two goals in a game, and has allowed one or fewer goals in seven of her 12 starts this season.

Charge: Ottawa’s only two regulation losses in their last nine games have come against Montreal at Place Bell, the team they entered the game chasing for the league’s final playoff spot.

Key Moment

Desbiens stopped Emily Clark’s breakway early in the second period that was among the better saves she made in what turned out to be a one-goal game before the empty-net goal.

Key Stat

Ottawa had the league’s best power play entering the game, but the Victoire held them without a goal in four opportunities.

Up Next

Victoire: Host the Toronto Sceptres on Wednesday.

Charge: Host the Seattle Torrent on Wednesday.

Team Green is known to be the only customer of the A16 process, and according to reports, Jensen already has sufficient chip supply from TSMC, credited to long-term contracts.

Not just NVIDIA, but AMD also made a massive bet by switching to TSMC, especially since the company had its own fab network, which later spun out as GlobalFoundries. Speaking with Jodi Shelton, AMD's CEO Lisa Su did reveal that putting their trust in TSMC was ""one of the major decisions"" made under her leadership, and by the looks of it, this eventually turned out to be a huge win for AMD, in terms of gaining client and server market share.

ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-24 19:12:38+00:00,Fortune,Why Mark Zuckerberg is positioning Meta as an AI infrastructure giant - Fortune,Sharon Goldman,,,,,https://fortune.com/2026/01/24/meta-compute-zuckerberg-ai-infrastructure-giant-data-center/,"A growing perception that Meta is playing catch-up For some Meta-watchers, the Meta Compute announcement was puzzling.
After all, Meta is already an AI infrastructure giant.
Powell McCormick is also a key strategic hire for the Meta Compute effort, Umesh Padval, an experienced investor and board member, told Fortune.
In a social media post shared the day Meta Compute was announced, “Big Short” investor Michael Burry wrote: “Meta gives in, throwing away its one saving grace.
But since Meta has already poured tens of billions into AI data centers and signaled hundreds of billions more in long-term infrastructure commitments, it looks like that train left the station long ago.","The new organization is designed to secure the massive amounts of computing power—measured in gigawatts, each of which could power hundreds of thousands of homes—needed for Meta’s drive to build AI models that lead to “superintelligence.”

“Meta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time,” Zuckerberg wrote. “How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage.”

Under the new structure, Zuckerberg said longtime Meta executive Santosh Janardhan will continue to run the company’s technical architecture, software, custom chips, and the day-to-day building and operation of Meta’s vast data center network. Meanwhile, Daniel Gross—one of Zuckerberg’s high-profile AI hires from last summer, who was previously cofounder of Safe Superintelligence with former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever—will lead a new group focused on the long game: how much computing power Meta will need years from now, where it should be built, how to secure scarce chips and energy, and how to model the business impact of those bets.

Zuckerberg also announced a new Meta president and vice chair, Dina Powell McCormick, to work on developing partnerships with governments to finance and deploy data centers around the world. She was previously deputy national security advisor for strategy to President Trump.

A growing perception that Meta is playing catch-up

For some Meta-watchers, the Meta Compute announcement was puzzling. After all, Meta is already an AI infrastructure giant. It has been a year since the company broke ground on its Hyperion site—a 4-million-square-foot data center campus in northeast Louisiana that Zuckerberg famously told President Trump was roughly comparable to the size of lower Manhattan. Why, then, did Meta suddenly need to declare a new top-level organization to do what it already appears to be doing at historic scale?

“This was kind of a head scratcher, I didn’t understand it at first,” said Patrick Moorhead, founder and chief analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. He suggested the message about Meta Compute was really meant for investors and employees, signaling that Meta remains a serious contender in a club led by Microsoft, Google, Oracle, OpenAI, and xAI. “It’s Meta saying, ‘Here is our strategy to roll this out,’” he said.

Rick Pederson of Bow River Capital agreed that the announcement responds to a growing perception among market analysts that Meta is playing catch-up with Google and OpenAI in the AI arms race.

“It was a way to discuss their focus, their intentionality surrounding the build-out of AI, computational capacity and infrastructure,” he said. “I would imagine that the other major hyperscalers have organizations something like this. But he took the opportunity to define it.” Even though the company spent over $70 billion on AI infrastructure last year and plans to spend another $600 billion in the next two years, Google and OpenAI are spending at least that amount, he added. “So I think this gave Zuckerberg a chance to talk about not just the emphasis, but also how they’re going to do it.”

Doubling down on infrastructure as an investment portfolio

Some experts said they are not at all surprised by the move to announce Meta Compute. “Meta is doubling down on infrastructure as an investment portfolio rather than simply a cost center,” said Lane Dilg, former head of infrastructure policy at OpenAI and founder of boutique advisory firm Apeiro.

As the AI boom accelerates, Meta no longer sees data centers, GPUs, power contracts, and custom chips as mere plumbing for its products. It treats them as strategic assets—more like a capital allocator than a tech company. In effect, Dilg said, Meta is positioning itself not just against other hyperscalers, but against the world’s most sophisticated investment platforms.

In that landscape, she explained, choosing Daniel Gross to co-lead the initiative makes sense. “Gross’s experience building AI-native and agentic platforms matters, paired with his compute expertise,” she said, pointing to the supercomputer he built with NFDG coinvestor Nat Friedman—now Meta’s head of products. Their effort became the Andromeda Cluster, a network of computing stockpiles totaling more than 4,000 GPUs, which they made available to their portfolio companies at below-market rates.

Gross has dropped hints about his own recruiting push for Meta Compute, saying in a recent post on X that he is hiring people with backgrounds in “deep learning, supply chains, commodities, semiconductors, sovereigns, energy, Excel, prediction markets, monitoring situations, etc.” This suggests Meta is preparing to hedge against volatility in power and hardware costs—and to make long-term bets shaped not just by technology, but by energy markets, supply chains, and geopolitics.

Powell McCormick is also a key strategic hire for the Meta Compute effort, Umesh Padval, an experienced investor and board member, told Fortune. “Hyperscalers are now focused on how to get power and are investing in power projects financed by cash and debt,” he said. “With her banking and political background, she would work with the Meta data center group to finance and get approvals to enable faster building of the compute capacity.”

Critics say Meta’s capital-intensive model would drag down returns

Not all are supportive of Meta’s move, however. In a social media post shared the day Meta Compute was announced, “Big Short” investor Michael Burry wrote: “Meta gives in, throwing away its one saving grace. Watch ROIC crash.” Burry’s warning reflects a fear that Meta is abandoning its ability to generate enormous profits without sinking vast sums into physical infrastructure. By embracing gigawatt-scale data centers, he argues, Meta is shifting toward a far more capital-intensive model—one that could drag down returns and make the company look more like a utility.

But since Meta has already poured tens of billions into AI data centers and signaled hundreds of billions more in long-term infrastructure commitments, it looks like that train left the station long ago.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2235448143.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-24 15:02:11.779934

Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY 0.53%) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.37%) are healthcare leaders that are also using AI. And there could be more advances from here for both the companies and their shareholders.

Bristol Myers Squibb teams up with Microsoft

Bristol Myers Squibb is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. Its primary focus is on cardiovascular, cancer, and immune disorders. The company just announced a partnership with Microsoft (MSFT +3.45%), the third-largest component of the S&P 500 index.

Microsoft's imaging technology is used in 80% of U.S. hospitals. By pairing these systems with Bristol Myers Squibb's expertise in oncology and drug delivery, the two companies hope to create an AI-enabled workflow that leads to earlier diagnosis of lung cancer and a clearer path toward treatment.

In some ways, this is a small event, but it highlights the value AI can offer in assisting medical professionals in identifying and treating illness. And if it is successful, it seems highly likely that Bristol Myers Squibb will attempt to expand the effort to additional indications.

Intuitive Surgical is just getting started

Intuitive Surgical is a stock that only aggressive growth investors should consider right now. The P/E ratio is a lofty 70. However, the company is still growing very quickly, noting that the number of da Vinci surgical robots installed in 2025 was up roughly 13% from 2024. Meanwhile, the number of surgeries using one of the company's robots rose 19%. So not only is there very strong demand for the robots, but there's even stronger end-market demand for robotic surgery.

(NYSE:UBER) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi once stressed the importance of embracing cryptocurrencies for practical purposes rather than as a “store of value.”

Stablecoins Over Bitcoin?

At the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on June 6, 2025, Khosrowshahi called Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) a “proven commodity” but said he finds crypto’s “instantiation” offers more practical benefits.

“I do think that stablecoin is quite promising, especially for global companies that are moving money around globally, to create a mechanism for us to essentially reduce costs,” he said.

At the time, Khosrowshahi said that the company was in the “study phase” for enabling cross-border stablecoin payments, calling it a “super interesting” proposition.

The Countdown: When Will Uber Go Crypto?

This was not the first time Khosrowshahi has voiced such considerations.

Speaking to CNBC in 2021, he said the company is “going to look into” Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for transactions. A year later, in 2022, he said that Uber is “absolutely” going to accept cryptocurrency for payments at some point in the future.

Meanwhile, seven months have passed since his latest remark, but the mobility giant has yet to implement cryptocurrencies as a payment option.

Uber didn’t immediately return Benzinga’s request for comment.

Are Stablecoins The Future Of Transactions?

Interestingly, Uber was among the early participants in the Diem Association, formerly Libra, joining in 2019 to support Meta Platforms‘ (NASDAQ:META) now-defunct stablecoin initiative for global payments.

A 2025 report by Grayscale found stablecoins, including USDC (CRYPTO: USDC), were facilitating nearly $800 billion in digital transactions each month, positioning themselves as credible challengers to traditional payment networks like Visa (NYSE:V).

Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $89,963.99, up 0.71% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Shares of Uber rose 0.22% in after-hours trading after closing 0.65% higher at $84.26 during Wednesday’s regular trading session. Year-to-date, the stock has gained over 3%.

The stock maintains a weaker price trend over the short, medium, and long terms, with Growth as its strongest category, according to Benzinga’s Edge Stock Rankings.

Though BRS working president K T Rama Rao and his cousin – former minister T Harish Rao are trying to brush it aside as a “lottapeesu case” (silly and frivolous case), sources in the party said the leadership is feeling the noose tightened around it.

According to the latest information from the party sources, KTR and Harish Rao, who were grilled by the SIT for seven hours each, were clearly that the investigators might even summon party president and former chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for questioning, adding to the unease within the party.

The leadership is reportedly keen on formulating a coordinated response to the investigation and the political narrative emerging around it.

On Saturday, KTR and Harish Rao rushed to KCR’s Erravelli farmhouse to discuss the way out, in the event of the phone tapping case turns serious.

Apparently, the BRS leadership is trying to divert the attention of the people from the tapping issue. KTR has repeatedly alleged that he is being subjected to “character assassination,” claiming that baseless insinuations were spread linking him to film personalities.

“But he seems to have forgotten that social media platforms aligned with BRS allegedly carried defamatory reports targeting a woman IAS officer, which only indicate his double standards,” an analyst said.

Another BRS leader and former IPS officer R S Praveen Kumar tried to defend the telephone tapping done during the BRS regime, saying it is a common practice and not a crime.

He pointed out that even present SIT chief Sajjannar and DGP Shivadhar Reddy had indulged in tapping of opposition leaders’ phones during the infamous cash-for-vote scam.

On the other hand, Harish Rao directly resorted to intimidate the investigating officers warning them that they would have to face the music, once the BRS returns to power.

The Telangana Police Officers’ Association subsequently warned political leaders against undermining or threatening legally constituted investigations.

The BRS leaders are also trying to play down the investigation, saying the investigators had asked meaningless questions and in fact, they counter-questioned the SIT effectively during interrogation.

Investigators, however, maintain that all statements and evidence—including alleged proof of phone tapping—have been officially recorded and will be assessed strictly within the legal framework.

“All these attempts show that the BRS leaders are in a state of panic as the investigation is taking a serious turn with every passing day,” sources said.",https://www.greatandhra.com/newphotos11/ktr_harish21769260919.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 13:00:43.534896

The health system operates 11 hospitals across Maryland, and forecasts call for a foot or more of snow in some areas Saturday night into Monday morning.
“Hospitals never close, even in extreme weather,” Treber tells Chief Healthcare Executive®.

But the planning also involves coordinating with local and state emergency management teams, weighing supplies, and dealing with road closures and other transportation delays. The National Weather Service projects cities in the Northeast could get one to two feet of snow, and the massive weather system is likely to affect most Americans east of the Rocky Mountains.

Meghan Treber, chief preparedness officer of the University of Maryland Medical System, has been working to coordinate readiness across the organization. The health system operates 11 hospitals across Maryland, and forecasts call for a foot or more of snow in some areas Saturday night into Monday morning.

Some of the system’s hospitals serve areas of several counties where they are the only facility providing acute care, she says.

“Hospitals never close, even in extreme weather,” Treber tells Chief Healthcare Executive®. “So our job as healthcare emergency managers is to anticipate those disruptions and then put layers of protection in place so patients can continue to receive safe care, and our staff can remain safe delivering that care.”

It’s plenty of work to staff and supply those hospitals, but the health system operates scores of other facilities. The system’s service area includes the city of Baltimore, surrounding suburbs and rural communities.

“We have an urgent care network. Our hospitals include two trauma centers. We have outpatient surgical centers and more than 340 care locations across the state,” she says. “Our entire health system is vast and serves quite a large swath of the state, all of which is going to experience the storm in a slightly different way.”

Ensuring staffing

Treber says planning for the storm began several days ago. The system began planning early to ensure hospitals had enough doctors, nurses and other staff, since the storm could affect travel into Monday.

“We plan early to ensure that we have adequate staffing for multiple days, not just for the storm itself, and that looks like coordinating so essential staff can arrive early and stay on site if needed. We provide sleeping arrangements where it's possible, and meals on site,” Treber says.

The health system also has booked rooms at local hotels within walking distance of its facilities for staff who won’t be able to get home.

Treber says plans also go beyond staff who drive to work. Plans include the possibility of public transportation services being suspended due to the weather.

If the snow total reaches forecasts, “I would absolutely expect that there will be some impact to public transportation, whether it's a full shutdown or a restriction of lines,” Treber says.

Planning for patients

The system’s hospitals began looking at which patients could go home before the storm.

“What we are trying to do is make sure that we are reviewing all of the patients that we have in our hospital and identifying the patients who can be safely discharged to home before the storm hits, because it will be very challenging to get people discharged during the storm,” she says.

The patient evaluations go beyond whether or not the patients have recovered enough to leave the hospital.

“Our case managers have to make sure that the roads are plowed, that the sidewalks are shoveled, the driveway shovel, the stairs are shoveled, and that we can get our patients back safely into their homes,” she says.

For those still in the hospital late Saturday, Treber says, “They're going to stay with us until we can safely get them home.”

Planning all year

The University of Maryland Medical System just opened a new, 400,000-square-foot logistics center to manage and distribute medical supplies for the entire organization. The logistics center opened in November, and the storm will be the first test of it. But Treber says it should improve the system’s readiness and resilience for emergencies.

The system has ordered enough medication, supplies and food for several days in case there are interruptions.

Since the logistics center supplies the entire hospital, Treber has also been talking with county officials to make sure road crews are plowing the road to the facility. County officials quickly assured her that they would clear the road to the logistic center and the roads to the hospitals.

But Treber says that also underscores the importance of regular contact with local and state officials throughout the year.

“It's a testament to the preparedness stance that we work with these people every day,” she says. “We plan with our local health departments. We plan with our emergency managers.”

It’s a strange machine, made up of a bunch of IBM System 360 mainframes connected together to a common memory unit, with all sorts of custom peripherals to support keeping track of airplanes in the sky. Absolutely go read the in-depth article on that machine if it sparks your curiosity.

It got me thinking about how strange computers were in the early days, and how boringly similar they’ve all become. Just looking at the word sizes of old machines is a great example. Over the last, say, 40 years, things that do computing have had 4, 8, 16, 32, or even 64-bit words. You noticed the powers-of-two trend going on here, right? Basically starting with the lowly Intel 4004, it’s been round numbers ever since.

On the other side of the timeline, though, you get strange beasts. The classic PDP-8 had 12-bit words, while its predecessors the PDP-6 and PDP-1 had 36 bits and 18 bits respectively. (Factors of six?) There’s a string of military guidance computers that had 27-bit words, while the Apollo Guidance computer ran 15-bit words. UNIVAC III had 25-bit words, putting the 23-bit Harvard Mark I to shame.

I wasn’t there, but it gives you the feeling that each computer is a unique, almost hand-crafted machine. Some must have made their odd architectural choices to suit particular functions, others because some designer had a cleaver idea. I’m not a computer historian, but I’m sure that the word lengths must tell a number of interesting stories.

On the whole, though, it gives the impression of a time when each computer was it’s own unique machine, before the convergence of everything to roughly the same architectural ideas. A much more hackery time, for lack of a better word. We still see echoes of this in the people who make their own “retro” computers these days, either virtually, on a breadboard, or emulated in the fabric of an FPGA. It’s not just nostalgia, though, but a return to a time when there was more creative freedom: a time before 64 bits took over.",https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ibm-360-featured.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 11:02:22.098613

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Investors see Bloom's solid oxide fuel cell as a robust source of power for the surging energy demand caused by the expansion of AI data centers. Bloom's cells operate independently of traditional power grids. They are also highly efficient, emitting only heat and clean water, according to the company.

↑ X NOW PLAYING How The AI Arms Race Is Redefining The Energy Sector In 2026

In its earlier iterations Bloom Energy was viewed as a green energy company, with promising tech, but it struggled with the same skepticism from investors as other climate stocks. However, the continued proliferation of AI has seen it find a new source of demand for its fuel cells.

Now, Bloom Energy is rapidly scaling its manufacturing capacity from 1 gigawatt currently to two gigawatts by the end of 2026, with its existing footprint capable of holding up to five gigawatts of capacity. Analysts see Bloom Energy, and its growing capacity, as a major player in powering data centers amid an expected energy shortfall.

""The company is viewed as an attractive, highly reliable time-to-power solution that will drive rapid volume growth, offering one of the fastest paths to power with the lowest execution risk for AI and data center customers,"" Morgan Stanley analysts noted on Jan. 18.

Bloom Energy did not respond to a request for comment.

Accelerating Profit Growth On These Tailwinds

In late October, the San Jose, Calif.,-based fuel cell manufacturer easily topped third-quarter earnings as revenue swelled 57% vs. a year earlier to $519 million. Adjusted earnings were 15 cents a share vs. a 1-cent loss a year earlier.

Bloom Energy is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings and revenue in early February. Analysts forecast earnings declining 30% to 30 cents per share with sales totaling $647.3 million, up 13.2% vs. a year ago, according to FactSet. However, for the full year, Bloom Energy profit is predicted to grow 93% to 54 cents a share with revenue increasing 30% to $1.91 billion.

""This seminal year for Bloom positions us for an even stronger 2026 and beyond, with higher growth and more profitability,"" Bloom Energy founder and Chief Executive KR Sridhar said on the Oct. 28 third-quarter earnings call.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Sridhar added there are three major tailwinds that Bloom is benefiting from today that have ""created a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us to become the global standard for on-site power generation.""

The CEO said these tailwinds are the AI buildout, federal policy that is pushing the U.S. to win the AI race and the fact that Bloom Energy's product innovation is ""advancing at a pace more akin to semiconductor evolution than to that of traditional industrial products.""

""Bloom is now positioned to become the standard in on-site power, which many of us believe will be a $1 trillion market,"" Sridhar said.

With this backdrop, analysts expect Bloom Energy's 2026 earnings to soar 293% compared to 2024 levels. Through 2030, the Street view has annual profit growing at a steady pace, hitting $6.36 per share at the beginning of the next decade.

Capitalizing On AI Data Center Deals

In 2025, Bloom Energy inked major deals with Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), Oracle and the data center company Equinix (EQIX).

In October, Bloom Energy announced that Brookfield Asset Management will invest up to $5 billion to deploy its fuel cells at AI data centers. Bloom Energy and Brookfield are actively collaborating on the design and delivery of AI factories globally. Brookfield is one of the world's largest AI infrastructure investors and has already invested $50 billion in AI opportunities while tripling the size of its AI strategy over the next three years.

Best IBD 50 Stocks To Watch

CEO Sridhar says Bloom Energy will be the preferred on-site provider for Brookfield's infrastructure portfolio of AI factories, data center operators, corporate facilities and other factories.

The announcement with Brookfield came after Bloom Energy cut a deal in late July with Oracle to supply fuel cell technology for that hyperscaler's AI data centers. Bloom Energy successfully delivered volumes to its first Oracle site within 55 days of the deal announcement vs. a 90-day target commitment.

Bloom Energy Stock Performance

Propelled by these deals, Bloom Energy stock surged nearly 300% last year. Through Jan. 23, Bloom shares have soared 66.7% in the 2026 stock market, leading the way in Investor's Business Daily's Energy-Alternative/Other industry group. The group's 54 stocks have collectively advanced 9.2% so far in 2026, good for 83rd out of the 197 industry groups ranked by IBD.

Bloom Energy is currently trading near record highs and is just below a buy zone from a cup base with a traditional 147.86 buy point, according to MarketSurge charts.

In the past 12 months, dating back to Jan. 23, 2025, Bloom Energy is up almost 424%. For comparison, in that time frame Nvidia is up 27.5% while Oracle has fallen 5%. Fellow Big Tech hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are up 4.3% and 1.6, respectively, since Jan. 23, 2025.

Bloom Energy stock has a perfect 99 Composite Rating. The AI data center energy play also has a 99 Relative Strength Rating and an 80 EPS Rating.

""We have strong traction across all channels of the AI ecosystem,"" Sridhar said on the third-quarter earnings call. ""As we continue to penetrate new geographies and verticals, success builds upon itself and should make each new market entry easier than the first. The opportunity is vast and we are still in the early innings.""

Bloom Energy Starts 2026 With A Bang

The strong Bloom stock move to start 2026 comes as a Wyoming data center project won a key approval earlier this month.

Laramie County commissioners on Jan. 6 reportedly approved site plans for a 1.8-gigawatt data center in Wyoming. Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro wrote on Jan. 8 that the proposed project includes 900 megawatts of power generated by fuel cells, with Bloom Energy named as the potential fuel cell provider.

Clean Energy Stock Up 410% In 2025 Jumps After Earnings Beat

The project is expected to start construction in the first quarter of 2026. Arcaro said that 900 megawatts would equate to around $3 billion in product revenue for Bloom Energy vs. the expected 2025 product revenue of $1.45 billion.

Importantly, an unregulated subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP) executed an unconditional purchase agreement on Jan. 4 to acquire a substantial portion of its option for solid oxide fuel cells to develop and construct a fuel generation facility for about $2.65 billion, according to an AEP regulatory filing. The filing showed there is a 20-year offtake agreement with a ""high investment grade third party consumer"" for 100% of the output of the fuel cell generation facility planned for Cheyenne.

American Electric Power previously partnered with Bloom Energy to deploy up to 1 gigawatt of Bloom's solid oxide fuel cell generators, primarily to power Amazon Web Services data centers.

Analysts' Take On Bloom Energy

Following American Electric Power's key regulatory filing, Clear Street raised its price target on Bloom Energy to 68 from 58, keeping a hold rating on shares. The firm noted that Bloom Energy sales ""should benefit strongly"" this year from a recent customer order of solid oxide fuel cells for a power generation plant in Wyoming.

Meanwhile, Evercore analysts wrote on Jan. 8 that the American Electric disclosure is a ""meaningful positive"" for Bloom Energy as it sheds light on the demand for its product. The firm has an outperform rating and a 152 price target on Bloom shares.

On Jan. 18, Morgan Stanley analysts also compiled a list of 18 ""high conviction thematic stock ideas"" across the U.S. and Latin America. Bloom Energy is one of the stocks.

Morgan Stanley sees Bloom Energy as playing a ""pivotal role in the future of energy, particularly as an enabler of AI infrastructure and a solution to the emerging power bottleneck for data centers.""

According to Morgan Stanley research, there could be a power shortfall of around 45 gigawatts for U.S. data centers through 2028. This is likely to lead to a substantial ramp in data center power demand with lengthy grid interconnection delays with some regions already experiencing five- to seven-year wait times, Morgan Stanley forecasts.

""As grid interconnection times lengthen and traditional power access becomes more constrained, Bloom's fuel cell technology represents a scarce resource in the market alongside U.S.-based solar panels and gas turbines, positioning it as a key beneficiary of the structural shift in how power is delivered to energy-intensive applications,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.

Investing Smarter Via Insurance Recapitalisation To capitalize on this opportunity, investors should: * Monitor insurance stocks and their recapitalisation progress.","Nigeria’s insurance sector is entering a new phase of capital strength following the introduction of the Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act (NIIRA) 2025, which mandates higher minimum capital requirements for operators. Beyond regulatory compliance, this wave of recapitalisation is reshaping insurers’ balance sheets, expanding their investment capacity and opening new pathways for stronger, more sustainable investment returns for shareholders and institutional investors alike.

The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has consequently set new minimum capital thresholds across the industry: N10 billion for life insurers, N15 billion for non-life insurers, N25 billion for composite insurers and N35 billion for reinsurers. The ongoing recapitalisation exercise is scheduled to conclude on July 30, 2026, giving operators a defined timeline to strengthen their capital base and reposition for growth.

As a result, several insurers have already approached shareholders for capital injections, while others are exploring strategic partnerships, rights issues, and potential mergers to meet the new regulatory thresholds and strengthen their market position.

The recapitalisation drive is expected to increase Investment Capacity with insurers with stronger balance sheets can invest in more substantial and diverse portfolios, potentially generating higher returns.

It will also improve governance and risk management: Enhanced capital requirements promote better governance and risk management practices, reducing the likelihood of insolvency and increasing investor confidence.

To expand insurance penetration: A more robust insurance sector can lead to increased insurance penetration, driving economic growth and creating new investment opportunities.

Looking at key insurance stocks to watch, capital market analysts have said that some insurance stocks that have rallied include: AIICO Insurance, Mutual Benefits Assurance, AXA Mansard Insurance, Linkage Assurance and Cornerstone Insurance.

The commissioner for Insurance/chief executive officer of NAICOM, Segun Omosehin, said the commission’s focus is to build a stronger, more credible insurance market that can protect policyholders and attract long-term investment.

“The recapitalisation and market conduct reforms are designed to ensure that insurance companies are financially sound, well governed and capable of meeting their obligations to policyholders. This will ultimately strengthen confidence in the industry,” Omosehin said.

A senior stockbroker, Tunde Oyediran emphasized that investors who truly understand the dynamics of the capital market must practice patience when it comes to their investments in companies, saying that “those who remain steadfast will likely see significant improvements in their investment portfolios over time.”

He encouraged a long-term perspective, stating, “the key is to stay committed to your company.”

Oyediran also highlighted the substantial untapped potential within the insurance sector, noting that “many Nigerians remain hesitant when it comes to embracing insurance products. This hesitation is a major concern, as effective legislation and enforcement could unlock the industry’s vast capabilities.”

He pointed out that a growing number of insurance firms are now diversifying their operations into various financial sectors, such as asset management and fintech, to solidify and enhance their income streams.

He stated that when the financial performance of these companies improves significantly, the benefits will inevitably extend to their investors in the form of better earnings and attractive dividends.

He mentioned several high-performing stocks in the market, including Custodian Investment Plc, NEM Insurance, Mansard Insurance, and Sunu Assurances, which are currently grabbing the attention of savvy investors seeking growth opportunities.

Investing Smarter Via Insurance Recapitalisation

To capitalize on this opportunity, investors should:

* Monitor insurance stocks and their recapitalisation progress.

* Consider investing in insurers with strong capital positions and growth potential.

* Diversify portfolios to include insurance sector investments.

Money Market

To finance the 2026 budget, the Chief Executive of CFG Advisory, Tilewa Adebajo, has urged the Federal Government to sell off part of its stake in its Joint Venture (JV) assets.

Speaking with journalists during the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) 2026 Economic Outlook, the economist warned that Nigeria’s current debt trajectory is unsustainable.

Adebajo who also projected that economic growth could exceed five per cent by the end of the year if urgent fiscal and structural reforms are implemented, said Nigeria’s debt profile, estimated at over $100 billion, poses a serious risk to macroeconomic stability.

Real Estate

The surging cost of house rents across Lagos, Ogun, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Asaba and other major Nigerian cities, amid largely stagnant incomes, is pushing many middle-class Nigerians into severe financial distress and, in some cases, homelessness.

Findings indicate that the cost of renting apartments and renewing leases in Lagos and its neighbouring Ogun communities has risen by more than 200 per cent in the past few years, deepening the housing burden on residents.

Market surveys show that rents for residential flats and small commercial spaces have jumped by over 90 per cent in several Lagos locations, including Lekki, Ajah, Surulere, Festac, Amuwo-Odofin, Apapa and Victoria Island.

Similarly, rents in suburban communities such as Ikotun, Ikorodu, Egbeda, Iyana-Ipaja, Agege, Abule-Egba and Ojodu-Berger have climbed sharply, moving beyond the affordability threshold of lower-income earners.

Maritime

Cargo haulage costs at the Tin Can Island and Apapa seaports in Lagos have dropped by 65.7 per cent, LEADERSHIP can report.

Findings show that the sharp decline is largely due to the introduction of the electronic call-up system, Ètò, operated by Truck Transit Park Limited (TTP), which has significantly improved truck movement and access to the ports.

Maritime experts attributed the reduction in haulage charges to shorter waiting times, faster truck turnaround, and the dismantling of racketeering and illegal checkpoints along port access roads.",https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Insurance.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 14:00:11.137570

Is Adobe (ADBE) Offering Value After A 31% One Year Share Price Decline

January 24, 2026

If you are wondering whether Adobe's current share price reflects its long term potential, it helps to separate the company’s story from what the market is currently willing to pay.

The stock last closed at US$301.07, with returns of 1.7% over 7 days, a 14.7% decline over 30 days, a 9.7% decline year to date, and a 30.8% decline over 1 year, which may have shifted how some investors see its growth prospects and risk profile.

These moves are playing out against a backdrop of ongoing interest in Adobe's core creative and digital media platforms, as investors weigh the long term value of its subscription based model and product ecosystem. Recent coverage has also focused on broader sentiment toward large software names, which can influence how quickly investors are willing to pay up for growth and established market positions.

On our checks Adobe currently scores 5 out of 6 on valuation, as shown by its . Next we will compare the different ways to look at that valuation, before finishing with a different framework that can help you judge whether the market price truly matches your own view of the company.

Approach 1: Adobe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model projects a company’s future cash flows and then discounts them back to today’s value, so you can compare that estimate to the current share price.

For Adobe, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $9.8b, and analysts have provided explicit forecasts out to 2030, with Simply Wall St extrapolating further to build a 10 year view. For example, the projections show free cash flow in 2030 of $13.0b, with interim annual estimates such as $10.3b in 2026 and $11.2b in 2027, all in $ and then discounted back to today.

Bringing all those discounted cash flows together, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $532.26 per share. Against the recent share price of $301.07, this implies the stock is around 43.4% undervalued according to this framework.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Adobe is undervalued by 43.4%. Track this in your or , or discover .

Approach 2: Adobe Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like Adobe, the P/E ratio is a useful way to relate what you pay per share to the earnings the business is currently generating. It gives you a quick sense of how many dollars investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.

What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on factors such as expected earnings growth and perceived risk. Higher growth and lower risk often support a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty usually call for a lower one.

Adobe currently trades on a P/E of 17.33x. That sits below the Software industry average of 30.76x and well below a peer group average of 55.29x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework estimates a P/E of 34.31x for Adobe, based on variables like its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics.

This Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for company specific factors instead of assuming all software names deserve the same multiple. Compared with the current P/E of 17.33x, the Fair Ratio of 34.31x suggests the shares trade below that model’s implied level.

Result: UNDERVALUED

P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose Your Adobe Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to connect your view of Adobe’s story with the numbers behind its fair value.

A Narrative is your explanation of what you think will happen to a company, written as a story that is backed by your own assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, which then link directly into an estimated fair value per share.

On Simply Wall St, millions of investors use Narratives on the Community page as an easy tool to translate their views into financial forecasts, compare the resulting fair value to the current share price and decide whether that gap is significant enough for them to consider buying or selling.

Because Narratives on the platform update when new information such as news or earnings is added, your fair value view can adjust automatically. You might see one Adobe Narrative that assumes a relatively high fair value based on optimistic growth and margins, while another assumes a far lower fair value based on more cautious expectations, even though both are using the same underlying framework.

The collaboration targets productivity gains, faster product development, and stronger national security capabilities across government programs.

The initiative focuses on applying generative AI to areas such as defense, infrastructure, and health services for federal clients.

For investors tracking NYSE:LDOS, this AI partnership arrives as the stock trades around $193.45, with a 1 year return of 31.2% and a 3 year return of 105.2%. Those figures place Leidos in a group of defense and government IT contractors that have seen renewed attention around digital modernization and mission critical technology.

The OpenAI collaboration indicates that AI may be a central theme in how Leidos positions itself with federal agencies going forward. If you follow the stock, this development may be worth watching for how it influences contract discussions, competitive positioning, and the types of solutions Leidos brings to government clients over time.

This OpenAI partnership ties directly into Leidos' focus areas in digital modernization, health services, national security, infrastructure, and defense, which are described as foundations of its NorthStar 2030 growth strategy. For you as an investor, the key angle is how deeply OpenAI's generative and agentic AI is embedded into core federal workflows, since that can influence Leidos' ability to compete for larger and more complex contracts tied to long term modernization programs.

Leidos Holdings Narrative, Now With an AI Twist

There is no formal narrative data attached here, but this announcement may feed into existing investor storylines that already link Leidos to government IT spending, cybersecurity, and digital modernization. If you view Leidos as a contractor closely aligned with U.S. federal priorities, the closer integration of OpenAI tools into both customer workflows and internal processes could reinforce that story around execution on long range technology programs.

Risks and rewards investors should keep in mind

The company is flagged with 4 rewards, including comments that it is trading at 33.4% below one fair value estimate and that earnings grew 16.9% over the past year.

Earnings are also described as forecast to grow 3.77% per year, while the stock is noted as trading at good value compared to peers and the industry.

There is 1 identified risk linked to a high level of debt, which could matter if AI investments or contract delivery require significant ongoing spending.

Management highlights internal productivity gains from thousands of employees already using OpenAI's platform daily, which could support margins if executed carefully.

BENGALURU, Jan 23 (Reuters) – Euro zone business activity growth held steady this month as a weaker expansion in the dominant services industry offset milder factory contraction, according to a survey, while price pressures picked up.

The common ‍currency bloc started the year on a weaker note but sentiment has improved since Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump backed down on additional tariffs he had threatened to impose on eight European countries as leverage to seize Greenland.

The HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite PMI, compiled by S&P Global, held at 51.5 this month but fell short of a Reuters poll forecast for 51.8. It remained ‌above the 50.0 level that separates growth from contraction for a ‌13th straight month.

“Overall, these are decent data, supporting the view of a relatively resilient euro zone economy in the face of multiple shocks and ongoing policy uncertainty,” said Claus Vistesen, chief euro zone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “That said, the bar to meet official and consensus forecasts is ​now higher.”

PRICE PRESSURES BACK ON RADAR

New orders rose at the weakest rate since September and new export business contracted at the quickest pace in four months, suggesting demand remained ‍weak across the board. Firms shed jobs for ​the first time since September.

The services PMI slowed to a four-month ​low of 51.9 from 52.4 in December, lower than the Reuters poll prediction of 52.6.

Manufacturing activity ‍contracted again but at a slower pace.

An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, barely returned to expansion territory but new orders contracted for a third straight month.

PMIs showed mixed activity across the bloc. In Germany, business activity grew at its fastest pace in three months in January but employment fell at the quickest rate ‍since November 2009.

However, activity in France unexpectedly contracted in January, after two months of meagre growth.

In Britain, a separate PMI showed businesses reported the fastest growth since April 2024. But inflation ‍and joblessness increased, too.

Overall price ‍pressures intensified with input costs rising at the fastest rate ​since February and output charges increasing at the quickest pace in ​nearly two ⁠years, reinforcing expectations the European Central Bank will keep rates ‌steady.

“Even though inflation has remained remarkably benign in recent months despite all the economic turmoil, the PMI does indicate increasing price pressures again,” said Bert Colijn at ING. “That being said, the moves are not nearly enough to sway the ECB from its expectations to hold rates for the foreseeable future.”

Still, optimism about future activity rose to its highest since May 2024.

Le mandat ne sera pas facile, admet Serge Lamontagne.

Le quatrième président-directeur général (PDG) en trois ans à la Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) l’a déjà vécu comme directeur général à la Ville de Laval. L’administration y était gangrenée par la corruption de l’ex-maire Gilles Vaillancourt.

Il devait y faire le ménage, mais il se veut toutefois rassurant: il n’agira pas comme un rouleau compresseur.

«Quand on arrive dans un contexte de tutelle et de corruption, les gens pensent qu’on va faire le ménage. [À Laval], oui, il y a des gens qui sont partis parce que la réorganisation était difficile. Il y en a à qui j’ai demandé de quitter. Mais la transformation s’est faite avec la majorité des gens», a-t-il expliqué, en entrevue avec notre Bureau parlementaire.

Le PDG prendra d’ailleurs le pouls des 5000 employés cette année, conscient que plusieurs sont échaudés par les trois dernières années et la mauvaise presse qui a déferlé à leur endroit.

L’UPAC en tête

Comme pour la SAAQ, Laval faisait l’objet d’enquêtes de l’unité permanente anticorruption (UPAC) à son entrée en fonction. Le nouveau PDG ne compte pas attendre les conclusions du corps de police pour poser des gestes importants.

«À Laval, j’ai travaillé en parallèle avec l’UPAC. Les enquêtes sont longues. Au niveau administratif, je ne peux pas attendre. Il faut avancer sans nuire aux enquêtes. S’il y a des accusations, on prendra acte et on agira en conséquence», dit-il.

«Quand on a un mandat comme ça, il faut scruter le passé, planifier et protéger l’avenir. Ici, le passé a déjà été largement scruté avec la Vérificatrice générale (VG), l’Autorité des marchés publics (AMP), la commission Galant», rappelle-t-il.

D’ailleurs, en écoutant cette commission, M. Lamontagne dit être «tombé en bas de [sa] chaise».

«J’ai été renversé par l’envergure du dossier», signale-t-il, admettant avoir été scandalisé.

Grosses responsabilités

Le nouveau PDG identifie d’ailleurs quatre priorités. D’abord, intégrer l’ensemble des rapports d’enquête afin d’élaborer un plan d’action global et empêcher la répétition des erreurs. Le rapport dévastateur de l’AMP le forcera à montrer patte blanche tous les six mois.

Un concept qu’il apprécie, assure-t-il.

«Les mots clés pour moi: gouvernance, transparence et reddition de comptes», a mentionné le PDG, qui se veut rassurant.

M. Lamontagne souhaite aussi s’attaquer au déficit budgétaire de l’organisation, qui pourrait frôler le milliard de dollars d’ici 2029 en raison de SAAQclic.

Fort de son expérience de gestion, il est convaincu d’y arriver. «On doit retrouver l’équilibre», signale-t-il.

La troisième priorité vise l’amélioration des services aux citoyens et l’optimisation des processus, malgré un système informatique incomplet.

Puis, le nouveau PDG tranchera rapidement la question de la sécurité et de l’armement des contrôleurs routiers. Le ministre des Transports, Jonatan Julien, lui en a donné rapidement la mission.

ISTA’s commitment to responsible AI, coupled with its focus on frontier research and interdisciplinary culture, make it perfectly placed to pursue this goal.

Camp – a philanthropist who is the creator of the not-for-profit Camp.org research organization and co-founder of the ride-hailing Uber app – visited the ISTA campus on January 13 to sign the donation agreement with President Martin Hetzer and Managing Director Georg Schneider.

“With this generous gift, ISTA can further build upon fundamental research in artificial intelligence, drawing on our strengths in computer science, mathematics, and the natural sciences,” said Hetzer. “It helps us pursue AI research within a broad, interdisciplinary scientific context, deepen our understanding of how these systems work, and address their limitations. It is essential for developing robust and trustworthy AI systems that deliver long-term value for both science and society.”

Investment in future breakthroughs

For Camp, the ISTA donation reflects a belief that the next generation of AI breakthroughs will come from ecosystems that prioritize rigor, collaboration, and long-term impact over short-term speed. His current focus is centered around facilitating AI development that helps people thrive around the world.

“Global solutions demand global perspectives and collaboration,” said Camp. “Supporting ISTA is about investing in a community that unites brilliant minds from around the world to further advance trustworthy AI in harmony with humanity and helps to ensure that innovation continues to grow with integrity, transparency, and respect for human values.” Camp has a history of supporting non-profit organizations focused on building responsible and trustworthy AI technology. However, the ISTA gift represents his first contribution to a European research institution.

“We are thrilled to have played a role in helping bring these two institutions together,” said Niklas Schmidt of Wolf Theiss Attorneys-at-Law. “Camp’s donation acknowledges the excellence of the Austrian research landscape.”

ISTA as AI hub

ISTA’s work in AI is wide-ranging and focuses on building systems that are reliable, efficient and scientifically grounded. Key areas include trustworthy AI, with researchers such as Christoph Lampert and his team striving for principled solutions rather than just bug fixes while seeking to make AI safer, as well as more robust, fair and respectful of data privacy.

Sustainable AI is another ISTA focus, with research led by Dan Alistarh aimed at making AI models more resource-efficient and broadly accessible. Francesco Locatello and his team work on causal AI aimed at helping AI systems learn how causes lead to effects, how actions change outcomes and how data they encounter can shift over time.

At ISTA, AI is also closely integrated with other research fields. That includes experimentally aware AI for protein structure prediction. In this area, Alex Bronstein, in collaboration with Paul Schanda, developed a method to ‘guide’ the AlphaFold3 AI model to match experimental data. Monika Henzinger meanwhile pursues work on the privacy-preserving training of large language models while Marco Mondelli and his group have developed rigorous methods for exploiting massive datasets and solving complex inference problems.

Bolstered by the donation, these and other ISTA researchers ­including Krishnendu Chatterjee, Thomas Henzinger, and Matthew Robinson will continue to contribute to AI research that is both scientifically robust and socially responsible.

“We greatly value this transatlantic vote of confidence in ISTA’s research mission and in our role in shaping the future of AI,” Hetzer said. Since opening its doors in 2009, ISTA has attracted scientists from around the world who carry out foundational research spanning the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science across roughly 90 groups, with that number expected to increase to 150 over the next decade.",https://ista.ac.at/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MartinHetzer_GarrettCamp_at_ISTA-1-c-ISTA_V1.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 12:02:10.127797

According to El Periódico Mediterráneo, the Moroccan financier now sits inside the president’s inner circle.

Born in 1984, he studied financial mathematics in France, joined Calyon, then moved to Madrid with Société Générale in 2009. Headed locally by friend Donato González, the bank was Pérez’s main lender before his presidency. His father partnered with Pérez in Moroccan construction projects.

Laghrari left Société Générale in 2013 to become a partner at Key Capital. He helped steady ACS after the failed Iberdrola bid and the property crisis, as the March family and the ‘Albertos’ distanced themselves from Pérez.

He has been involved in Madrid’s Providence and Sixth Street agreements, and in ACS’s purchase of Abertis. A co-founder of A22 Sports Managment, linked to Key Capital, he shaped the Super League’s financing, securing €4,000 million from JP Morgan and negotiating with signatory clubs. He also advised Joan Laporta and Barcelona.

The club has floated a new CEO to run a subsidiary for business operations, separate from the presidency and sporting side, handling investors, Bernabéu commercial activity and a model valued by Pérez at €10,000 million. Laghrari fits that brief and is bringing Sixth Street and Bernard Arnault to buy the 5% on offer.

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer shared his take on. A caller mentioned owning 300 TGT shares and asked for Cramer’s thoughts. He remarked:

I think that you gotta hold on to Target. Got a new CEO… Target seems to find itself in all sorts of trouble all the time. But for the first time in a long time, this stock is bouncing off its low with a 4% yield. I am going to bless you owning Target. Put some on here, and we have 300… maybe even buy another 100 if the stock gets to 100. Let’s have the new CEO on. I really want to speak to him because I’ve been a big Target fan for a very long time.

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a retailer that sells clothing, beauty items, groceries, electronics, home goods, and everyday essentials. Cramer discussed the stock during the November 20, 2025, episode and commented:

Next up, Target, oh jeez, this is a tough one. Target also reported yesterday, and this ailing big box retailer delivered yet another dispiriting set of numbers. We’re talking about a slight revenue miss, a nasty 2.7% decline in same-store sales, and a modest 7 cents earnings beat off a $1.71 basis. On top of that, Target slashed the high end of its full-year earnings forecast.

While we acknowledge the potential of TGT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

How American government subsidizes its ranchers

The federal government allows livestock grazing across an area of publicly owned land more than twice the size of California, making ranching the largest land use in the West. Billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies support the system, which often harms the environment.

As President Donald Trump’s administration pushes a pro-ranching agenda, ProPublica and High Country News investigated how public lands ranching has evolved. We filed more than 100 public record requests and sued the Bureau of Land Management to pry free documents and data; we interviewed everyone from ranchers to conservationists; and we toured ranching operations in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada. The resulting three-part investigation digs into the subsidies baked into ranching, the environmental impacts from livestock and the political clout that protects this status quo. Here are the takeaways from that work. The public lands grazing system was modernized in the 1930s in response to the rampant use of natural resources that led to the Dust Bowl — the massive dust storms triggered by poor agricultural practices, including overgrazing. Today, the system focuses on subsidizing the continued grazing of these lands.

The BLM and Forest Service, the two largest federal land management agencies, oversee most of the system. Combined, the agencies charged ranchers $21 million in grazing fees in 2024. Our analysis found that to be about a 93% discount, on average, compared with the market rate for forage on private land. We also found that, in 2024 alone, the federal government poured at least $2.5 billion into subsidy programs that public lands ranchers can access. Such subsidies include disaster assistance after droughts and floods as well as compensation for livestock lost to predators. A small number of wealthy individuals and corporations manage most livestock on public lands.

Roughly two-thirds of the grazing on BLM acreage is controlled by just 10% of ranchers, our analysis found. And on Forest Service land, the top 10% of permittees control more than 50% of grazing. Among the largest ranchers are billionaires like Stan Kroenke and Rupert Murdoch, as well as mining companies and public utilities. The administration released a “plan to fortify the American Beef Industry” in October that instructed the BLM and Forest Service to amend grazing regulations for the first time since the 1990s.

The plan suggested that taxpayers further support ranching by increasing subsidies for drought and wildfire relief, livestock killed by predators and government-backed insurance. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Livestock grazing is not only a federally and statutorily recognized appropriate land use, but a proven land management tool, one that reduces invasive species and wildfire risk, enhances ecosystem health, and supports rural stewardship.” Roughly 18,000 permittees graze livestock on BLM or Forest Service land, most of them small operations. These ranchers say they need government support and cheaper grazing fees to avoid insolvency.

The final paragraph of Joseph Schumpeter’s chapter-length introduction of his theory of democracy is such a banger

Source: J.A. Schumpter, Capitalism, Socialsm and Democracy. 1943.

For interesting commentary see “Democracy Before, In, and After Schumpeter” Philip Pettit

The classical model of democracy that Schumpeter criticizes is manufactured out of a variety of earlier ideas, not those of any one thinker or even one school of thought. His critique of the central ideals by which he defines the model—those of the common will and the common good—remains persuasive. People’s preferences are too messy and too manipulable to allow us to think that mass democracy can promote those ideals, as he defines them. Should we endorse his purely electoral model of democracy, then, and accept that people do not exercise any control over government? Not necessarily. We can expand democracy to include the constitutional and contestatory constraints that people impose on their rulers. We may hope that people can rely on such democratic controls to ensure that government operates by community standards.

(IBM) approaches a pivotal quarterly report, a notable divergence has emerged between its recent stock performance and analyst sentiment. Despite a significant weekly decline that saw shares lose approximately 15% of their value, closing at €259.25 last Friday, a wave of optimism persists among Wall Street observers. The upcoming financial release on Wednesday, January 28, after the U.S. market close, is now viewed as a critical juncture that could determine whether the technology giant can leverage its strategic initiatives to stabilize its equity value.

All eyes are on the fourth-quarter results, where forecasts are ambitious. Market experts, on average, anticipate earnings per share of $4.31, which would represent a year-over-year increase. Revenue growth is also projected to be robust, with estimates pointing to an advance of nearly 10%. Analysts will scrutinize several key areas: the performance of the software division, recognized as a primary engine for margin expansion; commentary on the planned acquisition of Confluent; and the trajectory of cash flow, which directly impacts the company's dividend sustainability. The report and subsequent guidance for 2026 are expected to set the market's tone for the coming months.

Strategic Moves in AI Fuel Confidence

A primary source of the prevailing positive outlook is IBM's aggressive expansion within the artificial intelligence sector. The company has launched multiple initiatives this week designed to solidify its market position:

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Enterprise Consulting: A new advisory service aimed at helping businesses scale their AI applications built on the watsonx platform.

Grammy Alliance: For the 2026 awards ceremony, IBM will provide a digital AI experience, showcasing its technology to a vast global audience.

Telecom Partnership: In collaboration with telecommunications firm e&, a new solution for governance and compliance has been developed, targeting a high-margin segment of the software market.

Analyst Consensus Defies Recent Price Action

The recent share price correction has not dampened the view from several major investment houses. In January, firms including Jefferies and Bank of America raised their price targets for IBM. Notably, Jefferies upgraded its rating on the stock from ""Hold"" to ""Buy."" The overall consensus among researchers now leans toward a ""Moderate Buy"" recommendation. Out of 19 analysts covering the company, 13 currently advise purchasing the shares.

Market strategists interpret this sustained confidence as an indication that the recent decline is more attributable to a pre-earnings market adjustment rather than a reflection of deteriorating fundamentals. The coming earnings presentation is seen as a potential catalyst to reconcile the disconnect between the stock's recent weakness and the upbeat analyst commentary. Should IBM confirm strong growth in its AI-driven segments and provide a reassuring outlook, it may well validate the current optimism and chart a new course for its shares.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2442574_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 08:59:33.993340

This article originally appeared on Out: AIDS took Ross Laycock 35 years ago.","Memory is a tricky thing.

My friend Felix Gonzalez-Torres once said, ""Each of us perceives things according to who and how we are at particular junctures, whose terms are always shifting.""

So I think, OK, I've had a great life with memories culled from a long list of fantastic, seemingly improbable, some say phantasmagorical experiences and friendships. But for me, it's as though these things happened to someone else, and I only realized how important they were after the fact. I'm not sure if it was naïveté, or my terminally blasé nature, or my Teflon indifference, as one exasperated therapist called it.

One of the few memories that has always felt very real to me dates to my childhood in Canada, when, on cold winter days, with snow drifts like white, ominous mountains enveloping that place I called home, I’d rush from school, lace up my skates, and trudge across the snow drifts, down to the river's edge. Alone, I would skate for miles in the early evening silence, just the schoosh schoosh of the blades on the rock hard ice, the witchy blackness of the early night, and my plumed breath in regular procession.

It is this memory that conjures up Ross Laycock, my indomitable gay brother, the prankster, the exuberant athlete and opera buff, the very embodiment of a certain kind of Canadian sprezzatura. Ross, who like so many, was murdered by Ronald Reagan’s toxic black hair dye and Nancy Reagan’s blood-stained Adolfo dress. By Jesse Helms’s southern-fried homophobia, and New York Mayor Ed Koch’s slammed-shut and padlocked closet door. I’m remembering Ross today, who died of AIDS-related illnesses, 35 years ago on January 24, 1991.

I met Ross in 1978 while we were students at McGill University — he a science major, and me, art history. Then, in the spring of 1980, Ross moved to New York to study menswear design at the Fashion Institute of Technology but soon realized he was not a fit for FIT — that he’d rather buy clothes than design them. I arrived six months later in November. As different as two young gay men could be, I felt deeply bonded to Ross because he represented a kind of unfettered freedom I had never known or understood, and for him, I was the brother he never had.

The first time I saw Ross and Felix together was at a cocktail party in Manhattan in 1983. The two had met a few weeks prior and were already madly in love. It was obvious that Ross had finally found in Felix his ideal man, and Felix had found his “audience of one."" I gave my approval.

Their intense relationship played itself out within the context of Reagan’s America, a time of great difficulty for many people, in particular gay men and lesbians. For some of us, it was also a time of great creativity and profound personal change, of art-making and vibrant activism centered on a spiraling “government-sponsored holocaust” as art critic Darren Jones named it. We opened our hearts and minds and grew in ways we never knew possible, but the tsunami of AIDS came roaring in and threatened to drown us.

Ross came from a family of girls — three sisters, where they all grew up in Inuvik, the Northwest Territories of Canada, in a small village called Norman Wells. I believe there is a kind of spectacular and unique beauty to that place, as he described it, but also boredom and tedium for a young boy. His father died when he was nine, and I know that affected him deeply. His mother, with few options, sent him to what is known in Canada as a ""residential school,"" an awful place, funded by the Canadian government, which forced Indigenous children to not speak their native languages, give up rituals and traditions including clothing, food, hunting, and adornments, and be indoctrinated into the Catholic liturgy. They used torture, starvation, psychological manipulation, and even murder to bend these children to the white man’s way. “Ross, as the only non-Indigenous student at the school, was bullied and abused by other students. I think his confidence, resilience, and charm helped him survive,” his sister Janice remembered. That is the adult Ross that I knew, and the Ross that Felix fell in love with, who he described as “strong as a horse; he could build anything.”

They were in so many ways the most unlikely/likely pair. Felix had been born and raised in Guaimaro, Cuba — the birthplace of the Cuban independence movement, and was separated from his parents in their decision to get him and his siblings out of Cuba as Castro swept into power. This left him feeling unmoored and alone until he eventually landed in New York City where he found a sense of home, something most important to both of them, and which they found in each other.

Ross eventually left New York and returned to Canada to continue his studies in biochemistry at the University of Toronto. He and Felix continued their love affair traveling between New York and Toronto, to Paris, Italy, and spending months in Los Angeles while Felix taught a semester at CalArts. They would spend every summer traveling the northland of Ontario, sleeping in a VW minivan, cooking over an open fire, hiking, swimming, and watching beavers build their dams, while Harry, Ross’s black Labrador, chased squirrels.

Ross became involved with the activist group AIDS Action Now!, and in 1989, organized direct actions at the fifth International AIDS Conference in Montreal, cowriting a manifesto of demands activists issued to the government of Canada as they stormed the stage at the opening plenary session.

I think of Dr. Martin Luther King’s famous phrase: ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" And it gives me hope. I appreciate the hard-won gains we in the LBGTQ+ community have made in the last 40 years, which were built upon the foundations laid by our brothers and sisters in the 60 years prior. And young people, who are smart and savvy, and seem to have a broad sense of acceptance and love for each other, without judgment, is the very definition of progress. Still, there is more to do.

Thing is, the arc of justice sometimes snaps back, and we find ourselves, once again, facing ugly prejudice, extreme threats of violence, and seemingly impossible odds. Now, hateful anti-trans legislation is being passed in many states, and misogynistic rhetoric spews daily from the Oval Office. We see the current administration canceling World AIDS Day and threatening the highly effective PEPFAR global health initiative, which provided life-saving care to people in developing nations around the world.

We also see pernicious attempts to erase our very existence, and our love, like at recent exhibitions of Felix’s work at the David Zwirner Gallery in New York, the Chicago Art Institute, and the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, where Ross’s name was very intentionally either marginalized, or completely erased from gallery and museum labels and catalogues, along with words like gay, Latino, Cuban, HIV, and AIDS in biographical information about Felix — who was, in fact, all of those things and more.

I know a few things from my years as an artist and activist. Organizing and direct action works, community building works and nonviolent protest works. But mostly I know, even with these setbacks, we will survive.

A 1984 portrait of Carl George by Felix Gonzalez-TorresFelix Gonzalez-Torres / Courtesy Carl George

The last time I saw my friends Ross and Felix together was as a huge pile of candy on a museum floor in New York City. The installation, Untitled (“Lover Boys”) 1991, had an ideal weight of 355 pounds of thousands of shimmering, silver, foil-wrapped candies, and was equal to the weight of the two men combined. Visitors to this installation, which Felix created for the Whitney Museum's 1991 Biennial Exhibition, were invited to take pieces of the candy, and as they did, the pile slowly dwindled — a metaphor for the gradual dissipation of two lives. It forged a charged connection between public dissemination and private ownership, popular discourse and rarified art theory, between the daily lives of gay Americans and the right-wing maelstrom sweeping the nation in the epidemic's early years.

I remember that glorious summer day on Jones Beach when I took the photo of Felix and Ross, bursting with love for each other, looking sexy and glamorous, not a care in the world. But it was not to be. Just a few years later, I gave Ross his last bath, his skeletal body covered with Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions. And soon thereafter, my friend Sharron Campeau and I made funeral arrangements to his exacting specifications; that his ashes be separated into 100 small bags so Felix could carry him everywhere and leave a bit of Ross in the places they both loved.

Huang was seen at a grocery market on Saturday in Shanghai’s busy Lujiazui area, looking relaxed, according to multiple photos circulated on social media.

Earlier, Huang met with Shanghai-based staff to review Nvidia’s milestones for 2025 and to discuss its product pipeline for the year ahead, although the H200 was not mentioned in the discussion, Tencent Holdings’ news portal reported on Friday.

He is expected to arrive in Beijing on Monday, with the office’s annual Lunar New Year celebration taking place that evening, according to an Nvidia employee.

Besides Beijing, Huang is also expected to visit Nvidia staff in Shenzhen, continuing a routine he has followed over the past two years to mark the Lunar New Year with employees and business partners. This year’s holiday begins in mid-February.

Nvidia did not immediately respond to an email inquiry sent on Saturday.

The visit comes at a critical moment for Nvidia, as the H200 – its second most powerful AI chip – has yet to clear regulatory hurdles in China. Last week, Washington approved exports of the chip, with the US government set to collect a 25 per cent fee. However, Beijing’s temporary import ban has cast uncertainty over its availability.",https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2026/01/24/9b15f79d-da77-49b4-849d-9222cff47ae5_d43e3742.jpg?itok=L-rM_0DU&v=1769240543,N,,2026-01-24 08:59:39.860626

AMD continues to feature prominently in the competitive landscape with its MI400 accelerators, which analysts expect to be shipped alongside Nvidia systems as aggregate AI server volumes increase.

AMD Targets Mass-Market AI PCs After CES 2026

AMD is positioning itself for the next phase of AI-driven growth by pushing artificial intelligence into mainstream PCs, while relying on its data center business for longer-term momentum, according to Counterpoint Research. The company used CES 2026 to pivot from proof-of-concept demos to mass-market execution, aiming to scale AI features across affordable consumer and commercial PCs, as per the firm.

Major manufacturers, including Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), plan to launch AMD-powered AI PCs in early 2026, with entry-level pricing starting at around $499. Counterpoint noted that AMD is emphasizing practical use cases such as productivity, gaming, and creative workloads, a strategy that could help spark a new PC upgrade cycle, particularly in desktops.

Data Centers Remain Core Growth Driver

Counterpoint also highlighted AMD's data center segment as its primary growth engine. Strong hyperscaler demand, tight supply conditions, and rising server CPU adoption are expected to support earnings. At the same time, platform initiatives like Helios could further strengthen AMD's role in AI infrastructure without directly displacing Nvidia.

AMD shares were largely unaffected by Intel Corp.'s (NASDAQ:INTC) quarterly results, which sent Intel stock lower. Intel reported fourth-quarter revenue of $13.67 billion, beating estimates of $13.37 billion, while adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share exceeded expectations. However, revenue declined 4% year over year, and the company guided to breakeven earnings in the first quarter.

AMD Price Action: Advanced Micro Devices shares were up 3.73% at $263.20 at the time of publication on Friday. The stock is trading near its 52-week high of $267.07, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Recent coverage around Kraft Heinz has focused on the company as a large, established player in the packaged foods space. Investors are paying close attention to how consumer brands are being valued in the current market. This context helps frame the recent share price moves as investors reassess how much they are willing to pay for slower growing but established food businesses.

On our valuation checklist, Kraft Heinz scores a 4 out of 6, which suggests several metrics point to the shares being priced below some reference estimates, but not all of them. Next, we will walk through the main valuation approaches behind that score and then finish with a more complete way to think about what the stock might be worth over time.

Approach 1: Kraft Heinz Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model takes the cash Kraft Heinz is expected to generate in the future, then discounts those amounts back into today’s dollars to estimate what the business might be worth right now.

For Kraft Heinz, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $3.54b. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2028, with Simply Wall St extending those cash flow projections further using its 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. In this framework, Free Cash Flow is projected to be $4.03b in 2035, with each year’s figure discounted back to reflect the time value of money.

Putting all of those discounted cash flows together produces an estimated intrinsic value of US$69.05 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$22.72, this DCF output suggests Kraft Heinz is trading at roughly a 67.1% discount to that estimate, which indicates that the shares appear undervalued based on this specific model.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kraft Heinz is undervalued by 67.1%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover 880 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows.

Approach 2: Kraft Heinz Price vs Sales

For established, profitable consumer brands, the Price to Sales, or P/S, ratio is a useful way to see what investors are paying for each dollar of revenue, especially when cash flow and earnings can be influenced by one off items or accounting choices.

In general, higher growth and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/S multiple, while slower growth and higher risk usually align with a lower, more conservative range that investors might view as normal or fair.

Kraft Heinz currently trades on a P/S ratio of 1.07x. That sits above the wider Food industry average of 0.77x, but below the peer group average of 1.86x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 1.33x for Kraft Heinz, which reflects the multiple that could be reasonable given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics.

This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for company specific features like growth, risk and profitability, rather than assuming all food companies deserve the same multiple.

Set against this 1.33x Fair Ratio, the current 1.07x P/S suggests Kraft Heinz shares appear undervalued on this measure.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kraft Heinz Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. These are simple stories you create about Kraft Heinz that tie your view of its future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast and then to a fair value you can compare with today’s share price.

On Simply Wall St, Narratives sit inside the Community page and give you a clear framework to say, “Here is how I think Kraft Heinz will perform,” plug that into expected cash flows or earnings, and see the fair value that results from those inputs.

Once you have a Narrative, you can quickly see whether your fair value is above or below the current price. This can help you consider whether Kraft Heinz looks closer to a buy, a hold, or a sell for your own situation, without needing complex spreadsheets.

Narratives are also refreshed when new information comes in, such as earnings releases or major news. This allows your fair value view to stay aligned with what is happening with Kraft Heinz. Different investors can reasonably land on very different fair values, for example one Narrative may see substantial upside while another assumes a more cautious outcome based on lower expected growth or profitability.

Linda was born on August 18, 1946, in Brainerd, Minnesota, the daughter of Raymond G. and Bernice L. (Congdon) Johnson. She enjoyed an idyllic childhood growing up on Round Lake as the only daughter—spoiled, or at least very well cared for—by her parents and two brothers.

She graduated from Washington High School in Brainerd in 1965, where she proudly served as a Majorette, and later attended Brainerd Community College (now CLC).

Linda devoted many years to helping others, working as a counselor first at the State Hospital and later at the Port Group Home for Girls. During retirement, she continued to stay busy cleaning homes and lovingly caring for her parents.

Linda was known for her quick wit and sharp sense of humor, as well as her legendary stubborn streak—a trait she happily passed down to her children. She loved gardening and was a wonderful cook, especially known for her boiled dinners and denvers. Above all, Linda cherished time spent with family and friends—whether playing 500, going to the movies with her grandchildren, or calling someone for coffee to start her day off right.

She will be deeply missed by her children, Dana (Randy) Loftis, Dion (Gwen) Lybeck, and David (Kristin) Lybeck; six grandchildren, Preston, Emily, Mariah, Molly, Maguire, and Maxon; three great-grandchildren, Ellanor, Oliver, and Barrett; her brothers, Bernard “Boots” Johnson and Randy “RJ” Johnson; her lifelong friend, Penny Akre; and many extended family members and friends.

She was preceded in death by her parents, Raymond and Bernice Johnson.

SoftBank completed a $22.5 billion forward purchase of OpenAI equity in late December, part of a planned $30 billion commitment in 2025.

While the cash outflow was matched by incoming assets, the valuation used for accounting creates a positive adjustment to equity.

The investment was executed at a $300 billion post-money valuation.

Analysts at BTIG expect SoftBank to carry the stake at OpenAI’s more recent valuation of about $500 billion, implying a roughly 67% uplift on the deployed capital.

Applied to the $22.5 billion tranche, this results in a gross gain of about $15 billion for the quarter.

Not all of that gain accrues to SoftBank shareholders. The position sits within SoftBank Vision Fund 2, where SoftBank retains 83% of the economics, with the remaining 17% attributed to Masayoshi Son. After this split, the gain attributable to shareholders falls to about $12.45 billion.

Analysts say investors must also account for an $8 billion unrealized gain already recognized earlier, tied to the rising value of the forward contract itself. Subtracting that amount avoids double counting and brings the net increase in equity and net asset value to about $4.45 billion.

Based on this adjustment, BTIG estimates SoftBank’s fair value mark for its OpenAI holding at $54.9 billion. That figure reflects the prior carrying value at the end of the second fiscal quarter, the December $22.5 billion investment, an earlier $1.45 billion capital infusion in October, and the newly calculated equity gain.

BTIG estimates SoftBank’s total net asset value at about $189 billion after the adjustment, making OpenAI roughly 30% of the group’s NAV. By comparison, BTIG noted that OpenAI represents less than 5% of Microsoft’s market capitalization.

BTIG has a Buy rating on SoftBank Group and a ¥5,400 price target, based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that applies a holding company discount to net asset value.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEL4K0QW_L.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 10:00:23.419061

Instead, Costco Cash Rewards from Citi are issued as part of the February credit card billing statement.
The Costco Anywhere Visa Card cashback rewards for other purchases remain unchanged.
As before, the Costco Anywhere Visa Card carries no annual fee, which is a great perk for a credit card.
The Costco Cash Rewards from Citi that cardholders are about to receive in February will expire on December 31 this year.","Costco members who also have the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi will be happy to hear the retailer has increased the cashback rates on gas purchased at Costco stations to 5%. The old 4% rate still applies to gas and EV charging elsewhere. Costco quietly increased the cashback rate in January 2025, as noted by NerdWallet on January 19. Both Citi co-branded Costco cards (Costco Anywhere Visa and Costco Anywhere Visa Business) got the upgrade. That said, the reason Costco's credit card upgrade is getting more attention in early 2026 may be tied to the imminent arrival of the cash rewards. Also, last year's change may have gone largely unnoticed, especially as Costco didn't run ad campaigns around the new perk.

Importantly, the cashback credit isn't available to users immediately. Instead, Costco Cash Rewards from Citi are issued as part of the February credit card billing statement. Rewards of $300 or more are eligible for direct deposit, while those under $300 must be redeemed in Costco stores for merchandise, cash, or check. Put differently, Costco members who have been pumping gas at Costco since mid-January 2025 will receive 5% cashback for their gas purchases in a few weeks. They may notice the difference.

The maximum cashback applies to the first $7,000 spent per year on gas and EV charging. After that, the rate drops to 1%. Costco's upgrade means consumers can earn as much as $350 instead of the previous $280 if the first $7,000 spent on Costco gas is with the Citi card. The cashback amount will be lower than $350 if they use the card for gas and EV charging from non-Costco locations.

In comments made last month during Costco's Q1 2026 earnings call, Costco's CFO Gary Millerchip mentioned the increased cashback rewards for gas as he explained the retailer is looking to ""improve the value of the membership"" going forward. ""We've made some major changes recently with the extended opening hours and the Instacart benefits and 5% gas on the credit card, but we'll continue to look for ways to add greater membership value,"" Millerchip said. In September, during the company's Q4 2025 earnings call, Costco CEO Ron Vachris said the retailer had a ""record year for gas volumes."" The longer gas station hours, new gas stations, and expansions of existing gas stations are the factors he cited for the growth.

The Costco Anywhere Visa Card cashback rewards for other purchases remain unchanged. Cardholders will get 3% on dining and eligible travel, 2% for purchases in Costco stores and on Costco.com, and 1% cashback on other purchases. As before, the Costco Anywhere Visa Card carries no annual fee, which is a great perk for a credit card. However, the card is only available to Costco members, which means you'll have to pay $65 a year for a Gold Star membership or $130 a year for the executive tier.

That said, the credit card's cashback rewards are a compelling reason to get a Costco membership. It's an easy way to score extra savings on all sorts of products, including iPhones bought at Costco – not just gas. The Costco Cash Rewards from Citi that cardholders are about to receive in February will expire on December 31 this year.",https://www.bgr.com/img/gallery/costco-made-a-big-credit-card-change-members-will-love/l-intro-1769216942.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 05:59:42.593132

“Nonetheless, the HCOB flash PMIs showed a modest improvement in manufacturing, whereas activity in the services sector weakened ‍notably at the start of the year.","PARIS, Jan 23 (Reuters) – French business activity unexpectedly contracted in January, after two months of meagre growth, according to a survey published Friday, as a sharp drop in demand for services ‍outweighed rising output in the manufacturing sector.

The HCOB France flash purchasing managers index (PMI) for the country’s dominant services sector, compiled by S&P Global, came in at 47.9 points in January, a three-month low.

The index fell again below the 50 points threshold separating growth from contraction, where it has been for ten ‌of the last 12 months. A Reuters poll forecast ‌for the January flash services PMI stood at 50.5 and the final December figure was at 50.1.

The flash manufacturing PMI for this month reached 51.0 points – a 43-month high – from 50.7 in December – and above a Reuters poll ​forecast for a figure of 50.5 points.

The flash January composite PMI – which comprises both the services and manufacturing sectors – slipped to 48.6 points ‍from 50.0 in December, and well below ​a forecast for a figure of 50.0 points.

“The French ​private sector entered the new year on a muted note. The HCOB ‍Flash PMIs point to a broad-based softening in export conditions, reflecting continued uncertainty on the trade policy front despite prior trade agreements,” said Hamburg Commercial Bank economist Jonas Feldhusen.

“Nonetheless, the HCOB flash PMIs showed a modest improvement in manufacturing, whereas activity in the services sector weakened ‍notably at the start of the year. The prospect of a resolution over the 2026 national budget offers some relief, as it reduces the risk ‍of a renewed political ‍crisis in the near term,” he said.

French Prime Minister ​Sebastien Lecornu earlier this week used a special ​constitutional power ⁠to force part of his 2026 budget bill ‌through the deeply divided lower house of parliament without a vote, bringing France closer to getting a 2026 budget.

Last month, the INSEE national statistics agency forecast France’s economy, the euro zone’s second-largest, to post moderate growth in early 2026, with resilient household spending offsetting weaker foreign trade.

Find .

What Is Hormel Foods' Investment Narrative?

To be comfortable owning Hormel today, you really have to believe in the durability of its brands and the company’s ability to translate modest sales growth, disciplined capital allocation and product innovation into steadier profitability over time. Recent results show pressured margins, relatively low returns on equity and a share price that has lagged both the broader market and food peers, so near term, the key catalysts remain any signs of earnings improvement, better international profitability and proof that new products like premium and convenience offerings can support pricing. Domenic Borrelli’s appointment fits into this story as a potential boost to retail execution and brand building, but it is unlikely to shift the short term earnings picture on its own. The bigger risks are valuation, weaker margin trends and a dividend that is not well covered by current earnings.

However, one risk that often gets less attention could matter more than investors expect. Hormel Foods' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 48%. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five Simply Wall St Community fair value views span roughly US$24.36 to US$47.20, reflecting wide expectations. Against that backdrop, concerns about thin dividend cover and soft margins may weigh on how confidently you view Hormel’s ability to support both income and reinvestment.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) paid $20 billion in December to license the AI-inference technology from startup chip designer Groq.

The two companies plan to invest up to $1 billion in talent, infrastructure, and compute over 5 years to help the new AI co-innovation lab.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, long viewed as a bedrock of stability for the packaged food giant, has indicated plans that could lead to a complete divestment of its substantial stake. As investors assess the implications of this potential move, the company also faces mounting pressure from rising commodity costs.

Beyond the uncertainty surrounding its shareholder base, Kraft Heinz is confronting tangible challenges in its supply chain. Severe cold weather events in the United States and the Black Sea region have triggered a short-term spike in agricultural commodity prices. Notably, wheat prices have advanced as market participants anticipate potential crop damage from ""winterkill"" conditions.

For consumer staples companies like Kraft Heinz, elevated input costs directly compress profit margins. This creates a significant financial constraint in a market where consumers remain highly sensitive to price increases on supermarket shelves.

The $7 Billion Overhang

The dominant concern for investors stems from a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 20. The filing outlines Berkshire Hathaway's potential sale of up to 325.4 million shares. This block represents the entirety of the conglomerate's 27.5% ownership position in Kraft Heinz.

Under the leadership of CEO Greg Abel, Berkshire appears to be continuing a strategic portfolio rationalization that in recent years has included trimming positions in companies like Apple and Bank of America. The mere possibility of shares worth approximately $7.7 billion entering the market acts as a substantial overhang on the stock price. Such a large potential supply typically suppresses any near-term recovery in a company's equity.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

Analyst Sentiment Turns Cautious

Financial institutions have responded swiftly to the combination of potential selling pressure and operational risks. Firms including BNP Paribas, Jefferies, and JPMorgan have lowered their price targets ahead of earnings, with new objectives set in a range between $22 and $24 per share. These adjustments reflect widespread skepticism that the stock can stage a meaningful rebound in the short term.

Recent trading activity underscores this cautious outlook:

* Friday's Closing Price: $22.45

* 12-Month Performance: -19.56%

* Cushion Above 52-Week Low: A mere 9.30%

The share price now trades perilously close to its critical 52-week low of $20.54.

Awaiting the Financial Report

Market attention now turns to February 11, 2026, when Kraft Heinz is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results before the market opens. While the stock currently offers a dividend yield of roughly 7%, the looming threat of a massive sale by its largest shareholder forces investors to judge whether this represents a genuine value opportunity or a classic ""value trap."" The upcoming earnings report will be crucial in determining if the company's underlying business is sufficiently robust to withstand the potential departure of its anchor investor.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2442124_100_100.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 22:58:30.687622

Silver and gold prices rose Friday, helped by sustained safe-haven demand amid lingering geopolitical risks.

Silver gained 6.42% to ₹3,18,960 per kg in the retail market, recovering from the previous day's fall. Gold rose 3% to ₹1,55,428 per 10 gm. With goods & services tax of 3%, a consumer has to shell out ₹1,60,090 per 10 gm of gold and ₹3,28,528 per kg of silver.

In the international market gold and silver surged to fresh all-time highs, with gold touching $4,970 a troy ounce and silver hitting $99.2 per troy ounce, marking also their strongest weekly performance since March 2020.

Volatility in prices is keeping consumers away from the physical market for the previous metals, putting the small and medium jewellers in trouble.

Market sentiment has been influenced also by US President Donald Trump's statement that he had secured permanent US access to Greenland through a NATO deal, though details remain unclear, and Denmark has reiterated its sovereignty. Trump also cancelled proposed tariffs on European imports, with the EU agreeing to suspend countermeasures while seeking clarity on future policy direction.

Live Events

Expectations of monetary easing in the US have also grown, as Trump is expected to appoint the next Federal Reserve chair, with markets pricing in a dovish candidate.

We’ll now examine how this improved holiday momentum in computing and gaming shapes Best Buy’s broader investment narrative for investors.

What Is Best Buy's Investment Narrative?

To own Best Buy, you have to believe that a mature, slower growing electronics retailer can still create value by squeezing more from its stores, services, and digital channels rather than chasing rapid expansion. The recent holiday update, with stronger demand in computing, gaming and mobile alongside better digital sales, slightly improves the near term picture for comps and supports management’s raised fiscal 2026 earnings guidance, but the stock’s muted short term returns suggest the market is not treating this as a game changer. Key catalysts now sit around whether that holiday strength shows up clearly in the upcoming fourth quarter numbers and margins, and whether e-commerce momentum can offset softer big ticket demand and tariff pressure. The biggest risk is that higher dividends and one off charges stretch already thin profit coverage if sales soften again.

However, one risk around dividend sustainability and thin margins is something investors should not ignore. Despite retreating, Best Buy's shares might still be trading above their fair value and there could be some more downside. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Six fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$53 to over US$140 per share, showing just how far apart individual views can be. Set against the recent holiday boost in computing and gaming and the ongoing pressure on margins and dividend cover, this wide range underlines why it helps to weigh multiple perspectives on Best Buy’s prospects before deciding what its shares are really worth.

Thyssenkrupp prüft den Verkauf einer Minderheitsbeteiligung an der Wälzlagersparte Rothe Erde. Das berichteten zwei mit der Angelegenheit vertraute Personen am Freitag. Die Nachricht kommt nicht völlig überraschend, denn die Essener erhalten nach eigenen Angaben regelmäßig Angebote für verschiedene Transaktionsmöglichkeiten.

Konkret geht es um rund 30 % der Anteile an Rothe Erde. Die Sparte, die zum Geschäftsbereich Thyssenkrupp Decarbon Technologies gehört, könnte dabei mit etwa 1,5 Milliarden Euro bewertet werden. Das entspricht umgerechnet rund 1,8 Milliarden Dollar. Für einen Konzern, der sich seit Jahren in der Umstrukturierung befindet, wäre das ein nicht zu unterschätzender Betrag.

Profitable Sparte lockt Interessenten an

Thyssenkrupp selbst äußerte sich vorsichtig zu den Spekulationen. In einer offiziellen Stellungnahme hieß es, Rothe Erde sei ein profitables Unternehmen und ein interessantes Asset innerhalb des Konzerns. Deshalb würden regelmäßig Angebote für verschiedene Transaktionsmöglichkeiten eingehen. Man halte alle Optionen offen und prüfe die jeweiligen Angebote, so der Konzern weiter.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Thyssenkrupp?

Diese Formulierung lässt durchaus Spielraum für Interpretationen. Einerseits wird die Profitabilität der Sparte betont, andererseits macht man keinen Hehl daraus, dass man grundsätzlich verkaufsbereit ist. Die Frage ist nur: Zu welchem Preis und unter welchen Bedingungen? Ein Teilverkauf würde Thyssenkrupp einerseits frisches Kapital bringen, andererseits aber auch die Kontrolle über eine profitable Einheit behalten.

Für Anleger bleibt abzuwarten, wie schnell sich hier konkrete Entwicklungen ergeben. Die Bewertung von 1,5 Milliarden Euro klingt ambitioniert, zeigt aber auch, dass Rothe Erde offenbar ein begehrtes Asset ist. Sollte der Deal zustande kommen, könnte das der Aktie neuen Schwung verleihen.

The product can be traded on Nasdaq.

Cryptocurrency ETFs receive new orders.

Grayscale, one of the largest digital asset investment managers, has taken another step to expand its presence in the cryptocurrency ETF market by filing a new registration request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proposal involves the launch of the Grayscale BNB ETF, an exchange-traded fund focused on the BNB token, linked to the Binance ecosystem.

According to document submitted to the SEC On Friday, the fund was structured to maintain direct exposure to the digital asset. According to the filing, the ETF “will hold 'BNB', which are digital assets based on an existing open-source cryptographic protocol on the BNB Smart Chain, comprising units that constitute the underlying assets of the fund's shares.” The description details how the product works and reinforces the focus on direct custody of the token.

BNB is the native token of the BNB Chain, a blockchain associated with Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the global market. The asset is among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and is widely used for fees, decentralized applications, and services within the network's ecosystem.

If it receives regulatory approval, the Grayscale BNB ETF will be traded on Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbol GBNB. The filing designates Bank of New York Mellon as the transfer agent for the fund, while Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, has been designated as the custodian of the digital assets, reinforcing the product's institutional structure.

Grayscale is not the first to seek an ETF linked to BNB. In May 2025, VanEck had already presented a similar proposal, which puts the asset manager in direct competition for space in a segment still in formation in the US market. The move occurs amidst a broader expansion of cryptocurrency ETFs, favored by a regulatory environment considered more receptive in the United States.

In recent months, funds linked to tokens such as Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, Hedera, and Chainlink have begun to integrate into the ETF market. Grayscale itself has already listed products linked to Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, and Chainlink, in addition to maintaining an active strategy of converting closed-end funds into ETFs. This week, the asset manager also signaled its intention to transform its fund linked to Near into an ETF, reinforcing its continued commitment to expanding its portfolio of cryptocurrency-related products.",,N,,2026-01-24 05:59:34.729275

On his final amyloid PET scan, he was still positive, but at a much reduced 33 centiloids.
To investigate, he assessed tau pathology with the PHF-1 antibody, which detects phosphorylation at S396/S404.
He found that amyloid PET scans taken after the initial treatment period, and again before therapy resumed in the OLE, looked much the same.
Tau pathology may be related to denser, more treatment-resistant plaques that are harder to remove.","23 Jan 2026

The 2026 Human Amyloid Imaging conference, held January 12–14, marked its second year in San Juan, Puerto Rico, following a 14-year run in Miami and some years of roving before that. The gathering featured 144 posters, 35 podium presentations, and one rather tricky quiz. Who knew Alois Alzheimer’s Ph.D. dissertation was on ear wax? Very few HAI attendees did. Nor, as it turns out, did your humble correspondent. Despite its amyloid-centric title, HAI spanned a broad range of topics and sparked lively discussion—for example on how best to quantify tau PET, what a plasma p-tau217 number means about risk for AD in cognitively normal people, and how to use AI to interpret amyloid scans.

One hot topic: postmortem analysis of trial data. It’s been just over 15 years since anti-amyloid antibodies first entered clinical trials, and five years since they reached clinical practice and data started trickling in from people who braved the first such therapies but have since passed away. Unlike PET imaging, postmortem pathology affords a granular view of what anti-amyloid antibodies are—and are not—accomplishing in a person’s brain. So far, the picture looks mixed: Some groups report amyloid clearance across the cortical expanse, while others find the effect to be patchy. What explains the difference is unclear; suspicion currently rests on baseline tau pathology.

One case that drew much attention at HAI came from David Wolk of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He described a 52-year-old man who sought care at the UPenn Alzheimer Disease Research Center after three years of worsening forgetfulness. Genetic testing revealed that he carried the TREM2 R47H variant, a mutation that raises Alzheimer’s disease risk three- to fourfold—about the same as carrying one ApoE4 allele.

On a PET scan, the man’s amyloid centiloid value was 139, a heavy burden. He enrolled in the EMERGE Phase 3 trial and received 16 doses of aducanumab over 22 months. After a 20-month gap, when the initial trial was discontinued following a futility analysis, he entered the open-label extension EMBARK, and received an additional 14 doses (Budd Haeberlein et al., 2022). On his final amyloid PET scan, he was still positive, but at a much reduced 33 centiloids.

His thinking and memory, as staged by the MMSE, held steady during EMBARK and for a couple more years afterward. Over time, thinking and daily functioning began to decline, and he developed trouble walking, becoming stiff and unsteady, like someone with Parkinson’s disease. He entered hospice care and died four and a half years after he had received his last dose of aducanumab.

This trial participant donated his brain to UPenn, where staining for amyloid with the NAB228 antibody showed that plaques were completely absent from the outer layers of his cortex and had also been cleared from deeper layers in some entire gyri—the brain’s curved ridges. In adjacent sulci, however, substantial amyloid remained, particularly in deeper cortical layers.

What explains this pattern? Wolk suspected tangles might be involved. To investigate, he assessed tau pathology with the PHF-1 antibody, which detects phosphorylation at S396/S404. This revealed a strikingly similar picture. Areas with extensive amyloid clearance, the gyri, had little to no detectable phosphorylated tau, while nearby sulci where amyloid had persisted were laden with phosphorylated tau. Slides showing this clear demarcation can be found in the HAI program book, but Wolk would not allow Alzforum to show them here.

Why this difference between the gyri and the sulci? Wolk thinks that regions where amyloid had been vanquished might have been spared from tau accumulation. “I think this primarily shows that in the absence of amyloid these brain regions seem to have not developed tau pathology despite the patient having not been on medicine for around four years, and despite these areas being in close proximity to regions with limited clearance of amyloid and significant amyloid and tau pathology,” Wolk told Alzforum. “It is also possible that some tau was removed in these regions also, but we cannot say that with certainty” he added.

“This shows how much we still have to learn about the biological effects of these therapies, and how important autopsy cases are for advancing our understanding,” said Gil Rabinovici of the University of California, San Francisco.

Considering four and a half years had passed between amyloid removal and autopsy, Rabinovici wondered if the staining pattern truly reflected differences in amyloid clearance between gyri and sulci, or whether some areas simply reaccumulated amyloid more quickly once treatment had ceased.

“That’s possible,” said Wolk. He noted that at CTAD last year, Lindsay Welikovitch from Brad Hyman’s group at Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, had calculated, based on time to autopsy, that amyloid plaques can slowly return after treatment stops, with burden rising over several years and tracking time off drug (Dec 2025 conference news). Indeed, Eisai has reported that cognition begins to worsen and amyloid PET signal rebounds after people stop taking lecanemab (Aug 2024 conference news). Likewise, people who had tested amyloid-negative during the Trailblazer-Alz2 trial and were taken off donanemab during the open-label extension began to reaccumulate amyloid at rates typically seen in untreated AD (Aug 2025 conference news).

To Christopher Brown, a postdoc in Wolk’s lab, reaccumulation seems less likely. He found that amyloid PET scans taken after the initial treatment period, and again before therapy resumed in the OLE, looked much the same. The gap between scans was only a year and a half; still, the images argue against amyloid springing back up in these regions, at least during this period, Brown said.

Joseph Masdeu of Houston Methodist Hospital asked if tau might only appear to be missing because its epitopes were masked by activated microglia. Wolk called this unlikely. He found that regions rich in tau contained activated-looking microglia and astrocytes, but in areas where amyloid had been cleared with no apparent tau pathology, glial morphology more closely resembled that of homeostatic microglia in healthy brain tissue. “This is an indication that the brain was getting back to normal,” said Wolk.

Scientists don’t know how representative this normalization might be among people who took aducanumab. Welikovitch had reported at CTAD that activated microglia and astrocytes persisted even after amyloid had been removed (Dec 2025 conference news).

Wolk’s findings also contrasted with those of Baayla Boon of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, who at HAI showed postmortem data from participants in the ENGAGE trial of aducanumab. In four cases, Boon found that plaques were nearly completely cleared from the upper layers of the cortex, though not across entire gyri. She had already presented this data at AAIC last year (Aug 2025 conference news).

Boon presented no tau data at HAI, but told Alzforum that she had stained postmortem tissue from these same four cases for p-tau using the AT8 antibody, which detects phosphorylation at serine 202 and threonine 205, and broadly labels both pretangle fibrils and mature tangles. She found abundant phospho-tau in superficial cortical layers where amyloid had been cleared (image below).

Why did tau pathology persist in Boon’s cases but not Wolk’s case? Boon said the different antibodies used might make a difference but, more importantly, she saw less plaque clearance than Wolk did. It could be that plaques need to be completely gone before the brain can take on tangles, she suggested.

A separate question is why immunotherapy removed plaques in some brain regions but not others. Matteo Tonietto of Hoffmann–La Roche in Basel, Switzerland, offered an explanation. His group asked whether baseline tau pathology influenced amyloid removal in people treated with gantenerumab. He drew on data from the Phase 3 GRADUATE trials, which ran from 2018 to late 2022. At HAI, Tonietto focused on 38 participants in the treatment group who’d had a tau PET scan at baseline, along with amyloid scans at baseline and again at the end, 116 weeks later.

Scrutinizing the scans region by region, the scientists became aware of a theme. Areas that already had more tangles at baseline tended to have less amyloid clearance during treatment, while areas that started out with a lighter tangle load saw more plaque removal (image below).

Regional Roadblock. Baseline tau levels plotted against treatment-related amyloid change, with each dot representing a different brain region. [Courtesy of Matteo Tonietto.]

Tonietto proposed two reasons why tau might influence amyloid removal. Tau pathology may be related to denser, more treatment-resistant plaques that are harder to remove. Tau pathology might also push microglia into a pro-inflammatory state that is ill-suited for clearing amyloid.

Mike Pontecorvo, who retired from Eli Lilly last year, echoed the latter idea. He suggested that when a person carries a high tau burden, their microglia may become overloaded and dysfunctional. Or both.—George Heaton

Alaska’s competitors faced some of the same headwinds and saw their profits climb year over year. Alaska, though still profitable in 2025, saw its profits drop 70% compared with the year before. Despite the rocky results, Alaska executives are still optimistic about the carrier’s expansion plans, sticking to long-term vision to boost revenue, reach new customers and turn its hometown Seattle hub into a global gateway by 2030.

On a Friday call with investors, Alaska executives said an industrywide drop in demand contributed to their decreased earnings, while acknowledging Alaska-specific issues such as “friction” in integrating the newly acquired Hawaiian Airlines and high real estate costs as the carrier expands.

“Last year was a year of transformation where we laid the groundwork for the next chapter of Alaska Air Group,” CEO Ben Minicucci told investors Friday. “It did not come without growing pains.”

Alaska Air Group — which includes Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines, as well as regional carrier Horizon Air and ground support company McGee Air Services — saw profits drop 74% in 2025 compared with the year prior, from $395 million to $100 million.

For the fourth quarter, which ended in December, profits dropped 70% year over year, from $71 million to $21 million.

Delta, meanwhile, saw a 44% jump in profit from 2024 to 2025, while United saw a nearly 7% increase.

All three carriers saw revenue growth, with Alaska increasing full-year operating revenue 21% compared with 2024, while United reported 3.5% growth and Delta 2.8%.

In an interview ahead of the earnings release Thursday, Alaska’s head of investor relations Ryan St. John said the biggest factor in Alaska’s 2025 results was a slump in demand that started in February and continued into the summer travel season.

Demand picked up again in the second half of the year, with a temporary slowdown in the fall during the government shutdown and resulting mandate to cut flights. Since then, St. John said, demand has continued to rebound this year, with Alaska recording some of its highest booking days in its history this month.

On Friday, Alaska executives again attributed much of the year’s performance to economic factors out of their control. On top of the change in demand, company leaders focused on volatile fuel prices on the West Coast, where there are few refineries available to provide the jet fuel carriers need. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport felt that firsthand in November, when a leak in the Olympic Pipeline forced airlines to turn to contingency plans to make sure flights kept operating smoothly.

For Alaska, a 10-cent change in fuel prices can result in a 75-cent change for the carrier’s earnings per share, Chief Financial Officer Shane Tackett said.

“We really need the West Coast refineries to stabilize. They just are not up and operating consistently enough,” Tackett said.

The airline is planning to work with communities and federal agencies to “smooth out” the issues with existing refineries and find new ways to bring more fuel to the West Coast, Tackett continued. But it would take a few years to get that initiative in place.

Alaska’s full year financial results included about $100 million of “transient ” costs that won’t occur in future quarters, Tackett told investors. He pointed to market labor agreements and increased real estate costs incurred as Alaska expands.

“Real estate costs continue to be the highest costs,” Tackett said. “All the investments that were necessary but being made in the core hubs, there is a cost reality that comes with that.”

All of the Alaska executives who spoke with The Seattle Times and with investors this week said the company has successfully integrated Hawaiian Airlines into its operations this year, checking several major milestones off its to-do list after completing its acquisition in September 2024.

But Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Harrison acknowledged Friday that the acquisition introduced some challenges that affected the company’s 2025 results.

“2025’s progress was slowed by macroeconomic challenges, and integration friction,” he said.

Most of the heavy lifting is now complete, Alaska said, including launching a joint loyalty program and receiving a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration. Alaska is still in the midst of transitioning to a single booking platform, but has already started using the new system to book future flights. In April, it will finalize the transition.

This year, Alaska also faced two significant IT outages caused by failures in the company’s data centers. In October, after the second disruptive outage, it hired consulting firm Accenture to evaluate its IT infrastructure.

On Friday, Minicucci and Tackett said the airline is investing in more resiliency and redundancy to its systems to prevent another breakdown.

“We’re making headway,” Tackett said. “We’ve got a lot of detailed plans ready to execute in the first quarter. We spent a good amount of time in the fourth quarter understanding what we need to do.”

The company has included those IT investments in its projections for 2026, Tackett said.

Alaska issued a wide range of guidance for next year — expecting earnings per share for the full year somewhere between $3.50 and $6.50. That’s a steep jump from 2025, which saw 18 cents earnings per share.

Facing several questions from analysts about that expansive range, Alaska leaders said they’ve baked in room for another year of economic pressures.

The best-case scenario assumes Alaska continues to reap rewards of its merger with Hawaiian and eliminates the one-time costs it faced this year. The worst-case scenario factors in another “deceleration” of demand and high fuel prices.

“Change can occur quickly in either direction,” Tackett said.

Analysts from JPMorgan Chase agree the airline faced external pressure in 2025 and is prepared to turn it around this year, they wrote in a note to investors Friday.

“There’s little doubt 2026 is starting off on the right foot,” the analysts wrote. “In Alaska’s case, their conservatism appears to be driven more by, well, conservatism … likely shaped by the tumultuous year the industry just experienced.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01232026_TZR_Alaska_Airlines_Anchorage-2025-AP_tzr_.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-23 22:01:06.369801

If we make such adjustment, the fractional undivided interest per Unit will vary from the amount indicated above. (2) The Public Offering Price shown above reflects the value of the Securities on the business day prior to the Initial Date of Deposit. The price you pay for your Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units. (3) You will pay a maximum sales charge of 1.85% of the Public Offering Price per Unit (equivalent to 1.88% of the net amount invested) which consists of an initial sales charge and a creation and development fee. Investors will not be assessed a sales charge on the portion of their Units represented by cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs and creation and development fee. (4) Each FLEX Option is generally valued based on the last quoted sale price where readily available and appropriate as discussed under ""Public Offering- The Value of the Securities."" On the Initial Date of Deposit, the evaluations for purposes of determining the purchase, sale or redemption price of Units will be at 2:30 p.m. Eastern time (the ""Initial Evaluation Time""). Subsequent to the Initial Date of Deposit, evaluations will be made as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each day on which it is open (the ""Evaluation Time""). (5) The Net Asset Value per Unit figure reflects the deduction of the creation and development fee and estimated organization costs, which will be deducted from the assets of the Trust at the end of the initial offering period. The Redemption Price per Unit does not reflect the deduction of such creation and development fee and estimated organization costs. See ""Redeeming Your Units."" (6) See ""Amending or Terminating the Indenture."" Page 3 Fee Table (Unaudited) This Fee Table describes the fees and expenses that you may, directly or indirectly, pay if you buy and hold Units of the Trust. See ""Public Offering"" and ""Expenses and Charges."" Although the Trust has a term of approximately 15 months, and is a unit investment trust rather than a mutual fund, this information allows you to compare fees.

The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Trust for the periods shown. The example also assumes a 5% return on your investment each year and that the Trust's operating expenses stay the same. The example does not take into consideration transaction fees which may be charged by certain broker/dealers for processing redemption requests. Although your actual costs may vary, based on these assumptions your costs, assuming you sell or redeem your Units at the end of each period, would be: 1 Year 15 Months ______ _________ $249 $255 The example will not differ if you hold rather than sell your Units at the end of each period. ________________ (a) The ""transactional sales charge"" consists entirely of an initial sales charge, deducted at the time of purchase. The initial sales charge is actually equal to the difference between the maximum sales charge of 1.85% and the amount of any remaining creation and development fee. Investors will not be assessed a sales charge on the portion of their Units represented by cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs and creation and development fee. (b) The creation and development fee compensates the Sponsor for creating and developing the Trust. The creation and development fee is a charge of $.050 per Unit collected at the end of the initial offering period, which is expected to be one day from the Initial Date of Deposit. If the price you pay for your Units exceeds $10.226 per Unit, the creation and development fee will be less than 0.49%; if the price you pay for your Units is less than $10.226 per Unit, the creation and development fee will exceed 0.49%. If you purchase Units after the initial offering period, you will not be assessed the creation and development fee. (c) Estimated organization costs, which include a one-time licensing fee, will be deducted from the assets of the Trust at the end of the initial offering period. Estimated organization costs are assessed on a fixed dollar amount per Unit basis which, as a percentage of average net assets, will vary over time. (d) Each of the fees listed herein is assessed on a fixed dollar amount per Unit basis which, as a percentage of average net assets, will vary over time. (e) Other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other portfolio transaction fees. In certain circumstances, the Trust may incur additional expenses not set forth above.

Page 4 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Unit Holders and the Sponsor, First Trust Portfolios L.P., of FT 12696 Opinion on the Statement of Net Assets We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets, including the schedule of investments, of FT 12696, comprising Vest Large Cap Deep Buffered 20 Portfolio, Series 99 (the ""Trust""), one of the series constituting the FT Series, as of the opening of business on January 23, 2026 (Initial Date of Deposit), and the related notes. In our opinion, the statement of net assets presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of the opening of business on January 23, 2026 (Initial Date of Deposit), in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion This statement of net assets is the responsibility of the Trust's Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this statement of net assets based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement of net assets is free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the statement of net assets, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the statement of net assets. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Trust's Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the statement of net assets. Our procedures included confirmation with the broker and confirmation of the irrevocable letter of credit held by The Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, and deposited in the Trust for the purchase of securities, as shown in the statement of net assets, as of the opening of business on January 23, 2026, by correspondence with the Trustee. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois January 23, 2026 We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies sponsored by First Trust Portfolios L.P. since 2001.

The Sponsor is responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require the Sponsor to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported herein. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust intends to comply in its initial fiscal year and thereafter with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and as such, will not be subject to federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income (including net realized capital gains) distributed to Unit holders. (1) The Trust invests in a portfolio of purchased and written FLEX Options. Aggregate cost of the purchased FLEX Options listed under ""Schedule of Investments"" and the liability for the written FLEX Options are based on their aggregate underlying value. The Securities were deposited at prices equal to their market value as determined by the Sponsor. The Trust has a Mandatory Termination Date of April 23, 2027. (2) An irrevocable letter of credit issued by The Bank of New York Mellon, of which approximately $300,000 has been allocated to the Trust, has been deposited with the Trustee as collateral, covering the monies necessary for the purchase of the Securities according to their purchase contracts $144,696 and cash $1,610. Cash is included in the Trust to cover the cost of the Trust's organization costs, the creation and development fee and the Trust's annual operating expenses. (3) The Trust will enter into option contracts which provide the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to buy a security at a predetermined exercise price on the option's expiration date and the Trust will also enter into option contracts which provide the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to sell a security to the Trust at a predetermined price on the option's expiration date. The option purchaser pays a premium to the option writer for the right to exercise the option. The option writer is obligated to sell or buy the security underlying the contract at a set price, if the option purchaser chooses to exercise the option. As a writer of an option contract, the Trust is not subject to credit risk but is subject to market risk, since the Trust is obligated to make payments under the terms of the option contract if exercised. (4) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount sufficient to reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of establishing the Trust. These costs have been estimated at $.0380 per Unit. A payment will be made at the end of the initial offering period to an account maintained by the Trustee from which the obligation of the investors to the Sponsor will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of the Trust are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Trust. (5) The creation and development fee ($.050 per Unit) is payable by the Trust on behalf of Unit holders out of assets of the Trust at the end of the initial offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to the close of the initial offering period, the fee will not be deducted from the proceeds. (6) Net asset value per Unit, as rounded to the nearest penny, is calculated by dividing the Trust's net assets by the number of Units outstanding. This figure includes organization costs and the creation and development fee, which will only be assessed to Units outstanding at the end of the initial offering period. (7) The aggregate cost to investors in the Trust, excluding the amount held in cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs and creation and development fee, includes a maximum sales charge computed at the rate of 1.85% of the Public Offering Price per Unit (equivalent to 1.88% of the net amount invested), assuming no reduction of sales charge as set forth under ""Public Offering.""

The Sponsor entered into purchase contracts for the Securities on January 23, 2026. Such purchase contracts are expected to settle within one business day. (2) Each FLEX Option contract entitles the holder thereof (i.e., the purchaser) to purchase (for the call options) or sell (for the put options) 100 shares of the SPDR(R) S&P 500(R) ETF Trust on the FLEX Option Expiration Date of April 23, 2027 at the FLEX Option's strike price multiplied by 100. The notional value of the FLEX Options as of the Initial Date of Deposit are as follows: Purchased Options: Call Options on SPY $137,582 Put Options on SPY $137,582 Written Options: Put Options on SPY $137,582 Call Options on SPY $137,582 (3) The cost or proceeds of the Securities to the Trust represents the aggregate underlying value with respect to the Securities acquired, generally determined based on the last quoted sale price where readily available and appropriate. On the Initial Date of Deposit, the value of the Securities will be based on the specific trade prices in which the Securities representing the Trust are executed. If no trades occur for a specific trade date or the Sponsor determines that market quotations are unavailable or inappropriate (e.g., due to infrequent transactions or thin trading), the Sponsor will determine the underlying value of the Securities based on their good faith determination of the fair value of the Securities at their discretion. To determine the fair value of the Securities, where available, the Sponsor will start with values generated using model prices provided by an independent third party, which uses a proprietary algorithm using standard option valuation variables and calculations. Where such values are not available through typical third party sources, the Sponsor will generate their own model- based valuations of the Securities, including using the Black-Scholes model for option valuation, and use current market quotations for comparable listed options that are more actively traded. The valuation of the Securities has been determined by the Sponsor. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820 (""ASC 820""), ""Fair Value Measurement,"" fair value is defined as the price that the Trust would either receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer an option's liability to Page 7 an independent buyer in a timely transaction in the principal or most advantageous market of the investment. ASC 820 established a three-tier hierarchy to maximize the use of the observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of the fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the technique or pricing model used to measure fair value and the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels: Level 1 which represents quoted prices in active markets for identical investments; Level 2 which represents fair value based on other significant observable inputs (including, quoted prices for similar investments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are non-active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default rates) or inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means), and Level 3 which represents fair value based on significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments). The Trust's investments in purchased options of $144,696 and written options of $(7,512) are classified as Level 2, whose valuations on the date of deposit were determined by the Sponsor using model prices provided by third-party pricing services. The inputs used by these third party pricing services were based upon significant observable inputs that included, but were not limited to, the items noted above. The cost of the Securities to the Sponsor and the Sponsor's loss (which is the difference between the cost of the Securities to the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to the Trust) are $137,224 and $40, respectively. Page 8 The FT Series The FT Series Defined. We, First Trust Portfolios L.P. (the ""Sponsor""), have created hundreds of similar yet separate series of a unit investment trust which we have named the FT Series. The series to which this prospectus relates, FT 12696, consists of a single portfolio known as Vest Large Cap Deep Buffered 20 Portfolio, Series 99. The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York by a Trust Agreement (the ""Indenture"") dated the Initial Date of Deposit. This agreement, entered into among First Trust Portfolios L.P., as Sponsor, The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee and First Trust Advisors L.P. as Portfolio Supervisor, governs the operation of the Trust. YOU MAY GET MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS CONCERNING THE NATURE, STRUCTURE AND RISKS OF THIS PRODUCT IN AN ""INFORMATION SUPPLEMENT"" BY CALLING THE SPONSOR AT 800- 621-1675, DEPT. CODE 2. How We Created the Trust. On the Initial Date of Deposit, we deposited a portfolio of FLEX Options and cash with the Trustee and, in turn, the Trustee delivered documents to us representing our ownership of the Trust in the form of units (""Units""). After the Initial Date of Deposit, we may deposit additional Securities in the Trust, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to buy more Securities, to create new Units for sale. If we create additional Units, we will attempt, to the extent practicable, to maintain the percentage relationship established among the Securities on the Initial Date of Deposit (as set forth under ""Schedule of Investments""), adjusted to reflect the sale, redemption or liquidation of any of the Securities or any stock split or a merger or other similar event affecting the issuer of the Securities. Since the prices of the Securities will fluctuate daily, the ratio of Securities in the Trust, on a market value basis, will also change daily. The portion of Securities represented by each Unit will not change as a result of the deposit of additional Securities or cash in the Trust. If we deposit cash, you and new investors may experience a dilution of your investment. This is because prices of Securities will fluctuate between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the Securities, and because the Trust pays the associated brokerage fees. To reduce this dilution, the Trust will try to buy the Securities as close to the Evaluation Time and as close to the evaluation price as possible. You may also experience a dilution of your investment when the Trust sells Securities to meet redemption requests as Securities are typically sold after the redemption request is received. Because the Trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the sale of Securities to meet redemption and exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses. TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A DILUTION TO YOUR INVESTMENT IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE THE HYPOTHETICAL RETURNS SET FORTH IN THIS PROSPECTUS. An affiliate of the Trustee may receive these brokerage fees or the Trustee may retain and pay us (or our affiliate) to act as agent for the Trust to buy Securities. If we or an affiliate of ours act as agent to the Trust, we will be subject to the restrictions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act""). When acting in an agency capacity, we may select various broker/dealers to execute securities transactions on behalf of the Trust, which may include broker/dealers who sell Units of the Trust. We do not consider sales of Units of the Trust or any other products sponsored by First Trust as a factor in selecting such broker/dealers. We cannot guarantee that the Trust will keep its present size and composition for any length of time. Securities may be periodically sold under certain circumstances to satisfy Trust obligations, to meet redemption requests and, as described in ""Removing Securities from the Trust,"" to maintain the sound investment character of the Trust, and the proceeds received by the Trust will be used to meet Trust obligations or distributed to Unit holders. However, Securities will not be sold to take advantage of market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation or depreciation, or if they no longer meet the criteria by which they were selected. You will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the Securities in the Trust. As the holder of the Securities, the Trustee will vote the Securities and, except as described in ""Removing Securities from the Trust,"" will endeavor to vote the Securities such that the Securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the Securities held by owners other than such Trust. Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for a failure in any of the Securities. However, if a contract for the purchase of any of the Securities initially deposited in the Trust fails, unless we can purchase substitute Securities (""Replacement Securities"") we will refund to you that portion of the purchase price and transactional sales charge resulting from the failed contract. Any Replacement Security the Trust acquires will be identical to those from the failed contract. Page 9 Portfolio Objective. The Trust seeks to provide returns that match the price return of the Underlying ETF up to a predetermined upside cap of 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) while providing a buffer against the first 20% of Underlying ETF losses (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) during the period from January 23, 2026 to April 23, 2027. Under normal market conditions, the Trust will invest at least 80% of its net assets in investments that provide exposure to large capitalization companies. The Trust is concentrated (i.e., invests 25% or more of Trust assets) in investments that provide exposure to the information technology sector. The Portfolio. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio consisting of purchased and written FLEX Options and cash to pay for the annual operating expenses, creation and development fee and organization costs of the Trust. Because a portion of your investment is held in cash to pay for these expenses, and the cap and buffer amounts are determined independent of the cash component, such expenses will not further reduce the cap and buffer amounts disclosed in this prospectus. The FLEX Options are listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (the ""CBOE"") and are guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation (the ""OCC""). The FLEX Options reference shares of the Underlying ETF which had a share price on the NYSE of $687.91 (the ""Initial Underlying ETF Level"") at the time the FLEX Options were executed and entitle or obligate the holder to purchase or sell shares of the Underlying ETF at each FLEX Option's strike price on April 23, 2027 (the ""FLEX Option Expiration Date""). The FLEX Options are all European style options, which means that they are exercisable at the strike price only on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The FLEX Options are intended to be liquidated on or prior to the FLEX Option Expiration Date, rather than be exercised, in order to avoid having the Trust receive shares of the Underlying ETF or be obligated to deliver shares of the Underlying ETF. The FLEX Options are intended to generate returns based on the price performance of the Underlying ETF. Please note that the Trust's performance will not reflect the payment of dividends by the Underlying ETF. The Underlying ETF is an exchange-traded fund (""ETF"") that seeks to track performance of the S&P 500(R) Index (the ""Underlying Index""). The Underlying Index is composed of selected stocks from five hundred (500) issuers, all of which are listed on national stock exchanges and spans a broad range of major industries. See ""The Underlying ETF and the Underlying Index"" on page 14. The Trust is designed for Unit holders who intend to purchase Units at the Trust's inception, the only day Units are available for sale, and hold them until April 23, 2027, the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, and seeks a percentage total return per Unit that increases by any percentage increase in the price of the Underlying ETF relative to the Initial Underlying ETF Level up to a maximum total return of 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs), 10.28% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and 11.80% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account) (the ""Capped Return""), while also providing downside ""buffered"" protection of up to the first 20% of the decline in the Underlying ETF (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) (""Buffered Protection""). Returns after application of the buffer will be reduced by -2.21% for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account and -0.87% for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account. See ""Fee Table"" in this prospectus for information regarding these fees and expenses. The Capped Return and the Buffered Protection are based on the life of the Trust and are not an annualized rate of return. The percentage increase or decrease of the Underlying ETF described above is the percentage increase or decrease of the Underlying ETF from when the FLEX Option strike levels are set on the initial date of deposit to the close of the market on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The Trust's ability to achieve its investment objective is dependent on Unit holders purchasing Units at a price equal to their initial net asset value ($10 per Unit) and holding them until the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the Initial Date of Deposit, which will be higher than $10 per Unit (the Trust's net asset value per Unit on the Initial Date of Deposit) because of the Trust's sales charges and organization costs, which will impact your potential returns. THE TRUST MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE HYPOTHETICAL RETURNS SET FORTH IN THIS PROSPECTUS. THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE MAY BE IMPACTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REDEMPTION ACTIVITY, A DILUTION OF YOUR INVESTMENT, UNUSUAL ECONOMIC EVENTS, MARKET MOVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FLEX OPTIONS. REDEMPTION ACTIVITY COULD CAUSE THE TRUST TO Page 10 RECOGNIZE INCOME THAT THE TRUST IS REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE TO MAINTAIN THE TRUST'S RIC STATUS AND AVOID THE EXCISE TAX. SELLING SECURITIES TO MAKE THESE DISTRIBUTIONS MAY IMPACT THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE. THE TRUST'S PORTFOLIO IS NOT MANAGED. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THE FLEX OPTIONS CANNOT MAINTAIN THEIR PROPER RATIOS, THERE MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE TRUST'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OR FOLLOW ITS PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY. Illustrative Market Scenarios. The Trust seeks to provide returns based on the price performance of the Underlying ETF for Units purchased on the Trust's Initial Date of Deposit at their initial net asset value of $10 per Unit and held until the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date as follows: - THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF INCREASES ABOVE A CAPPED RETURN OF 12.78%. If, at the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the price of the Underlying ETF increased by greater than or equal to 12.78% compared to the price of the Underlying ETF at the Trust's inception, the Trust seeks to provide Unit holders with a maximum total return of 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs), 10.28% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and 11.80% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account). If the price of the Underlying ETF increases above the Capped Return, Unit holders will not participate in those gains beyond the Capped Return. - THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF INCREASES BETWEEN 0% AND A CAPPED RETURN OF 12.78%. If, at the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the price of the Underlying ETF increased between 0% and 12.78% compared to the price of the Underlying ETF at the Trust's inception, the Trust seeks to provide Unit holders with a total return that increases by the approximate percentage increase of the price of the Underlying ETF, up to a maximum return of 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs), 10.28% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and 11.80% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account). - THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BETWEEN 0% AND 20%. If, at the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the price of the Underlying ETF decreased between 0% and 20% compared to the price of the Underlying ETF at the Trust's inception, the Trust seeks to provide Unit holders with a ""buffered"" total return of approximately 0.00% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs), -2.21% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and -0.87% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account). - THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BY GREATER THAN 20%. If, at the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the price of the Underlying ETF decreased by greater than 20% compared to the price of the Underlying ETF at the Trust's inception, the Trust seeks to provide Unit holders with a loss that is 20% less (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) than the loss of the Underlying ETF, with a maximum loss of approximately -80.44% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and -80.17% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account) (the ""Maximum Loss""). If the price of the Underlying ETF decreases by greater than 20%, Unit holders will only be protected against the first 20% of Underlying ETF losses. Page 11 Hypothetical Performance Return Chart The following chart illustrates the hypothetical returns that the Trust seeks to provide in certain illustrative scenarios. THIS CHART DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PAYMENT BY UNIT HOLDERS OF APPLICABLE SALES CHARGES AND ORGANIZATION COSTS, AS SUCH GAINS WILL BE DECREASED BY THE SALES CHARGES AND ORGANIZATION COSTS AND LOSSES WILL BE INCREASED BY THE SALES CHARGES AND ORGANIZATION COSTS. Please note that the chart assumes a capped return of approximately 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) and a buffer against the first 20% of Underlying ETF losses (before applicable sales charges and organization costs).

Page 12 What is a FLEX Option? The Trust's initial portfolio includes several types of FLEX Options including purchased and written put and call options (as further described below). The FLEX Options are all European style options, which means that they are exercisable at the strike price only on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. FLEX Options are customized option contracts available through national securities exchanges that are guaranteed for settlement by the OCC, a market clearinghouse. The FLEX Options are listed on the CBOE. FLEX Options provide investors with the ability to customize terms of an option, including exercise prices, exercise styles (European style versus American style options which are exercisable any time prior to the expiration date) and expiration dates, while achieving price discovery in competitive, transparent auctions markets and avoiding the counterparty exposure of the over-the-counter option positions. Each FLEX Option contract entitles the holder thereof (i.e., the purchaser of the FLEX Option) the option to purchase (for the call options) or sell (for the put options) 100 shares of the Underlying ETF as of the close of the market on the FLEX Option Expiration Date at the strike price multiplied by 100. The Trust is designed so that any amount owed by the Trust on the written FLEX Options will be covered by payouts at expiration from the purchased FLEX Options. As a result, the FLEX Options will be fully covered and no additional collateral will be necessary during the life of the Trust. The Trust receives premiums in exchange for the written FLEX Options and pays premiums in exchange for the purchased FLEX Options. The OCC and securities exchange that the FLEX Options are listed on do not charge ongoing fees to writers or purchasers of the FLEX Options during their life for continuing to hold the option contracts. The OCC guarantees performance by each of the counterparties to FLEX Options, becoming the ""buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer,"" protecting clearing members and options traders from counterparty risk. Subject to determination by the Securities Committee of the OCC, adjustments may be made to the FLEX Options for certain events (collectively, ""Corporate Actions"") specified in the OCC's by-laws and rules: certain stock dividends or distributions, stock splits, reverse stock splits, rights offerings, distributions, reorganizations, recapitalizations, or reclassifications with respect to an underlying security, or a merger, consolidation, dissolution or liquidation of the issuer of the underlying security. According to the OCC's by-laws, the nature and extent of any such adjustment is to be determined by the OCC's Securities Committee, in light of the circumstances known to it at the time such determination is made, based on its judgment as to what is appropriate for the protection of investors and the public interest, taking into account such factors as fairness to holders and writers (or purchasers and sellers) of the affected options, the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in the affected options, consistency of interpretation and practice, efficiency of exercise settlement procedures, and the coordination with other clearing agencies of the clearance and settlement of transactions in the underlying interest. The information set forth above relating to the FLEX Options and the OCC has been obtained from the OCC. The description and terms of the FLEX Options to be entered into with the OCC are set forth in the by-laws and rules of the OCC, available at www.optionsclearing.com, which is not considered part of this prospectus nor is it incorporated by reference herein. The Trust invests in in-the-money purchased call options, out-of-the-money written call options, at-the-money purchased put options and out-of-the-money written put options. The following discussion describes each type of security. In-The-Money Purchased Call Options (""ITM Purchased Call Options""). The ITM Purchased Call Options are call options purchased by the Trust, each with a strike price significantly lower than the Initial Underlying ETF Level. If the price of the Underlying ETF is less than or equal to the strike price of the ITM Purchased Call Options on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the ITM Purchased Call Options will expire without net proceeds being payable to the Trust (i.e., the ITM Purchased Call Options will expire worthless). If the price of the Underlying ETF is greater than the strike price on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, then the ITM Purchased Call Options are intended to provide a return to the Trust based on the difference between the strike price of the ITM Purchased Call Options and the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date equal to a per Unit dollar amount of proceeds of $10.000 multiplied by ((the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date divided by the Initial Underlying ETF Level) minus 0.00%) on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The ITM Purchased Call Options are intended to provide approximately one-to-one exposure to the Underlying ETF. Out-Of-The-Money Written Call Options (""OTM Written Call Options""). The OTM Written Call Options are call options written by the Trust, each with a strike price greater than the Initial Underlying ETF Level. If the price of the Underlying ETF is less than or equal to the strike price of the OTM Written Page 13 Call Options on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the OTM Written Call Options will expire without net proceeds being payable by the Trust (i.e., the OTM Written Call Options will expire worthless). If the price of the Underlying ETF is greater than the strike price on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, then the OTM Written Call Options are intended to provide for the Trust to deliver proceeds to the purchasers of the OTM Written Call Options based on the increase of the price of the Underlying ETF over the strike price of the OTM Written Call Options equal to a per Unit dollar amount of proceeds of $10.000 multiplied by ((the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date divided by the Initial Underlying ETF Level) minus 112.78%) on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The OTM Written Call Options are intended to provide premiums to the Trust that will offset the cost of the purchased FLEX Options and are also intended to limit the increase from the FLEX Options to 12.78%. At-The-Money Purchased Put Options (""ATM Purchased Put Options""). The ATM Purchased Put Options are put options purchased by the Trust, each with a strike price equal to the Initial Underlying ETF Level. If the price of the Underlying ETF is greater than or equal to the strike price of the ATM Purchased Put Options on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the ATM Purchased Put Options will expire without net proceeds being payable to the Trust (i.e., the ATM Purchased Put Options will expire worthless). If the price of the Underlying ETF is less than the strike price on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, then the ATM Purchased Put Options are intended to provide a return to the Trust based on the decrease between the Initial Underlying ETF Level and the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date equal to a per Unit dollar amount of proceeds of $10.000 multiplied by (100.00% minus (the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date divided by the Initial Underlying ETF Level)) on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. Out-Of-The-Money Written Put Options (""OTM Written Put Options""). The OTM Written Put Options are put options written by the Trust, each with a strike price less than the Initial Underlying ETF Level. If the price of the Underlying ETF is greater than or equal to the strike price of the OTM Written Put Options on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the OTM Written Put Options will expire without net proceeds being payable by the Trust (i.e., the OTM Written Put Options will expire worthless). If the price of the Underlying ETF is less than the strike price on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, then the OTM Written Put Options are intended to provide for the Trust to deliver proceeds to the purchasers of the OTM Written Put Options based on the decrease between the Initial Underlying ETF Level and the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date equal to a per Unit dollar amount of proceeds of $10.000 multiplied by (80.00% minus (the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date divided by the Initial Underlying ETF Level)) on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The ATM Purchased Put Options along with the OTM Written Put Options are intended to offset a decrease between the Initial Underlying ETF Level and the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date up to 20%. The Underlying ETF and the Underlying Index. The SPDR(R) S&P 500(R) ETF Trust (the ""Underlying ETF"") is an exchange-traded unit investment trust that uses a full replication strategy, meaning it invests entirely in the securities which comprise the S&P 500(R) Index (the ""Underlying Index""). PDR Services, LLC (""PDR"") serves as the Underlying ETF's sponsor. The investment objective of the Underlying ETF is to seek to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Underlying Index. See below for a description of the Underlying ETF's principal investment strategies and risks. You can find the Underlying ETF's prospectus and other information about the Underlying ETF, including the statement of additional information and most recent reports to shareholders, online at https://us.spdrs.com/en/etf/spdr-sp-500-etf-SPY. The summary information below regarding the Underlying ETF comes from its filings with the SEC (File No. 33-46080). You are urged to refer to the SEC filings made by the Underlying ETF and to other publicly available information (e.g., the Underlying ETF's annual reports) to obtain an understanding of the Underlying ETF's business and financial prospects. The following description of the Underlying ETF's principal investment strategies was taken directly from the Underlying ETF's prospectus, dated January 27, 2025 (defined terms have been modified). ""SPY seeks to achieve its investment objective by holding a portfolio of the common stocks that are included in the Index (the ""Portfolio""), with the weight of each stock in SPY's Portfolio substantially corresponding to the weight of such stock in the Index. In SPY's prospectus, the term ""Portfolio Securities"" refers to the common stocks that are actually held by SPY and make up SPY's Portfolio, while the Page 14 term ""Index Securities"" refers to the common stocks that are included in the Index, as determined by the index provider, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (""S&P""). At any time, SPY's Portfolio will consist of as many of the Index Securities as is practicable. To maintain the correspondence between the composition and weightings of Portfolio Securities and Index Securities, State Street Global Advisors Trust Company (the ""Trustee"") or its parent company, State Street Bank and Trust Company (""SSBT"") adjusts SPY's Portfolio from time to time to conform to periodic changes made by S&P to the identity and/or relative weightings of Index Securities in the Index. SPY's Trustee or SSBT aggregates certain of these adjustments and makes changes to SPY's Portfolio at least monthly, or more frequently in the case of significant changes to the Index. SPY may pay transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its Portfolio). Such transaction costs may be higher if there are significant rebalancings of Index Securities in the Index, which may also result in higher taxes when SPY's units are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in SPY's estimated annual Trust ordinary operating expenses, affect SPY's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, SPY's portfolio turnover rate was 3% of the average value of its portfolio. SPY's portfolio turnover rate does not include securities received or delivered from processing creations or redemptions of SPY's units. Portfolio turnover will be a function of changes to the Index as well as requirements of SPY's trust agreement.... Although SPY may fail to own certain Index Securities at any particular time, SPY generally will be substantially invested in Index Securities, which should result in a close correspondence between the performance of the Index and the performance of SPY....SPY does not hold or trade futures or swaps and is not a commodity pool.... The Index includes five hundred (500) selected companies, all of which are listed on national stock exchanges and spans a broad range of major industries....Since 1968, the Index has been a component of the U.S. Commerce Department's list of Leading Indicators that track key sectors of the U.S. economy. Current information regarding the market value of the Index is available from market information services. The Index is determined, comprised and calculated without regard to SPY."" As of January 21, 2026, the Underlying ETF had significant investments in information technology companies.

Of course, as with any similar investment, there can be no guarantee that the objectives of the Trust will be achieved. See ""Risk Factors"" for a discussion of the risks of investing in the Trust. Hypothetical Examples The examples that follow illustrate various scenarios with respect to the FLEX Options held by the Trust. The assumptions made in connection with these examples may not reflect actual events. You should not take any example as an indication or assurance of the expected performance of the Underlying ETF, the FLEX Options or the Trust Units. These examples do not attempt to present any projection of actual Trust performance. These examples are merely intended to illustrate the operation of the FLEX Options and the return or loss in certain situations. The hypothetical returns shown below do not reflect the deduction of the Trust's sales charges or organization costs. Please note that the examples assume a capped return of approximately 12.78% (before the applicable sales charges and Page 15 organization costs) and a buffer against the first 20% of Underlying ETF losses (before applicable sales charges and organization costs). EXAMPLE 1 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF INCREASES BY 40% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the FLEX Option Expiration Date closing price of the Underlying ETF increase by 40% over the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would provide a hypothetical return of approximately $1,127.80 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $1,399.98 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Put Options or the ATM Purchased Put Options, as each would expire worthless, - losing value of approximately $272.21 on the OTM Written Call Options, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example, participation in the appreciation of the Underlying ETF is capped by the Capped Return feature. Therefore, an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust does not benefit from the full appreciation of the Underlying ETF during the term of the Trust. Because of the Capped Return feature, return will be less than a direct investment in the Underlying ETF, which would not be subject to such a Capped Return. In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust is not affected by the Buffered Protection feature or the Maximum Loss feature. In this example, the hypothetical total return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately 12.78%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than 12.78% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. EXAMPLE 2 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF INCREASES BY 5% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the expiration date closing price represent a 5% increase over the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would provide a hypothetical return of approximately $1,050.01 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $1,049.98 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Put Options, the ATM Purchased Put Options or OTM Written Call Options, as each would expire worthless, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example, upside exposure to the Underlying ETF is similar to the price return (not including returns from dividends) available from a direct investment in the Underlying ETF because the performance of the Underlying ETF did not exceed the Capped Return. In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust is not affected by the Buffered Protection feature, the Maximum Loss feature or the Capped Return feature. In this example, the hypothetical total return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately 5.00%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than 5.00% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. EXAMPLE 3 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BY 5% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the expiration date closing price represent a 5% decrease from the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would Page 16 provide a hypothetical return of approximately $1,000.01 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $949.98 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - receiving value of approximately $50.00 on the ATM Purchased Put Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Put Options or OTM Written Call Options, as each would expire worthless, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example there are benefits from the Buffered Protection feature provided where the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date represents a decrease from the Initial Underlying ETF Level, but by less than 20%. Because of the Buffered Protection feature, the Unit holder's return would be better than the price return (not including returns from dividends) from a direct investment in the Underlying ETF. In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust is not affected by the Maximum Loss feature or Capped Return feature. In this example, the hypothetical total return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately 0.00%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than 0.00% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. EXAMPLE 4 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BY 50% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the expiration date closing price represent a 50% decrease from the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would provide a hypothetical return of approximately $700.01 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $499.98 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - receiving value of approximately $500.00 on the ATM Purchased Put Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Call Options, as they would expire worthless, - losing value of approximately $300.00 on the OTM Written Put Options, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example, there is a loss less than the loss that would have resulted from a direct investment in the Underlying ETF (not including returns from dividends). In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust benefits from the Buffered Protection feature, and is not affected by the Maximum Loss feature or Capped Return feature. In this example, the hypothetical loss on a investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately -30.00%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than -30.00% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. EXAMPLE 5 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BY 95% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the expiration date closing price represent a 95% decrease from the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would provide a hypothetical return of approximately $250.01 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $49.99 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - receiving value of approximately $949.99 on the ATM Purchased Put Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Call Options, as they would expire worthless, - losing value of approximately $750.00 on the OTM Written Put Options, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example, there are benefits from the Buffered Protection feature and a loss less than the loss that would have resulted from a direct investment in the Underlying ETF (not including returns from dividends). In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust is not affected by the Capped Return feature. Page 17 In this example, the hypothetical loss on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately -75.00%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than -75.00% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. THE RETURN ON UNITS REDEEMED PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION OF THE TRUST WILL LIKELY BE LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE AND THE RETURN THAT A UNIT HOLDER COULD EXPECT IF UNITS WERE HELD UNTIL THE TRUST'S TERMINATION. IN ADDITION, DURING THE LIFE OF THE TRUST, THE UNIT VALUE WILL NOT MOVE PROPORTIONALLY WITH CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF. ANY REDEMPTION OF UNITS PRIOR TO THE TRUST'S TERMINATION COULD RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS.

Page 18 THESE EXAMPLES DO NOT SHOW THE PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF OR ANY INVESTMENT. THESE EXAMPLES ARE FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS OF THE UNDERLYING ETF, THE FLEX OPTIONS OR THE TRUST'S UNITS. YOU MAY REALIZE A RETURN THAT IS LOWER THAN THE INTENDED RETURNS DESCRIBED ABOVE AS A RESULT OF UNITS BEING REDEEMED PRIOR TO THE TRUST'S MANDATORY TERMINATION DATE, PURCHASING UNITS AT A PRICE OTHER THAN THE INITIAL NET ASSET VALUE OF THE UNITS ON THE INITIAL DATE OF DEPOSIT, IN THE EVENT THAT THE FLEX OPTIONS ARE OTHERWISE LIQUIDATED BY THE TRUST PRIOR TO EXPIRATION, IF THERE IS A LACK OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE FLEX OPTIONS DURING THE LIFE OF THE TRUST OR ON THE FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE, IF THE TRUST IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE PROPORTIONAL RELATIONSHIP OF THE FLEX OPTIONS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FLEX OPTION CONTRACTS IN THE TRUST'S PORTFOLIO, IF A CORPORATE ACTION (DEFINED ABOVE) OCCURS WITH RESPECT TO THE UNDERLYING ETF, OR AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN POTENTIAL TAX-RELATED EXPENSES AND OTHER EXPENSES OF THE TRUST ABOVE ESTIMATED LEVELS. Risk Factors Price Volatility Risk. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance of the Trust will be positive over any period of time, or that you won't lose money. The Trust invests in FLEX Options. The value of the Trust's Units will fluctuate with changes in the value of the FLEX Options. The value of your Units may fall over time. Amounts available to distribute to Unit holders on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date will depend primarily on the performance of the FLEX Options and are not guaranteed. The Trust seeks to provide returns related to the price performance of the Underlying ETF only, which does not include returns from distributions paid by the Underlying ETF. The Units, on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date and at any other point in time, may be worth less than your original investment. In addition, during the life of the Trust, the Unit value will not move proportionally with changes in the value of the Underlying ETF. The Trust's investment strategy has not been designed to achieve its objective if Units are bought after the Trust's Initial Date of Deposit or redeemed prior to the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date. Because the Trust is not managed, the Trustee will not sell Securities in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations, as is common in managed investments. Units of the Trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Underlying ETF Market Risk. The FLEX Options represent indirect positions in the Underlying ETF and are subject to risks associated with changes in value as the price of the Underlying ETF rises or falls. The investment in the FLEX Options includes the risk that their value may be affected by market risk related to the Underlying ETF, the Underlying Index and the value of the securities in the Underlying Index held by the Underlying ETF. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities will fluctuate. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of an issuer, ratings on a bond, or political or economic events affecting the issuer. While the FLEX Options are individually related to the Underlying ETF, the return on the FLEX Options depends on the price of the Underlying ETF at the close of the NYSE on the FLEX Option Expiration Date and will be substantially determined by market conditions and the Underlying ETF and the value of the securities comprising the Underlying ETF as of such time. Common Stocks Risk. The Underlying ETF is an ETF that seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the S&P 500(R) Index. The value of the Underlying ETF will fluctuate over time based on changes in the value of the Underlying Index and securities represented by the Underlying ETF, which are subject to risks associated with investments in common stocks. Common stocks are subject to the risk that their prices will fall. Common stock prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market, such as market volatility, or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur. Common stock prices may also be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase, negatively impacting issuers. Common stocks represent a proportional share of ownership in a company. Shareholders of common stocks have rights to receive payments that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks of, such issuers. Common stocks are structurally subordinated to preferred stocks, bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and represent a residual claim on the issuer's assets that have no value unless such assets are sufficient to cover all other claims. Page 19 Concentration Risk. When 25% or more of a trust's portfolio is invested in securities that provide exposure to companies within a single sector, the trust is considered to be concentrated in that particular sector. A portfolio concentrated in one or more sectors may present more risks than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. The Trust is concentrated in investments that provide exposure to the information technology sector. Information Technology. A significant percentage of the stocks held by the Underlying ETF are issued by information technology companies. Technology companies are generally subject to the risks of rapidly changing technologies; short product life cycles; fierce competition; aggressive pricing; frequent introduction of new or enhanced products; the loss of patent, copyright and trademark protections; cyclical market patterns; evolving industry standards; and frequent new product introductions. Technology companies may be smaller and less experienced companies, with limited product lines, markets or financial resources. Technology company stocks have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to their operating performance. Also, the stocks of many Internet companies have exceptionally high price to earnings ratios with little or no earnings histories. Equity Investing Risk. Because the Trust holds FLEX Options that reference the Underlying ETF, the Trust has exposure to an investment in the Underlying ETF, which involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund of equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. An investment in the Underlying ETF is subject to the risks of any investment in a broadly based portfolio of common stocks, including the risk that the general level of stock prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment. The value of securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the securities, the value of common stocks generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of the securities change from time to time. The financial condition of issuers of the securities may become impaired or the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate, either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio and thus in the value of units. Since the Underlying ETF is not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not result in its elimination from the portfolio unless such issuer is removed from the Index. Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises. Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the rights of common stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Common stock values are subject to market fluctuations as long as the common stock remains outstanding. The value of the portfolio will fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust. Large Capitalization Companies Risk. The securities held by the Underlying ETF are issued by large capitalization companies. The return on investment in stocks of large capitalization companies may be less than the return on investment in stocks of small and/or mid capitalization companies. Large capitalization companies may also grow at a slower rate than the overall market. Capped Upside Risk. The Trust's strategy seeks to provide returns that match those of the Underlying ETF for Units purchased on the Trust's Initial Date of Deposit and held for the entire Outcome Period, subject to a pre-determined upside cap. If an investor does not hold its Units for the entire Outcome Period, the returns realized by that investor may not match those that the Trust seeks to achieve. If the Underlying ETF experiences gains during the Outcome Period, the Trust will not participate in those gains beyond the cap. If the anticipated return approaches the cap during the life of the Trust, some investors may choose to redeem early. Such behavior may impose increased costs on the Trust, reducing the return to the remaining Unit holders. Buffered Loss Risk. There can be no guarantee that the Trust will be successful in its strategy to buffer against Underlying ETF losses if the Underlying ETF decreases over the Outcome Period by 20% or less. A Unit holder may lose their entire investment. The Trust's strategy seeks to deliver returns that match the price return of the Underlying ETF (up to the cap), Page 20 while covering the first 20% of downside losses, if Units are bought on the day on which the Trust enters into the FLEX Options and held until those FLEX Options expire at the end of the Outcome Period. In the event an investor sells or redeems Units prior to the expiration of the FLEX Options, the buffer that the Trust seeks to provide may not be available. Dilution Risk. If we deposit cash, you and new investors may experience a dilution of your investment. This is because prices of Securities will fluctuate between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the Securities, and because the Trust pays the associated brokerage fees. To reduce this dilution, the Trust will try to buy the Securities as close to the Evaluation Time and as close to the evaluation price as possible. You may also experience a dilution of your investment when the Trust sells Securities to meet redemption requests. Because the Trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the sale of Securities to meet redemption and exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses. To the extent there is a dilution to your investment it is highly likely that you will not receive the hypothetical returns set forth in this prospectus. Outcome Period Risk. The Trust's investment strategy is designed to deliver returns that match those of the Underlying ETF if Units are bought on the day on which the Trust enters into the FLEX Options (i.e., the first day of the Outcome Period) and held until those FLEX Options expire at the end of the Outcome Period, subject to the predetermined upside return cap. In the event an investor purchases Units after the first day of the Outcome Period or sells or redeems Units prior to the end of the Outcome Period, the value of that investor's investment in their Units may not be buffered against a decline in the value of the Underlying ETF and may not participate in a gain in the value of the Underlying ETF up to the cap for the investor's investment period. FLEX Options Risk. Trading FLEX Options involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities. The Trust may experience substantial downside from specific FLEX Option positions and certain FLEX Option positions may expire worthless. The FLEX Options are listed on an exchange; however, no one can guarantee that a liquid secondary trading market will exist for the FLEX Options. In the event that trading in the FLEX Options is limited or absent, the value of the Trust's FLEX Options may decrease. In a less liquid market for the FLEX Options, liquidating the FLEX Options may require the payment of a premium (for written FLEX Options) or acceptance of a discounted price (for purchased FLEX Options) and may take longer to complete. A less liquid trading market may adversely impact the value of the FLEX Options and Trust Units and result in the Trust being unable to achieve its investment objective. Less liquidity in the trading of the Trusts FLEX Options could have an impact on the prices paid or received by the Trust for the FLEX Options in connection with redemptions of the Trust's Units. Depending on the nature of this impact to pricing, the Trust may be forced to pay more for redemptions than the price at which it currently values the FLEX Options. Such overpayment could reduce the Trust's ability to maintain the cap and buffer. Additionally, in a less liquid market for the FLEX Options, the liquidation of a large number of options may more significantly impact the price. A less liquid trading market may adversely impact the value of the FLEX Options and the value of your investment. The trading in FLEX Options may be less deep and liquid than the market for certain other exchange-traded options, non-customized options or other securities. Transactions in FLEX Options are required to be centrally cleared. In a transaction involving FLEX Options, the Trust's counterparty is the OCC, rather than a bank or broker. Since the Trust is not a member of the OCC and only members (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the OCC, the Trust will hold its FLEX Options through accounts at clearing members. Although clearing members guarantee performance of their clients' obligations to the OCC, there is a risk that the assets of the Trust might not be fully protected in the event of a clearing member's bankruptcy, as the Trust would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the clearing member's customers for the relevant account class. Additionally, the OCC may be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the FLEX Options contracts. FLEX Options Valuation Risk. The FLEX Options held by the Trust will be exercisable at the strike price only on their expiration date. Prior to the expiration date, the value of the FLEX Options will be determined based upon market quotations or using other recognized pricing methods. The value of the FLEX Options does not increase or decrease at the same rate as the Underlying ETF (although they generally move in the same direction) or its underlying securities and FLEX Option prices may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period of time. The value of the FLEX Options prior to the expiration date may vary because of factors other than the value of the Underlying ETF, such as interest rate changes, changing supply and demand, decreased liquidity of the FLEX Options, a change in the actual and perceived volatility of the stock market and the Underlying ETF and the Page 21 remaining time to expiration. An increase in the value of the written FLEX Options reduces the value of your Units. As the value of the written FLEX Options increases, the written FLEX Options have a more negative impact on the value of your Units. You should note that even if the value of the Underlying ETF does not change, if the value of a written FLEX Option increases (for example, based on increased volatility of the Underlying Index) your Units will lose value. After the premium is received on the written FLEX Options, the written FLEX Options will reduce the value of your Units. During periods of reduced market liquidity or in the absence of readily available market quotations for the holdings of the Trust, the ability of the Sponsor to value the FLEX Options based on their good faith determination of the fair value becomes more difficult and the judgment of the Sponsor may play a greater role in the valuation of the Trust's holdings due to reduced availability of reliable objective pricing data. Consequently, while such determinations may be made in good faith, it may nevertheless be more difficult for the Trust to accurately assign a daily value and could result in greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used. Under those circumstances, the value of the FLEX Options will require more reliance on the Sponsor's judgment than that required for securities for which there is an active trading market. This creates a risk of mispricing or improper valuation of the FLEX Options which could impact the value of the Trust's Units. There is no assurance that the Trust could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Trust would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the Trust at that time. In addition, the Trust's ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers. Investment in the Underlying ETF Risk. Because the Trust holds FLEX Options that reference a fund, Unit holders are subject to the risk that the securities selected by the fund's investment advisor will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds. Further, the fund may in the future invest in other types of securities which involve risk which may differ from those set forth below. The fund referenced by the FLEX Options held by the Trust may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers. ETFs Risk. ETFs are investment pools that hold other securities. The FLEX Options represent indirect positions in the Underlying ETF, which is an ETF, and are subject to risks associated with changes in value of the Underlying ETF, such as the following: - Index Correlation and Tracking Error Risk. While the Underlying ETF is intended to track the performance of the Underlying Index, the Underlying ETF's returns may not match or achieve a high degree of correlation with the return of the Underlying Index. Index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an index-based ETF will vary from the actual performance of the fund's target index, known as ""tracking error."" This can happen due to transaction costs, market impact, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin- offs) and timing variances. In addition, it is possible that the Underlying ETF may not always fully replicate the securities contained in the Underlying Index. - Market Trading Risk. The Underlying ETF is structured as a unit investment trust registered under the 1940 Act. Unlike typical open-end funds or unit investment trusts, ETFs generally do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value. Shares of ETFs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the ETF shares may decrease. The amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors. ETFs generally sell and redeem shares in large blocks (often known as ""Creation Units""). In addition, securities exchanges list ETF shares for trading, which allows investors to purchase and sell individual ETF shares at current market prices throughout the day. ETFs therefore possess characteristics of traditional open-end funds and unit investment trusts, which issue redeemable shares, and of corporate common stocks or closed-end funds, which generally issue shares that trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges and are not redeemable. - Passive Investment Risk. The Underlying ETF is a passively-managed index fund that seeks to replicate the performance and composition of the Underlying Index. As a result, the Underlying ETF will hold constituent securities of the Underlying Index regardless of the current or projected performance on a specific security or particular industry or market sector. Maintaining investments in the securities regardless of market conditions of the Page 22 performance of individual securities could cause the Underlying ETF's returns to be lower than if it employed an active strategy. Counterparty Risk. Trust transactions involving a counterparty are subject to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the Trust. Counterparty risk may arise because of the counterparty's financial condition (i.e., financial difficulties, bankruptcy, or insolvency), market activities and developments, or other reasons, whether foreseen or not. A counterparty's inability to fulfill its obligation may result in significant financial loss to the Trust. The Trust may be unable to recover its investment from the counterparty or may obtain a limited recovery, and/or recovery may be delayed. The OCC acts as guarantor and central counterparty with respect to the FLEX Options. As a result, the ability of the Trust to meet its objective depends on the OCC being able to meet its obligations. In the unlikely event that the OCC becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its settlement obligations, the Trust could suffer significant losses. Tax Risk. The Trust intends to treat any income it may derive from the FLEX Options as ""qualifying income"" under the provisions of the Code applicable to regulated investment companies (""RICs""). In addition, based upon language in the legislative history, the Trust intends to treat the issuer of the FLEX Options as the referenced asset, which, assuming the referenced asset qualifies as a RIC, would allow the Trust to qualify for special rules in the RIC diversification requirements. If the income is not qualifying income or the issuer of the FLEX Options is not appropriately the referenced asset, the Trust could lose its own status as a RIC. Regulated Investment Company Qualification Risk. To maintain its status as a RIC, the Trust must distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income annually. In addition, to avoid a non-deductible excise tax, the Trust must distribute at least 98% of its ordinary income and at least 98.2% of its capital gain net income. The Trust has entered into option agreements with the same counterparty and taken the position that the option agreements are separate agreements. Under general tax principles, a regulated investment company would not accrue income on separate option agreements during the term of the agreements. However, if the agreements are treated as one agreement, the Trust might be required to accrue income currently during the term and make annual distributions of income. If the Trust is required to accrue income but does not distribute the income to the investors, the Trust may fail to qualify as a regulated investment company. In addition, if the agreements are treated as one agreement, the Trust may fail either or both of the RIC income and diversification tests. Separately, depending upon the circumstances, sales to fund redemptions could cause the Trust to recognize income that the Trust is required to distribute to maintain the Trust's RIC status and avoid the excise tax. Funding such distributions could require additional sales, which could require more distributions and affect the projected performance of the Trust. Alternatively, if the Trust only makes distributions to maintain its RIC status and becomes subject to the excise tax, that could also affect the projected performance of the Trust. In either case, the assets sold to fund redemptions, distributions or pay the excise tax will not be available to assist the Trust in meeting its target outcome. If the Trust fails to qualify as a regulated investment company, it will be subject to tax as a C corporation. Section 1258 Risk. Section 1258 of the Internal Revenue Code requires the gain from conversion transactions to be recharacterized as ordinary income. The Trust contains a straddle, which would generally produce ordinary income or short term capital gain. When a transaction sold as producing capital gains from certain types of investments, including straddles that create a return tied to the time value of money, the transaction may be treated as a conversion transaction, and all gain from the transaction may be treated as ordinary income. Early Trust Termination Risk. The Trustee has the power to terminate your Trust early in limited cases as described under ""Amending or Terminating the Indenture"" including if the value of the Securities owned by the Trust as shown by any evaluation is less than the lower of $2,000,000 or 20% of the total value of Securities deposited in the Trust during the initial offering period. This could result in a reduction in the value of Units and result in a significant loss to investors. Distributions Risk. If the amount of cash in the Income and Capital Accounts of the Trust are insufficient to provide for expenses and other amounts payable by the Trust, the Trust may sell Securities to pay such amounts. These sales may result in losses to Unit holders and the inability of the Trust to meet its investment objective. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its size or composition. Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security, or Units of the Trust in general, may fall in value or underperform other investments. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic, political, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. The Federal Reserve has begun to lower interest rates and may continue to do so in the future. Potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking Page 23 industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Additionally, challenges in commercial real estate markets, including declining valuations and elevated vacancies, could have a broader impact on financial markets. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, political turbulence or other events could have a significant negative impact on the Trust and its investments. The ongoing adversarial political climate in the United States, as well as political and diplomatic events both domestic and abroad, have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. regulatory landscape, markets and investor behavior, which could have a negative impact on the Trust's investments and operations. The change in administration resulting from the 2024 United States national elections could result in significant impacts to international trade relations, tax and immigration policies, and other aspects of the national and international political and financial landscape, which could affect, among other things, inflation and the securities markets generally. Administrative actions against companies in certain industries, such as the defense industry, prohibiting them from paying dividends or engaging in stock buybacks, may negatively impact the performance of such companies and the Trust's investments. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Iran, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities could have a significant impact on certain Trust investments as well as Trust performance. The economies of the United States and its trading partners, as well as the financial markets generally, may be adversely impacted by trade disputes, including the imposition of tariffs, and other matters. A public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks in response, could cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. Advancements in technology may also adversely impact markets and the overall performance of the Trust. For instance, the economy may be significantly impacted by the advanced development and increased regulation of artificial intelligence. Additionally, cybersecurity breaches of both government and non-government entities could have negative impacts on infrastructure and the ability of such entities, including the Trust, to operate properly. Such events could adversely affect the prices and liquidity of the Trust's portfolio securities and could result in disruptions in the trading markets. Any such circumstances could have a materially negative impact on the value of the Trust's Units and result in increased market volatility. Absence of an Active Market in the Underlying ETF Risk. The Underlying ETF faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Underlying ETF shares due to a limited number of market markers or authorized participants. The Underlying ETF may rely on a small number of third-party market makers to provide a market for the purchase and sale of shares and market makers are under no obligation to make a market in the Underlying ETF's shares. Additionally, only a limited number of institutions act as authorized participants for the Underlying ETF and only an authorized participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Underlying ETF and are not obligated to submit purchase or redemption orders for creation units. Decisions by market makers or authorized participants to reduce their role or step away from these activities in times of market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process in maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of the Underlying ETF's portfolio securities and the Underlying ETF's market price. Any trading halt or other problem relating to the trading activity of these market makers or any issues disrupting the authorized participants' ability to proceed with creation and/or redemption orders could result in a dramatic change in the spread between t",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-23 19:59:55.377538

NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Federal judges rejected DoorDash's, ‌Uber ​Technologies' and Instacart's bids for injunctions ‌to block a series of New York City laws governing food-delivery apps, including ​a requirement that they give customers an option to tip delivery workers when paying.

U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan ‍said DoorDash and Uber did not show ​a clear likelihood that a requirement that they suggest a minimum 10% tip before customers place orders ​would violate their constitutional ⁠free speech rights.

Daniels said the tipping laws ""advance the city's goals of enhancing cost transparency at the time of checkout, restoring consumer choice, and providing protections to delivery workers.""

Separately, U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan rejected Instacart's argument that New York's state legislature forbade the city from mandating the tipping option, and from ‌requiring grocery delivery apps such as Instacart to offer delivery workers the same minimum pay available to ​restaurant delivery ‌workers.

The companies, all based in ‍San Francisco, warned ⁠that the laws could reduce business.

DoorDash and Uber said the tipping disclosure rule would dissuade customers burdened by rising prices and ""tipping fatigue"" from ordering, while Instacart said raising worker pay could lead to higher grocery delivery costs.

Both decisions are dated January 22 and were made public on Friday. The laws take effect on January 26.

MAMDANI CRITICIZED DELIVERY APP INDUSTRY

All three companies said they plan appeals.

""Forcing platforms to solicit a tip before checkout at a time when New Yorkers are ​sick of tipping culture and facing a growing affordability crisis is bad policy,"" a spokesperson for DoorDash said.

Uber's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.

A spokesperson for Instacart, the trade name for publicly traded Maplebear, called Koeltl's decision ""a step in the wrong direction for New York workers and families.""

New York City has had several court battles with delivery app companies, including over a first-in-the-nation law in 2023 that guaranteed minimum pay for workers.

It also accused DoorDash and Uber of making changes, which the city labeled ""design tricks,"" to their platforms since the minimum pay law took effect, costing delivery workers $554 million in tips even as tipping on rival platforms held steady.

New York ​City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has criticized the delivery app industry. Last week, his administration warned DoorDash, Uber, Instacart, Grubhub and other companies to comply with tipping and other worker protection laws.

Sam Levine, commissioner of New York City's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, said the judges' decisions ""ensure that workers ​get paid, and consumers have the option to tip freely.""

In a blog post on Thursday, OpenAI disclosed how it is using the open-source PostgreSQL database.

OpenAI runs ChatGPT and its API platform for 800 million users on a single-primary PostgreSQL instance — not a distributed database, not a sharded cluster. One Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server handles all writes. Nearly 50 read replicas spread across multiple regions handle reads. The system processes millions of queries per second while maintaining low double-digit millisecond p99 latency and five-nines availability.

The setup challenges conventional scaling wisdom and offers enterprise architects insight into what actually works at massive scale.

T he lesson here isn’t to copy OpenAI’s stack. It’s that architectural decisions should be driven by workload patterns and operational constraints — not by scale panic or fashionable infrastructure choices. OpenAI’s PostgreSQL setup shows how far proven systems can stretch when teams optimize deliberately instead of re-architecting prematurely.

""For years, PostgreSQL has been one of the most critical, under-the-hood data systems powering core products like ChatGPT and OpenAI’s API,"" OpenAI engineer Bohan Zhang wrote in a technical disclosure. ""Over the past year, our PostgreSQL load has grown by more than 10x, and it continues to rise quickly.""

The company achieved this scale through targeted optimizations, including connection pooling that cut connection time from 50 milliseconds to 5 milliseconds and cache locking to prevent 'thundering herd' problems where cache misses trigger database overload.

Why PostgreSQL matters for enterprises

PostgreSQL handles operational data for ChatGPT and OpenAI's API platform. The workload is heavily read-oriented, which makes PostgreSQL a good fit. However, PostgreSQL's multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) creates challenges under heavy write loads.

When updating data, PostgreSQL copies entire rows to create new versions, causing write amplification and forcing queries to scan through multiple versions to find current data.

Rather than fighting this limitation, OpenAI built its strategy around it. At OpenAI’s scale, these tradeoffs aren’t theoretical — they determine which workloads stay on PostgreSQL and which ones must move elsewhere.

How OpenAI is optimizing PostgreSQL

At large scale, conventional database wisdom points to one of two paths: shard PostgreSQL across multiple primary instances so writes can be distributed, or migrate to a distributed SQL database like CockroachDB or YugabyteDB designed to handle massive scale from the start. Most organizations would have taken one of these paths years ago, well before reaching 800 million users.

Sharding or moving to a distributed SQL database eliminates the single-writer bottleneck. A distributed SQL database handles this coordination automatically, but both approaches introduce significant complexity: application code must route queries to the correct shard, distributed transactions become harder to manage and operational overhead increases substantially.

Instead of sharding PostgreSQL, OpenAI established a hybrid strategy: no new tables in PostgreSQL. New workloads default to sharded systems like Azure Cosmos DB. Existing write-heavy workloads that can be horizontally partitioned get migrated out. Everything else stays in PostgreSQL with aggressive optimization.

This approach offers enterprises a practical alternative to wholesale re-architecture. Rather than spending years rewriting hundreds of endpoints, teams can identify specific bottlenecks and move only those workloads to purpose-built systems.

Why this matters

OpenAI's experience scaling PostgreSQL reveals several practices that enterprises can adopt regardless of their scale.

Build operational defenses at multiple layers. OpenAI's approach combines cache locking to prevent ""thundering herd"" problems, connection pooling (which dropped their connection time from 50ms to 5ms), and rate limiting at application, proxy and query levels. Workload isolation routes low-priority and high-priority traffic to separate instances, ensuring a poorly optimized new feature can't degrade core services.

Review and monitor ORM-generated SQL in production. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Django, SQLAlchemy, and Hibernate automatically generate database queries from application code, which is convenient for developers. However, OpenAI found one ORM-generated query joining 12 tables that caused multiple high-severity incidents when traffic spiked. The convenience of letting frameworks generate SQL creates hidden scaling risks that only surface under production load. Make reviewing these queries a standard practice.

Enforce strict operational discipline. OpenAI permits only lightweight schema changes — anything triggering a full table rewrite is prohibited. Schema changes have a 5-second timeout. Long-running queries get automatically terminated to prevent blocking database maintenance operations. When backfilling data, they enforce rate limits so aggressive that operations can take over a week.

Read-heavy workloads with burst writes can run on single-primary PostgreSQL longer than commonly assumed. The decision to shard should depend on workload patterns rather than user counts.

This approach is particularly relevant for AI applications, which often have heavily read-oriented workloads with unpredictable traffic spikes. These characteristics align with the pattern where single-primary PostgreSQL scales effectively.

The lesson is straightforward: identify actual bottlenecks, optimize proven infrastructure where possible, and migrate selectively when necessary. Wholesale re-architecture isn't always the answer to scaling challenges.",https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/2nMZ8lzfqYONXXqLmfp03c/ef9465cd0a706732727d46c445280358/chatGPT-PostgreSQL.jpg?w=800&q=75,N,,2026-01-23 17:03:13.295116

Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement.

The Notes will not be listed on any U.S. securities exchange or quotation system. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these Notes or determined that this pricing supplement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The Notes constitute our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Notes are not deposit liabilities of Barclays Bank PLC and are not covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme or insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or deposit insurance agency of the United States, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction.

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

●You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

●You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the appropriateness of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement, the prospectus, the prospectus supplement and the underlying supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the Notes for investment.

Example 1: The Final Underlier Value of the NDX Index is 150.00, the Final Underlier Value of the RTY Index is 130.000 and the Final Underlier Value of the SPX Index is 140.00.

Because the RTY Index has the lowest Underlier Return, the RTY Index is the Least Performing Underlier. Because the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is greater than or equal to its Digital Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,082.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Digital Percentage)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 8.20%) = $1,082.00

Example 1 demonstrates that you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Underlier. Even though each Underlier appreciated significantly, the payment at maturity is limited to $1,082.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold.

Example 2: The Final Underlier Value of the NDX Index is 95.00, the Final Underlier Value of the RTY Index is 140.000 and the Final Underlier Value of the SPX Index is 105.00.

Because the NDX Index has the lowest Underlier Return, the NDX Index is the Least Performing Underlier. Because the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is greater than or equal to its Digital Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,082.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Digital Percentage)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 8.20%) = $1,082.00

Example 3: The Final Underlier Value of the NDX Index is 125.00, the Final Underlier Value of the RTY Index is 65.000 and the Final Underlier Value of the SPX Index is 95.00.

Because the RTY Index has the lowest Underlier Return, the RTY Index is the Least Performing Underlier. Because the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is less than its Digital Barrier Value but greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold.

Example 4: The Final Underlier Value of the NDX Index is 80.00, the Final Underlier Value of the RTY Index is 40.000 and the Final Underlier Value of the SPX Index is 150.00.

Because the RTY Index has the lowest Underlier Return, the RTY Index is the Least Performing Underlier. Because the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $400.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Underlier Return of the Least Performing Underlier)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × -60.00%) = $400.00

Example 4 demonstrates that, if the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Underlier from its Initial Underlier Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Underlier Return of any other Underlier being higher than the Underlier Return of the Least Performing Underlier.

You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC.

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Underliers or their components. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss—The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Underlier from its Initial Underlier Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited to the Digital Percentage—If the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is greater than or equal to its Digital Barrier Value, for each $1,000 principal amount Note, you will receive at maturity $1,000 plus a predetermined percentage of the principal amount. We refer to this percentage as the Digital Percentage, which is equal to 8.20%. If the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is greater than or equal to its Digital Barrier Value, you will receive the maximum payment at maturity of $1,082.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note regardless of any appreciation of any Underlier, which may be significant. Your return on the Notes will be less than the percentage change in the Least Performing Underlier from its Initial Underlier Value to its Final Underlier Value if such percentage is greater than the Digital Percentage.

●No Interest Payments—As a holder of the Notes, you will not receive interest payments.

●Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Underlier, You Are Exposed to Greater Risk of Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Underlier—The risk that you will lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Underlier. With multiple Underliers, it is more likely that the Final Underlier Value of at least one Underlier will be less than its Barrier Value, and therefore, it is more likely that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Underliers may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Underliers, the greater the potential for one of those Underliers to close below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date.

It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Underliers will be over the term of the Notes. The Underliers represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes.

●You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Underlier—Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Underliers. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Underlier. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Underlier. Poor performance by any Underlier over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the values of the other Underliers. If the Final Underlier Value of any Underlier is less than its Barrier Value, you will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Underlier from its Initial Underlier Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Underlier.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Underliers on the Dates Specified—Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Underliers on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Underliers determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of the Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity—You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity. If you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Underlier has increased from its Initial Underlier Value. See “—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Securities Composing the Underliers—The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the securities composing the Underliers. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the securities composing the Underliers would have.

●The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain— There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the Notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described below under “Tax Considerations.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the Notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an

investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer—The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underliers

●Each Underlier Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing That Underlier, Not the Total Return—The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Underliers, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing each Underlier. Each Underlier is not a “total return” index that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Underlier. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature.

●Adjustments to the Underliers Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes—The sponsor of an Underlier may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Underlier or make other methodological changes to that Underlier that could affect its performance. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of an Underlier in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Underlier. In addition, the sponsor of an Underlier may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Underlier at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the discontinued Underlier or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Underlier. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the relevant Underlier and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●There Are Risks Associated with Investments in Securities Linked to the Value of Non-U.S. Equity Securities with Respect to the NDX Index—Some of the equity securities composing the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

●The Notes Are Subject to Small-Capitalization Companies Risk with Respect to the RTY Index—The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore Notes linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and

economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs—Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or an Underlier or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Historical Performance of the Underliers Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Underliers Over the Term of the Notes—The value of each Underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of an Underlier is not an indication of the future performance of that Underlier over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation between the Underliers is not an indication of the future correlation between them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Underliers individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Underlier.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Underliers or their components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Underliers and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underliers” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe values and expected volatility of the Underliers;

ocorrelation (or lack of correlation) of the Underliers;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

odividend rates on the components of each Underlier;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes—The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing topurchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

●The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes—Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the Underliers. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes. This gain or loss on your Notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your Notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of Notes at the original issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-23 17:02:39.170015

The company's implied volatility remains below the 52-week median, indicating stable investor expectations.

Adobe demonstrates strong financial health with robust margins and consistent revenue growth.

Adobe's (ADBE) share price climbed by $1.91, or 0.64%, reaching approximately $301.63, while options activity presented a mixed sentiment. The options market saw a relatively low volume with 29,000 contracts changing hands, where call options outnumbered put options, resulting in a put/call ratio of 0.45, distinctly below the typical 2.92. This shift indicates a moderately bullish perspective among investors.

The implied volatility (IV30) for Adobe decreased slightly by 0.23 to 29.77, remaining under the 52-week median. This suggests traders anticipate a daily price movement of around $5.66. Additionally, the put-call skew showed signs of flattening, contributing to the overall positive outlook for the stock.

Adobe Inc., a leader in the technology sector, specializes in providing content creation, document management, and digital marketing software and services. The company operates through three main segments: digital media content creation, digital experience for marketing solutions, and publishing for legacy products. With a market capitalization of approximately $122.88 billion, Adobe is a significant player in the software industry.

Financial Health Analysis

Adobe's financial performance is marked by strong revenue growth and profitability. The company reported a revenue of $23.77 billion, with a three-year growth rate of 14.2%. Adobe's operating margin stands at 36.63%, while its net margin is 30%, indicating efficient cost management and profitability.

On the balance sheet front, Adobe exhibits strong financial health with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.57, suggesting a balanced approach to leveraging. The company's current ratio and quick ratio both stand at 1, reflecting adequate liquidity to meet short-term obligations.

Despite a recent insider selling transaction, Adobe maintains a strong Altman Z-Score of 8.09, indicating low bankruptcy risk. The Piotroski F-Score of 7 further underscores the company's financial robustness.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Adobe's valuation metrics suggest it is trading at attractive levels. The company's P/E ratio is 17.91, close to its 10-year low, while the P/S ratio of 5.36 and P/B ratio of 10.64 are also near historical lows. Analyst sentiment remains positive, with a target price of $426.3 and a recommendation score of 2.3, indicating a ""Buy"" consensus.

Technical indicators such as the RSI of 30.97 suggest the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially signaling a buying opportunity. Institutional ownership is high at 80.93%, reflecting confidence from large investors.

Risk Assessment

Adobe's financial health is bolstered by strong grades in financial strength, with a Z-Score of 8.09 and a Piotroski F-Score of 7. However, sector-specific risks such as rapid technological changes and competitive pressures remain pertinent. The company's beta of 1.48 indicates higher volatility compared to the market, which investors should consider.

Overall, Adobe's strong financial metrics, coupled with its strategic positioning in the technology sector, suggest a resilient outlook. Investors should remain cognizant of market dynamics and sector-specific risks while evaluating Adobe's potential as a long-term investment.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C0000098S.png?20,N,,2026-01-23 19:03:03.632642

The offering, called IBM Enterprise Advantage, brings together IBM consulting services, pre-built AI agents, and governance tools to help companies deploy AI more quickly and safely across the enterprise, the company said.

Enterprise Advantage enables organizations to integrate AI into existing workflows and systems and expand agentic applications using their current cloud environments and AI models.

It does this by combining IBM’s consulting expertise with tools developed through IBM Consulting Advantage, the company’s internal AI-enabled delivery platform. IBM said the internal platform has been used in more than 150 client engagements and has helped improve consultant productivity.

Those experiences shaped how Enterprise Advantage is now being offered to customers to support their own AI initiatives.

The service supports major hyperscalers including AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as IBM watsonx and a mix of open‑ and proprietary models. The service will allow companies to extend existing technology investments rather than replace them.

Addressing the Enterprise AI Execution Gap

A recent IBM Institute for Business Value report highlighted a growing gap between AI ambition and execution. The report found that 79% of executives expect AI to deliver significant business value by 2030. However, only 24% say they have a clear view of where that value will come from.

The report indicated that many organizations still lack the operating models and systems required to support AI at scale.

Enterprise Advantage is designed to help address this gap by providing a structured way to build, integrate, and govern AI agents within existing enterprise platforms.

Key elements of the service include:

Enterprise AI platform design: Companies can integrate AI capabilities into existing enterprise systems and workflows without requiring wholesale infrastructure changes using Enterprise Advantage. IBM cited Pearson, as an example where Pearson is building personalized, AI-powered learning tools for global organizations and individuals. The learning company is also developing a custom internal AI platform to transform its own business operations and drive growth.

Multi‑cloud and model flexibility: Support for major cloud platforms and a mix of open‑ and proprietary AI models, allows organizations to build on existing technology investments.

Pre‑built AI agents and accelerators: Enterprise Advantage will give companies access to a catalog of reusable, industry‑specific AI agents intended to shorten deployment timelines and reduce implementation risk.

Built‑in governance and controls: Enterprise Advantage supports embedded mechanisms for security, compliance, and lifecycle management as AI agents are deployed into production environments. IBM’s research report notes that organizations are increasingly adopting hybrid human‑and‑AI working models, which introduce new governance and risk management requirements as AI becomes more operationally embedded.

Mohamad Ali, senior VP and head of IBM Consulting, said, “Many organizations are investing in AI, but achieving real value at scale remains a major challenge. We have solved many of these challenges inside IBM by using AI to transform our own operations and deliver measurable results, giving us a proven playbook to help clients succeed. Enterprise Advantage brings this framework to clients by combining human expertise with digital workers and ready-to-use AI assets so they can scale AI with confidence and achieve meaningful impact.”

What This Means for ERP Insiders

Enterprise AI is shifting from experimentation to operating mode. IBM’s launch reflects growing pressure on large organizations to move beyond pilots and define how AI fits into core operating models. The emphasis is on repeatable architectures that can scale across the enterprise and deliver value while working within existing systems.

Agentic AI raises the architectural bar for ERP environments. As AI agents take on more orchestration and decision-support roles, ERP systems must allow AI to work directly with live business data, rather than sitting outside core processes. This increases the importance of platform design and interoperability over point functionality.",https://erp.today/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/carson-masterson-0mXw-dvuLok-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 17:03:00.296037

Investors rethink ‘hands off’ investing and decide to start making real money

Shares of Altimmune (NASDAQ:ALT) surged 35.4% over the past week, coinciding with a dramatic shift in retail investor sentiment on Reddit.

The clinical-stage biotech develops treatments for metabolic diseases and became one of the highest-rated stocks in social sentiment tracking after the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for its lead drug pemvidutide on January 16.

Mentions of Altimmune on Reddit increased sharply, with users sharing high-conviction positions. One r/wallstreetbets post titled ""Altimmune - $100k + YOLO - The MASH Sleeping Giant, the train is leaving the station"" accumulated 128 upvotes and 219 comments. The author opened with conviction: ""BTD CONFIRMED - Yesterday, the FDA granted them Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for MASH. This is huge. It means the FDA sees 'substantial improvement' over existing therapies."" The post emphasized the significance: ""BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL, only around 1/3 of applications gets accepted, and it tells big Pharma, FDA wants this drug, come fucking buy."" The user detailed their position: ""I've been in this stock since $3.50, added more at $4.20, and I'm not selling until we hit double digits or get bought out. This is my conviction play for 2026."" They concluded: ""The train is leaving the station. Get in now or watch from the sidelines as this thing runs to $15-20.""

Reddit Bulls Point to Regulatory Catalyst and Buyout Potential

The optimism centers on three factors driving retail trader conviction:

Altimmune beat earnings estimates in all four quarters of 2025, with surprises ranging from 12.9% to 23.9%, while narrowing annual losses 45% year-over-year to negative $0.74 per share

The company hired a new CEO in January 2026, Jerome Durso, who previously sold Intercept Pharmaceuticals to Alfasigma, fueling acquisition speculation

Analyst price targets averaging $17.75 imply 209% upside from current levels, with 7 of 9 analysts rating the stock buy or strong buy despite the company remaining unprofitable

Small-Cap Speculation Faces Eli Lilly Reality

Altimmune's $561 million market cap and $210 million cash position contrast sharply with competitors. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), which dominates the obesity drug market with Mounjaro and Zepbound, posted 54% revenue growth in its most recent quarter and maintains a $975 billion market cap with 48% operating margins. The stock is up 59% year-to-date but down 18.7% over the past year, reflecting volatility around its 52-week range of $2.90 to $7.73. For speculative investors willing to bet on regulatory acceleration and potential acquisition interest, the Reddit community is making a loud case, but this remains a high-risk, pre-revenue biotech play in a space dominated by pharmaceutical giants.

It’s Time To Rethink Passive Investing

For more than a decade, the investing advice aimed at everyday Americans followed a familiar script: automate everything, keep costs low, and don’t touch a thing. And increasingly, investors are realizing that being completely hands-off also means being completely disengaged.

That realization hits like a lightning bolt when you realize not just how much better your returns could be, but that there are amazing offers like one app where new self-directed investing accounts funded with as little as $50 can receive stock worth up to $1,000.

Contributor Cale Hunt brings to Windows Central more than nine years of experience writing about laptops, PCs, accessories, games, and beyond.","NVIDIA's next conquest, after what feels like years of rumors, is laptops. No, I'm not talking about mobile RTX graphics cards. This is an entirely new processor designed to run Windows on Arm.

The rumors really kicked off in 2023 when NVIDIA was reported to be weighing its options regarding an ARM SoC designed for Windows PCs, and in July 2025, we got a much more significant leak in the form of a Geekbench OpenCL benchmark listing. Earlier this week, we covered a DigiTimes report suggesting that supply chains are gearing up to launch laptops featuring the NVIDIA N1X chip in Q1 2026.

Now, a fresh leak from dataminer Huang514613 gives us an insight into what sort of PCs we might expect. The leak was not hard to spot, at least as long as you aren't shy about poking around in support documents.

On one of Lenovo's ""Legion Space"" public webpages, support for its software includes a long list of applicable Legion gaming laptops. Included in the listings are the regular collection of Intel and AMD configurations, but there's something there that's not like the others.

A Legion 7 15N1X11 stands out as the only product to not feature the usual ""I"" (for Intel) or ""A"" (for AMD) product number. That can't be anything other than NVIDIA's N1X SoC.

Huang514613 follows up the original leak with another X post listing other ""known N1 products from Lenovo."" These include:

Ideapad Slim 5 14N1V11

Ideapad Slim 5 16N1V11

Yoga Pro 7 15N1V11

Yoga Pro 7 15N1X11

Yoga 9 2-in-1 16N1X11

These leaks ultimately fly in the face of assumptions that NVIDIA's N1X was a chip designed for use in desktop PCs. It could very well still be found in desktops, but the fact that it's arriving for laptops — including a 15-inch Legion 7 and a 16-inch Yoga 9 2-in-1 — is exciting, to say the least.

So far, we can only go on leaked and rumored specs to flesh out the N1X. But what we do know bodes well for mobile PC gaming, creation, and AI workloads.

If the N1X is indeed the same chip used in NVIDIA's DGX Spark, we're looking at 20 ARM cores and an integrated Blackwell graphics chip with 6,144 CUDA cores. That's enough to theoretically place its performance alongside the desktop-class RTX 5070. If true, the N1X would be among the fastest iGPUs available in any laptop.

Aligning with rumors of an N1X launch in early 2026, Microsoft has been busy preparing a significant Windows 11 26H1 update. It's a full OS upgrade that moves Windows from the Germanium platform release to Bromine, unlocking platform changes required for Snapdragon X2 and NVIDIA N1X.

Microsoft also rolled out public support for the Xbox PC app on Windows on Arm this week, noting that its Prism emulation layer now supports 85% of games available through the subscription.

Delta has already implemented the three-tier fares for its economy and Comfort tickets.
“We’re still testing Comfort Basic right now.
Delta launched Comfort Basic on Nov. 19 as a “skinnier” version of its extra-legroom Comfort cabin, The Points Guy shared at the time.","Feeling frugal? Soon enough, you may still be able to fly first-class.

Delta Air Lines has unveiled a plan to launch tiered fares for both business and first-class, meaning you could soon snag a cheaper ticket in the coveted cabins.

Company executives hinted during an earnings call on Jan. 13 that the change could happen as early as this year.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian noted that the airline’s goal is to have “three categories for every product, which is Basic, Main and Extra.”

This means that when booking seats in premium cabins, customers will now have an option to book “basic” first-class and business class tickets that don’t include perks like free cancellation and loyalty points, per Travel + Leisure.

Currently, those who fly in premium cabins on Delta can only choose between Classic and Extra, while economy travelers can choose from all three.

The Basic fare will be the cheapest option, but will come with limitations such as a later boarding group or no seat selection. Classic is considered to be Delta’s standard airfare, while the more expensive Extra may include benefits such as mile accrual and refundable tickets.

Delta has already implemented the three-tier fares for its economy and Comfort tickets.

“We’ve been incredibly thoughtful about not going too fast, making sure that we’re measured in that approach,” Joe Esposito, Delta’s executive vice president, said on the call. “We’re still testing Comfort Basic right now. We’re going to expand that for the rest of this year.”

“There’s more we can offer the customer based on what they’re willing to pay,” Esposito said.

Delta launched Comfort Basic on Nov. 19 as a “skinnier” version of its extra-legroom Comfort cabin, The Points Guy shared at the time.

Travelers flying Basic in Delta Comfort still get the premium seat with extra legroom, as well as early boarding, complimentary alcoholic beverages and dedicated overhead bin space.

However, the Basic flyers cannot select their seats in advance, receive fewer SkyMiles and have to pay a cancellation fee if needed.

Delta is the first major US airline to offer lower tiers for first or business fare, though some international carriers such as Qatar Airways, Emirates, Finnair, Air France and Etihad already offer something similar.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/119525621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2026-01-23 16:02:04.553607

The Nvidia co-founder spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and was asked by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who is the WEF interim co-chair, about how the rise of AI will change the nature of work.

""First of all, this is the largest infrastructure build-out in human history. That's going to create a lot of jobs,"" Huang said. ""It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft – we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers and network technicians and people who install and fit out the equipment.""

""We have a great shortage in that, and I'm really delighted to see so many people in so many countries recognizing this important area,"" he added. ""Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.""

During his discussion with Fink, the Nvidia CEO went into detail about the different levels of AI infrastructure and how they rely upon each other.

Extreme Networks Launches New Partner Program To Position Specialists Against Network Heavyweights

Extreme Networks makes this week’s Came to Win list for its launch of a new partner program that seeks to meet the changing networking market needs of enterprise customers while providing simplicity for channel partners.

The Extreme Partner First program simplifies deal registration, serves up more transparent pricing, offers new training and certifications, and uses AI to improve time to revenue and profitability with less friction, according to Joe Spencer, Extreme’s senior vice president of global channel and strategic initiatives.

“Our program has been around for quite some time. It was designed for what the market needed several years ago, and we listened to our partners and redesigned for what they need today,” Spencer told CRN. “I want partners to know that we’re going to do business with them in a simple and predictable fashion that builds trust between us and them and that if we go to market together, they know what to expect, and that they’re going to solve their needed customer outcomes with ease with Extreme versus our competition.”

Extreme Partner First offers a unified rebate structure, quicker deal approvals, and clearer pricing and benefits for partners. For more predictable profitability, the program provides one global, SKU- and volume-based rebate model and a unified global framework for deal registration with a 48-hour target approval for service level agreements that makes it easier for partners to pursue and scale international opportunities.

Extreme will also help partners close deals faster thanks to its new Partner AI Sales Assistant, a feature that helps partners find critical sales information in seconds, the Morrisville, N.C.-based company said.

Through new training opportunities, partners can earn combined certifications for installation and troubleshooting, with a specific focus on AI readiness and use cases within the company’s flagship Extreme Platform ONE.

D&H Acquires Fulfillment.com In Third-Party Logistics Play

D&H made a savvy acquisition this week, buying Fulfillment.com, a Savannah, Ga.-based provider of technology for e-commerce fulfillment, in a move the IT distributor said will expand its Scale third-party logistics and supply chain services business.

Fulfillment.com is a top provider of e-commerce fulfillment services to high-volume, multi-channel and omni-channel internet retailers worldwide. The company says it ships millions of business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) orders to over 150 countries.

D&H told CRN the acquisition is focused on expanding the capabilities of D&H’s Scale business and strengthening the distributor’s ecommerce fulfillment and third-party logistics operations. D&H Scale is an in-house supply chain management organization that offers end-to-end B2B and B2C commerce capabilities.

D&H Scale is independent of D&H’s core technology distribution strategy and the Fulfillment.com acquisition does not involve changes to channel programs, partner engagement models or distribution operations.

But while Fulfillment.com is focused on B2C distribution, the company’s technology could be a boon to D&H’s channel partner community through enhanced third-party logistics capabilities, expanded direct-to-consumer fulfillment, an improved global e-commerce infrastructure,and advanced technology-driven logistics.

Fulfillment.com has four fulfillment centers in the U.S. and one each in Canada, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Australia. The company says that in the U.S., it can make one-day to two-day delivery to 99.97 percent of the continental U.S. population and can make next-day delivery by ground to 69 percent of that population.

ConnectWise Buys Service Desk Agentic AI Startup

Staying on the topic of strategic acquisitions, ConnectWise this week acquired Toronto-based Zofiq, an agentic AI company with technology that automates high-volume service desk operations, in a move to push toward more autonomous service delivery for MSPs.

The acquisition deal brings about 15 Zofiq employees into the Tampa, Fla.-based vendor and folds the startup’s technology directly into ConnectWise’s broader platform strategy: embedding AI agents inside PSA and RMM workflows.

“This has always been part of our strategy,” ConnectWise CEO Manny Rivelo (pictured) told CRN. “How do we move the company toward autonomous workflows? When you look at Zofiq, it just feels like a great marriage. The timing is right, the technology is ready and the industry needs it.”

Service desks are under pressure from every direction, according to Rivelo. Service ticket volumes keep climbing, talent is hard to find and harder to keep, and customers expect faster, more consistent outcomes, he said. With Zofiq, AI agents handle tasks like triage, routing, resolution steps and documentation—all within existing workflows.

Zofiq’s approach ingests ticket data and learns from it. “At the core of Zofiq is our learning engine. It trains on historical data, learns how an MSP works, and automates based on that. In the old world, you automated by building workflows. In the post-AI world, you automate by letting AI learn from your data and guiding it with natural language,” said Lee Silverstone, Zofiq co-founder and CEO.

Claroty Raises $150M In New Funding Amid Industry Segment Consolidation

Claroty, a developer of security for cyber-physical systems, makes this week’s list for raising an impressive $150 million in a Series F funding round.

Funding from the new round, which was led by Golub Growth with participation from earlier investors, will be targeted for expansion globally, including potentially through mergers and acquisitions.

With the new capital infusion, Claroty has raised at least $885 million in total funding since its launch in 2015.

Claroty did not disclose a new valuation for the company following the new funding round, but the company said it had experienced 80 percent growth in valuation since the previous funding round in March 2024. A published report said Claroty was eyeing a possible IPO in 2027.

The announcement of Claroty’s new funding comes amid consolidation in the market for vendors specializing in OT and IoT security. Nozomi Networks disclosed in September that it had reached an agreement to be acquired by Mitsubishi Electric for roughly $1 billion.

ServiceNow Beefs Up Channel Program With AI Emphasis

ServiceNow this week unveiled a number of enhancements to its channel program, including the launch of a new partner business value composer designed to make it easier for solution providers to help speed customers’ adoption of the latest AI technologies.

The company is also offering partners new certifications in different product areas, as well as bringing them the fruit of acquisitions such as ServiceNow’s pending acquisition of agentic AI developer Moveworks.

The changes to the channel program were officially unveiled at ServiceNow’s annual sales kickoff, held this week in Las Vegas.

One initiative ServiceNow is discussing at the sales kickoff is streamlining the incentives the company provides across the deal life cycle, Michael Park (pictured), senior vice president of global partnerships and channels, told CRN.

“We are expanding our strategic investment fund,” Park said. “We’re setting a new market development fund in front of that for demand gen. ... And then we have reseller fees and incentives for deployment. When I came into the job, there were 14 different incentive models. We now have four.”

Another plan introduced at the sales kickoff was simplifying partner membership fees, Park said. “We’re going to roll out a single program membership fee across all the partner types,” he said. “We’ve got too many versions right now. It’s so complicated. Let’s just do one.”",https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2026/media_1767c0ecc897fa2a845b017258f7e1dd7f019085e.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-23 13:59:20.080041

The Dublin-based company said the Affera Sphere-360 catheter won CE mark for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and the first cases of the device used in the Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial were completed.

Sphere-9 is the only all-in-one, dual energy mapping and ablation catheter for treatment of persistent AFib and concomitant CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Medtronic said the Affera system, together with the Sphere-9 catheter, enables physician treatment flexibility with its wide area focal design and 9mm lattice tip that can be used with an 8.5Fr sheath.

Medtronic inherited the device when it acquired Affera in 2022.

The Horizon 360 IDE study is a prospective, single-arm clinical study at centers across the U.S. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.

""The achievement of CE Mark for Sphere-360, as well as the first cases in the U.S. IDE trial, mark two major achievements in our effort to deliver new and better treatments to AFib patients,"" said Rebecca Seidel, president of the Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio. ""We're committed to leading in PFA and bringing meaningful innovation at a regular cadence.""

Medtronic first won approval for PFA technology to treat AFib in 2023.

In a November earnings call, Geoff Martha, chairman and CEO of Medtronic, discussed the impact of the company’s PFA offerings.

According to a Seeking Alpha transcript of the earnings call, Martha said. “In Cardiac Ablation, our PFA franchise is generating just a ton of momentum. We grew 71%, which is a strong acceleration from last quarter's nearly 50% CAS growth. This is the highest growth rate of any company in this large and fast-growing space. We're winning share as our PFA franchise grew over 300% in the U.S., as well as in international markets. This was based on the strength of our Affera mapping system and our Sphere-9 dual energy and high-density mapping catheter.”

“Look, physicians tell us that they appreciate not only the shorter procedure times that they're seeing with Affera, but increasingly, they're calling out its outstanding durability as well,” he said according to the Seeking Alpha transcript. “And demand continues to be extremely high as we hear repeatedly from customers that they want to purchase additional Affera systems to expand into even more of their labs. And in the vast majority of instances, when a new Affera system goes into a lab, we take the majority of the AFib procedure share in that lab.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/blt2dd7bada2a3862a3/6973bad0b6aa7b646dfc73ad/Untitled_design_-_2026-01-23T131509.688.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-23 17:02:49.217293

In a series of announcements this week, the artificial intelligence giant behind ChatGPT signaled meaningful shifts in how it plans to scale its technology, and added some safety rails in response to allegations it has been subjected to time and again.

This comes as OpenAI defends its governance history, navigates criticism from co-founder Elon Musk and surrounding legal drama, and strategizes ways to increase recurring revenue.

At the center of it is that it will begin testing advertisements within ChatGPT for users on its free tier and the newly introduced $8-per-month Chat “Go” plan. This marks a new revenue source for the company as it prepares to launch hardware AI products and continues to invest heavily in data centers.

Until now, it primarily relied on investments, partnerships, and subscription revenue to cover its ever-growing computing costs.

ChatGPT ads come with guardrails

OpenAI’s belief has been that its revenue model must grow to support the value intelligence it delivers to its users and organizations. CFO Sarah Friar, in a recent blog post, explained that the company’s monetization strategy has always been direct and simple.

In this informational post, Friar also expanded on what could come next for the company- licensing to IP-based agreements. Further adding, “that is how the internet evolved. Intelligence will follow the same path.”

On X,Sam Altman emphasized that this introduction will not result in any discrepancy in the information provided to its users.

Further clarifying that the need for this step is to ensure ChatGPT remains available to consumers who “don’t want to pay” but want to use it.

The message was echoed by Fidji Somo in her blog post, reinforcing that ads remain a means of aligning revenue with usage, rather than steering behavior. Somo also elaborated that these ads will be used to improve the user experience and will be expanded to allow users to ask questions about the sponsored product.

The move does not come as a surprise, given the rising demand for generative AI tools, and add to that the related costs, which remain high.

Overall, the Supreme Court upheld the appeal, reiterating the CAT’s gatekeeping function as a specialist tribunal, in a ruling that is welcome news for corporate defendants.

To curtail the use of opt-out proceedings as a means of leveraging settlement in weak and frivolous claims, claimant firms will need to put forward an arguable case and demonstrate that opt-in proceedings are not a practicable alternative for the class they purport to represent.

On 18 December 2025, the UK Supreme Court handed down its judgment in the case of Evans v Barclays Bank plc & Ors [2025] UKSC 48, with significant implications for the future of collective proceedings in the United Kingdom. Overturning the Court of Appeal’s decision, the Supreme Court emphasised the importance of the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) exercising its discretion as a specialist body and clarified the relevant factors to consider when deciding whether opt-in or opt-out proceedings are more appropriate.

Background

In 2019, Mr Evans sought permission to bring opt-out collective proceedings against several major banks, including Barclays, seeking damages as part of a ‘follow-on’ claim for anticompetitive infringements relating to foreign exchange trading. The main issue in contention was the mechanism by which the collective action would proceed — specifically, whether the claims should be certified on an opt-in or opt-out basis.

CAT Decision — 31 March 2023

The CAT considered Mr Evans’ application for opt-out certification, referring to section 79(3) of the CAT Rules 2015, which identifies the merits of the case and the practicability of opt-in proceedings as relevant factors. It concluded that Mr Evans failed to articulate a plausible case on causation, potentially justifying strike-out, and determined that opt-in proceedings were practicable for the sophisticated institutional class members, whose losses accounted for a majority of the claim’s value. On this basis, the CAT refused opt-out certification.

Court of Appeal Decision — 9 May 2024

The Court of Appeal overturned the CAT’s judgment, rejecting the emphasis placed by the CAT on its assessment of the merits of the case. The Court of Appeal gave more weight to the fact that opt-in proceedings were unlikely to occur, stating that access to justice considerations were relevant to the assessment of practicability including all members of the class irrespective of their size and sophistication, not solely for consumers and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The cost of opt-in proceedings and the practical burdens associated with opting in would likely exceed the sums at stake for most of the class members, thereby limiting the practicability of opt-in proceedings and favouring opt-out certification. Accordingly, it set aside the CAT’s decision and remitted the case, prompting an appeal from the banks to the Supreme Court.

Supreme Court Decision — 18 December 2025

The Supreme Court examined the decision to intervene with the CAT’s reasoning and disagreed with the Court of Appeal, overall reaffirming the CAT’s ability to exercise discretion as a specialist tribunal.

1. Merits of the Claims

Firstly, the Supreme Court agreed that the strength of Mr Evans’ claim was an important factor, as section 79(3)(a) of the CAT Rules expressly identifies. It also observed that opt-out proceedings legally and commercially favour claimants, as the procedure enables the representation of a larger class. This often results in higher value claims and increased costs for corporate defendants, which may be leveraged to advance weak and frivolous claims. To preserve the balance between access to justice for claimants and protection for corporates against oppressive litigation, the courts should not allow weaker claims to proceed on an opt-out basis. The Supreme Court therefore held that the Court of Appeal had no basis for interfering with the CAT’s decision.

2. Practicability of Opt-In Proceedings

On the issue of practicability, the CAT was correct to divide the class into subclasses. The potential claimants ranged from sophisticated commercial entities and financial institutions to individuals and smaller entities. The CAT gave foremost attention to the sophisticated entities who accounted for most of the value of the claim. Those institutions were capable of pursuing litigation on an opt-in basis but had made a conscious and deliberate decision not to do so. Opt-out certification should not be used as an alternative route in cases where opt-in proceedings fail to generate sufficient interest. The CAT exercised its discretion to divide the class and came to a reasoned decision, and there was no basis for the Court of Appeal to interfere.

3. Neutral Starting Point

The Court of Appeal adopted a starting position in favour of opt-out proceedings, taking the view that it must uphold principles of vindicating rights and deterring future wrongdoers as powerful factors favouring certification. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, confirming that judicial decision-makers must adopt a position of neutrality with no presumption in favour of either procedure when determining certification. The Supreme Court held the CAT was correct to adopt an even-handed approach, weighing factors on both sides to strike a balance between competing interests, and to exercise its judgment as a specialist tribunal without interference from the appellate courts in the absence of an error of law.

A More Exacting Certification Process

Overall, the Supreme Court upheld the appeal and reiterated the CAT’s gatekeeping function as a specialist tribunal, in a ruling that is welcome news for corporate defendants. As identified in the October 2025 report we published in conjunction with Kendal Global Advisory, businesses have reported increased liability risk and exposure to damages resulting from the strategic utilisation of the collective redress regime by claimant firms, as well as concerns that claimant interests are not at the forefront of such actions. This decision — one amongst a number of recent appellate court judgments shaping the collective and class actions landscape — raises the threshold for opt-out certification and reflects the court’s increasing attentiveness to the practical and procedural realities of such large-scale litigation.

A recent earnings release and 2026 guidance update, though strong, triggered a price pullback and a trend-following opportunity.

What is a trend-following signal? Assuming the trend is up, as it is with JNJ stock, a trend-following signal occurs when the price action retreats to an accepted trend-following indicator, such as a moving average or trend line, and then confirms support at that level. What this does is affirm the presence of buyers and high potential for rebound while derisking the entry point. The likely outcome of such a signal is that the stock price will continue its steady advance and set fresh highs in the near future.

Johnson & Johnson’s Healthy Business and Pipeline Underpin Stock Price Action

Johnson & Johnson’s Q4 results reveal the strength of its portfolio and pipeline, with revenue up 9.1% YOY and nearly 200 basis points better than expected. The strength was driven by the combination of core strength in Innovative Medicine and Med Tech, compounded by acquisitions. The company grew organically by 7.1% and adjusted by 6.1%, and expects to sustain a mid-single-digit pace in 2026.

Margins, which were roughly in line with consensus expectations, were an area of strength in the report. The company’s adjusted earnings, like margins, were as expected, showing significant improvement compared to the prior year.

Up more than 20%, adjusted earnings strengthened the already strong balance sheet and capital return outlook.

Management's guidance was good—and likely to be cautious. The company targets 6.7% revenue growth and margin improvement, with both targets above consensus.

Momentum in core segments (specifically with blockbusters like Darzalex) and pipeline advancement, could cause the firm to beat on its own guidance next report.

Lastly, the company reported positive results from several trials and submitted its OTTAVA robotic surgical system for De Novo classification. If approved, it will open a new revenue stream with potential to grow at a high-double-digit rate for several years.

Johnson & Johnson Results Align With Bullish Analyst Trends

Johnson & Johnson’s bullish analyst trends are unlikely to end, given the Q4 strengths and outlook. As it stands, the 29 tracked by MarketBeat rate this stock as a Moderate Buy and price targets are rising.

The consensus price target implies the stock is fairly valued, trading near the pre-release close, but the trend points to the high end of the range, sufficient for a 10% upside and a fresh all-time high.

Institutions also accumulated in 2025 and early 2026, limiting the downside risk should the stock price pull back.

Johnson & Johnson’s dividend is among the reasons analysts and institutions like this stock. The payment yields nearly 2.5%, even with shares near record highs, and is expected to grow over time.

The company is a Dividend King with over 60 years of annual increases to its credit. A low payout ratio of 50% signals that modest, single-digit increases can be sustained for the foreseeable future.

Risks for JNJ shareholders in 2026 include ongoing talc litigation, competition from Stellara biosimilars, and execution risk tied to the expected OTTAVA launch. Talc litigation is being allowed to advance, with the plaintiff’s expert testimony to be allowed. This is a hurdle for the company, but it will be allowed to refute the testimony. Meanwhile, Stelara lost its patent protection in 2025 and will face increasing competition as the year progresses. Sales of Stelara, which accounted for approximately 11.5% of 2024 revenue, fell more than 40% in 2025.

FactSet Barclays Partnership Tests Growth Narrative After Share Price Slide

January 23, 2026

FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS) has entered a multiyear partnership with Barclays to support the bank's long term market data strategy.

The collaboration will see FactSet provide data and analytics capabilities to Barclays across its global operations.

The agreement signals deeper integration of FactSet's platforms into a major financial institution's core workflows.

For investors watching FactSet at a share price of $288.79, this new Barclays agreement comes after a mixed performance record. NYSE:FDS shows a 1.4% gain year to date, but the stock has seen a 37.1% decline over the past year and is lower over the 3 year and 5 year periods. That backdrop makes large client wins particularly important to how you might think about the business today.

The Barclays partnership could influence how you assess FactSet's competitive position in high value enterprise data contracts, an area where scale and client stickiness tend to matter. While the revenue and margin impact are not detailed here, investors may want to watch for future disclosures around adoption, product scope, and any expansion of the relationship into additional business lines.

This agreement looks like a meaningful validation of FactSet's role in enterprise data, since Barclays is tying a long term market data plan to FactSet's analytics and technology. For you as an investor, the key angle is that Barclays is not just buying a single product; it is standardising on a suite of tools, which can deepen usage over time if FactSet is embedded across desks and regions.

FactSet Research Systems narrative, does this Barclays deal move the needle?

Recent concerns around slowing revenue growth and a 31.8% share price decline over six months have fed a narrative that FactSet is a mature business without much excitement. A large global bank choosing FactSet to power its market data strategy may challenge that view slightly, because it speaks to relevance with tier one clients even as growth has moderated.

Risks and rewards to weigh from this partnership

🎁 A multiyear, broad product rollout at Barclays can support perceptions of dependable earnings and help justify fair value assessments that already factor in a reliable 1.52% dividend.

🎁 The agreement may reinforce existing views that FactSet is still winning business, with earnings having grown 9.4% per year over five years and forecasts pointing to 6.13% annual growth.

⚠️ Execution risk remains, since FactSet still has a high level of debt and must deliver smoothly on complex implementation and service requirements for a global bank.

⚠️ Investors may want to see whether this is a one off win or part of a broader pattern of similar deals before revising expectations around long term growth.

What to watch next

From here, it is worth tracking any quantified disclosures on contract value, product adoption across Barclays' business lines, and whether other large institutions reference similar partnerships with FactSet.

What Is Agilent Technologies' Investment Narrative?

To own Agilent, you need to be on board with a measured, innovation-led story rather than a hyper-growth one. The company is generating solid revenue of US$6,948.0 million and earnings of US$1,303.0 million, but its share price has lagged both the broader US market and the Life Sciences industry over the past year. The launch of the S540MD slide scanner fits neatly into Agilent’s push deeper into digital pathology and AI tools, but on its own it is unlikely to shift the near term earnings outlook or the consensus price target, which already sits about a fifth above the current share price. The more immediate catalysts remain execution on moderate earnings growth, management’s relatively new tenure, and how comfortably investors accept a valuation above some fair value estimates.

However, there is one key execution risk around new management and capital allocation that investors should not ignore. Agilent Technologies' share price has been on the slide but might be up to 22% below fair value. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$113 to US$169 per share, underlining how far apart private investors can be. Against that backdrop, Agilent’s push into AI enabled pathology and a relatively new management team give you plenty of reasons to compare several viewpoints before deciding how much of its future you want to price in.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 22% more than the current price!

On January 13, Christine Cho, CFA, from Barclays, reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $146 price target. However, earlier on January 9, Goldman Sachs had maintained a Neutral rating on Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) with a $106 price target.

​The ratings follow the company’s agreement with Meta to develop a 1.2 GW Nuclear Energy at Pike County, Ohio. Management of Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) noted that, under the agreement, Meta will prepay for the power and provide capital to ensure the project is completed successfully. Management noted that they plan to use the capital to advance phase 1 of the project on the land that has already been acquired, along with securing fuel for the plant. The pre-construction work is expected to start this year, with the first phase of the plant coming online in 2030.

​According to Goldman Sachs, each GW of powerhouse deployment will add roughly $15 to $20 per share to the company’s stock, based on the DCF analysis. The firm also noted that Meta is pursuing other nuclear deals, which it views as positive for companies in the nuclear segment.

​Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced nuclear power plants that recycle nuclear waste to provide clean, reliable energy, supporting sustainable solutions for the increasing power demands of AI.

“I think we can produce tools, and I think we can do it easily now with AI that we couldn't before,” Abell said.","Healthcare cybersecurity is a Gordian Knot problem—complex, difficult, and essential—but AI might provide the sword.

Andrea Abell, CISO at pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, is utilizing the technology available for all sorts of tasks. During a conversation with IT Brew at CES earlier this month, Abell said she uses AI “across the board.” Defenders should assume threat actors are doing the same.

“If we are looking to defend [against] generative AI, we have to think about all of the places that an attacker can take advantage of it,” Abell said.

Seeking out. Likening threat detection to finding a needle in a haystack, Abell said that she believes AI can make the haystack smaller and speed up the hunt, especially when combined with human knowledge. Agentic AI also has a role to play, especially in threat modeling.

“We’re doing what everyone else is doing, which is making agents to help reduce the human workload,” Abell said. “All of this new technology requires new defenses, new tooling, all of those types of things.”

In the healthcare sector, workers are often the last line of defense against hackers—and attacks can come when the focus is on saving lives, not protecting systems. John Riggi, national advisor for cybersecurity and risk at trade and lobbying group the American Hospital Association (AHA), told IT Brew in November that cybersecurity is an important part of any healthcare organization’s setup.

“Cyber hygiene is as important as medical hygiene to help protect patients from harm,” Riggi said.

Part of making that happen, said Alex Tyrrell, SVP and CTO of the health division at Wolters Kluwer, is ensuring there’s device security alongside the implementation of AI solutions.

“Training is going to be a key aspect and maintaining these guardrails, make sure the controls are in place,” Tyrell told IT Brew in December.

Get it right. Yes, there will be challenges. But Abell remains optimistic and hopeful about the future of AI-assisted cybersecurity in the healthcare space. Implementing change in the supply chain for vendor security, as well as modeling threats, requires a serious effort on the part of IT pros at Eli Lilly.

Abell added that she hopes initiatives like secure by default, which are being implemented by companies like Amazon and Microsoft, will help to offer a framework for small, rural healthcare centers and hospitals.

“I think we can produce tools, and I think we can do it easily now with AI that we couldn't before,” Abell said. “That’s what I’m most excited about.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/8fe871abfaf7960b7d06933c9dee6aae5e1eced9-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2026-01-23 12:43:02.843750

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) – U.S. business activity was steady in January as an improvement in new orders was offset by a lackluster labor market and lingering concerns among firms over higher costs because of import tariffs, a survey showed on ‍Friday.

S&P Global said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, inched down to 52.8 this month from 52.7 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the private sector. Both services and manufacturing flash PMIs were little changed this month.

S&P Global said the composite PMI was consistent with a moderation in economic growth at the turn of the year.

The government reported on ‌Thursday that the economy grew at a 4.4% annualized pace in the ‌third quarter, driven by strong consumer and business spending on intellectual property products, likely related to artificial intelligence, as well as a smaller trade deficit.

The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 5.4% rate in the October-December quarter. The fourth-quarter GDP report, delayed by the 43-day government ​shutdown, will be published on February 20.

The survey continued to paint a picture of labor market stagnation, which S&P Global said reflected concerns over rising costs and softer sales growth in ‍recent months. Its measure of private sector employment edged up ​to 50.5 from 50.3 last month.

Some businesses reported difficulties finding staff, which ​could be linked to an immigration crackdown that economists say has reduced labor supply.

TARIFFS ARE WIDELY BLAMED ‍FOR INCREASED COSTS

The survey’s gauge of prices asked by firms for goods and services ticked down to 57.2, still among the highest recorded over the last three years, from 57.3 in December.

A measure of prices paid for inputs fell to a still-high 59.7 from 61.9 last month.

The elevated price measures suggest that inflation could remain high for some time. Businesses have absorbed ‍some of the duties from President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs, helping to avert a much feared big inflation surge. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged next week while policymakers watch ‍inflation and the labor market.

“Increased ‍costs, widely blamed on tariffs, are again cited as a key driver ​of higher prices for both goods and services in January, meaning ​inflation and ⁠affordability remains a widespread concern among businesses,” said Chris Williamson, chief business ‌economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The survey’s measure of new orders received by businesses rose to 52.2 from 50.8 in December. But exports fell to a nine-month low, pulled down by declines in both goods and services.

Business confidence weakened, dropping slightly below the average seen last year. S&P Global said “the demand-dampening impact of higher prices, geopolitical worries and federal government policies remained a concern among many firms.”

The Sphere-360 catheter was designed in response to physician feedback showing the need for a simple, differentiated workflow and predictable outcomes using a single catheter that accommodates anatomical variations in pulmonary veins. The catheter boasts an adjustable configuration lattice design that conforms to the shape of the veins and allows energy delivery without needing to rotate the catheter in each position.

“The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes. Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter,” said Tobias Reichlin, MD., Director of Electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. “With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it’s an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.”

It delivers circumferential, consistent lesions from the entire 34 mm lattice without catheter rotation. The all-in-one catheter for navigation, mapping, and ablation needs a single transseptal puncture and no catheter exchange. Real-time local impedance information assesses catheter proximity to tissue, as well.

Polestar Capital e-Mobility & Infrastructure Fund (PCEIF) was launched in February 2025 with a target of €500 million and a €1 billion hard-cap.
“That may have been one of the triggers because Polestar Capital was earning quite good money from that mandate,” one source said.
The firm previously had three other funds in capital raising, which have now either been suspended or sold: PCEIF; Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds); and Polestar Capital Circular Debt Fund (PCDF).
Fund strategy PCEIF is an infrastructure credit fund that invests in the energy transition by providing senior-secured loans to businesses supplying low-carbon transport solutions.","Utrecht-based Polestar Capital has halted fundraising for its flagship sustainable infrastructure debt strategy, Infrastructure Investor has learned.

Polestar Capital e-Mobility & Infrastructure Fund (PCEIF) was launched in February 2025 with a target of €500 million and a €1 billion hard-cap. The fund was expected to hold a €500 million first close on its target by the end of 2025, with a final close anticipated on its hard-cap in Q3 2026.

Sources with knowledge of the matter said that the manager suspended fundraising after encountering financial difficulties. As a result, Polestar has embarked on an organisational restructuring and implemented a new business strategy.

“They [Polestar] decided to do a reorganisation, which meant that half of the staff left,” one source stated, noting the departures included the biodiversity team and the PCEIF investment unit.

Meanwhile, another source echoed this view: “PCEIF is on hold for the moment; it’s not fundraising because things are not going well.”

When approached for comment, a spokesperson at Polestar disputed that the firm had experienced financial challenges. The firm acknowledged that it had paused fundraising for PCEIF, but stated the decision was in response to feedback from investors to widen and diversify the scope of the strategy.

Infrastructure Investor understands that one of the potential causes for the alleged financial challenges could be the loss of one of its earnings streams and key mandate – the Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds) – in 2024.

It is understood that the manager sold its brokerage operations in December 2024, including the activities related to the Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds).

“That may have been one of the triggers because Polestar Capital was earning quite good money from that mandate,” one source said. “That mandate was given back to the [Dutch] government.”

Crucially, sources suggested investors grew concerned after learning of the firm’s alleged financial constraints in June and July 2025, leading some to withdraw their interest. At that time, PCEIF had been in advanced discussions with several large Dutch institutional investors and some international investors who were conducting due diligence.

Sources added that the manager was anticipating that three or four investors would contribute more than €100 million each to the strategy. These investors – including pension schemes and insurance companies from the Netherlands and abroad – were expected to provide the €500 million required for the vehicle’s first close by the end of Q4 2025.

Polestar denied that investors had withdrawn their interest due to concerns over the manager’s financial position.

Infrastructure Investor understands that despite the suspension, efforts are being explored to continue the strategy, either under a new GP or within the sustainability arm of an existing manager. Sources also pointed to ongoing discussions with potential GPs in Germany, the UK and the Netherlands about taking over the fund or strategy.

Another source suggested Polestar is likely to reassess whether to resume fundraising for PCEIF once the reorganisation is complete.

The Polestar spokesman signalled the firm may return to market later this year with a broader impact strategy, which could still feature e-mobility as one of its themes.

Infrastructure Investor understands the manager is still in the market with its remaining strategy, Limburg Energy Fund.

The firm previously had three other funds in capital raising, which have now either been suspended or sold: PCEIF; Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds); and Polestar Capital Circular Debt Fund (PCDF).

In December 2025, Colesco Capital, a sustainability-led private credit specialist, acquired the management of PCDF from Polestar and renamed it the Colesco Circular & Climate Credit Impact Fund.

Fund strategy

PCEIF is an infrastructure credit fund that invests in the energy transition by providing senior-secured loans to businesses supplying low-carbon transport solutions.

The vehicle aims to finance a portfolio of 15-30 initiatives, with approximately 80 percent based in the Netherlands and the remainder in Northwestern Europe.

PCEIF deploys capital to e-mobility and charging infrastructure projects, including e-fleets, public charging point operators, and privately-owned depot charging facilities.

The fund targets an 8 percent net IRR, with ticket sizes ranging between €5 million and €75 million, and has a 10-year term with an option to extend for two years.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1313535992.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 10:41:29.295202

Successful completion of first cases at multiple sites kicks off Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial in the United States

GALWAY, Ireland , Jan. 23, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced two major milestones for the Affera™ Sphere-360™ catheter, a first-of-its-kind, all-in-one mapping and single-shot pulsed field ablation (PFA) catheter for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib): CE Mark in Europe and the completion of first cases in the Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial in the United States.

The Sphere-360 catheter was designed in response to physician feedback expressing the need for a simple, differentiated workflow and predictable outcomes using a single catheter that accommodates anatomical variations in pulmonary veins. Seamlessly integrated with the Affera mapping and ablation system, the catheter offers an adjustable configuration lattice design that conforms to the shape of the veins and allows energy delivery without the need to rotate the catheter in each position.

The Affera mapping and ablation system and the Sphere-9™ all-in-one mapping and ablation catheter have been rapidly adopted by physicians in multiple geographies for their excellent safety and durability profile.

""The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes. Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter,"" said Tobias Reichlin, M.D., Director of Electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. ""With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it's an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.""

Additional benefits of Sphere-360 include:

Delivers circumferential, consistent lesions from the entire 34 mm lattice without catheter rotation, enhancing workflow efficiency

Adapts to the vein by adjusting the shape of the conformable lattice to the patient's anatomy

All-in-one catheter for navigation, mapping, and ablation with a single transseptal puncture and zero catheter exchange

Real-time local impedance information to assess catheter proximity to tissue

Easy access to pulmonary veins with enhanced stability through its over-the-wire design

Compatible with FlexCath Contour™ 10 French deflectable sheath designed for easy catheter positioning

""Advances in electrophysiology over the past several years are having a significant impact on care for arrhythmia patients, and Affera has been a key part of that impact,"" said Vivek Reddy, M.D., Director of Cardiac Arrhythmia Services for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. ""Now with Sphere-360, we have a new and differentiated single-shot PFA catheter with the potential to deliver the next phase of innovation. It's an exciting time for physicians and patients and we're not slowing down.""

Results from the Sphere-360 European study at one year were presented at the Heart Rhythm Society Annual Meeting and published in the Heart Rhythm Journal in April 2025. The prospective, single-arm, multi-center trial in European centers demonstrated excellent efficacy, safety, and durability that led to CE Mark.

""The achievement of CE Mark for Sphere-360, as well as the first cases in the U.S. IDE trial, mark two major achievements in our effort to deliver new and better treatments to AFib patients,"" said Rebecca Seidel, president of the Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio. ""We're committed to leading in PFA and bringing meaningful innovation at a regular cadence.""

The Horizon 360 IDE study is a prospective, single-arm clinical study at centers across the U.S. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.

About Medtronic PFA

About Atrial Fibrillation

AFib is one of the most common and undertreated heart rhythm disorders, affecting more than 60 million people worldwide 1 . AFib is a progressive disease, often beginning as paroxysmal AFib (presents intermittently) and progressing to persistent (lasts for more than 7+ days without stopping). As the disease progresses, the risk of serious complications including heart failure, stroke and risk of death increases 2-5 .

Recruitment is ongoing for the DurAVR transcatheter heart valve global pivotal trial for patients with severe aortic stenosis, known as the Paradigm trial.
Aortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the body, becomes narrowed.
TAVR stands for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a minimally invasive procedure to replace a diseased aortic valve.","Medtronic will invest up to US$90m in Anteris Technologies to help fund the next stage of growth and the DurAVR transcatheter heart valve programme.

The Australia-founded company said the funding will support execution of its clinical strategy for DurAVR, designed to mimic a healthy human aortic valve and replicate normal aortic blood flow.

Transcatheter heart valves are replacement valves delivered to the heart through a catheter, a thin flexible tube inserted through a blood vessel rather than open heart surgery.

The private placement requires Medtronic to acquire a 16.0 to 19.99 per cent stake in Anteris.

Anteris is also proposing a US$200m underwritten public offering, with underwriters given a 30-day option to spend US$30m to buy additional shares at the offering price, minus underwriting discounts and commissions.

Recruitment is ongoing for the DurAVR transcatheter heart valve global pivotal trial for patients with severe aortic stenosis, known as the Paradigm trial. Aortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the body, becomes narrowed.

The company said it is expanding its manufacturing capabilities.

Jorie Soskin is vice president and general manager of the structural heart business in Medtronic’s cardiovascular portfolio.

Soskin said: “Medtronic is a pioneer in TAVR innovation and evidence.

“Our investment in differentiated innovation like DurAVR THV technology, which has the potential to offer improved valve performance in a balloon-expandable platform, is core to our commitment to define and drive the future of TAVR, meeting the needs of more aortic stenosis patients and heart teams with a comprehensive portfolio.”

Officials said part of the proceeds may also fund research and development for v2vmedtech, Anteris’ partner company, which is developing a next-generation transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system for mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. This refers to leaky valves that allow blood to flow backwards.

Any remaining funds could be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The fundraising came nearly three months after Anteris announced positive one-year clinical outcomes for DurAVR. The balloon-expandable, biomimetic DurAVR THV is made from a single piece of moulded Adapt tissue, described as the company’s patented anti-calcification bovine tissue technology.

Wayne Paterson, chief executive of Anteris Technologies, said the deal followed 2.5 years of negotiations.

Paterson said Medtronic wanted to acquire the company outright because Anteris’ technology could make it more competitive against TAVR rival Edwards Lifesciences, but it ultimately agreed to an investment that could enable a co-commercialisation partnership and manufacturing collaborations around Minneapolis.

TAVR stands for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a minimally invasive procedure to replace a diseased aortic valve.

According to a regulatory filing linked to the offering, Medtronic will also have the right to a non-voting board observer and certain negotiation rights in connection with future third-party acquisition proposals.

The investment in Anteris comes after Medtronic’s TAVR competitor Edwards Lifesciences failed to acquire JenaValve due to antitrust concerns from the Federal Trade Commission.",https://www.htworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cropped-HTW-3-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-23 09:42:25.448504

Overview

Sandisk Corporation's stock experienced a dramatic 1,117% surge over six months, doubling in the first two weeks of 2026. This rally, attributed to the AI trade's focus on storage and a flash memory shortage enabling price hikes, has generated over $3 billion in mark-to-market losses for short sellers. With short interest rising to 7.5% of the float, S3 Partners flags an 'extreme' risk of a short squeeze.

1. THE SEAMLESS LINK

The escalating short squeeze risk for Sandisk Corporation is a direct consequence of its remarkable stock performance, which has seen shares appreciate over 1,100% in the past six months. This meteoric rise, which accelerated with a doubling in value during the first two weeks of 2026, has placed immense pressure on bearish investors. The company's trajectory is closely watched, especially given the fundamental shifts occurring in the technology sector.

2. THE STRUCTURE

The AI-Fueled Storage Surge

Sandisk Corporation's stock has demonstrated an extraordinary upward trend, climbing 1,117% in the last six months and showing no signs of abatement, even doubling in the initial two weeks of 2026 [6, 9]. This performance has inflicted substantial mark-to-market losses exceeding $3 billion upon short sellers [News1]. According to S3 Partners, short interest has climbed to 7.5% of Sandisk's total float, a significant increase from a prior 4%, elevating the firm's risk score to an 'extreme' level indicative of a potential short squeeze [News1]. A short squeeze materializes when a rapid stock price increase compels short sellers to repurchase shares to cover their positions, often at a loss, which can further amplify the price climb [News1]. As of January 21, 2026, Sandisk's market capitalization stood at approximately $73.47 billion, with its stock trading around $501.29 [7, 9]. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio remains negative on a trailing twelve-month basis, a common characteristic for companies undergoing rapid growth or strategic investment phases, though a forward P/E estimate for 2026 stands at approximately 35.6 [1, 15].

Catalysts Driving Storage Demand

The remarkable rally in Sandisk shares is underpinned by a confluence of factors. The burgeoning artificial intelligence sector has increasingly directed its focus toward storage solutions, recognizing the massive data requirements for AI infrastructure [6, 18, 23]. This heightened demand, coupled with a critical shortage in flash memory supply, has provided Sandisk with the leverage to increase prices [6, 11, 35]. Supporting this narrative, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's pronouncements at the CES Technology conference, where he described the storage space as a ""completely unserved market,"" added considerable positive sentiment towards storage-focused companies [19, 27]. The global memory chip shortage, exacerbated by manufacturers shifting capacity to high-margin AI products like HBM and DDR5, is projected to persist through late 2026 and into 2027, further tightening supply and supporting higher prices for NAND flash [18, 39].

Sandisk's Market Position and Corporate History

Headquartered in California, Sandisk is recognized for its high-performance storage drives, memory cards, and USB flash drives [News1]. Sandisk Corporation (SNDK) completed its separation from Western Digital and began independent trading on the Nasdaq on February 24, 2025 [20, 36]. Since its re-listing, its stock has experienced substantial growth, with reports indicating gains of over 700% by early 2026, and a significant increase from April 2025 to January 2026 [6, 47]. Western Digital, now a pure-play HDD provider post-spin-off, has also seen its stock surge significantly, benefiting from AI-driven demand for high-capacity storage solutions and improved margins [21, 28]. Several investment banks have raised price targets for Sandisk, with Bernstein Société Générale doubling its target to $580, citing unprecedented NAND shortages and price increases [15]. Sandisk is scheduled to announce its fiscal second-quarter financial results on January 29, 2026 [11].

Successful completion of first cases at multiple sites kicks off Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial in the United States

Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced two major milestones for the Affera™ Sphere-360™ catheter, a first-of-its-kind, all-in-one mapping and single-shot pulsed field ablation (PFA) catheter for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib): CE Mark in Europe and the completion of first cases in the Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial in the United States.

The Sphere-360 catheter was designed in response to physician feedback expressing the need for a simple, differentiated workflow and predictable outcomes using a single catheter that accommodates anatomical variations in pulmonary veins. Seamlessly integrated with the Affera mapping and ablation system, the catheter offers an adjustable configuration lattice design that conforms to the shape of the veins and allows energy delivery without the need to rotate the catheter in each position.

The Affera mapping and ablation system and the Sphere-9™ all-in-one mapping and ablation catheter have been rapidly adopted by physicians in multiple geographies for their excellent safety and durability profile.

""The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes. Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter,"" said Tobias Reichlin, M.D., Director of Electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. ""With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it's an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.""

Additional benefits of Sphere-360 include:

Delivers circumferential, consistent lesions from the entire 34 mm lattice without catheter rotation, enhancing workflow efficiency

Adapts to the vein by adjusting the shape of the conformable lattice to the patient's anatomy

All-in-one catheter for navigation, mapping, and ablation with a single transseptal puncture and zero catheter exchange

Real-time local impedance information to assess catheter proximity to tissue

Easy access to pulmonary veins with enhanced stability through its over-the-wire design

Compatible with FlexCath Contour™ 10 French deflectable sheath designed for easy catheter positioning

""Advances in electrophysiology over the past several years are having a significant impact on care for arrhythmia patients, and Affera has been a key part of that impact,"" said Vivek Reddy, M.D., Director of Cardiac Arrhythmia Services for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. ""Now with Sphere-360, we have a new and differentiated single-shot PFA catheter with the potential to deliver the next phase of innovation. It's an exciting time for physicians and patients and we're not slowing down.""

Results from the Sphere-360 European study at one year were presented at the Heart Rhythm Society Annual Meeting and published in the Heart Rhythm Journal in April 2025. The prospective, single-arm, multi-center trial in European centers demonstrated excellent efficacy, safety, and durability that led to CE Mark.

""The achievement of CE Mark for Sphere-360, as well as the first cases in the U.S. IDE trial, mark two major achievements in our effort to deliver new and better treatments to AFib patients,"" said Rebecca Seidel, president of the Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio. ""We're committed to leading in PFA and bringing meaningful innovation at a regular cadence.""

The Horizon 360 IDE study is a prospective, single-arm clinical study at centers across the U.S. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.

Operational information for accessing the measures is available at UniCredit branches throughout the region.","UniCredit has launched extraordinary measures to meet the immediate needs of families and businesses affected by the severe weather in Calabria. This initiative provides financial support to customers residing or headquartered in Calabria.

The severe weather that has hit large areas of Calabria in recent weeks, the institute in Piazza Gae Aulenti explains in a statement, is causing damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses, placing particular pressure on small towns, agricultural supply chains, local businesses, and widespread tourism. Several areas are experiencing operational difficulties, production slowdowns, and strains on businesses' liquidity, in a context already marked by structural fragility and increasing exposure to extreme weather events.

In this context, UniCredit has made available an ""Emergency Moratorium,"" which allows for the suspension of mortgage payments for up to twelve months for private customers and for mortgage and unsecured loans for businesses, for loans that are in regular repayment and have not incurred any irregularities in the two months prior to the request. Applications must be submitted by March 31, 2026, accompanied by a self-certification certifying the damage suffered. The suspension takes effect from the first available payment following the submission of the request and does not result in negative reports in credit databases.

In addition to the moratorium, a ""New Business Credit"" package is available, which provides financing on favorable terms to support business continuity, the recovery of operations, and initial liquidity needs, subject to a credit assessment. Applications must be received by March 31, 2026. The suspended installments, including interest accrued on the suspended principal only, can be repaid at the end of the original repayment plan, over the remaining term of the mortgage, or in a lump sum in the event of early repayment. The suspension can also be requested for mortgages subject to securitization or the issuance of covered bank bonds and does not constitute contractual novation.

""When an extraordinary weather event hits a region, the priority is to prevent the damage from quickly turning into financial hardship for families and businesses,"" says Ferdinando Natali, Unicredit's Southern Regional Manager. ""Suspending installments and accessing new liquidity allow us to maintain continuity in payments, supplier relationships, and day-to-day operations, at a time when stability is crucial.""

Operational information for accessing the measures is available at UniCredit branches throughout the region.

Omics Lab Services Market

Dublin, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Omics Lab Services Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Omics Lab Services Market is projected to expand from USD 72.88 Billion in 2025 to USD 128.48 Billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 9.91%. The market is significantly propelled by the increasing integration of personalized and precision medicine, as healthcare providers turn to molecular profiling to customize patient treatments.

This transition from generalized prescribing to targeted therapeutic approaches requires extensive genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic testing, thereby boosting the volume of samples processed by specialized labs. Pharmaceutical developers are heavily investing in biomarker research to validate these targeted therapies, fueling the demand for outsourced, high-complexity testing to ensure regulatory approval and clinical success. According to the Personalized Medicine Coalition's May 2025 report, 'Personalized Medicine at FDA: The Scope & Significance of Progress in 2024,' the FDA approved 18 new personalized medicines in 2024, representing roughly 38% of all newly approved therapeutic molecular entities, which highlights the industry's reliance on advanced omics data.

Concurrently, the rising demand for liquid biopsy and non-invasive diagnostic tools is widening the market scope by facilitating frequent disease monitoring without the risks involved in tissue biopsies. This shift compels service providers to expand their sequencing infrastructure and bioinformatic capabilities to manage the growing influx of complex blood-based biomarker tests needed for cancer surveillance and early detection. Guardant Health reported in its 'Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results' in February 2025 that it processed approximately 206,700 oncology clinical tests during 2024, a 20% increase year-over-year. The financial magnitude of this trend is further demonstrated by Exact Sciences, which reported total revenue of $2.76 billion for the full year 2024 in 2025, largely attributed to the strong uptake of its diagnostic and cancer screening services.

Market Challenges

A major obstacle to the Global Omics Lab Services Market is the intricate regulatory framework governing data privacy and ethical compliance. Because laboratories handle vast amounts of sensitive genetic data, they must implement advanced data protection systems to satisfy strict international requirements. This necessity requires significant resource allocation, which increases operational costs and diverts funds away from research and development, often leading to project delays. Consequently, the financial and technical demands of compliance establish high barriers to entry, deterring smaller, innovative companies and favoring market consolidation among a few large providers.

Additionally, the severe financial implications of data breaches force laboratories to prioritize risk management over service expansion. The costs associated with security failures are prohibitive and pose significant liability concerns; the American Hospital Association's 2025 Environmental Scan report noted that the average cost of a healthcare data breach in 2024 was $9.77 million. Such high risks drive organizations to adopt restrictive data handling protocols, which can impede collaborative research efforts and slow the market's capacity to provide timely and accessible diagnostic solutions.

Market Trends

The integration of Artificial Intelligence for advanced data interpretation is emerging as a cornerstone trend in the omics sector, shifting the focus from delivering raw sequencing data to providing actionable insights. Service providers are increasingly incorporating machine learning algorithms into their bioinformatics workflows to decode complex multi-omics datasets, enabling pharmaceutical clients to discover new therapeutic targets more rapidly and accurately. This evolution toward AI-driven insight generation offers significant revenue potential for technologically advanced labs. For instance, Tempus AI reported in its 'Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results' in February 2025 that it achieved a total revenue of $693.4 million for the fiscal year 2024, marking a 30.4% year-over-year increase driven largely by its enhanced AI-enabled capabilities.

In parallel, the rise of Spatial Omics and tissue profiling technologies is transforming biological analysis by allowing researchers to map gene expression within the architectural context of tissue. Unlike traditional sequencing methods that dissociate cells, spatial profiling maintains the sample's positional integrity, offering vital insights into tumor microenvironments and cellular interactions crucial for immuno-oncology. This advancement has prompted laboratories to invest significantly in high-plex imaging and spatially resolved transcriptomics to satisfy growing biopharma demand. Highlighting this trend, 10x Genomics reported in its 'Preliminary Select Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results' in January 2025 that it generated approximately $121.1 million in spatial consumables revenue for the full year 2024, demonstrating the rapid industry adoption of these context-aware solutions.

ByteDance, Meta, and OpenAI are all betting on one thing You may ask, since software is so powerful, why not just make apps as before?
In short, ByteDance, Meta, and OpenAI are all betting on one thing: What if users don't click on apps?
Large companies are vying for our attention, the scenes in front of us, and the sounds in our ears.","Have you noticed that large companies are all deploying their own AI hardware products?

At the Davos Forum, Chris Lane, the global affairs officer of OpenAI, revealed the latest news that OpenAI is progressing as planned and preparing to launch its first AI hardware device in the second half of 2026.

This news has completely stirred up the already anxious tech circle.

This means that the world's top algorithm engines are entering the hardware race. In China, recently, companies like Huawei, ByteDance, and Alibaba are all flocking to the AI hardware market.

You know, in the past decade, Internet companies have been trying to get rid of bulky hardware and pursue a light - asset software model. Now, they are collectively ""reverting to their ancestors"" at all costs and rushing back to the tough hardware market that once gave them a hard time.

Take ByteDance as a typical example. As a software company, its Feishu recently collaborated with Anker Innovations to launch an AI office hardware called ""One Bean"". Before that, people only knew Feishu for its documents, spreadsheets, and video conferencing.

But if you broaden your perspective, you'll find that this is not just Feishu's move. ByteDance, Alibaba, Xiaomi, Baidu, and even Meta and OpenAI across the ocean are all scrambling into the hardware market.

Meta is the most aggressive. According to media reports, Zuckerberg has asked manufacturing partners to double the annual production capacity of AI smart glasses to 20 million pairs by the end of 2026.

Is this another technological upsurge? However, if you look back at the pitfalls these large companies have encountered on the hardware path, you'll find how abnormal this collective influx is.

In the past decade, large companies' attempts at hardware almost always ended in failure, especially in the Chinese market. Baidu made mobile phones, ByteDance acquired Smartisan, Alibaba launched Tmall Genie, and Tencent also tried various social hardware.

What was the result? Either they left with losses or disbanded the departments. It seems that software companies' DNA is not suited to handle hardware.

For large companies to venture into hardware is like jumping into a fire pit.

But in 2026, the hardware trend has not only returned but is even more intense than before.

What exactly is going on behind this? Why are large companies willing to jump into this arduous hardware business again?

1. Why can't software companies do well in hardware?

Before discussing why everyone wants to do hardware now, we need to see why they failed in the past.

You may have forgotten that Tencent once wanted to make mobile phones. Around 2015, Tencent launched the TOS (Tencent OS) system and even collaborated with manufacturers to produce mobile phones. What was the result? There was no splash in the market, and the project was soon halted. After ByteDance acquired Smartisan, it also couldn't escape the fate of failure.

The reason why it's difficult for large companies to do hardware is that they carry the arrogance of Internet companies in their genes.

The logic of Internet companies is to quickly test and iterate. If there is a mistake in an app, programmers can stay up all night to modify the code, and users can resume normal use after an update the next day. In this world, the marginal cost is almost zero. One more user just means a little more server space.

But hardware is a completely different story.

The logic of hardware is a one - shot deal. If there is a one - millimeter error when making a mold, hundreds of thousands of shells will become waste. If you order one less sensor in the supply chain, your entire production line will have to stop. Hardware companies pursue cost control of each part and inventory turnover.

Take the smart speaker war back then. To grab users, large companies sold speakers that cost 200 yuan for 69 yuan or even less. They thought that as long as you bought their speakers, you would use their music services and buy their products.

Users did buy, but they just used the speakers as alarm clocks or radios. The hardware itself didn't make money, and the software services couldn't drive sales either. In the end, these hardware departments became a heavy burden on the company's books.

In short, software companies didn't understand the respect for hardware before. They approached hardware with the same mindset as making apps and were finally taught a lesson by the supply chain and inventory.

2. AI has changed the rules of the game

Since it was so difficult in the past, why do people think it's okay now?

The answer lies in the large - scale AI models. The most important reason is actually just two words: interaction.

In the past, it was difficult to make hardware. You had to design screens, complex menus, and figure out how users would click and press. This required strong industrial design and interaction logic. Software companies' failure in hardware was largely because they designed the hardware too complexly and couldn't handle these physical - level complex interactions.

But after the emergence of large - scale AI models, the situation has changed.

Nowadays, AI hardware no longer needs a screen or even redundant buttons. Look at Feishu's ""One Bean"". Its core interaction is simply listening and speaking.

Take AI glasses as another example. You say a word to the glasses, and they can understand your meaning and execute directly. This interaction method has lowered the threshold of hardware.

Software companies have found that they don't need to study how to make a perfect touch screen. They only need to do a good job on the ""brain"" (AI model), and the hardware only needs to provide a microphone, camera, and chip.

Nowadays, hardware has essentially become a sensor for AI.

Take the Plaud Note product as an example. It sells well because it addresses the pain point that the iPhone can't record calls. But do users really buy it just for recording? No. Users buy it for the summarization, transcription, and translation after recording.

Without a model like ChatGPT behind it, this recording pen would just be ordinary electronic waste. It's AI that gives these simply - structured hardware devices the ability to think and summarize.

Software companies suddenly realized that they don't need to compete with Apple and Huawei in terms of precise industrial design. They only need to make a simple carrier and install their AI models into it.

For Feishu, the original intention of making ""One Bean"" is definitely not to make money from selling hardware, but to let Feishu's AI go beyond computers and mobile phones. If you're in an offline meeting or on the road while driving and can't open your computer to write a document, ""One Bean"" becomes your external brain.

In short, what software companies are best at has now become the core competitiveness of hardware.

3. ByteDance, Meta, and OpenAI are all betting on one thing

You may ask, since software is so powerful, why not just make apps as before? Why do they have to get involved in making hardware themselves?

Imagine the scenario in 2026. If you're wearing Meta's glasses or OpenAI's headphones and you have a need. For example, you want to schedule a meeting at 3 p.m.

Will you take out your phone, unlock it, find the Feishu icon, click on it, and then look for the calendar?

Most likely not. You'll just say to the glasses: Schedule a meeting for me.

At this time, the AI Agent in the glasses will directly handle the matter for you. In this process, the Feishu app completely disappears. It becomes a ""plug - in"" that provides data in the background.

This is fatal for large software companies.

If users no longer open the app, large companies will lose direct control over users. They can't see users' behavior habits, can't push ads to users, and can't sell other value - added services. They become workers for hardware manufacturers.

Feishu's making of ""One Bean"", Meta's making of glasses, and OpenAI's making of headphones are all essentially about defending their interaction entrances. They must have their own hardware carriers to ensure that when users have a need, they turn to their AI first, not others'.

Whoever controls the hardware closest to users' ears and eyes controls users' habits.

In short, ByteDance, Meta, and OpenAI are all betting on one thing: What if users don't click on apps?

This is a battle for the right to control the user entrance and the first interface.

4. Data scarcity, and even more panic without data

Besides seizing the entrance, there is a more hidden reason: AI has exhausted the data on the Internet.

You may not know that the current AI models are facing an embarrassing reality. The high - quality text data on the Internet is almost used up.

According to a report by the Epoch AI Research Institute, the high - quality English language data may run out between 2026 and 2032. In China, the data of each large company is self - contained and not open.

If AI wants to continue to evolve, it must find new data sources.

Where is this data? It's in our real life.

The data on the Internet is ""dead"" and processed by others. But the conversations in the real world, the scenes you see, and the tone in your meetings are real - time data.

AI hardware is essentially a 24 - hour detector.

When you wear AI glasses and enter a supermarket or use an AI recording pen in a meeting, AI is learning in real - time how humans handle real - world problems. It can see your logic in choosing products and hear your negotiation skills.

This first - person audio - visual data from the physical world is the scarcest resource for training the next - generation AI at present.

By selling hardware, large software companies are actually installing countless eyes and ears around the world. The data sent back to the cloud can make their models smarter and more understanding of human behavior logic.

Why do large companies make AI hardware? They don't care about the hardware profit. What they want is the real world in front of you.

5. Hardware is no longer a heavy asset

Why do people think they can succeed this time? Because large companies have become smarter and no longer try to handle everything by themselves.

Previously, when large companies made hardware, they took on everything from circuit board design to mold - making and factory production scheduling. As a result, it was not only slow but also lacked professionalism.

Now the trend is cooperation. For example, recently Doubao collaborated with ZTE to make mobile phones, and Feishu's choice to work with Anker Innovations on ""One Bean"" is a typical sign. It has to be said that ByteDance has mastered the dual - mode of software and hardware well.

Anker Innovations is a world - leading consumer electronics company. Their understanding of hardware such as the supply chain, batteries, and audio chips is world - class, and their supply - chain advantage is very strong. Anker Innovations provides the hardware carrier and distribution channels. Feishu provides the AI model and connects the office ecosystem.

This division of labor has significantly reduced the trial - and - error cost for software companies.

Feishu doesn't need to study how to make a non - heating charging chip, and Anker Innovations doesn't need to train a large - language model. This ""Lego - style"" assembly model has shortened the hardware R & D cycle from the previous 18 months to the current 6 months or even less.

Hardware is no longer a heavy asset but has become a plug - in that can be quickly iterated.

The production cycle of hardware has been shortened, and the risks have been shared. This makes large companies think that it's worth jumping into this ""fire pit"" again.

[Beyond the Page] Words:

The AI hardware trend in 2026 seems lively but is actually full of helplessness.

The collective move of software companies into hardware is essentially a fear of the end of the mobile Internet era. People have found that the walls of apps can no longer withstand the impact of AI. If you don't turn yourself into a physical entity that users carry around, you'll be forgotten by users.

But we also need to think about a question: Do we really need so many AI recording pens, glasses, and headphones?

The progress of technology is supposed to make people's lives easier. But now, we seem to be surrounded by more sensors. Large companies are vying for our attention, the scenes in front of us, and the sounds in our ears.

When the large - scale model finds its carrier, it is no longer just an icon in the phone but becomes a part of our body.

Is this human evolution or another deep penetration into our lives?","https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260123/v2_c5b4ce30ed5f4130ab317e3df97b6e5e@000000_oswg62034oswg946oswg403_img_000?x-oss-process=image/resize,m_mfit,w_600,h_400,limit_0/crop,w_600,h_400,g_center",N,,2026-01-23 11:01:02.855369

LONDON Art Fair features works from two modernist homes built in the late 1930s and run by the National Trust, the show’s museum partners, at its 2026 season opener.

The NT is Europe’s largest conservation charity, with 360-plus buildings in its care, and 2 Willow Road, Hampstead, by Ernő and Ursula Goldfinger and The Homewood, in Esher, by Patrick Gwynne, were both designed by the architects as family homes to include art.

Pieces on show include those by Henry Moore, Max Ernst, Prunella Clough, and more from Hampstead; and from Esher, most notably three works on paper by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska.

The 38th LAF is up and running at the Business Design Centre in Islington* and continues until Sunday, see www.londonartfair.co.uk for full details.

More than 120 galleries from home and abroad are represented, selling some excellent modern and contemporary art, complemented by an impressive programme of talks and tours throughout.

The Platform presentation, guest curated by Dr Ferren Gipson, is on the theme of The Unexpected, with artists challenging “conventions in material, process, and form in their work”.

An Encounters section has “the freshest contemporary art” from some 23 galleries, and among them IDENTITY – Ukrainian Artists’ Community, most of whom have moved to the UK owing to the war.

They offer a variety of styles and techniques on the theme “geometry of the universe”.

Siger Gallery’s exhibit “focuses on anxious artistic practices”, both challenging and unnerving.

Guillermo Monroy’s mixed media sculpture Speechless, for example, particularly so; with a masked young female as if coffined in a violin case.

And the Cole Levi-Klimt stand has a more overt religious theme, which includes an intriguing take on the Madonna and Child by Paul Freud.

With both smaller and larger galleries at the fair there’s enormous choice.

From oils by LS Lowry (price on application) and rare early works by David Hockney to oils from Walter Sickert, Ivon Hitchens, Kyffin Williams and many, many, more.

Excluding acquisitions, net new money was 2.7 billion francs, supported by activity in expansion markets including Asia, the Middle East, and Monaco.

Management Frames 2025 as Execution Under Pressure

CEO Guy de Picciotto pointed to delivery through adverse FX, falling rates, and acquisition–related costs, saying: «In 2025, our Bank once again delivered strong results… we achieved a healthy profit margin, reflecting a good balance of external and organic growth.»

Total income reached 1.51 billion francs, up 12.5 percent versus 2024, with the net result from interest operations at 546.1 million francs, up 13.1 percent.

OpenAI executives, meanwhile, debuted new education, health and cybersecurity initiatives, framing the moves as part of a push to ensure all markets — not just the US — see gains from the technology. At a press huddle, Brad Lightcap, the company’s chief operating officer, quoted the sci-fi author William Gibson: “The future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed.” Lightcap added: “That very much rings true on this.”

The rhetoric hints at the anxiety of this moment for AI. Many investors are getting antsy to see significant commercial growth that justifies the sector’s enormous expenditures and lofty valuations. OpenAI, an unprofitable startup, has committed to spend more than $1.4 trillion on data centers and chips for AI in the coming years, including striking several deals with cloud providers and chipmakers that have been criticized as circular.

Here follows a statement by the Royal Office :

""Following the 35th African Cup of Nations, hosted with great enthusiasm by the Kingdom of Morocco from December 21st, 2025 to January 18th, 2026, His Majesty the King Mohammed VI, may God assist Him, wishes to convey His gratitude to all members of the Nation, who have contributed admirably to the full success of this wonderful event.

His Majesty the King particularly wishes to congratulate all citizens, across various cities of the Kingdom, for the efforts deployed, and to thank each and every one for their valuable contribution to this historic success, which has been acknowledged and acclaimed worldwide.

The Sovereign also addresses His congratulations to millions of Moroccan women, men and children who, in an exemplary manner and each in their own way, tirelessly supported their national team, currently ranked 8th best national team in the world. Such remarkable result, fruit of a high-level proactive sports and infrastructure policy, as well as the patriotic choice made by talented youth of Moroccan Expatriates to opt for the national team’s jersey and to defend its colors with pride and gusto.

This edition of the continental competition will stand as a milestone, as, beyond its sporting outcomes, it made for a gauge for the Kingdom’s major leap on the path to development and progress, fruit of a long-term vision and a unique and efficient Moroccan model which puts the citizen at the heart of all ambition.

Moreover, even if this major continental football celebration hosted by the Kingdom appears to have been sadly marred by the unfortunate events of the final minutes of the match between the national teams of Morocco and Senegal, during which regrettable incidents and deeply deplorable behavior occurred, it remains nonetheless that, once passions have subsided, inter-African fraternity will naturally prevail, for this Moroccan success is also an African success. Morocco remains proud to have offered, on its soil, a month of popular joy and sporting emotion, and to have contributed to the prominence of Africa and its football.

Furthermore, in view of the denigration and attempts at discrediting sustained, His Majesty the King, may God assist Him, remains convinced that hostile schemes will never reach their aims, and that Moroccan people know to balance matters and not to be drawn into resentment and discord. Nothing will alter the closeness that was fostered over centuries between our African people, nor the fruitful cooperation built hand in hand with different countries of the Continent, bolstered by ever ambitious partnerships.

The Kingdom of Morocco is and shall remain a great African country, faithful to the spirit of brotherhood, solidarity and an always nurtured mutual respect towards its Continent.

In accordance with the enlightened Vision of the Sovereign, Morocco will further its resolute and steadfast commitment in favor of a united and prosperous Africa, notably through mutual exchange of experiences, expertise and knowledge.""",,N,,2026-01-23 11:43:38.684706

Let's dig into Taiwan Semi's earnings results and explore why the company's outlook bodes well for top players in the semiconductor industry.

Taiwan Semi just reported monster earnings

In the fourth quarter, Taiwan Semi generated $33.7 billion in revenue. This was about $300 million above the company's previously issued guidance, and represented growth of 25% year over year and 2% sequentially.

Perhaps even more encouraging is the company's profitability profile. In Q4, TSMC posted a gross margin of 62% -- roughly 330 basis points higher compared to the same period in 2024.

The combination of robust acceleration across the top line and widening gross profits fueled meaningful expansion in operating margins and earnings per share (EPS) for Taiwan Semi.

During the earnings call, the company's CEO, C.C. Wei, hinted that Taiwan Semi would use this excess cash flow to continue investing in next-generation foundries -- referring to the ongoing infrastructure boom as a ""multiyear AI megatrend.""

Taiwan Semi should be thought of as a pick-and-shovel player along the chip value chain. While Nvidia and Broadcom design different types of semiconductors meant for generative AI development, TSMC is the company behind the scenes bringing this hardware to life.

Taiwan Semi is the largest chip manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue. With a market share hovering around 70%, both Nvidia and Broadcom rely heavily on TSMC's fabrication expertise in order to fulfill their respective backlog orders. Taiwan Semi's current growth trajectory and encouraging forward guidance is especially good news for Nvidia and Broadcom investors.

TSMC's results validate that hyperscalers like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- some of Nvidia's largest customers -- are accelerating their AI infrastructure roadmaps.

Taiwan Semi's ability to manufacture advanced processing nodes such as 5 nanometer and 3 nanometer at scale matters greatly for Nvidia. The reason this is important is because higher profit margins and increased output from TSMC suggest that Nvidia's chips are both in high demand and being converted into shipped revenue more quickly.

Broadcom benefits from TSMC's success for a different reason than its GPU counterpart. Broadcom's value in AI infrastructure comes from designing networking gear for data centers, custom silicon architectures, and connectivity chips. Many of these specialty processes are also manufactured by Taiwan Semi.

TSMC's booming business underscores the idea that AI budgets aren't entirely consumed by GPUs. Rather, the hyperscalers are deploying capital across a broad suite of critical infrastructure beyond general-purpose training hardware.

In other words, the resiliency of Taiwan Semi's business suggests that the current infrastructure supercycle differs materially from the historical cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. Developers are investing beyond raw compute and opting for a full hardware stack to build out their AI systems.

Should you buy Taiwan Semi stock right now?

Taiwan Semi currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24. While the company has experienced meaningful valuation expansion over the last year, TSMC's forward earnings multiple trades at a steep discount to prior highs.

In my eyes, the compression in the company's valuation multiple could suggest that investors have not yet priced in the entirety of Taiwan Semi's growth prospects over the next several years. In other words, despite a strong earnings report and encouraging outlook, some investors may still be suspicious that AI is a bubble and therefore are not assigning premium valuations.

To me, TSMC's latest report should mitigate the bubble fears. The company's growth is accelerating across the board, and management has been explicit about its expansion plans. I think Taiwan Semi is positioned for significant revenue and profit growth through the rest of the decade, making now an interesting time to buy the stock at a reasonable price point.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851887%2Ftaiwan-semiconductor-tsmc-building-with-tsmc-logo-in-front_tsmc-9.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-23 07:58:27.878399

The company said the partnerships will allow it to further hone Foundry, which it said allows companies to “collaborate directly with Adobe engineers and scientists to create brand-specific generative AI models, responsibly trained on their own IP and designed for safe commercial use.”

The announcement, made the day that the Sundance Film Festival debuted in Utah, holds promise in particular for many smaller and independent creative shops (such as those dozens of indie projects on display during Sundance) in both entertainment and marketing for enterprises.

The announcement includes partnerships with Hollywood’s Big Three talent agencies (UTA, WME and CAA); hybrid and AI film-production companies Wonder Studio, Promise.ai, Infinite Studio and B5 Studios; Parsons School of Design and two other art colleges; design studio Cantina Creative; and prominent directors David Ayer and Jaume Collet-Serra.

“Our mission is to protect the soul of the work as tools evolve,” said Justin Hackney, Wonder Studios CCO and co-founder, in an Adobe blog post. “Partnering with Adobe removes the friction between imagination and execution, allowing creators to enter true flow states.

Anna’s Archive calls itself a non-profit that aims to preserve all human knowledge and make it accessible to anyone in the world, doing so by illegally scraping vast troves of data. It makes pirated content like e-books and scientific articles available in the form of download links via partner servers at varying speeds.

Anna’s Archive stated in a Reddit post that it provided its data to anyone who wanted it, and that anyone could torrent its data or pay for higher speed access. The platform also said that while it did not have direct dealings with Nvidia (as was alleged in the lawsuit), it had no objections in coming to an agreement with the company.

Following up on a lawsuit filed in 2024, authors Abdi Nazemian, Brian Keene, Stewart O’Nan, Andre Dubus III, and Susan Orlean alleged that Nvidia copied their works multiple times to train its language models and reached out to Anna’s Archive for data.

“NVIDIA “got the green light” to use Anna’s Archive. NVIDIA did not hesitate in using pirated books from these illicit sources of copyrighted material, regardless of the “risk” or the harm to authors like the Plaintiffs,” the authors claimed in a legal filing dated January 16.

But the price surge is rippling through consumer markets.
Counterpoint estimates that memory prices will jump 40 percent to 50 percent in the first quarter, after last year’s 50 percent surge.
Some analysts said Apple, with its scale, pricing power and deep supplier network, is better positioned to weather the memory chip price surge than its smaller rivals.
“But it isn’t immune, and may need to raise prices to pass on higher input costs.”","Global demand for smartphones, personal computers and gaming consoles is expected to shrink this year as companies from Britain’s Raspberry Pi to HP Inc raise sticker prices to offset surging memory chip costs.

The rapid build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure by US tech firms such as OpenAI, Alphabet-owned Google and Microsoft has absorbed much of the world’s memory chip supply, pushing up prices as manufacturers prioritize components for higher-margin data centers over consumer devices.

Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, the world’s three largest producers of memory chips, have said in recent months that they were struggling to keep up with demand as they reported rosy quarterly earnings on the back of surging prices for their semiconductors.

But the price surge is rippling through consumer markets.

Research firms IDC and Counterpoint both now expect global smartphone sales to shrink at least 2 percent this year, in a sharp reversal from their growth outlook a few months ago. That would mark the first annual decline in shipments since 2023.

The PC market is expected to shrink at least 4.9 percent in 2026, IDC estimated, after an 8.1 percent growth last year. Meanwhile, console sales are expected to fall 4.4 percent in the current year after an estimated growth of 5.8 percent in 2025, according to TrendForce.

While several firms have already raised prices, industry heavyweights Apple and Dell face a tough choice: take on the costs and sacrifice margins or pass them onto consumers at the risk of stifling demand.

“Manufacturers might absorb some costs but given the scale of the shortage, it is certainly going to show up as higher prices for consumers,” Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said.

“It is going to result in more tepid consumer device sales in 2026. It will be a challenge for these companies that are trying to sell products during a time of broader inflation.”

Pressure is being compounded by expectations that the price increases will persist, possibly into next year. Counterpoint estimates that memory prices will jump 40 percent to 50 percent in the first quarter, after last year’s 50 percent surge.

“Over the last two quarters, we’ve seen 1,000 percent price inflation in some products and pricing is continuing to rise,” said Tobey Gonnerman, president of semiconductor distributor Fusion Worldwide.

“Consumers can expect to pay significantly higher prices for laptops, mobile phones, wearables and gaming devices very soon.”

Analysts believe the impact is likely to be most pronounced for manufacturers of low- and mid-range devices, such as Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi and TCL Technology and PC firm Lenovo.

TrendForce said last year that Dell and Lenovo were planning price hikes of as much as 20 percent early in 2026.

Shares of all Raspberry Pi, Xiaomi, Dell, HP Inc and Lenovo fell in the last three months of 2025, with Xiaomi posting the biggest drop with a 27.2 percent decline.

HP CEO Enrique Lores said in November the company would raise PC prices due to “significant” memory chip costs, while Raspberry Pi CEO called the cost surge “painful” in a December blog post announcing price increases for its devices.

The weaker demand outlook could also hamper sales at electronics-focused retailers such as Best Buy, which had already warned last year that tariff-driven price increases could dissuade potential buyers.

Apple will report earnings on January 29, while Dell is slated to report on February 26. Xiaomi usually reports in late March.

Some analysts said Apple, with its scale, pricing power and deep supplier network, is better positioned to weather the memory chip price surge than its smaller rivals.

The company typically holds prices of its flagship iPhone lineup in the US steady between its September launch events. Last year, it absorbed the hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff-related costs, instead of passing them on to customers.

“Apple is better-positioned, as it uses contract pricing (rather than more volatile spot pricing) for its purchases, securing better prices,” Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said.

The company appointed Barret Zoph to lead its efforts to sell its AI to enterprises, according to reporting from The Information, citing an internal OpenAI memo.

TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for confirmation and more information.

Zoph returned to OpenAI last week after leaving Thinking Machine Labs, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s AI startup where Zoph had served as a co-founder and CTO since October 2024.

The exact circumstances of his departure aren’t clear, with rumors swirling about whether Zoph and a few other former OpenAI employees were fired or left on their own accord, possibly with plans to return to OpenAI all along.

Zoph was previously the vice president of post-training inference at OpenAI from September 2022 to October 2024. He’s stepping into a very different position and will likely play an important role at the company as it looks to grow its enterprise business — an area where it is losing ground to competitors.

OpenAI launched its enterprise-focused ChatGPT Enterprise product in 2023 more than a year before Anthropic and multiple years before Google launched its enterprise offerings. The company claims the product has more than 5 million business users and counts companies including SoftBank, Target, and Lowe’s as customers.

But its market share is falling while its rivals are climbing.

Anthropic holds a dominant lead over its AI rivals when it comes to enterprise large language model usage. The AI research lab holds a 40% market share, according to a December report from VC firm Menlo Ventures (which, it should be noted, has invested aggressively in Anthropic). In July, the startup’s market share was estimated to be 32%.

Google’s Gemini adoption has been steadier, according to Menlo Ventures. The company released its enterprise product last fall and has seen its enterprise LLM usage market share largely stay the same, per Menlo’s findings, growing from 20% in July to 21% at the end of the year.

OpenAI on the other hand has seen its usage market share drop from 50% in 2023 to 27% at the end of 2025 — a trend that appears to concern the company. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed concern specifically that Google Gemini’s growth was starting to encroach on OpenAI in an internal memo a few months ago.

Cloud software stocks have started this year where they left off in 2025: sell-off mode.

The continued downward spiral is setting the stage for a flurry of acquisitions, investors told CNBC.

The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund , which tracks cloud software, has dropped more than 8% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is slightly up. Leading software names like Salesforce , ServiceNow and Adobe are down more than 14% after badly underperforming the market a year ago.

The overriding concern is that artificial intelligence will eventually displace key pieces of the enterprise stack, as IT buyers turn to AI agents to handle tasks currently handled by software vendors, both large and small. Those fears were amplified last week when Anthropic's Claude launched an AI agent tool named Cowork that is aimed at the enterprise customer.

A senior investor at a large private equity fund who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly on the subject said the disruption in software is happening today and will force several midsized software companies to seek financing options, potentially spurring acquisitions by private equity.

Orlando Bravo, co-founder of software-focused buyout firm Thoma Bravo, is looking to buy the dip, and sees value in companies that are building their own agentic solutions to work with their existing systems.

""We're seeing just incredible buying opportunities right now,"" Bravo told CNBC's Sara Eisen in Davos on Wednesday. He said his firm is doing deals and ""will be a lot more active.""

While investors like Bravo remain bullish on software in an AI-dominated world, analyst Jackson Ader at KeyBanc sees real vulnerabilities. He conducted an analysis of the major threats facing software in August, and said then that seat-based application companies like Monday.com , Asana and Sprout Social are the most exposed. All three stocks have seen double-digit drops in 2026.

In that same note to clients, Bader said those companies aren't tied to an anchor system of record like enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and customer relationship management, or CRM, and have yet to become multiproduct platforms. Representatives from Monday, Asana and Sprout didn't respond to requests for comment.

Even companies with a wider breadth of products and more established enterprise footprint are facing significant market skepticism.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has spent months defending his company and trying to reassure investors that it is well-positioned in AI.

In Davos, Benioff told Eisen that the company's latest quarter was ""the best quarter we've ever had in our careers"" and that ""we're one of the largest cash-producing companies in the world.""

""But it's not enough,"" Benioff said, referring to the market action. ""Because if you don't produce a large language model, you're evidently not in fashion right now.""

ServiceNow is responding to the pressure by joining the potential competition. On Wednesday, the company announced a deal with OpenAI to use its models to offer AI agents to business customers.

The news didn't ease concerns. ServiceNow shares dropped for six consecutive trading days before rising on Thursday, and are down 17% in January.

HubSpot , Atlassian and Braze are having an even worse start to the year, with shares of each down more than 20%.

Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC that the recent pullback in software stocks could force certain companies to ""explore strategic alternatives"" and that any new deals that don't have a compelling AI angle won't gain much traction with investors.

In a note published in late November, Jaluria highlighted Asana, Box and DocuSign as potential acquisition targets in software. The companies didn't respond to requests for comment.

With tech earnings season kicking into high gear next week, Wall Street will start to get a clearer picture of where particular companies stand in adopting AI or getting swallowed by it.

Luria said one of the crucial questions is how quickly AI agents like Claude's Cowork go beyond developing new code and actually automate different parts of the software lifecycle. That timeline will be critical in understanding the reality of the AI threat and how soon cloud software companies might feel the pain.

Strategic Pricing and Access

In coordination with federal initiatives, the healthcare firm is launching a direct-to-patient platform that aims to provide pharmaceutical products at discounted rates. According to the manufacturer, this move seeks to align domestic drug pricing more closely with costs found in other developed international markets.

The agreement also provides the company with specific exemptions from certain tariffs.

Future Infrastructure Goals

The organization aims to produce the majority of its complex therapies within the U.S. to ensure more reliable patient access, according to the company announcement. By investing heavily in advanced manufacturing technologies, the firm is transitioning away from older production models to more efficient, automated systems.

J&J added that more announcements regarding domestic production are expected before the end of the year.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

On January 16, Oppenheimer lowered its price target on Boston Scientific to $100 from $125 with an Outperform rating. Oppenheimer is cautious on the financial optics of Boston Scientific’s $14.5 billion acquisition of Penumbra. Although the deal creates a powerhouse in the thrombectomy and neurovascular markets, analysts are questioning the valuation. At $374 per share, the high purchase multiple may hinder the company’s ability to generate a strong ROIC, leading the firm to question whether the timing was ideal for such a large-scale transaction.

Penumbra’s acquisition represents Boston Scientific’s second-largest takeover in its history and marks its re-entry into the neurovascular market.

The move is designed to broaden Boston Scientific’s cardiovascular and neurovascular portfolios. Having divested its neurovascular business to Stryker over a decade ago, Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney emphasized that the company sought a scaled platform and a strong pipeline to return to this attractive segment. Penumbra is expected to contribute ~$1.4 billion in sales for 2025, and the integration is projected to enhance Boston Scientific’s revenue and margins over the long term.

Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices for use in various interventional medical specialties. It has two segments: MedSurg and Cardiovascular.

While we acknowledge the potential of BSX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

According to the reports, the company’s CEO, Sam Altman, has been meeting with top sovereign wealth funds and other large investors, especially in the United Arab Emirates and Abu Dhabi, to discuss the potential deal.

Valuation could be up to $830B

The talks are still in the early stages, and the amount could change, the report adds. People familiar with the discussions say OpenAI is targeting a valuation between $750 billion and $830 billion, though no final agreements have been announced.

OpenAI is known for its artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT and has spent heavily on developing large models, data centers, and computing infrastructure.

Raising new capital would help fund future technology work, including building more computing capacity and hiring engineers.

In addition to the Middle East meetings, Altman has also held separate talks with companies like Amazon about potential investments of at least $10 billion, according to earlier reports.

OpenAI has worked with Middle Eastern partners before. The company has been linked with groups such as G42, a technology investor based in the UAE, and MGX Fund Management, an Abu Dhabi-backed AI investment firm.

The completed transactions mark a major funding milestone for the structural heart company as it advances its global pivotal clinical program and scales manufacturing in preparation for potential commercialisation.

Capital raising structure and pricing

The underwritten public offering was initially announced earlier this week at US$200 million but was increased to US$230 million following the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares.

Anteris ultimately issued 40 million common shares at US$5.75 per share in the public offering, including the additional shares issued under the option.

In parallel, the company completed a private placement of 15.65 million shares to Medtronic at the same US$5.75 per share, bringing total gross proceeds from the two transactions to about US$320 million before fees and expenses.

The offering was led by Barclays, Wells Fargo Securities and Cantor as joint book-running managers, with Barrenjoey Markets acting as financial adviser to Asia-Pacific investors. Wells Fargo Securities also acted as sole placement agent for the Medtronic investment.

Funding global PARADIGM trial and manufacturing expansion

Anteris said the net proceeds from the offering and private placement, together with existing cash reserves, will support the next phase of growth and execution of its clinical strategy.

A key focus will be the ongoing recruitment and execution of the global pivotal PARADIGM trial, which is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the DurAVR® Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The company also plans to use funds to expand manufacturing capabilities and support continued research and development activities, with remaining capital allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes.

The PARADIGM trial is a large, randomised controlled study designed to enrol around 1,000 patients globally and compare DurAVR® head-to-head against commercially available transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) systems. The trial assesses a composite endpoint including all-cause mortality, stroke and cardiovascular hospitalisation at one year.

Recruitment is already under way, with the first patients enrolled and implanted in Denmark during the December quarter of 2025.

Strategic backing from Medtronic

Management said the US$90 million investment from Medtronic provides both financial support and crucial strategic validation of Anteris’ valve technology as it moves towards regulatory approval and commercialisation.

“This strategic investment, along with our underwritten offering of common stock, represent an important milestone for our company,” said Anteris chief executive officer Wayne Paterson.

“It also provides strong validation of our program from the capital markets and a major strategic innovator,” he added. “The investment is one aspect of a collaboration that may expand into other strategic areas in the future.”

Medtronic said its investment reflects confidence in differentiated innovation within the TAVR market, particularly in technologies that aim to improve haemodynamics and valve performance within a balloon-expandable platform.

Strengthened balance sheet supports next phase

With the capital raise now completed, Anteris said it is well positioned to maintain momentum across clinical execution, manufacturing scale-up and longer-term commercial planning.

The strengthened balance sheet is expected to support expansion of the PARADIGM trial across additional geographies and advance Anteris’ goal of delivering next-generation transcatheter heart valve solutions to a growing global patient population.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI2XzAxXC9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMDEtMjMtYXQtMS0xMC0wNy1QTS5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,,2026-01-22 20:39:23.347863

That is why Binance is now pursuing a European license and turning to Greek authorities. The company has established both a holding company there and submitted a formal application for a MiCA license. This step comes against the backdrop of intensified scrutiny by French regulators and an escalating conflict over enforcement of the Markets-in-Crypto-Assets Regulation, which has been fully applicable since December 2024. By July 1, 2026, all crypto platforms operating in the EU must provide appropriate authorization, otherwise they face exclusion from the European market.

The French banking regulator ACPR identified significant deficiencies in Binance’s risk control systems during inspections, while intensive anti-money laundering reviews are running in parallel at dozens of crypto exchanges. Of over 100 platforms registered in France, only four have received full authorization so far—a success rate of four percent. In contrast, competitors such as Kraken, Binance, KuCoin, Bybit, Coinbase, and OKX have already obtained MiCA-compliant licenses and now operate in all countries of the European Economic Area or will soon launch. Overall, more than 50 crypto companies now hold MiCA approval—Binance cannot be missing.

Stablecoins: Clear Winners and Losers

In the stablecoin sector, a clear market consolidation is emerging. While Tether, despite its market dominance, has not yet received a MiCA license and has already been removed from several EU exchanges, Circle with EURC and USDC, Société Générale-Forge with EURCV and USDCV, and Membrane Finance with EURe and eUSD have successfully cleared the regulatory hurdle. Notably, most approved stablecoins are denominated in euros, suggesting a strategic realignment of the European crypto market.

The consequences for non-compliant companies are drastic. Regulators have already imposed fines exceeding 540 million euros against crypto firms that violated regulatory requirements. After the deadline in July 2026, all tolerance ends, and companies without appropriate authorization irrevocably lose their operating license in the European Union. For Binance and other pending applicants, the clock is ticking, while already-licensed competitors continuously expand their market position.

Binance Entered 2026 Optimistically

Binance co-CEOs Yi He and Richard Teng, whose team serves approximately 300 million customers, showed greater optimism than ever in their 2026 outlook. They identified five converging forces that will drive the market from “uncertain expansion” to “secure expansion”: robust global economic growth despite trade conflicts, an impending technological revolution (AI, quantum computing, fusion), increased government liquidity provision to households and businesses, the resumption of balance sheet expansion by the Federal Reserve with further interest rate cuts, and expected regulatory clarity through the “RFIA/CLARITY Act,” which is intended to define rules for on-chain assets. This combination of macroeconomic tailwinds, monetary easing, fiscal support, and regulatory clarity makes the long-term development of on-chain assets and applications far more predictable.

The CEOs particularly emphasized that coming growth will no longer be based solely on sentiment and hype, but driven by two fundamental factors: state capital at the sovereign level and enterprise-grade applications. When nations discuss Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and on-chain assets grow from billions to trillions, it is no longer just a “bull market,” but a fundamental redesign of financial infrastructure. In this environment, Binance intends to continue functioning as a “road builder” and is increasing investment in security, compliance, and education to provide all users with safe access to the crypto world.",https://www.trendingtopics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Binance_Leadership.png,N,,2026-01-22 22:40:00.450460

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things.","NEW YORK — Skydance-owned Paramount is again extending the tender offer window in its $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner's merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that's still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,"" Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it's “clear our shareholders agree,"" as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner's studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner's board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix's proposed acquisition includes only Warner's studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount's bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner's current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix both fell slightly Thursday. Shares of Paramount-Skydance rose nearly 3%.

Albertsons Companies ( (ACI) ) has issued an update.

On January 22, 2026, Albertsons Companies and several subsidiaries launched a refinancing push in the bond market, announcing plans to redeem in cash the full $1.35 billion of 4.625% senior notes due 2027 and the $750 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2028, with the redemption expected to occur on February 21, 2026. To fund this move, the company priced an upsized private offering to institutional and offshore investors of $1.2 billion of new senior notes due 2032 at 5.625% and $900 million of additional 5.750% senior notes due 2034, issued at 98.5% of face value and fungible with its existing 2034 notes, with closing expected around February 2, 2026. The transaction extends Albertsons’ debt maturities and consolidates its capital structure by shifting obligations from 2027–2028 to 2032–2034, a step that could ease near-term refinancing risk and provide greater financial flexibility for operations and stakeholders, albeit at somewhat higher long-term coupon costs.

Spark’s Take on ACI Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, ACI is a Neutral.

The score is held back primarily by high leverage and weakening margins, plus bearish technicals with the stock trending below key moving averages. These are partially offset by supportive valuation (low P/E and ~3.7% yield) and a constructive earnings-call backdrop with narrowed guidance, strong digital/pharmacy execution, and continued capital return plans, albeit with notable near-term headwinds.

The stock has retreated from its recent peak, with the market's attention firmly fixed on the upcoming release of the company's Q4 2025 financial results. The central question is whether IBM can deliver on the high expectations surrounding its software division and its current artificial intelligence strategy.

High Stakes for Software and AI

The upcoming report on January 28 is viewed as a critical test for the bullish narrative supported by several analysts. Consensus estimates set a high bar:

- Earnings Per Share (EPS): Approximately $4.33, compared to $3.92 in the prior-year period.

- Total Revenue: Around $19.22 billion, up from $17.55 billion in last year's fourth quarter.

- Software Revenue: Expectations are set near $8.9 billion.

Market observers will scrutinize the software segment with particular intensity. Growth of roughly 7% year-over-year is seen as a minimum threshold to justify recent analyst optimism. A miss on this key metric could widen the apparent gap between positive analyst commentary and the stock's recent cautious price action. Furthermore, IBM's guidance for 2026, especially concerning free cash flow and margin development, will significantly influence the stock's subsequent trajectory.

Analyst Conviction Meets Market Hesitation

At the beginning of the year, several investment banks raised their targets for IBM. Jefferies upgraded the stock to ""Buy"" on January 5, establishing a price target of $360. Bank of America followed with a $335 target, while Evercore ISI set its objective at $330. The common theme is a belief in the company's intact medium-term story, even as short-term market sentiment grows more tentative.

Firms like Stifel have reaffirmed buy recommendations, projecting organic software growth of 7–8%, consistent with the division's trajectory throughout 2025. This dynamic is expected to underpin further margin expansion and growing cash flows. Despite these upward revisions, the equity has recently softened. Priced at €259.25 in European trading, the shares sit approximately 17% below their 52-week high, though they remain well above the prior year's low. The recent pullback is largely attributed to profit-taking and heightened investor restraint ahead of the earnings release.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Strategic Moves in Quantum Security and AI

Beyond the financials, IBM continues to advance its technological positioning. On January 22, the corporation announced a strategic partnership with Keyfactor, a provider of digital trust solutions. The collaboration aims to prepare enterprise clients for the coming era of ""post-quantum cryptography.""

The initiative involves integrating Keyfactor's automation platform with the cybersecurity expertise of IBM Consulting. This move is predicated on the expectation that future quantum computers could compromise current encryption standards. By addressing this threat early, IBM seeks to establish itself as a provider of high-margin consulting and security solutions with potential for long-term demand.

The company is also maintaining its activity in the AI arena. New collaborations with S&P Global and chip specialist Groq are designed to embed the watsonx platform more deeply into corporate workflows and accelerate the practical deployment of agentic AI applications. This strategy allows IBM to target the trend toward specialized, productivity-enhancing AI systems, moving beyond broad platform promises.

The Path Forward Post-Earnings

A convincing performance from IBM, demonstrating robust software growth and providing a confident outlook, could reframe the recent share price decline as a healthy consolidation before a potential next leg up. The January 28 report serves as the definitive event that will either validate the current analyst confidence or challenge the foundations of the optimistic investment thesis.

The Globe Pulsed Field System, which gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in September 2025, is capable of both high-density mapping and PFA. It features a 122-electrode spherical array designed to deliver single-shot pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).

Reviewing 1-year data from PULSAR

The FDA’s decision to approve this technology was largely based on results from the Kardium-funded PULSAR clinical trial. One-year data from PULSAR is now available in full.

The study’s authors tracked 183 patients with a mean age of 65 years old. The primary effectiveness endpoint—freedom from atrial arrhythmias or other failure modes for one year—was seen in 77.8% of patients. The primary safety event rate, meanwhile, was 0.6% due to a single stroke in a patient with severe hypertension and polycystic kidney disease. There were no device-related primary safety events.

Another key takeaway from PULSAR was the fact that PVI durability rates were quite high. PVI durability is sometimes a significant issue with PFA, but these one-year results suggest cardiologists using the Globe Pulsed Field System may have better luck with avoiding the need for redo procedures. The authors did warn that more research is still needed to determine if this durability will remain outside of a pivotal study made up of high-volume operators.

“The Globe Pulsed Field System has the potential to transform how we treat AFib by delivering durable pulmonary vein isolation with remarkable efficiency and safety,” said Vivek Reddy, MD, PULSAR principal investigator and a prominent electrophysiologist from Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, said in a statement. “These results show that this technology can make a real difference for patients, offering them better outcomes and a safer path to long‑term relief from arrhythmias.”

“The publication of the PULSAR pivotal trial results in JACC is a tremendous validation of the safety, efficacy and efficiency of the Globe System” added Kevin Chaplin, CEO of Kardium. “At Kardium, we are committed to delivering the most advanced system for the treatment of AFib.”

An outside perspective on Kardium’s PFA technology

Two electrophysiologists out of Germany—Boris Schmidt, MD, and K.R. Julian Chun, MD, both of Cardioangiologisches Centrum Bethanien in Frankfurt—wrote an editorial that accompanied the one-year PULSAR data.[2] Schmidt and Chun did not participate in the trial and have no connection to Kardium, providing readers with an outside perspective of this new technology.

Overall, Schmidt and Chun celebrated the “remarkable” one-year outcomes of this study. They pointed to the “favorable safety profile” and the “impeccable” PVI durability rates.

The two co-authors did note that the Globe Pulsed Field System almost appears to be “overengineered” at first due to its advanced features. However, they highlighted the technology’s potential to provide additional value not seen with other PFA systems.

“The most innovative potential of the global array lies in the capability to simultaneously record intracardiac electrograms from 122 distinct electrodes,” they wrote. “This will allow us to improve our understanding of electrical phenomena present during atrial fibrillation and may help to identify drivers, rotors, and other arrhythmogenic sources. Thus, it may be a unique mapping and ablation solution for patients with persistent AFib or with AFib independently from the pulmonary veins.”

The co-authors concluded by looking ahead, saying only time will tell whether this is “just another single-shot ablation tool, or if these sophisticated features will add substantial benefit.”

Spark’s Take on BK Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, BK is a Outperform.

The score is driven primarily by strong financial performance (profitability, improved leverage, and solid cash conversion despite weaker FCF growth) and supportive technical momentum (price above major moving averages with positive MACD). Earnings-call guidance and raised medium-term targets further reinforce the outlook, while valuation appears reasonable with a moderate dividend yield.

""As is our common refrain, Chinese banks are adequately capitalised, and losses on property loans are manageable,"" said Ming Tan, credit analyst, S&P Global Ratings.

""Moreover, data from the structured finance market indicates that Chinese mortgages are performing normally, with no big spike in bad loans,” Tan added.

Investors are currently focused on the weak liquidity of China Vanke Co. Ltd. , and potential contagion should more defaults occur, the report said.

Investors also want to know if direct sales of foreclosed properties at steep discounts will result in collateral impairments at banks.

But banks' property-sector strains are easing in S&P’s base case, albeit from a high level, S&P said.

Meanwhile, China's domestic demand is likely to remain subdued and exports should slow in China.

Despite this, China’s real GDP is still headed for growth in 2026, with S&P estimating a 4% rise during the year.

“Meanwhile, given fewer interest rate cuts in 2025 than we expected, we project the banking sector's net interest margin will stabilize at 1.29% in 2027. This would be slightly higher than our previous forecast of 1.27%,” Tan wrote in the report.

Vera Rubin is already being pitched as a full-stack AI infrastructure play, with revamped GPUs, CPUs and networking chips aimed at agentic and inference workloads. Recent reports claim Nvidia has reshuffled key elements, framed as a response to AMD’s push with Instinct MI455X.

SemiAnalysis claims the Vera Rubin NVL72 spec will have 22.2 TB/s of memory bandwidth. That is a hefty leap from the numbers Nvidia showed off at GTC 2025, and it looks like a deliberate move to keep its lead in hyperscaler adoption.

The jump from roughly 13 TB/s to 22.2 TB/s does not come from fairy dust. The claim is that Nvidia is pushing HBM4 beyond standard JEDEC ratings, asking suppliers to raise pin speeds up to 11 Gbps.

Nvidia is working with a narrower eight-stack interface, so squeezing more out of pin speeds is the obvious lever to pull. AMD previously looked comfortable, leaning on 12-Hi HBM4 stacks to claim a 19.6 TB/s figure.

AMD has been talking up the Instinct MI400 family for a while, and it clearly fancies a more serious run at hyperscaler sockets this round. This all seems Nvidia’s attempt to counter this.

USA Today Network

Microsoft Corp. is planning 15 more data centers and adding 8.7 million square feet to its operation in Racine County.

The Mount Pleasant Village Plan Commission unanimously approved the site plans for Microsoft‘s latest development on Jan. 21. The approval goes to the full village board.

Microsoft has had a presence in the area since it announced it was building its first data center in 2024.

This latest proposal, if approved by officials from the Village of Mount Pleasant, marks the biggest expansion the company has made since it came to Wisconsin.

Here’s what to know about Microsoft’s latest plans for Mount Pleasant.

What is the scope of the Racine County Microsoft projects?

Microsoft’s biggest presence is in Mount Pleasant in Racine County. So far, the company has committed more than $7.3 billion in the first phase of its data center campus to support its efforts on artificial intelligence, and it’s likely to grow as the demand for data centers increases.

What’s the location of the planned Microsoft projects in Racine County?

There are two proposals being evaluated by Mount Pleasant officials. One is located on Durand Avenue and the other is on International Drive.

On Durand Avenue, the proposal is planning for up to nine data centers with additional office space, each up to 579,796 square feet. The proposal also includes a 96,000-square-foot office and storage building, and other accessory buildings.

On International Drive, the proposal is planning for six data centers and additional office space, each up to 568,103 square feet. The proposal includes a 74,000-square-foot office and storage building, and other accessory buildings.

Is there a timeline for all of this construction?

Short answer: No.

Longer answer: Microsoft has issued a statement saying “Microsoft has proposed an expansion in Mount Pleasant, with plans submitted for two additional datacenter campuses on land we purchased in 2024. These preliminary plans are the next step in our years-long development process and we look forward to sharing more about our specific plans as we go forward as we’ve done for our first two sites in May 2024 and September of 2025 respectively.”

How many buildings has Microsoft constructed in Racine County?

The company is finishing up its first data center, which consists of multiple buildings. And Microsoft is planning on breaking ground on a second data center later this year.

What guidelines must Microsoft follow while building in Mount Pleasant?

Village staff has set conditions to the proposals which include meeting architectural, lighting, parking and other modifications.

Also, Microsoft must “comply with all Racine Water Utility, Mount Pleasant Sanitary Sewer Utility, and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources rules and permissions regarding consuming and returning water to the applicable utility systems and watersheds,” the staff report says.

How many buildings does Microsoft plan to construct in Racine County?

If what Microsoft is planning comes to fruition, then nearly 20 buildings are planned for the next several years. However businesses change course regularly, even on the plot of land Microsoft is building on. It was originally intended for a giant campus for Foxconn but the original plans fell apart, giving Microsoft an opportunity to build its data centers.

And in 2025 Microsoft paused construction on its first data center for a brief period of time as the company because it was “assessing demand overall for AI and the other was assessing what kind of data center would make the most sense to build here for the second phase,” according to Brad Smith, Microsoft president.

How does the Microsoft data center square footage compare with a Walmart Supercenter?

Walmart Supercenters can range from 99,000 to 260,000 square feet. A Walmart Supercenter is about 200,000 square feet.

Each data center and office space Microsoft is proposing is more than 560,000 square feet, which is nearly three times the size of a Supercenter. With 15 proposed data centers being evaluated for Mount Pleasant, that’s easily more than two Walmart Supercenters per data center.

Medtronic, a global leader in healthcare technology, announced verification study results for its investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry with Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor at the Society for Technology in Anesthesia (STA) Annual Meeting.

The company successfully completed pivotal clinical studies for its new Nellcor™ pulse oximetry technology. Initial data show that the investigational Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor technology, when paired with a set of market-released sensors representative of the Nellcor™ pulse oximetry sensor line, demonstrated SpO₂ accuracy better than the FDA's draft-recommended1 threshold. Additionally, pulse rate accuracy was within Nellcor™ technology acceptance limits. These results were observed in a sample inclusive of the full range of skin tones.

Pulse oximetry accuracy has historically varied across skin tones, raising concerns about technology that works for all patients. The investigational Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor technology reflects ongoing efforts of Medtronic to deliver its Nellcor™ technology's consistent SpO₂ and pulse rate accuracy across all skin tones. The company's commitment to getting it right - for every patient - is why Medtronic opened a clinical physiology lab near the Five Points neighborhood of Denver, Colorado. As a result of their extensive community outreach efforts, Medtronic has conducted its clinical studies not only with a diverse array of participants but with greater speed and frequency, leading to faster innovation.

Previously granted FDA Safer Technologies Program (STeP) designation, the company's investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry with Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor is currently under 510(k) review, marking an important regulatory milestone in efforts by Medtronic to bring this innovation to market.†

""Today's verification study results demonstrate accuracy across various skin tones, meeting and exceeding both the current U.S. FDA guidance and newer, more-inclusive draft guidance,"" said Dr. Randall Clark, principal investigator of the Medtronic clinical physiology lab. ""Seeing such positive outcomes with the investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry technology, paired with Nellcor™ sensors, marks an important step toward advancing medical-grade pulse oximetry that works for every patient.""

The verification studies were conducted in consideration of the evolving regulatory guidance1 and global standards expectations on pulse oximeters for medical purposes, which recommends accuracy testing across the full spectrum of skin tones and maintaining the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for SpO₂ accuracy within 3%, regardless of sensor type.

Key findings:

Study design: Three controlled hypoxia studies with 71 participants (ages 20-46) representing diverse skin tones across Monk Skin Tone (MST) cohorts:

• Light (MST 1-4): 32 participants (45.1%)

• Medium (MST 5-7): 19 participants (26.8%)

• Dark (MST 8-10): 20 participants (28.2%)

SpO₂ accuracy: Investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry with Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor paired with Nellcor™ sensors demonstrated SpO₂ RMS accuracy ranging from 1.33% (upper 95% CI: 1.48%) to 1.69% (upper 95% CI: 1.93%), outperforming the FDA draft guidance threshold of 3%.

Pulse rate accuracy: RMS accuracy remained within 2 bpm, meeting the Nellcor™ technology acceptance criterion of 3 bpm.

""Medtronic is leading the way for pulse oximetry technology that aims to deliver accuracy and inclusivity for every patient, every time,"" said Dr. Jeb Denny, chief medical officer of the Medtronic Acute Care & Monitoring business, which is part of the company's Medical Surgical Portfolio. ""Our leadership in this space reflects a commitment to advancing standards that represent all patients and empowering clinicians with world-class technology to deliver safe, equitable care for every patient, in every setting.""

The findings were presented by Medtronic at STA 2026, with Dr. David MacLeod, anesthesiologist at Duke University Hospital in North Carolina, as the healthcare professional author on the abstract.

† STeP designation applies to future product candidates. Nellcor™ technology in the scope of the STeP application is 510(k) pending. It is not approved or cleared by the FDA and not available for sale in the U.S. Inclusion in STeP does not guarantee approval, clearance, or granting of future marketing submissions.

Acute Care and Monitoring products should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosis or therapy and are intended only as an adjunct in patient assessment. Note: Oxygen saturation accuracy can be affected by certain environmental, equipment, and patient physiologic conditions that influence readings of SpO2.

ID9,Boston Scientific,2026-01-22 19:38:20+00:00,Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry,Moving the Needle in the Home Healthcare Manufacturing Space,Susan Shepard,,,,,https://www.mddionline.com/drug-delivery/moving-the-needle-in-the-home-healthcare-manufacturing-space,"He also serves as a Medtech consultant for Forj Medical, a contract development and manufacturing organization focused on advancing next-generation manufacturing solutions for minimally invasive and devices.
At MD&M West, he will present “The Needle Boom: Scaling Overmolded Needle Manufacturing for the At Home Care Revolution,” where he will share how manufacturers should think about scaling precision devices for a rapidly changing home healthcare landscape.
As medical devices increasingly enter the home as part of daily life, the shift is profound.
Can you briefly explain what overmolded needles are and why they are so important in the home-care sector?
Springer: Overmolded needles are more reliable and more precise than glued needles, especially when devices are used unsupervised at home.","“When you start democratizing or decentralizing technology, you have to be very thoughtful about who you partner with,” said Michael Springer, in a recent interview with MD+DI. Speaking about overmolded needles and the accelerating demand driven by GLP‑1 therapies, CGMs, and even neural devices, he offered a clear caution: “Most importantly, don’t try to do it yourself.”

Springer, a Medtech innovation and commercialization leader, works closely with startups, clinicians, and OEMs to accelerate the path to market for breakthrough technologies. He also serves as a Medtech consultant for Forj Medical, a contract development and manufacturing organization focused on advancing next-generation manufacturing solutions for minimally invasive and devices.

At MD&M West, he will present “The Needle Boom: Scaling Overmolded Needle Manufacturing for the At Home Care Revolution,” where he will share how manufacturers should think about scaling precision devices for a rapidly changing home healthcare landscape.

He believes companies can learn from startups, particularly in how they approach manufacturing differently. “You have to ask whether you’re simply good at making needles, or whether you truly understand how needles behave as systems evolve,” Springer explained. “That’s the difference between a manufacturing company and a process engineering company.”

Springer noted that this distinction is central to the work he supports at Forj Medical, where integrated design-through-manufacturing teams help customers anticipate scale from the earliest stages.

Below, Springer shares his perspective not only on overmolded needles but also on the broader shift toward scaling medical devices for home use and what it takes to do it well.

Let me start off by asking why is this topic important for medical device manufacturers?

Springer: With the rise of GLP1s, single-use consumables, and vaccination-driven injections, needles are back in focus. But this conversation goes well beyond needles. When devices move from hospital to home to consumer scale, many of the same patterns appear.

Across wearables, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), drug delivery, and implantables, signal paths and fluid paths get smaller, while tolerance for failure goes to zero. Needles are a great example of a broader trend. Manufacturing is no longer downstream—it’s part of the invention itself.

If you look at who is entering this space today, ranging from large pharma to glucose monitoring companies, it’s becoming clear that success requires far more than understanding the needle alone. Needles appear simple, but they are complex to manufacture at scale.

Take a startup like Biolinq, a company working with micron-scale sensing elements that function similarly to needles. It raises a fundamental question: what actually defines a needle? That challenge forces the industry to rethink assumptions.

Many established companies are comfortable saying, “This is how we’ve always done it.” The real question is whether that approach keeps you ahead of the curve, or already behind it.

As medical devices increasingly enter the home as part of daily life, the shift is profound. It’s comparable to moving from desktop software to mobile apps. Everything becomes decentralized.

When choosing partners, it’s not enough to ask whether they can make a needle. You also must ask whether they understand home-use environments. There are hidden physics and scaling challenges that startups are often solving first.

That’s one of the reasons I work with Forj Medical. Their global footprint and integrated engineering-to-manufacturing ecosystem is built to support devices as they move from early development into high-volume use markets.

My view is that if you’re not working with new companies pushing these boundaries, your design and manufacturing perspective becomes limited. There are many excellent engineers and manufacturers, but the pace of change demands constant challenge and strategic alignment.

Can you briefly explain what overmolded needles are and why they are so important in the home-care sector?

Springer: Overmolded needles are more reliable and more precise than glued needles, especially when devices are used unsupervised at home. Home-use devices live in the real world. A hospital is not the real world.

When you remove trained operators and controlled environments, expectations rise dramatically. If something doesn’t work at home, users lose trust quickly. They stop wearing the device or stop taking the medication.

That’s why human-centered design becomes critical. Overmolded needles support reliability, longevity, and trust. As devices continue to shrink, overmolding presents new technical challenges, but it remains essential for reliability at scale. Companies like Forj Medical, which specialize in microscale molding, electromagnetic sensing, and full system technologies, are increasingly being asked to solve these challenges earlier in the development cycle.

Who should come to your session?

Springer: Ideally, attendees leave with something that resonates and something that challenges how they think. The irony is that final decision makers often don’t attend sessions like this.

If an engineer and a manager attend together, they can continue the conversation back at their company. They can ask, “Is this real? Are we seeing this already?”

The session is for people who are allowed to take calculated risks through strategic decisions. It’s about understanding your risk profile, how you partner, and how you outsource as technology evolves. Forj Medical has been navigating these exact questions as they prepare customers for scale.

What are the main messages you would like your attendees to take away from your session?

Springer: First, it’s never too early to get help. This session is for teams who don't just want to launch a device, but they also want to survive scale.

Many of the best projects fail early, pivot, and eventually find their path. That process often requires outside experience. Asking for help is not failure—it’s a strategic decision.

Second, scale must be designed in from the beginning. Scale is where most devices fail. Working with a CDMO like Forj Medical can help teams design with scale, manufacturability, and global production in mind from day one.

If someone leaves and decides to send one thoughtful email or start one internal conversation, that’s a win.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/bltdc6b4703ab050591/69727a45dbcab26a37fe04b7/Untitled_design_-_2026-01-22T142727.202.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-22 17:40:24.148665

Upcoming Earnings to Intensify Scrutiny The next critical test arrives on February 11, 2026, when Kraft Heinz reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results before the market opens.","In a decisive move signaling a significant loss of confidence, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has filed to divest its entire stake in Kraft Heinz. SEC documents dated January 21 reveal the investment conglomerate plans to sell 325.4 million shares, representing over one-quarter of the company's total share capital. This exit concludes an investment held for more than a decade and comes at a moment of considerable challenge for the packaged food giant.

The decision appears to be a clear verdict on the company's future direction. Since its peak in 2017, Kraft Heinz shares have plummeted approximately 70% in value. The move by CEO Greg Abel is widely seen as tidying up the portfolio of his predecessor, Warren Buffett, who had himself labeled the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz a mistake. Berkshire had already recorded a $3.76 billion impairment on the investment in the summer of 2025.

The timing delivers an immediate blow to newly appointed Kraft Heinz CEO Steve Cahillane, who assumed the role on January 1, 2026. He now faces a stark vote of no confidence from one of the company's most prominent shareholders. Market analysts are aligning with this skeptical view, as evidenced by recent rating adjustments:

BNP Paribas Exane downgraded the stock to ""Underperform,"" setting a price target of $22.

JPMorgan reduced its rating to ""Neutral"" with a $24 target, citing persistent volume pressure expected through the end of 2026.

Jefferies maintained a ""Hold"" but cut its price target to $23, criticizing the company's ""unclear separation strategy.""

Operational performance offers little solace. The company's U.S. retail sales declined by four percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

A Vote Against the Planned Split

Central to the current uncertainty is CEO Cahillane's strategy to split Kraft Heinz into two separate publicly traded entities in the second half of 2026. The plan would create ""Global Taste Elevation Co."" for faster-growing sauces and condiments, and ""North American Grocery Co."" for established staple brands in the U.S. market.

Observers interpret Berkshire's registered exit as a direct expression of doubt in this separation plan's value-creation potential. Rather than waiting to see the split implemented, Berkshire is choosing to cut its losses, even at current depressed share prices.

Upcoming Earnings to Intensify Scrutiny

The next critical test arrives on February 11, 2026, when Kraft Heinz reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results before the market opens. Analysts are forecasting earnings per share of $0.61 on revenue of $6.38 billion.

Until the disposal is complete, selling pressure is likely to persist. A key concern for the market is the method of Berkshire's exit. If the shares are sold on the open market rather than through a controlled secondary offering, the resulting liquidity overhang could stifle any potential for a near-term share price recovery.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2440222_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 18:41:31.444124

On Wednesday, PhonePe updated its IPO prospectus (PDF), detailing how many shares are up for sale. Tiger Global and Microsoft are offering up their full stakes in the company, while Walmart is choosing to retain its majority stake and selling up to 45.9 million shares (about 9% of the company).

Up to 50.66 million shares are up for sale, marking a liquidity event for existing shareholders.

PhonePe was valued at about $12 billion in a January 2023 funding round, though it is targeting a market capitalization of around $15 billion in the IPO, which could raise up to $1.5 billion, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.

The offer does not include any founder sell-downs, and the prospectus shows the share sale is being driven by existing investors rather than by PhonePe’s management.

Founded in 2015 by Sameer Nigam, Rahul Chari, and Burzin Engineer and acquired by e-commerce giant Flipkart a year later, PhonePe has emerged as one of India’s most successful fintechs. The company started with digital payments and has expanded into stockbroking and mutual fund investments, and even offers an Android app store as an alternative to the Google Play Store.

PhonePe is the largest player in India’s digital payments market, leading the UPI ecosystem in transaction volumes and staying ahead of Google Pay. In December 2025, it processed about 9.81 billion transactions worth roughly ₹13.6 trillion (about $148.6 billion), compared with Google Pay’s 7.50 billion transactions worth about ₹9.6 trillion (around $104.5 billion), according to the latest NPCI data.

The company was spun off after Flipkart decided on a partial split in December 2020. PhonePe and Flipkart completed their separation in December 2022, and Walmart remained the fintech’s dominant shareholder.

In the six months ended September 2025, PhonePe’s revenue from operations rose 22% to ₹39.19 billion (about $427.79 million) from a year earlier, while its loss widened to ₹14.44 billion (around $157.70 million) from ₹12.03 billion (about $131.34 million), per the prospectus.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1206129405.jpg?resize=1200,784",N,,2026-01-22 14:42:23.798834

Training Safety Through Data and Simulation Modern AI-driven safety systems learn from exponentially more driving scenarios than any human could experience in a lifetime.
By generating synthetic scenarios that represent these rare situations, AI systems can learn appropriate responses during development without putting people at risk.","AI-powered driver assistance technologies are becoming standard equipment, fundamentally changing how vehicle safety is assessed and validated.

The recent recognition of the Mercedes-Benz CLA as Euro NCAP’s Best Performer of 2025 underscores this shift, as the vehicle combines traditional passive safety features with NVIDIA DRIVE AV software to achieve the highest overall safety score of the year.

​​“When Euro NCAP assesses vehicle safety, it evaluates both passive and active systems — achieving a perfect score requires a state-of-the-art advanced driver assistance system,” said Ola Källenius, CEO of the Mercedes-Benz Group. “This milestone represents the culmination of five years of collaboration between Mercedes-Benz and NVIDIA to enhance real-world safety and deliver tangible value to customers.”

Euro NCAP (European New Car Assessment Programme) has for nearly 30 years served as Europe’s independent vehicle safety authority, backed by European governments, motoring organizations and consumer groups.

Euro NCAP evaluates vehicles across four categories that reflect real-world safety. For AI-powered driver assistance, the most relevant are the “Vulnerable Road User” and “Safety Assist” categories, which assess technologies designed to help prevent crashes — including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping support and speed assistance.

Only vehicles achieving five-star ratings with standard equipment qualify for “Best in Class” recognition, with winners determined by weighted scores across all categories. In 2025, Euro NCAP tested a record 49 models.

Safety Comes First: How DRIVE AV Is Built for Trust

Safety ratings like Euro NCAP are increasingly recognizing vehicles that combine strong passive protection with advanced active safety performance. As AI becomes central to driving, the benchmark for the “safest” car will increasingly be defined not only by how well a vehicle handles a crash, but how effectively it helps prevent one.

The Mercedes-Benz CLA is built with NVIDIA DRIVE AV, a dual-stack architecture that’s designed to help automakers deliver systems that aren’t only intelligent, but predictable, verifiable and resilient in the real world. The architecture pairs an AI-driven end-to-end driving system with a parallel classical safety stack to provide redundancy across AV sensing, planning and execution.

The CLA is also built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion architecture, which incorporates sensor diversity and hardware redundancy into the vehicle’s overall design.

At the heart of this approach is NVIDIA Halos — a comprehensive safety system spanning hardware, software, tools, development processes and certification support. Halos delivers a structured safety foundation for developing automated driving and other AI capabilities while staying anchored to robust guardrails, redundancy and fault tolerance.

Third-party certification and assessments are also important to build trust:

TÜV SÜD granted the ISO 21434 Cybersecurity Process certification to NVIDIA for its automotive system-on-a-chip, platform and software engineering processes. Additionally, NVIDIA DriveOS 6.0 conforms to ISO 26262 Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) D standards.

TÜV Rheinland performed an independent United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) safety assessment of NVIDIA DRIVE AV related to safety requirements for complex electronic systems, which NVIDIA successfully completed.

NVIDIA recently released its Alpamayo family of open AI models, simulation tools and datasets — which enables AVs to navigate even rare, “long-tail” events they haven’t been trained on by breaking the scenario down into smaller steps, reasoning through multiple possible actions and ultimately selecting the safest one. Using these models with the parallel classical safety stack in the NVIDIA DRIVE AV dual-stack architecture provides an additional layer of protection to keep vehicles operating within safe boundaries.

Training Safety Through Data and Simulation

Modern AI-driven safety systems learn from exponentially more driving scenarios than any human could experience in a lifetime. NVIDIA’s cloud-to-car development approach transforms real-world data into billions of simulated miles using NVIDIA DGX systems for neural network training, the NVIDIA Omniverse and Cosmos platforms for simulation, and NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for in-vehicle computing.

This methodology addresses a critical challenge in safety validation: training AI to navigate rare but high-risk edge cases that are too dangerous — or too infrequent — to test reliably in the real world. By generating synthetic scenarios that represent these rare situations, AI systems can learn appropriate responses during development without putting people at risk.

The CLA’s recognition is more than a single model earning a top rating — it reflects a broader shift in what safety means in the modern vehicle, where trusted crash protection is paired with AI-enabled driver assistance designed to help avoid accidents in the first place.",https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mb-cla-euro-ncap-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:59:18.969484

In a note ahead of IBM’s earnings report, due on January 28, the firm reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock. “We are bullish on IBM's ability to deliver upward estimate revisions and accelerating software growth in calendar year 2026,” the analysts wrote.

Jefferies pointed to Red Hat as a primary driver of the outlook, noting that bookings growth accelerated to roughly 20% and that key subscription products such as OpenShift and Ansible are showing accelerating demand. The analysts highlighted OpenShift’s annual recurring revenue of about $1.8 billion, along with about 40% bookings growth, supported by $400 million in virtualization-related bookings and an additional $700 million pipeline. They wrote that these indicators, along with broader Red Hat momentum, could help drive stronger software revenue.

The note also cited momentum in automation and data as supporting factors, noting that HCP delivered its highest bookings quarter in history in the third quarter, supported by IBM’s global distribution channels, and is expected to approach 20% growth this year.

Jefferies added that the Data and AI portfolio, initially expected to grow in the mid-to-high single digits, could benefit from the CFLT transaction through acquired revenue and a higher growth profile.

A rebound in mainframe software spending could further support software revenue, the firm added. The analysts noted that transaction processing software underperformed for much of 2025 as mainframe clients prioritized hardware spend early in the cycle.

Given the strength in shipped MIPS, which they wrote were more than 100 percent higher versus the z16 cycle, Jefferies believes that transaction processing revenue should benefit as shipped MIPS turn into installed MIPS.

On IBM’s Q4 results, Jefferies noted that sentiment has improved as IBM’s software growth rose from mid-single digits to high-single digits, but execution has been inconsistent and the company has slightly missed Street estimates in each of the last four quarters.

They noted that Street estimates are modeling 10.2% year-over-year software growth in the fourth quarter, alongside 10% infrastructure growth and 6% consulting growth, with total revenue growth expected at 9.5% and a free cash flow margin of 36%.

Jefferies also discussed valuation, noting that IBM trades at 26 times CY27 GAAP EPS, compared with 27 times for Oracle and 23 times for Microsoft. They have a $360 price target on IBM, which traded hands at about $297 on Thursday afternoon.

The analysts believe that the multiple could expand if software execution becomes more consistent and the software business mix rises, with software expected to represent nearly half of revenue by 2027.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI2XzAxXC8yMDI0LTEwLTI0LTEyLTU4LTMxLWI0ZGVlMWNmOTU0ZTU0NzcwZjA1ZjlkMjU0OGU4YzhkLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2026-01-22 14:42:07.242786

Managing GLP-1 spending has become a strategy of its own, according to one NFP leader, who advocated for collaboration among CHROs, CFOs, and corporate boards to address this issue.
A host of pharmaceutical manufacturers have agreed to sell their medications at a lower price point, including Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which make GLP-1 drugs.
“I think GLP-1s will always be a specific, individual topic,” apart from pharmacy benefits more broadly, he explained.
Managing complex challenges surrounding pharmacy costs may benefit from cross-collaboration among HR and finance teams, as well as corporate boards, Conway suggested.","Employers grew more concerned about the high cost of pharmaceutical drugs last year, even as the White House rolled out a series of policies intended to lower prices of some popular medications.

Nearly three-quarters of employers said they were moderately, very, or extremely concerned about pharmacy costs being “unsustainable” in 2025, according to a recent report from NFP, a benefits consultancy that’s part of Aon. That’s up from 67% who expressed moderate to extreme concern about pharmacy costs in 2024.

The growing focus on pharmacy spending comes as employer health costs are projected to rise more than 9% this year, driven in part by coverage of costly GLP-1 medications for weight loss. Managing GLP-1 spending has become a strategy of its own, according to one NFP leader, who advocated for collaboration among CHROs, CFOs, and corporate boards to address this issue.

How HR is seeking to control prescription drug spend. President Donald Trump campaigned on overhauling the US healthcare system and has rolled out a number of policies intended to lower drug prices since taking office in 2024. A host of pharmaceutical manufacturers have agreed to sell their medications at a lower price point, including Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which make GLP-1 drugs.

The hope is that these deals will eventually bring relief to the employer-sponsored insurance market. As of October 2025, though, GLP-1 diabetes and weight loss medications were still cited as the top driver of prescription drug spending among health benefits decision-makers surveyed by NFP, with 51% identifying them as such, up from 44% in 2024.

Despite their high cost, GLP-1s are gaining ground as a potential lever for talent attraction and retention. Indeed, 29% of workers told NFP they would switch jobs to gain GLP-1 coverage.

Still, decisions about coverage vary “dramatically” from one employer to the next, said Nick Conway, NFP’s president of Rx Solutions. Those who are covering the drugs are commonly turning to “bolt-on solutions” to help manage costs, he said. Such solutions may be offered by a pharmacy benefit manager or a third party, and may help employers evaluate whether GLP-1s are appropriate for their workers, as well as manage utilization.

Other employers may forgo working with their PBM entirely and turn to point solution vendors to help manage GLP-1s separately from other prescription drugs, he said.

Whatever approach HR teams land on, it looks likely that GLP-1s will require unique strategic thinking for the foreseeable future, Conway said. “I think GLP-1s will always be a specific, individual topic,” apart from pharmacy benefits more broadly, he explained.

Managing complex challenges surrounding pharmacy costs may benefit from cross-collaboration among HR and finance teams, as well as corporate boards, Conway suggested. “All this disruption is creating a more robust conversation at our employer clients to bring in either the chief financial officer of the business, or the board of the business, into these decisions,” he said.","https://morningbrew.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,quality=70,format=auto/https://storage.morningbrew.com/image/2026-01-22/image-8d1ec49515058dfebb728eb57c8fded728c81ac9-2409x1606-jpg/Moneyinhealthcare-Highcosthealthconcept",N,,2026-01-22 17:58:24.670397

Lisa Su — Chair and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. So we delivered very strong second quarter results, with revenue exceeding the midpoint of guidance as higher EPYC and Ryzen processor sales more than offset headwinds from export controls that impacted Instinct sales. We set records for both EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales, reflecting the broad-based demand for our differentiated, high-performance data center, PC, and embedded processors.

Second quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion, and we delivered over $1 billion in free cash flow. Excluding the $800 million inventory write-down related to data center AI export controls, gross margin was 54%, marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion led by a richer product mix.

Turning to the segments, Data Center segment revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. We saw robust demand across our EPYC portfolio to power cloud and enterprise workloads and increasingly for emerging AI use cases. In particular, adoption of Agentic AI is creating additional demand for general-purpose compute infrastructure, as customers quickly realize that each token generated by a GPU triggers multiple CPU-intensive tasks. Against this backdrop, 5th Gen EPYC Turin shipments ramped significantly, and we had sustained demand for our prior generation EPYC processors. As a result, we set records for both cloud and enterprise CPU sales and delivered our 33rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains.

In cloud, adoption expanded with the largest hyperscalers as they deployed EPYC to power more of their mission-critical infrastructure, services, and public cloud products. More than 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances launched in the quarter, including multiple Turin instances from Google and Oracle Cloud that deliver up to twice the performance of our previous generation, which were already the industry’s highest-performing offerings. There are now nearly 1,200 EPYC cloud instances available globally, as providers continue expanding both the breadth and regional availability of their AMD offerings. This continued expansion is accelerating enterprise adoption of EPYC in the cloud, with deployments growing significantly from the prior quarter as we closed large wins with dozens of large aerospace, streaming, financial services, retail, and energy companies.

EPYC adoption also grew with telecom customers, as providers modernize their infrastructure for next-generation networks. For example, KDDI announced plans to deploy EPYC processors to power its 5G virtualized network, and Nokia selected EPYC for its cloud platform used by service providers to build, deploy, and manage core network functions.

Turning to enterprise on-prem adoption, HPE, Dell, Lenovo and Supermicro launched 28 new Turin platforms in the quarter that delivered leadership performance, efficiency, and TCO across a wide range of enterprise workloads. EPYC enterprise deployments grew significantly from the prior quarter, supported by new wins with large technology, automotive, manufacturing, financial services, and public sector customers. To extend our momentum with SMB and hosted IT service customers, we launched the EPYC 4005 series that combine enterprise-grade performance and features in cost-optimized platforms, purpose-built for smaller-scale deployments.

Turning to HPC, AMD now powers more than one-third of the world’s fastest supercomputers, including El Capitan and Frontier, which retained the number one and number two spots on the latest top 500 list. We also powered 12 of the top 20 systems on the Green500, highlighting the performance per watt advantages of EPYC and Instinct for large-scale deployments. Looking ahead, we remain bullish on our server CPU business, driven by durable tailwinds, including growing demand for cloud and on-prem compute, sustained share gains, and the growing investments in general-purpose infrastructure required to enable AI.

Turning to our data center AI business, revenue declined year-over-year as US export restrictions effectively eliminated MI308 sales to China, and we began transitioning to our next-generation MI350 series accelerators. We made solid progress with MI300 and MI325 in the quarter, closing new wins and expanding adoption with Tier1 customers, next-generation AI cloud providers, and end users. Today, seven of the top 10 model builders and AI companies use Instinct, underscoring the performance and TCO advantages of our data center AI solutions. We launched our Instinct MI350 series with industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity and broad adoption across hyperscalers, AI companies, and OEMs.

From a competitive standpoint, MI355 matches or exceeds B200 in critical training and inference workloads and delivers comparable performance to GB200 for key workloads at significantly lower cost and complexity. For at-scale inferencing, MI355 delivers up to 40% more tokens per dollar, providing leadership performance and clear TCO advantages. With the MI350 series, we’re also expanding our system-level capabilities to support deployments powered by AMD CPUs, GPUs, and NICs. As one example, Oracle is building a 27,000-plus node AI cluster combining MI355 accelerators, 5th Gen EPYC Turin CPUs, and Pollara 400 SmartNICs. We began volume production of the MI350 series ahead of schedule in June, and expect a steep production ramp in the second half of the year to support large-scale production deployments with multiple customers.

Our Sovereign AI engagements accelerated in the quarter, as governments around the world adopt AMD technology to build secure AI infrastructure and advance their economies. As one example, we announced a multi-billion dollar collaboration with UMaine to build AI infrastructure powered entirely on AMD CPUs, GPUs, and software. Initial deployments are underway in key regions, with quarterly expansions planned over the coming years. In addition, we have more than 40 active engagements globally and see significant opportunities to power an increasingly larger portion of national computing centers and sovereign AI initiatives.

On the AI software front, we made significant progress this quarter increasing the performance, improving the usability, and expanding the adoption of ROCm. We announced ROCm 7 with major upgrades across every layer of the stack, delivering more than 3x higher inferencing and training performance, compared to our prior generation, and adding support for large-scale training, distributed inference, and lower precision data types. The deepened developer engagement, we introduced nightly ROCm builds and expanded access to instant compute infrastructure, including launching our first Developer Cloud that provides pre-configured containers for instant access to AMD GPUs. We also expanded native support for ROCm across key frameworks including vLLM and SGLang, enabling frontier models like Llama 4, Gemma 3, and DeepSeek R1 to launch with Day 0 AMD support. To accelerate enterprise adoption, we introduced ROCm Enterprise AI, a full-stack platform that integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure and includes everything needed for an enterprise to deploy, manage, and scale AI across their business.

Looking ahead, the development of our next-generation MI400 series is progressing rapidly. These are the most advanced GPUs we have ever built, with up to 40 petaflops of FP4 AI performance and 50% more memory, memory bandwidth, and scale out throughput than the competition. With the MI400 series, we’re bringing together everything we’ve learned across silicon, software, and systems to deliver Helios, a full-stack, rack-scale AI platform. Helios is purpose-built for the most demanding AI workloads, with each rack connecting up to 72 GPUs that can operate as a single massive AI accelerator. Helios is expected to deliver up to a 10x generational performance increase for the most advanced frontier models, and we believe it will be the highest performance AI system in the world when it launches. MI400 series development is progressing well towards our planned launch in 2026, with significant interest in large-scale deployments from multiple high-profile customers.

To accelerate our development, we have invested significantly to expand our AI software and hardware capabilities, both organically and inorganically with a number of acquisitions and strategic investments. We strengthened our software stack last quarter with the addition of the Brium and Lamini teams, building on our acquisitions of Nod.ai, Mipsology, and Silo AI. On the hardware side, we added a world-class rack and data center scale design team in the second quarter with our acquisition of ZT Systems. The ZT team has integrated seamlessly, and they are actively engaging with multiple customers to accelerate deployments of our Helios solutions at scale. We also announced last quarter that Sanmina intends to acquire ZT’ US-based manufacturing business, becoming our lead partner for AI rack manufacturing.

Turning to the AI regulatory environment, earlier this quarter, we were notified by the Department of Commerce that it is moving forward with the review of our license applications to export MI308 to China. We appreciate the focus the Trump administration is placing on ensuring that the US technology remains central to global AI infrastructure, and we expect to resume MI308 shipments as licenses are approved, subject to end customer demand and supply chain readiness. As our licenses are still under review, we are not including any MI308 revenue in our third quarter guidance. Despite that, we expect Instinct revenue to grow year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by the ramp of MI350 at multiple customers.

In Client and Gaming, segment revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our semi-custom game console SoCs and Radeon GPUs. Client revenue increased 67% year-over-year to $2.5 billion led by record desktop CPU sales. Demand for our latest generation Ryzen 9000 series was strong, especially for our differentiated X3D processors. We delivered record desktop channel CPU sales, as Ryzen processors consistently topped the best-selling CPU lists at major global e-tailers throughout the quarter. We also expanded our Zen 5 desktop portfolio with the launch of our latest Threadripper processors that feature up to 96 cores and deliver up to double the performance of the competition in many popular content creation and design workloads.

In mobile, demand for AMD-powered notebooks was strong, with sell-out growing by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year. We drove a richer mix of higher ASP mobile parts year-over-year as we expanded our share in the premium notebook segment, where our Ryzen AI 300 CPUs deliver leadership, performance, and value for both general-purpose and AI workloads.

In commercial PCs, Ryzen adoption accelerated as OEM consumption increased more than 25% year-over-year. We saw strong sell-through for AMD commercial notebooks with Lenovo and HP, and a significant uptick in Dell sales as they ramp availability of their AMD commercial portfolio. We also closed new enterprise wins with Forbes 2000 pharma, tech, automotive, financial services, aerospace, and healthcare companies. We expect to continue growing our commercial client share based on the strength of our product portfolio and expanded breadth of OEM offerings.

Looking more broadly, we remain confident we can continue growing client processor revenue ahead of the market over the coming quarters, driven by increased adoption of our desktop and notebook products, growing commercial momentum, and a richer product mix.

In gaming, revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Semi-custom revenue increased by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year, as console inventories normalized and our customers began preparing for the holiday season. We announced a new multiyear collaboration with Microsoft for custom chips that will power the next-generation of Xbox devices, including consoles, PCs, and handhelds. We also deepened our collaboration with Sony through Project Amethyst, a co-engineering program that will use machine learning to power the next wave of immersive gaming experiences.

In PC gaming, demand for our latest generation Radeon 9000 series GPUs was very strong, with desktop GPUs sell-through accelerating in the quarter, as demand outpaced supply. We launched the Radeon 9600 XT, extending the performance advantages of RDNA 4 to mainstream gamers and delivering a significant uplift in gaming performance, including more than double the ray tracing of our prior generation. As part of our end-to-end AI strategy, we introduced the Radeon AI PRO R9700 GPU for local inferencing, model fine-tuning, and other data-intensive workloads. The R9700 features more memory, full ROCm support, and multi-GPU scalability, enabling advanced AI development and deployment directly on the desktop.

Turning to our embedded segment, revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $824 million. Demand continues recovering gradually with sell-through in the second quarter picking up, as strength in most markets was offset by a few pockets of softness in inventory reduction actions, largely with industrial customers. We expanded our embedded portfolio with the first production shipments of Spartan UltraScale+ FPGAs that deliver leadership performance and advanced security for cost-sensitive, low-power applications. Adoption of our Versal adaptive SoCs continues expanding in high-end applications, including next-generation Robotaxi platforms developed by Bosch in Europe, where Versal serves as a high-performance controller enabling real-time processing, security, and encryption in fully electric automated vehicles.

Looking ahead, we expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications, and aerospace markets will drive a return to sequential growth in the second half of 2025. Longer-term design win momentum continues to build tracking ahead of this point last year and putting us on pace to surpass the record $14 billion in design wins we achieved in 2024.

In summary, demand is very strong across our product portfolio, and we are well-positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year, led by the steep ramp of MI350 series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and Ryzen share gains. Our server and PC CPU businesses are accelerating, driven by growing demand for high-performance compute, sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio, and expanded go-to-market investments. Our embedded in gaming businesses are returning to growth and are well-positioned for long-term success, supported by strong design win momentum. And in AI, we are seeing strong adoption of our MI350 series and ROCm 7, as we deliver leadership performance and TCO advantages across a broader range of workloads and ramp deployments with an expanded set of cloud and enterprise customers.

Looking ahead, we see a clear path to scaling our AI business to tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. We are very excited about our next-generation MI400 series, which is another giant step forward on our roadmap and has been designed to deliver leadership performance at the chip, server, and rack levels. Customer interest for the MI400 series is very strong, and we are actively engaging with an expanding set of customers to support large-scale deployments in 2026. We are in the early stages of an industry-wide AI transformation that will drive a step function increase in compute demand across all of our markets, positioning us for significant revenue and earnings growth over the coming years.

Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter results. Jean?

Jean Hu — Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer

Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. We are pleased with our strong second quarter financial results. We delivered record revenue of $7.7 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, up 32% year-over-year, reflecting strong momentum across our business. Record sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and higher semi-custom shipment more than offset the impact of the US export controls, restricting MI308 sales to China. Revenue increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in the Client and Gaming segment, partially offset by the data center revenue decrease due to export controls.

Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago. The decrease was due to the $800 million inventory and related charges associated with the export restrictions. Excluding this charge, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%.

Operating expenses were approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of 32% year-over-year, as we continue to invest aggressively in go-to-market activities for revenue growth and in R&D to capitalize on significant future AI expansion opportunities. Operating income was $897 million, representing a 12% operating margin compared to $1.3 billion, or 22% a year ago. The decline was primarily due to the inventory and related charges. Taxes, interest expense, and other totaled $126 million.

For the second quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share were $0.48, compared to $0.69 a year ago. The inventory and related charges reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.43.

Now turning to our reportable segment, starting with the Data Center. Data Center segment revenue was $3.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, driven by strong EPYC CPU revenue and the share gains across both cloud and enterprise customers. On a sequential basis, Data Center revenue decreased 12% due to the impact of the export controls on MI308. The Data Center segment operating loss was $155 million, compared to operating income of $743 million a year ago, or 26% of revenue. The loss was primarily due to the inventory and related charges.

Client and Gaming segment revenue was $3.6 billion, up 69% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our PC and console gaming products. In the Client business, revenue was a record of $2.5 billion, up 67% year-over-year, driven by record sales of our Ryzen desktop CPUs and richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to $1.1 billion, up 73% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for our newly launched gaming GPUs and higher semi-custom revenue as inventory has now normalized and customers prepare for the holiday season.

Client and Gaming segment operating income was $767 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to $166 million, or 8% a year ago, driven by richer client product mix and operating leverage on higher revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $824 million, down 4% year-over-year and flat sequentially, as embedded and market demand remains mixed. Embedded segment operating income was $275 million, or 33% of revenue, compared to $345 million, or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to product mix.

Before I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the acquisition of ZT Systems early in the second quarter. As we had announced our intent to divest ZT manufacturing business, the financial results of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non-GAAP financials. Subsequently, in May, we entered into an agreement with the Sanmina Corporation to sell the ZT manufacturing business for $3 billion in cash and stock, inclusive of contingent payments. The transaction is expected to close near the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, during the quarter, we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operating activities of continuing operations, and free cash flow was a record of $1.2 billion. We returned $478 million to shareholders through share repurchases, resulting in $1.2 billion in share repurchases for the first half of 2025. In May, our Board of Directors approved an additional $6 billion authorization exiting the quarter, we have $9.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion. Our long-term debt was $3.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid down $950 million of commercial paper used to finance the ZT Systems’ acquisition cost.

Now turning to our third quarter 2025 outlook, please note that our third quarter outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipment to China, as our license applications are currently under review by US government. For the third quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to be approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 28% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Client and Gaming and Data Center segments. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in the Data Center segment with the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series GPU products. Modest growth in our Client and Gaming segment, with client revenue increasing and gaming revenue to be flattish. And our Embedded segment revenue to return to growth.

In addition, we expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.55 billion. We expect net interest and other expenses to be, again, over approximately $10 million. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.

In closing, we executed very well in the first half of the year, delivering record revenue and building strong momentum for growth in the second half. The strategic investment we are making positioned us to capitalize on the expanding AI opportunities across all our end markets, driving sustainable long-term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling value creation.

With that, I’ll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.

Matthew Ramsay — Vice President of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations

Operator, will you please pull the audience for questions? Thank you.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Yes, thank you, Matt. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Thomas O’Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas O’Malley

Hey, thank you for taking my questions, and I appreciate it. Lisa, I want to start on the Client business. So you had previously laid out a second half outlook that was roughly flattish with the first half, as you were kind of protecting against some pull-forward. So first, do you think that your Q2 results included some pull-forwards and the second half should still be flattish? And longer-term, after the Intel commentary regarding 18A, maybe what that means is a knee jerk reaction just right away for AMD longer-term in terms share and ASPs?

Lisa Su

Sure, Tom, thanks for the question. So first of all, our Client and Gaming segment, and particularly our Client business, just performed very well in the first half of the year, I think if you look at the entire first half, it was up 68% year-over-year. I think if you look underneath that, what we’re seeing is strength in every part of our Client business. So we saw very strong sales in our desktop channel area. We have a leadership product there, best gaming GPUs with our X3D GPUs. We’ve had strong rise in AI adoption as well in the first half of the year, we see that in sell-through. And in addition, we’ve had strong enterprise sell-through as we brought that forward.

So to your question of how much is pull-forward, we don’t think a whole lot of that is. We actually — when we look at the sell-through patterns, the end user consumption is actually quite strong for client in terms of going into the second half of the year. As we said in our Q3 guide, the primary driver of our Q3 guide is a very strong data center driven by MI350 ramping. We are expecting some growth in the Client business, so I wouldn’t say it’ll be flat to the first half, but it won’t be — we’re planning for it to be a little bit less than seasonal, just given some of the uncertainties out there. But the Client business is performing extremely well for us. We believe we are gaining share in all the right places. So if you look at the numbers in the first quarter, and it’ll show through in the second quarter as well, a lot of the uplift in revenue is in ASPs. And that is basically, we’re selling up the stack on the strength of our portfolio.

And I think we’re still quite underrepresented in the enterprise portion of the business. That is where we have increased our go-to-market resources and focus. And we’re seeing nice traction there, especially with the portfolios that we have from HP and Lenovo in enterprise PCs. And now we’re adding Dell as well as it’s ramping here, started in the second quarter, we’ll ramp more in the second half of the year. So I think all of those are tailwinds for our Client business, beyond the second half of ’25, but really, into the next number of quarters, as we think about the portfolio and the opportunities for us.

Thomas O’Malley

Super helpful. And then secondly, I was hopeful you could provide us a little more color on China. So the guide doesn’t include MI308. But perhaps you could comment on when you get approval if the supply chain is ready, what’s currently in inventory, and maybe compare what you think the contribution will look like versus the $700 million in Q2 and the $800 million for the second half you spoke about in April?

Lisa Su

Sure, Tom. So, yeah, let me answer some of the questions on China. I’m sure that there are some questions. Look, we’re very pleased with the progress that’s been made with the administration over the last couple of months. We’ve been working very closely with the administration. I think the focus here on ensuring that US technology gets utilized throughout the world is something that we certainly support and very much want to contribute to. China is an important market for us. Given the timing of licenses, we have a number of licenses that are under review now. We are working with the Department of Commerce to get those reviewed. We do expect that once those licenses are approved, we will start MI308 shipments.

In terms of the supply chain, most of our inventory was not in finished goods, so it was work in process, and it will take us a couple of quarters to run through that. The exact timing of revenue and contribution will depend a bit on when those are — when the licenses are actually granted. But overall, I think this is a better position than we were 90 days ago. And we certainly view China as a market that we would like to service with MI308. And we’re working closely with the administration to do that.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Vivek Arya

Thank you for taking my question. If we look into 2026, right, that’s when I think the Sovereign opportunity could get quite meaningful for AMD. What is the right way to size that? What does this JV structure mean with some of the contracts that you have signed? And would you consider this incremental to the kind of growth rate that you’re seeing with your current MI business, or would this be instead of? So just if you could give us a way to size, what is that incremental opportunity from a Sovereign customers when it comes to ’26, Lisa? Is it dependent on MI400, right? In which case, it might be more backup dated, etc. So just some ways to think about Sovereign for AMD next year.

Lisa Su

Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, we’re really excited about the overall AI opportunity for us with MI355 and the MI400 series as we go through the back half of this year and into 2026. I think it’s — there’s a very large opportunity with, let’s call it hyperscalers, some of the leading AI companies, as well as Sovereign. I think Sovereign is additive to that, for sure. From the standpoint of what to expect, there are also some regulatory things that need to be worked through on the Sovereign side. But again, we’re working closely with the administration as they go through the various regulatory decisions that need to be made.

But from my perspective, I think the fact that countries want their own Sovereign computing capability is very, very clear. I think we see that all over the world. The HUMAIN opportunity that you’re referring to that we announced with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I think is a great example of where together with their ambitions, our technology, I think you heard from Tareq that was — he was at our event saying that would start with MI355, that we would expect that that would continue on. I think what’s attractive about our offering is our open ecosystem. And I think that really resonates with the Sovereign community. But to your original question, I think it’s an additive opportunity, and it’s one that we believe will continue to be very important for us going forward with both MI355 as well as the MI400 series.

Vivek Arya

Got it. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about gross margins for your MI product. So I understand in the early days, right, it has been dilutive. What kind of sales level is required for it to start becoming additive to margins? And let’s say if I fast-forward to Q4 and assume that your Q4 sales are growing year-over-year roughly the same rate as Q3 sales, should we expect gross margins kind of to stay at these Q3 levels, or are there other plus/minus drivers we should think about in terms of gross margins as you go into Q4? Thank you.

Jean Hu

Yeah, Vivek, thank you for the question. The gross margin of our MI product, we said it’s a little bit below corporate average. I think at this point, our priority is really to address the large, fast-growing revenue opportunities we have and provide customers a better TCO to really expand our presence in the marketplace. I think the way to think about our gross margin, there are different dynamics, right, different customers, different generations. But also, our operations team has been continuing to really drive operational efficiency to improve our MI family’s gross margin. That has been ongoing. So it’s not necessarily really tied to, okay, the revenue level each quarter, but you should think about it as a trend in the longer term. It should improve continually going forward.

Overall, the way I think about it is gross margin dollars, right, this is one of the fastest-growing market opportunities. For any financial metrics, gross margin dollars is what we try to grab as much as we can. Hopefully, that helped your question.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot. Lisa, so my question is on data center GPU. You did say that June is up year-over-year. So it sounds like it’s maybe a little more than $1 billion. And you use words like “strong ramp” into the back half of the year. Can you give us just any color on what that means? Can you get to, say, $7 billion for the year? And can you give us some maybe milepost on what you’re assuming for Q3? That would be great.

Lisa Su

Yeah, thanks, Tim, for the question. I think what we said in the prepared remarks is that, we are seeing a strong ramp from Q2 into Q3. MI355, we actually started production in June, so we had some shipments in sort of in the month of June, but it really is ramping as we go through this quarter in the third quarter. So in terms of guideposts, we said it would grow year-on-year from last year. And that I think is a strong ramp. And then we would expect it to grow into the fourth quarter as well.

The demand, I should say, what we’re seeing from customers is, I think really positive around MI355. Sort of the way I would contrast it with maybe the MI300 ramp, I think MI300 started with perhaps some smaller deployments. I think what we’re seeing with MI355 is very competitive versus the B200, GB200 family of products. I think there’s a strong desire to really use us at scale. MI355 is very strong for inferencing. We’re also working with a number of customers on training. And this is also an opportunity for us to build into the MI400 series as we go into 2026. So we’re bullish on MI355 and where the AI opportunity is for us. And I think we’re right on track to what we expected to be as we were going through the development of the roadmap.

Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot. And then, Lisa, just on that point, also, you did talk about a new Developer Cloud. So, obviously, you’re beginning to lease back some of the capacity that you’re selling into the clouds and the NIO clouds. Is that going to be a material portion of the revenue you’re going to recognize for MI355 in the back half of the year? Can you just talk about that and maybe how to think about how much demand that’s going to stimulate and what the ultimate goal is for that cloud? Thanks.

Lisa Su

Yeah. So there are a couple of things in that question. So let me answer. So the Developer Cloud is simply we want to make it super easy for developers to get on AMD Instinct GPUs. One could say — again, if we look back at the MI300 family, we were very focused on the largest hyperscalers and the largest customers. But there’s a lot of interest in our GPUs across a number of customers who just wanted easier access. So by ensuring that Developer Cloud is there, that it has, ready-to-deploy containers, you can run training and inference easily, you don’t necessarily have to make longer-term commitments, I think that’s the purpose of the Developer Cloud.

I don’t think it adds meaningfully to revenue in the second half of the year, but it certainly adds to customers getting experience with AMD. I think the larger revenue opportunities for us are really with large customer adoption as they ramp to larger deployments. And we’re very actively trying to get those deployments up and running as soon as possible.

One of the things, just as a reminder, that the MI355 is — given that it’s a similar infrastructure to MI300, we actually think it’s going to ramp very quickly and very well for customers. And I think that’s one of the attractive portions of it as well.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.

Ross Seymore

Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, I want to go back to the Instinct side of things, and the MI355 ramp. Looks like the second half is going to ramp really significantly. You said it’s going to be up year-over-year in the third quarter. I believe a quarter ago, you said roughly the same thing in the MI308 is out of both numbers. So that shouldn’t really matter and I guess it would be upside. But I just wondered how have things changed from a quarter ago as far as the MI350 family adoption, especially because you launched a little bit early? Is the growth a little bit more than you would have expected a quarter ago, about the same, or a little worse? Just any sort of color on that would be helpful.

Lisa Su

Yeah, Ross, thanks for the question. I think the main thing I would say is, I think the adoption is a bit faster than we might have expected. Again, whenever you launch a product, we want to make sure that we go through the full validation and all of that with our customers. I think there’s a lot of interest, broad-based interest in MI355. And so, I feel like over the last 90 days, I think we’ve had significant sort of new customer interest and that’s certainly positive.

I will say —

Ross Seymore

I guess —

Lisa Su

Oh, I’m sorry, Ross, I was just going to add, the — our engagements are — I think the other piece is, I think there’s also a lot of excitement around MI400 and what we can do with the Helios rack. And so, there are a number of customers who, based on the strong roadmap that we’re showing, want to get familiar and really work with us earlier in the life cycle, which, I think is again, positive.

Ross Seymore

Great. Thank you for that. I guess is my follow-up, an earlier question you talked about a little bit below seasonality in the second half of the year for your Client business. It seems like there’s just — I don’t even know if seasonality is a framework that matters. But how are you thinking about that for the second half as a whole for Client? And then Gaming, it was just up a huge amount sequentially. In the second quarter, you described a little bit of what you’re expecting there. But how do you think about seasonality for the second half in its entirety in the Gaming side as well?

Lisa Su

Yeah. Let me try, and then Jean might add if you want a little bit more color. So the way to think about it is, we do expect some growth — sequential growth in client as we go into the third quarter. I would say, single-digit-type growth. We continue to see good traction for our products in that portfolio. On the Gaming side, I would call it flattish to Q2. And we’re coming off of such a strong Q2 that I think flattish is actually to be expected.

As we go into the fourth quarter, the dynamics that we would see is, we would see that the console business would actually be down substantially. So think about it as down strong double digits. The customers usually build for the holiday season, sort of before that and then that will be completed by the fourth quarter. So we would expect as the Client and Gaming segment that the segment would probably be down in the fourth quarter.

So hopefully, that helps. Jean, did you want to add to that?

Jean Hu

No, I think you covered it.

And the next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.

Joshua Buchalter

Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about lead times on your — on the Instinct family, both for the MI350 family and MI400. As you move into larger cluster sizes, which it sounds like you’re doing at least with Oracle on 350, and then endeavor to do more so on 400, how much visibility and lead time do you need from your customers? Because I would imagine the lead time for your parts is measured in months. But on the infrastructure side, in particular for the larger-scale deployments, those things are measured in years at this point. So maybe you could speak to the visibility specifically on the 400. Thank you.

Lisa Su

Yes, sure, Josh. So, yes, I mean, our lead times are long, given all of the processing steps that we have to go through. Think about it as somewhere between eight, nine months, that type of thing. We have a very, very strong supply chain. We’ve been preparing for these ramps of both MI350 series and MI400 series and that preparation is ongoing. So we feel like we have a very strong supply chain there.

In terms of visibility with customers, we’re absolutely working with customers very closely on near-term MI350 series deployments, getting those deployments up as quickly as possible. Again, one of the things about the MI350 series that is good is that, it can go into existing data centers, given the — just given the platform that is — that it is in. So we have been certainly working with our customers there.

And then for the MI400 series, there are lots and lots of details in sort of full rack scale design implementation and we’re actively working with the largest customers right now on just ensuring that our Helios rack is fully compatible with their data center build out as we go into 2026. So that visibility is important. I think that co-development, co-engineering is important as we get into the rack scale architecture. And the ZT team that we’ve brought in has been extremely, extremely helpful in terms of both internal platform build out, as well as ensuring that we’re working closely with our customers on their data center needs.

Joshua Buchalter

Thank you for that, Lisa. And maybe for Jean, I wanted to follow up on Vivek’s question earlier on gross margins. So if we add back the charges in 2Q and then your gross margin implied in the guidance is roughly flat sequentially, and that’s despite what’s implied to be data center GPUs up meaningfully, sequentially. It doesn’t seem like consoles falling off in the third quarter. I mean, can you maybe talk to the underlying drivers of how you’re able to keep the flat gross margins despite what sounds like still margin-dilutive data center GPUs up significantly within the mix? Thank you.

Jean Hu

Yeah, Josh, thanks for the question. Yeah, we are guiding our Q3 gross margin around the 54% and Q2, you’re right, excluding the $800 million charge. It was close to 54%. I think the Gaming business actually is quite high. So the mix actually is unfavorable. But we do have some tailwinds we have been really driving. First is, we have been expanding our server business, which has really nice gross margin. And on the Client business side, we are expanding the commercial PC business. That really helps us to drive the gross margin up. In addition, we do have a really strong operational team. They are driving the gross margin improvement just from an operational efficiency perspective across the board. So overall, our objective is to continue to improve gross margin despite MI350 very strong ramp in Q3, we are able to continue to drive the margin up.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Joseph Moore

Great. Thank you. You used this language before of the kind of tens of billions opportunity around MI400. Can you talk about the time frame when that might occur, and not to pin you down too much, and what would help you get to that level sooner rather than later? Should we think of that 2027 realistic outcome that you could be looking at $20 billion-plus? Just a little bit more color on that tens of billions comment.

Lisa Su

Yeah. Maybe without being specific, Joe, I can give you sort of the way I look at it and back to this notion of, are we incrementally more confident? I think we’re seeing a lot of positive signs in our AI customer adoption. I think the strength of the MI350 series, the very positive feedback that we’re getting on MI400 from customers, the work that we’re doing in terms of ensuring that we are fully ready for large-scale deployments of not just inference but training. I think when we get to tens of billions of dollars, we’re talking about significant gigawatt-scale type deployments. And those would be important for us to get there. And we’re certainly, I think, engaged with all the right customers that can enable that type of ramp. But I won’t necessarily speculate on the exact time other than to say certainly, that would be our set of aspirations.

Joseph Moore

Great, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then, as these workloads evolve, I mean, you’ve sort of talked about inference and training as different opportunities for AMD. Are you seeing those start to come together? It seems like with inference, there’s — the reasoning models are requiring much higher complexity. Is rack scale more important to the inference market than you thought it might be? Just any color around how that complexity of inference is impacting you guys.

Lisa Su

Yeah, I think that’s absolutely true, Joe. I think with the proliferation of models, I think what we’re seeing is, GPUs continue to be very — sort of the computing of choice as you think about all the models that are out there. And then as you go into distributed inference and some of the newer techniques, we are seeing the importance of the scale-up and scale-out architecture, which we are investing in. But I think the overarching thing is, I think we have a very competitive roadmap across the next couple of generations. I think that has now gotten strong customer validation. We’re getting a lot of feedback from customers on where they would like to see us continue to add more resources and add more focus. And so, that is very helpful. And the key is to be a full-scale solution provider for these large customer deployments and that’s what we’re working on.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.

Aaron Rakers

Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I do have a follow-up as well. I guess the first question is, when we look at the data center guide, Jean, you alluded to double-digit sequential growth. Obviously, the MI355 series kind of ramping, I’m curious, how could we conceptualize what you’re expecting in the server side, and where do you think your market share is today in traditional enterprise servers outside of cloud?

Jean Hu

Yeah, I think when you look at our Data Center business, we do have a strong double-digit growth. Both server and the MI, both sides are growing sequentially. Of course, MI ramp is the most significant one. As far as server market share, we do think we continue to drive the market share up compared to Q1. Third-party has not published report yet, but we feel really good about the Q2 market share increase versus Q1.

Lisa Su

And Aaron, if I just add to that, one of the things that — it’s important for people to understand is, in some of the cloud capex numbers that have come out that have been quite positive, that is not only a GPU statement, but there’s actually significant CPU capex in there as well. We’ve started to see more robust forecasts going out a number of quarters on the server CPU side, because all of that AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well. And so, we’re very bullish on the opportunity in servers. I think the team has really executed extremely well. I mean, if you look at our portfolio now, Turin Genoa, our very well-adopted broadening workloads. Enterprise adoption is also increasing. And so, I think all of those are positive for the server opportunity in the second half of ’25, as well as going into ’26 and beyond.

Aaron Rakers

Yeah. And then as a follow-up, I’m kind of thinking about the China, the MI308 opportunity. When we do see a license, I think you alluded to this earlier, it’s going to take a little bit of time to ramp and get the supply chain to satisfy the demand. But I’m curious, the $800 million write-down that you had taken, is there no kind of finished inventory there? Does that come back? Do you have any reversal aspects of that once a license gets approved?

Jean Hu

Let me start first, then Lisa can add. The first on the $800 million, majority of them are WIPs. We really don’t have on-the-shelf finished good we can ship immediately. So we do need to take time if we get a license.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.

CJ Muse

Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Lisa, I was hoping you could level-set us on the Instinct ramp into 2026. How are you thinking about the timing of the handoff 350 to 400? How are you thinking about Helios contributions? And I guess very importantly, from a customer contribution perspective, how you might see that evolve from traditional hyperscalers to perhaps more Sovereign and NIO cloud within the mix?

Lisa Su

Sure, CJ. So certainly, as second half this year, it’s all about MI355 ramp into first half of next year, I think the MI400 series development is right on track. The development of the Helios platform is also right on track. We would expect significant revenue contribution from Helios in 2026. And then relative to the contribution of the various things, hyperscalers, sort of some of the — versus NIO clouds versus Sovereign, I think it’s a little early to really talk about the different pieces other than to say, you would expect that hyperscalers and let’s call it NIO clouds that would be working for other large AI natives, maybe significant pieces of the initial ramp. And then Sovereign may come a little bit later in time, just given sort of the timing of when different build-outs would happen. So hopefully, that gives you some color, CJ.

CJ Muse

Yeah, very helpful. And then, Jean, I guess a question for you, with the sale of ZT for $3 million in cash and stock, and you only have $3 billion of debt outstanding, how are you thinking about the use of proceeds? Is there saving for a rainy day or bolt-on acquisitions, perhaps more aggressive share buyback? How are you thinking about it today?

Jean Hu

Yeah, thanks for the question. Our business model actually generates a lot of free cash flow. As you see in Q2, free cash flow generation was $1.2 billion. So if we close the ZT sale, and we’ll get more cash, overall, our capital allocation principle continues to be the first phase investing, especially with the tremendous AI opportunities ahead of us. And then we will continue to return cash to shareholders. We did a $1.2 billion repurchase in the first half of the year. We are committed to continue to return cash to shareholders through share repurchase.

Matthew Ramsay

Operator, I think we have time for one more caller, please.

Operator

Okay. The final question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.

Ben Reitzes

Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to clarify a little bit on the $1 billion increase in sequential sales. It would seem like it’s coming from GPUs, primarily. I was wondering if you could back that. And that’s with nothing in China. And if the answer to the prior question that GPUs are over $1 billion, that kind of puts you at a $2 billion run rate. And I was just wondering if that was accurate in terms of thinking. And then I have just a very quick follow-up. Thanks.

Jean Hu

Hi, Ben, thanks for the question. If you look at the sequential revenue increase, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, we see data center strong double-digit increase, which includes both GPU and CPU. But GPU definitely drives the largest incremental amount increase. We also mentioned the client actually is going to increase sequentially. In addition, the Embedded business will return to sequential growth. So multiple businesses contributed to sequential increase, but the majority of increase really driven by MI355′ strong ramp.

Ben Reitzes

Okay. Great. And then if indeed that gets you pretty close to a couple billion dollars, if the MI300 comes in, do you see it at the same run rate that you exited and then you have the ability to get at that $800 million run rate right away or do you think it’ll take several quarters to ramp when you get the license? Thanks.

Lisa Su

Yeah, Ben, it will take some time to ramp, just given — particularly, today, I mean, we’re sitting already in early August, so I don’t think you would see a lot of it in Q3. But certainly, as licenses would be approved, we would schedule that, and it would take a little while to ramp.

Matthew Ramsay

All right, operator. Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody that joined the call today. And we just like to end the call now. Thank you.

Riyadh Air launches cargo brand

Riyadh Air, Saudi Arabia’s new national carrier, has launched its cargo operations under the brand name Riyadh Cargo, marking its formal entry into the global air cargo market and the activation of belly-hold cargo services across its wide-body fleet.

Riyadh Cargo will leverage the substantial capacity available on Riyadh Air’s orderbook of more than 120 wide-body aircraft to move goods efficiently and reliably, strengthening connectivity between global markets. The cargo operation is being developed through a deliberate, phased strategy designed to build a scalable and fully integrated business anchored at the airline’s Riyadh hub. Growth will be aligned closely with network expansion and the airline’s increasing operational maturity.

The cargo division has already begun operations as part of the carrier’s wider ‘Pathway to Perfect’ process and has demonstrated early operational momentum on the Riyadh–London Heathrow route. During this initial phase, Riyadh Cargo has successfully transported significant volumes across a diverse range of commodities, including garments and textiles, fresh flowers, seafood, tea and coffee. These early movements highlight the operation’s ability to manage time-sensitive, perishable and high-value shipments with consistency and reliability.

Pravin Singh, Global Head of Cargo at Riyadh Air, said the cargo business has been designed with a long-term vision from the outset. “Riyadh Cargo has been built with a clear focus on operational discipline, reliability, and long-term scalability,” he said. “Launching within a live environment allows us to test, learn, and continuously refine how we operate, while delivering real value to our customers from the get-go. The launch of the brand is a foundational step in building a cargo business that grows alongside our network expansion and supports Saudi Arabia’s broader logistics ambitions.”

Walmart Keeps in Control

Walmart will cut its stake in PhonePe by about 12% to around 60%. Other stakeholders, Tiger Global and tech titan Microsoft (MSFT), plan to exit their stakes.

Walmart, which holds an about 72% stake in PhonePe, is selling nearly 46 million shares in the IPO. The three firms will together sell around 50.7 million shares in the offering. PhonePe will not issue any new shares in the IPO and will not receive proceeds from the sale. It aims to list by mid-2026, according to a Reuters report.

The company, founded in 2015, is the leading payments platform on India’s popular unified payments interface (UPI), commanding more than 45% market share by transaction volume, as of December 2025.

However, PhonePe’s loss widened to 14.44 billion rupees ($157.80 million) in the six-month period ended September 30, from 12.03 billion rupees a year ago, while revenue rose about 22% to 39.18 billion rupees, the filing showed.

Its main competitors in India are Google (GOOGL) Pay and Paytm.

Crucial Expansion Plans

PhonePe has more than 657 million registered users and offers payment solutions to over 47 million merchants.

PhonePe had been part of Flipkart, an India-based e-commerce group that is also majority-owned by Walmart. Both have been a crucial part of Walmart’s international expansion plans in the world’s most populous country.

PhonePe’s IPO plan comes amid buoyant Indian primary markets, where fundraising hit a record high in 2025. India ranked as the world’s second-largest primary market in 2025 after the United States, with 367 IPOs raising $21.8 billion, according to LSEG-compiled data.

Shares of Warner Bros.","By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS, AP Business Writer

NEW YORK (AP) — Skydance-owned Paramount is again extending the tender offer window in its $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that’s still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,” Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it’s “clear our shareholders agree,” as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner’s studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner’s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount’s bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Wired and The Wall Street Journal earlier reported some details of the exits of Mr. Zoph, Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz from Thinking Machines.
Thinking Machines amassed $2 billion from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the chip makers Nvidia and AMD, and others.
In the ensuing months, Thinking Machines struggled to raise new funding, for which it was seeking a valuation of $50 billion.","On Jan. 12, Mira Murati, the chief executive and co-founder of the artificial intelligence start-up Thinking Machines Lab, was asked by Sam Schoenholz, a leading researcher at the company, to join a meeting.

Ms. Murati sat down with Mr. Schoenholz and two other founders, Barret Zoph and Luke Metz. All four had worked together at OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, where Ms. Murati had been the chief technology officer, before the creation of Thinking Machines in February.

But in less than a year, Mr. Zoph, Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz had become deeply unhappy with the start-up’s direction. Thinking Machines lagged OpenAI and other rivals in releasing products, and was struggling to raise new funding at an eye-popping $50 billion valuation. The men had urged Ms. Murati to strike a deal — Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had discussed buying Thinking Machines, and Ms. Murati had developed closer ties with the chief executive of Anthropic, a leading A.I. company — but no transaction had resulted.

At the meeting, the men lobbied for Mr. Zoph, Thinking Machines’ chief technology officer, to oversee decisions about the company’s technical direction. They threatened to leave if changes were not made, four people with knowledge of the discussion said.

Ms. Murati balked. She told Mr. Zoph that he was already the chief technology officer and should just do his job.

Two days later, Ms. Murati, 37, fired Mr. Zoph, 32, who had been talking behind her back since October with OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, about returning to the company. OpenAI immediately rehired Mr. Zoph, along with Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz.

Another nine or so of Thinking Machines’ roughly 100 employees have decamped to OpenAI or have received offers to join the company, three people with knowledge of the situation said. Meta has also made offers worth hundreds of millions of dollars to some of the start-up’s employees, two people said.

The defections have set off furious mudslinging, as each side has cranked up its spin machine to portray its version of the story. A relationship that Mr. Zoph had with a Thinking Machines employee became public, and Ms. Murati — who posted a public message about having “parted ways” with Mr. Zoph — has faced questions over her reasons for firing him and the state of the company.

The turmoil at Thinking Machines, one of the highest-profile A.I. start-ups, is the latest episode in the perpetual soap opera that is the artificial intelligence industry, where young billionaires clash over professional and personal relationships as they vie for money, power and supremacy in the field. Occasionally, the drama spills into public view, riveting Silicon Valley.

“I am reminded of this line from ‘Anna Karenina’: ‘All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,’” said Venky Ganesan, a partner at the investment firm Menlo Ventures. “Happy companies require many things to go right simultaneously. You only need one or two things to go wrong to have an unhappy company.""

Wired and The Wall Street Journal earlier reported some details of the exits of Mr. Zoph, Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz from Thinking Machines.

The A.I. industry, a relatively small world of technology specialists and wealthy executives and investors, has long dealt with internecine feuds. Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, clashed with Mr. Altman over the company’s direction in 2018 and left. Mr. Musk has since sued Mr. Altman and OpenAI, accusing them of breaching the company’s founding contract by putting commercial interests ahead of the public good.

(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)

In 2023, several OpenAI board members ousted Mr. Altman, saying they did not trust him to build A.I. for the benefit of humanity. Ms. Murati played a part in Mr. Altman’s firing and briefly took over as OpenAI’s chief executive.

Her timing was fortuitous. The A.I. industry was booming, and Ms. Murati had the name recognition in tech circles to gather funding for a new venture. Thinking Machines amassed $2 billion from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the chip makers Nvidia and AMD, and others.

The financing, announced in July, valued Thinking Machines at $12 billion, though it had not released a product and Ms. Murati was tight-lipped about what the start-up would produce. In a social media post at the time, she said the start-up “exists to empower humanity.”

The company opened an office in San Francisco’s Mission District, a few blocks from OpenAI’s headquarters, and spared no expense on interior decorating. The in-house gym included “squat racks” for weight lifting, with iron barbells branded with “Thinking Machines” in bold white typeface.

Last summer, Mr. Zoph approached Ms. Murati about his relationship with a colleague who was not an A.I. researcher and who eventually left the company, three people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zoph continued in his role.

Around then, Meta executives reached out to Ms. Murati about potentially buying Thinking Machines, five people with knowledge of the conversations said. Mr. Zoph wanted to sell, but Ms. Murati preferred to remain independent and viewed the discussions with Meta as not serious.

In October, Thinking Machines released a product that helps developers adjust A.I. models to better perform specific tasks. Offered to businesses and software developers over the internet, the product was similar to technologies from Google, Amazon and Microsoft.

Mr. Tulloch also pushed Ms. Murati to sell Thinking Machines, two people familiar with the matter said. No deal materialized, and he left for Meta, which was heavily recruiting A.I. talent. The talks between Meta and Thinking Machines were reported earlier by The Verge.

In the ensuing months, Thinking Machines struggled to raise new funding, for which it was seeking a valuation of $50 billion. Some of its investors have privately worried about whether the start-up has a path forward as an independent company, two people familiar with the discussions said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/THINKING-MACHINES-OPENAI-zfjv/THINKING-MACHINES-OPENAI-zfjv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:42:25.162954

Yes, that means CPUs. The last time Nvidia tried its hand at non-graphics PC processors, it ended in a lasting failure. Times have changed, and now it’s ripe for Nvidia to once again enter the market for all-in Team Green machines. It could mark the moment when ARM-based PCs really take off, if only the ongoing RAM crisis wasn’t making this one of the worst moments for PCs in general.

Sure, Nvidia didn’t have much to say at CES 2026; however, a report from Digitimes (read via machine translation) claims that the company could have a notebook-ready chip early this year. This would be an ARM-based chip potentially akin to the Grace Blackwell SoC (system on a chip) found inside Nvidia’s DGX Spark AI-centric computers. Tom’s Hardware reported last week the same chip appeared in a shipping manifest for a sample Dell 16 Premium laptop.

This supposed “N1X” chip could be followed by several differently spec’ed CPUs later in the year. If Digitimes’ supply chain sources are correct, we could even hear about a supposed “N2” chip as a follow-up before the end of 2026. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang previously hinted at the N1 last year in a press conference with Intel’s new chief, Lip-Bu Tan. That’s where Nvidia promised to craft chips with Intel that would somehow combine the best of both companies. We’ll have to see how well that partnership goes if both chipmakers are actively competing with each other.

There’s a mountain of competition for Nvidia

Nvidia will be late to the party no matter what it does. Qualcomm, the other big ARM-based chipmaker for lightweight laptops, already has its Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip promising huge gains in graphics capability. Qualcomm also shared details on its Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at CES 2026. Nvidia’s only consumer-end announcements were tied to DLSS upscaler updates, more multi-frame gen for games, and computer vision technology for autonomous vehicles.

The N1X could still be a powerful chip, though with all the delays, Nvidia may be better off waiting to showcase a more powerful N2 chip if it wants to compete with Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 laptop chips or whatever gamer-specific APU (accelerated processing unit) AMD has been cooking up. Of course, we’d be interested in a laptop that has RTX 50-series Blackwell capabilities without the need for a power-sucking discrete GPU.

Microsoft promises all ARM-based PCs will be good for gaming

On Wednesday, Microsoft declared that it was making its Xbox app work natively on “all” ARM-based PCs. That’s interesting rhetoric considering how much of its messaging previously centered on “Snapdragon on PCs” or “Copilot+.” Xbox now claims that 85% of Xbox apps are compatible on ARM, though that’s mostly thanks to improvements to the Windows Prism emulator. Prism can take x86 native apps and help them run by recreating that separate CPU microarchitecture as software. In a recent update, Microsoft added support for AVX and AVX2 extensions to the x86 instruction set. These are especially important for games that rely on AVX for tasks like video encoders and physics engines.

Microsoft is also advertising that ARM-based PCs will share compatibility with Epic Anti-Cheat. Lack of EAC support is why some of these computers and other Linux-based systems like Valve’s Steam Deck struggle to run games like the ever-popular Fortnite. We’re two years into Microsoft’s big ARM-based PC push, and Qualcomm is adamant it no longer needs to talk about compatibility issues. The chipmaker launched a Qualcomm Control Panel app last year that’s supposed to act as a launcher for various games and programs, ensuring they work natively or on emulators when necessary.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/nVidia-GeForce-5080-11-e1740161107263-1200x675.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:00:08.210261

Lines, also known as MOL, one of Japan’s biggest shipping companies, announced its first carbon removal results under its long-term environmental plan. This move marks a real step beyond reducing emissions. MOL aims to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 under its Environmental Vision 2.2.

Shipping emissions are hard to cut, so removal methods help tackle the remaining CO₂. MOL’s actions also reflect the global growth of the carbon removal market. Companies and countries are investing more in solutions that take CO₂ out of the air for long-term storage. This trend is rising as climate targets push industries to go beyond emission cuts.

DAC, Ocean Capture & Rocks: A Trio of MOL’s First Carbon Removal

In fiscal 2024, MOL announced its first verified carbon removal achievements. This progress builds on its Environmental Vision 2.2 strategy. The shipping giant secured measurable removal commitments using several technologies.

In its LinkedIn post, the company notes:

“In FY2024, MOL reported credits equivalent to 2,000 tons of CO₂ emissions- marking the company’s first tangible achievement in CDR… As MOL continues to diversify its CDR portfolio, it remains committed to finding and scaling the most effective solutions- both natural and technological- to advance toward a decarbonized future.”

MOL partnered with Climeworks, a leading Direct Air Capture (DAC) company. Through this partnership, the company agreed to procure 13,400 tonnes of CO₂ removal by 2030 using Climeworks’ DAC systems.

MOL is the first shipping company globally to set up this type of DAC purchase. DAC pulls CO₂ directly from the air and stores it permanently.

MOL also signed an offtake agreement for 30,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits from Captura’s Direct Ocean Capture technology. This method removes CO₂ from seawater, which draws CO₂ from the air over time.

In addition, MOL made a deal with Alt Carbon for 10,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits. These credits come from enhanced rock weathering in India. Enhanced weathering helps pull CO₂ from the air into minerals in soil, a type of removal considered higher quality and more durable. This deal is the first of its kind between a Japanese shipping company and an Indian climate tech firm.

MOL is also buying enhanced rock weathering removal credits through another multiyear offtake. This brings added diversity to its removal portfolio. These deals help the company support different removal paths rather than relying on a single method.

Why Shipping Needs Removals

The global shipping industry carries about 90% of traded goods by volume. It also produces roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions. If trade grows, emissions could rise unless action is taken.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims for shipping emissions to drop. The targets are: 20-30% reduction by 2030, 70-80% by 2040, and net-zero by 2050, all compared to 2008 levels.

Even with cleaner fuels like ammonia or hydrogen, some emissions will remain hard to avoid. Energy efficiency and fuel switches help, but they cannot remove all CO₂ from long ocean voyages. Carbon removal fills this gap. It helps shipping companies offset their leftover emissions while future fuel solutions scale up.

RELATED: Shipping Toward Net Zero: Maritime Turns to Green Hydrogen and Ammonia

MOL’s Environmental Vision 2.2 plan aims to remove 2.2 million tonnes of CO₂ by 2030. This goal covers all its removal initiatives. This creates demand for early‑stage removal solutions and helps scale emerging technologies.

Partnerships on the Horizon: Forests, Carbon Credits, and Cross-Industry Moves

MOL’s carbon removal work includes broader moves with partners and industry players. The company is supporting carbon credits to cut emissions and expand negative emissions. All credits are third-party certified and independently verified to ensure quality and impact.

In January 2025, MOL and Marubeni Corporation started Marubeni MOL Forests Co. This joint venture will create, trade, and retire nature‑based carbon credits. Its first project aims to plant around 10,000 hectares of new forest in India. This will generate credits from afforestation and reforestation. These forests will start producing removals around 2028. Nature‑based solutions help store carbon while boosting biodiversity and soil quality.

Also, MOL signed a deal with ITOCHU Corporation. This agreement aims to promote environmental attribute certificates. These certificates help cut Scope 3 emissions in transportation. This work is the first Japanese model linking shipping and aviation in environmental certificate use. Scope 3 emissions come from supply chains and end‑use.

Another related program is the NX‑GREEN Ocean Program by Nippon Express, launched in February 2025. It uses carbon inset certificates tied to low‑carbon shipping by MOL vessels. These certificates help companies reduce their Scope 3 freight emissions. The program shows how removal and decarbonization can work together for supply chains.

Together, these partnerships show MOL’s expanding role. The company is connecting technical and natural removal solutions with marine decarbonization and cross‑industry climate efforts.

Riding the Carbon Market Wave

The global carbon removal market is growing fast. Corporations and governments are investing more in long-lasting removal methods. These include DAC, ocean capture, enhanced weathering, and nature-based solutions. This growth matches scientific calls for big removals to keep warming under 1.5°C.

MOL is helping to expand the removal market by investing in multiple technologies. A joint venture for a NextGen CDR Facility, including MOL and other buyers, aims for over 1 million tonnes of certified removals by 2025. These projects include DAC and biomass removal with long-term storage. Early demand helps drive down costs over time and encourages more technological development.

Shipping companies are also investing in emission reduction technologies. These include more efficient ship designs, alternative fuels, and onboard carbon capture systems.

Global shipping firms continue to align with the IMO’s decarbonization goals through technology upgrades, fuel changes, and climate partnerships. This includes work on hull design, logistics efficiency, and fuel alternatives such as ammonia and hydrogen. Those efforts reduce emissions intensity and support long-term climate targets.

Challenges Ahead: Cost, Permanence, and MRV

Despite progress, carbon removal faces challenges.

High Costs and Early Stage Technology: Direct Air Capture and ocean capture remain expensive and are still early in deployment, making them less appealing than traditional emission reductions.

Need for Strong MRV and Certification: Measurement, Reporting, and Verification systems must stay robust to ensure credits reflect real and lasting CO₂ removal. Independent certification is critical for market trust.

Nature-Based Risks: Forest and land projects require careful planning. Carbon storage can be reversed if forests burn, degrade, or are mismanaged. High-quality MRV standards help protect long-term carbon value.

Sailing Toward 2050: MOL’s Vision for Net-Zero Maritime

Despite challenges, experts say removals will be necessary for sectors that cannot eliminate emissions by 2050. Shipping, aviation, and heavy industry will likely cut emissions and use durable removals to meet climate goals.

For MOL, investing in removal markets, partnerships, and strong MRV frameworks positions the company as a leader in maritime decarbonization. The first results under Environmental Vision 2.2 show how shipping firms can add new climate solutions to their sustainability plans.

By partnering with DAC, ocean capture, and enhanced weathering technologies, and by investing in nature-based solutions, MOL is expanding its climate action beyond traditional emission cuts.

As shipping and corporate climate planning evolve, carbon removal will remain a key part of long-term strategies. MOL’s progress with Environmental Vision 2.2 shows how companies can blend technology, nature, and market forces to achieve bold climate goals.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_1705906225.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:42:11.572861

Fortunately, I had saved partial copies of some conversations and materials, but large parts of my work were lost forever.
However, my case reveals a fundamental weakness: these tools were not developed with academic standards of reliability and accountability in mind.
If a single click can irrevocably delete years of work, ChatGPT cannot, in my opinion and on the basis of my experience, be considered completely safe for professional use.
OpenAI, in its responses to me, referred to ‘privacy by design’ — which means that everything is deleted without a trace when users deactivate data sharing.","Within a couple of years of ChatGPT coming out, I had come to rely on the artificial-intelligence tool, for my work as a professor of plant sciences at the University of Cologne in Germany. Having signed up for OpenAI’s subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, I used it as an assistant every day — to write e-mails, draft course descriptions, structure grant applications, revise publications, prepare lectures, create exams and analyse student responses, and even as an interactive tool as part of my teaching.

It was fast and flexible, and I found it reliable in a specific sense: it was always available, remembered the context of ongoing conversations and allowed me to retrieve and refine previous drafts. I was well aware that large language models such as those that power ChatGPT can produce seemingly confident but sometimes incorrect statements, so I never equated its reliability with factual accuracy, but instead relied on the continuity and apparent stability of the workspace.

But in August, I temporarily disabled the ‘data consent’ option because I wanted to see whether I would still have access to all of the model’s functions if I did not provide OpenAI with my data. At that moment, all of my chats were permanently deleted and the project folders were emptied — two years of carefully structured academic work disappeared. No warning appeared. There was no undo option. Just a blank page. Fortunately, I had saved partial copies of some conversations and materials, but large parts of my work were lost forever.

At first, I thought it was a mistake. I tried different browsers, devices and networks. I cleared the cache, reinstalled the app and even changed the settings back and forth. Nothing helped.

When I contacted OpenAI’s support, the first responses came from an AI agent. Only after repeated enquiries did a human employee respond, but the answer remained the same: the data were permanently lost and could not be recovered.

Accountability gap

This was not a case of losing random notes or idle chats. Among my discussions with ChatGPT were project folders containing multiple conversations that I had used to develop grant applications, prepare teaching materials, refine publication drafts and design exam analyses. This was intellectual scaffolding that had been built up over a two-year period.

AI for research: the ultimate guide to choosing the right tool

We are increasingly being encouraged to integrate generative AI into research and teaching. Individuals use it for writing, planning and teaching; universities are experimenting with embedding it into curricula. However, my case reveals a fundamental weakness: these tools were not developed with academic standards of reliability and accountability in mind.

If a single click can irrevocably delete years of work, ChatGPT cannot, in my opinion and on the basis of my experience, be considered completely safe for professional use. As a paying subscriber (€20 per month, or US$23), I assumed basic protective measures would be in place, including a warning about irreversible deletion, a recovery option, albeit time-limited, and backups or redundancy.

OpenAI, in its responses to me, referred to ‘privacy by design’ — which means that everything is deleted without a trace when users deactivate data sharing. The company was clear: once deleted, chats cannot be recovered, and there is no redundancy or backup that would allow such a thing (see ‘No going back’). Ultimately, OpenAI fulfilled what they saw as a commitment to my privacy as a user by deleting my information the second I asked them to.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04064-7/d41586-025-04064-7_51933892.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 16:41:58.773543

​Richard Glasson, currently global CEO of Hogarth, will oversee the new operation as CEO of WPP Production.
“Bringing all of WPP’s craft expertise together in WPP Production reinforces our position at the heart of WPP's integrated offering.
WPP Production will consolidate the group’s extensive and specialist production resources into a single global organisation, with all teams operating on one platform using WPP Open’s production technology and AI-powered workflows.
This is about delivering exceptional value and setting new benchmarks for the quality and scale of content production worldwide.” The transition to WPP Production will take effect on February 23rd 2026.","​WPP has launched WPP Production, a new global production platform that brings together Hogarth with production teams and capabilities from across the WPP network.

WPP said the new offering is designed to unify all creative producers into a single global organisation and combine production expertise with technology, including generative AI, virtual and hybrid production and data-driven workflows.

The move follows similar consolidation efforts by other holding companies, including Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, which operate as Publicis Production and Omnicom Production respectively.

​Richard Glasson, currently global CEO of Hogarth, will oversee the new operation as CEO of WPP Production. “This is a transformative moment for us and, more importantly, for our clients,” he said. “Bringing all of WPP’s craft expertise together in WPP Production reinforces our position at the heart of WPP's integrated offering. It allows us to activate the full collective power of WPP – its talent, creativity, technology and data – to redefine content creation. We are focused on delivering smarter, more innovative and world-class storytelling that drives business for our clients.”

WPP said the launch is built around four core areas: creating a “unified global team” of craft and production experts; integrating agency-based producers into a single global structure; investing in talent and technology to support “next-generation content origination”; and launching a “high-velocity content studio” that combines production and media capabilities, with a focus on performance and real-time optimisation.

WPP Production will consolidate the group’s extensive and specialist production resources into a single global organisation, with all teams operating on one platform using WPP Open’s production technology and AI-powered workflows. The company said this is intended to improve connectivity across markets and increase operational efficiency.

The group said the move establishes what it describes as the world’s largest creative production capability, comprising close to 10,000 people across more than 40 cities and designed to deliver large volumes of content across multiple channels and geographies.

The new offering reflects what WPP lays out as its broader strategy to provide more integrated and seamless services across creative, media and production, delivered through WPP Open. The company said this approach is intended to give clients access to a more connected ecosystem of creative, media and production expertise.

The company added that WPP Production will focus on the use of technologies including advanced AI, virtual production and sustainable production practices, with the aim of supporting next-generation content creation and premium content at scale.

WPP also said it will continue to invest in physical production infrastructure, building on the existing Hogarth Studios network and the recent development of a major content capture and virtual production studio in London. The company said it plans to open a number of additional major studio locations globally.

According to the announcement, clients will have access to faster turnaround times, greater cost efficiency and a wider range of production solutions through the new structure.

“The launch of WPP Production is a cornerstone of our strategic vision to integrate our services, making it easier for clients to access WPP’s full spectrum of capabilities,” said Cindy Rose, CEO of WPP. “In a rapidly evolving landscape where content is king, WPP Production will be the powerhouse that enables us to be the trusted growth partner for our clients. This is about delivering exceptional value and setting new benchmarks for the quality and scale of content production worldwide.”

The transition to WPP Production will take effect on February 23rd 2026.",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2026-01/wpp-prod.T6qcK-pV.png,N,,2026-01-22 13:42:32.493528

What Happened: Oracle Network Called Undervalued

Hougan's assessment focuses on Chainlink's function as a decentralized oracle network that delivers real-world data to blockchains.

Without this technology, financial applications on distributed ledgers cannot access external information like asset prices or payment confirmations.

The executive emphasized that major financial institutions already depend on Chainlink's services.

The stablecoin sector relies on its price feeds for maintaining pegs and conducting Proof of Reserves audits.

Tokenized real-world assets—including stocks, bonds and commodities—require the oracle network for regulatory compliance and accurate settlement.

The breadth of institutional adoption supports the undervaluation thesis. SWIFT, DTCC, JPMorgan, Visa, Mastercard and Fidelity have all integrated or experimented with Chainlink's technology for cross-chain interoperability and blockchain-based settlement.

Also Read: Ethereum Reserves Hit 10-Year Low Across Exchanges As Price Falls Below $3K

Why It Matters: Infrastructure Meets Wall Street

Hougan's analysis suggests that demand for oracle services will grow exponentially as real-world asset tokenization expands and decentralized finance markets continue developing.

The network maintains dominant market share, often cited above 50% of total value secured by oracles.

The LINK token functions as both payment for data services and collateral that node operators must stake against accurate performance. This economic model ties security directly to network demand.

The convergence of institutional adoption and DeFi growth positions Chainlink's infrastructure as increasingly critical to both blockchain and traditional finance systems.

OpenAI, Anthropic, SpaceX and Stripe are among the big names said to be considering an initial public offering (IPO) this year.
Here are 10 of the companies most likely to take advantage of that enthusiasm with an IPO.
SpaceX Elon Musk’s company reportedly reached a $800bn valuation in December and is preparing to go public.
An Anduril spokesperson said “we don’t have a timeline for IPO” and called rumours about a 2026 flotation “pure speculation”.","You’ve probably heard of “unicorns” – technology startups valued at more than $1bn – but 2026 is shaping up to be the year of the “hectocorn”, with several US and European companies potentially floating on stock markets at valuations over $100bn (£75bn).

OpenAI, Anthropic, SpaceX and Stripe are among the big names said to be considering an initial public offering (IPO) this year.

The success of their flotations – whether the shares maintain their value, rise or fall – could shape concerns about the AI race and whether the resulting market mania is a bubble.

Some may have had plans to float last year that were delayed or derailed by the US federal shutdown and sweeping government job cuts hitting the market watchdog. This year is shaping up to be similarly geopolitically choppy, with Trump’s latest tariff threats against European allies over Greenland casting a shadow over shares this week.

However, despite last year’s turmoil markets soared to near-record highs on the back of the AI boom, and investors are expected to keep betting big on the technology for now. Here are 10 of the companies most likely to take advantage of that enthusiasm with an IPO.

OpenAI

The San Francisco-based company is synonymous with AI, having triggered a frenzy of public interest in the subject with the launch of the ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. It is a loss-making business but has attracted investment from big names including Microsoft and the Japanese group SoftBank, and its valuation has boomed from $29bn in 2023 to $500bn last year. If OpenAI floats it could be valued at as much as $1tn, according to Reuters.

Underpinning these numbers is a hope that demand for AI, and the transformative impact of its adoption by workplaces and individuals, more than pays back the multitrillion-dollar investment in the datacentres and computer chips that support it. OpenAI is committed to spending $1.4tn on such infrastructure over the next eight years, but must convince investors it can pay that back.

“OpenAI is clearly the single biggest test for the entire AI economy, the bubble idea and whether it’s all built on sand,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets.

Anthropic

Like OpenAI, the San Francisco-headquartered startup behind the chatbot Claude and the now wildly popular Claude Code is also yet to turn a profit. This month, the company signed a term sheet for a $10bn funding round that puts its valuation at $350bn.

If Anthropic floats, it may have ramifications that go beyond the AI race. Many of its employees are aligned with the effective altruism movement, and energetic discussion on internet forums suggests that money could pour into causes aligned with this movement if its employees cash out.

SpaceX

Elon Musk’s company reportedly reached a $800bn valuation in December and is preparing to go public. However, “whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain”, according to comments from its chief financial officer, Bret Johnsen, in a letter obtained by Reuters.

On the one hand, geopolitical volatility is likely to make the nexus between tech, aerospace and defence more appealing to investors, said Mike Bellin at PricewaterhouseCoopers. This may have ramifications for SpaceX. On the other, Elon Musk’s reputation, and that of Tesla, make the outcome of the IPO somewhat harder to predict, said Mark Moccia, an analyst at research firm Forrester, although he expects “a huge mix of institutional and retail investors”.

“SpaceX in particular is what retail investors are homing in on this year as it’s got the buzz and it’s Musk,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets.

Kraken

One of the world’s largest crypto exchanges – not to be confused with the software spin-off of the UK energy firm Octopus – Kraken submitted its paperwork for an IPO in November, and was valued roughly at $20bn. The crypto firm could face a race to float its stock before this year’s US midterm elections, say analysts, as there is a risk political changes in the US reverse Trump’s laissez-faire approach to crypto regulation.

Databricks

This company helps customers to build AI agents – tools that carry out tasks autonomously – using their own data. Its revenue grew more than 55% last year and last month it achieved a valuation of $134bn.

Ali Ghodsi, Databricks’ chief executive, says the company’s growth rate is due to businesses building “data-intensive applications that use AI”.

Canva

A bright light of Australia’s tech industry, Canva was valued last year at $A65bn, although it has moved its parent company domicile to the US in order to prepare for a flotation. The Sydney-based software design company, which calls its employees “Canvanauts”, has 240 million users and two of its co-founders – the wife and husband team Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht – are sixth on the Australian rich list, according to the Financial Review, with a combined fortune of $14bn.

A Canva spokesperson said it had “nothing to share in terms of an IPO timeline”.

Anduril

Palmer Luckey, the chief executive of the defence-tech startup, has said Anduril is “definitely going to be a publicly traded company”, but has not given a timeline. Analysts cite the company’s close ties with the Trump administration and Trump’s decision to hike military spending as factors that may push it towards an offering this year.

“Trump’s 50% increase in defence spending announcement should be the green light to go for it,” said Wilson.

An Anduril spokesperson said “we don’t have a timeline for IPO” and called rumours about a 2026 flotation “pure speculation”.

Monzo

Monzo is an online bank that operates entirely through a mobile app. It reported more than 12 million customers in 2025.

The London-based fintech – the jargon for tech firms that offer financial services like banking or payments – was reportedly working with Morgan Stanley last summer to meet investors before a 2026 IPO – but this was later complicated by the exit of its chief executive, TS Anil.

Bolt

The Estonian rival to Uber, Bolt lined up an adviser for an IPO last year. The company has had a difficult few years, however, with reported losses of more than €102m in 2024. The company is reportedly considering whether to list in the EU or the US.

A Bolt spokesperson said: “Any date for listing will depend on favourable market conditions, which remains a significant factor in determining when Bolt goes public. Our teams are working to ensure the business is ready to IPO, should market conditions be right.”

Stripe

The online payment processing company was founded by the Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison in 2010. It has headquarters in California and Dublin and has long been a cornerstone of fintech. Last year it was reported that Stripe had attained a valuation of $107bn, a bounceback from when it was valued at $50bn in 2023. A Stripe spokesperson declined to comment.

Anthropic, Kraken, Monzo, SpaceX and Databricks did not respond to requests for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52f28e3778e0def3eb14d4cf2f324385763c3788/467_0_2672_2138/master/2672.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8880a14137c62ac1f0b7024f95f4ae53",N,,2026-01-22 14:42:15.325435

Keyfactor and IBM Consulting have partnered to provide enterprises with visibility, risk management, and a structured path to modernize cryptography and prepare for post-quantum cryptography (PQC).

The joint solution combines Keyfactor’s cryptographic discovery, PKI, digital signing, and lifecycle automation with IBM Consulting’s cybersecurity expertise, governance frameworks, and quantum-safe delivery methods.

Enterprises using the solution gain automated cryptographic discovery, risk scoring and prioritization, PQC-ready PKI and signing, lifecycle automation, and governance structures aligned with NIST, EU, and global PQC guidance.

PRESS RELEASE — Keyfactor, the leader in digital trust for modern enterprises, today announced a new joint solution with IBM Consulting that gives enterprises visibility into their cryptographic assets to help reduce operational and regulatory risk, and accelerate readiness for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The joint solution combines Keyfactor’s industry-leading cryptographic discovery, PKI, digital signing, and certificate lifecycle automation capabilities with IBM Consulting’s global cybersecurity expertise, governance frameworks, and enterprise-scale quantum-safe delivery methods, accelerators, and AI-based assets.

Cryptography powers every connection, transaction, and digital interaction, yet it remains one of the most vulnerable and least understood dependencies in the modern enterprise. Certificates, keys, algorithms, protocols, and libraries span across infrastructure, networks, devices, applications, and third-party solutions, often with fragmented ownership and inconsistent controls. This lack of unified visibility leaves organizations vulnerable to outages, audit gaps, and rising security and compliance risks as quantum computing timelines accelerate. At the same time, emerging regulations and PQC guidance are increasing the pressure on enterprises to demonstrate control and modernization across their entire cryptographic landscape.

“Cryptography sits at the center of every digital interaction, yet most enterprises struggle to see or understand the full scope of their cryptographic footprint,” said Ted Shorter, Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of Keyfactor. “By combining Keyfactor’s ability to discover, automate, and modernize cryptography with IBM Consulting’s deep expertise in strategy, governance, and quantum-safe transformation, organizations get a practical, end-to-end path from cryptographic complexity to clarity and control. This partnership empowers enterprises to reduce risk today while preparing confidently for tomorrow.”

The joint solution provides enterprises with clarity, control, and a structured modernization path to transition from reactive cryptography management to a governed and automated approach to quantum-safe readiness. Joint clients can benefit from four key integrated areas:

End-to-end cryptographic discovery & inventory

Automated discovery reveals where cryptographic assets live across on-prem, cloud, hybrid, and DevOps environments, exposing blind spots and shadow cryptography. The solution enables enterprises to build a comprehensive cryptographic inventory and Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM).

Risk scoring & prioritization

By combining IBM Consulting’s business and regulatory expertise and quantum-safe transformation services, including IBM Quantum Safe Migration Orchestrator, with visibility and risk-based insights from Keyfactor, organizations gain structured risk analysis, governance models, and prioritized remediation plans.

Modern PKI, signing, and lifecycle automation

Keyfactor’s EJBCA, SignServer, and Command solutions provide PQC-ready PKI, centralized signing, and automated certificate lifecycle management — replacing manual work with policy-driven processes that strengthen security, reduce operational friction, and significantly reduce outage risk.

Governance and long-term resilience

IBM Consulting establishes scalable operating models, including cryptographic Centers of Excellence (CCoEs), governance frameworks, KPIs, and training to drive sustainable modernization and quantum-safe transformation.

Together, these components create an actionable, phased modernization path aligned to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), EU, and global PQC guidance — from initial discovery to long-term crypto-agility.

“Quantum-safe transformation is more than a cryptographic upgrade; it’s a major operational shift that requires coordination across people, processes, and technology,” said Dinesh Nagarajan, Global Partner, Cybersecurity, IBM Consulting. “Enterprises shouldn’t shoulder that journey alone. Partnering with experts who have deep cryptographic expertise and a track record of delivering complex, enterprise-wide transformations facilitates a smoother, more secure transition. Working with Keyfactor, we can help organizations uncover hidden risks, modernize their trust infrastructure, and build long-term resilience as the quantum era approaches.”

The decision came after discussions between L’Oréal’s top management and a delegation from the state government during the World Economic Forum (WEF 2026).

Reuters reported that the group will invest more than Rs35bn ($383.4m) in the facility, which is being positioned as a global base for innovation, technology, data and supply-chain operations.

The centre is expected to underpin L’Oréal’s worldwide programmes in digital transformation, AI and analytics, and to generate 2,000 technology roles by 2030.

In November 2025, L’Oréal said it would set up one of its largest global capability centres (GCCs) in Hyderabad, separate from its Indian research operations in Mumbai and Bengaluru.

At the time, the company stated that the site would support global technology, innovation and research activities for the group, and that it had begun searching for senior executives for the project, including candidates from its Paris headquarters.

L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus said the group was pleased to proceed with the development and that “tech solutions generated from the Hyderabad GCC will be supplied to our facilities all around the world”.

In a Facebook post, the Telangana delegation led by chief minister A Revanth Reddy said the project would take the form of a GCC focused on beauty technology.

Telangana IT minister D Sridhar Babu added that the state was prepared to offer full backing to international investors and pointed to Hyderabad’s growing presence as a host for GCCs across sectors such as med-tech, health-tech and hospitality.

Sanjay Kumar, special chief secretary for information technology, electronics, communications and industries, invited L’Oréal to also consider establishing manufacturing facilities in the state alongside the GCC.

According to the Facebook update from Telangana’s information and public relations department, Hieronimus responded favourably and indicated the company would examine the possibility of future investment in a production unit in Hyderabad.

Reports surfaced indicating that Peet’s Coffee (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., had been listed as an ‘executed person’ due to ongoing litigation.
Despite these challenges, JDE Peet's—the parent company formed through a merger between Jacobs Douwe Egberts and Peet's in 2019—continues to thrive on multiple fronts.
Known for housing over 50 brands including L'OR and Senseo alongside its flagship name, JDE Peet's operates across more than 100 countries worldwide.
In August 2025, Keurig Dr Pepper announced plans to acquire JDE Peet’s for €15.7 billion (approximately $17 billion).","In the bustling world of coffee, few names resonate as deeply as Peet's Coffee. Founded by Alfred Peet in 1966, this brand is often credited with igniting America’s specialty coffee movement. With its rich history and commitment to quality, Peet's has carved out a unique niche that appeals to discerning coffee lovers everywhere.

Recently, however, the company found itself navigating turbulent waters following some unsettling news regarding its operations in China. Reports surfaced indicating that Peet’s Coffee (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., had been listed as an ‘executed person’ due to ongoing litigation. This label can evoke concern among consumers and investors alike—what does it mean for such a beloved brand?

But here’s where things get interesting: shortly after these reports emerged, the information mysteriously vanished from public records. A spokesperson for Peet’s clarified that this was merely related to an active lawsuit and assured stakeholders that the situation was under control; indeed, they stated that any adverse listings were retracted once verified.

This incident highlights not only the complexities of operating within international markets but also how quickly perceptions can shift based on fleeting information. The legal landscape can be daunting for companies expanding globally—especially when dealing with different jurisdictions like China.

Despite these challenges, JDE Peet's—the parent company formed through a merger between Jacobs Douwe Egberts and Peet's in 2019—continues to thrive on multiple fronts. Known for housing over 50 brands including L'OR and Senseo alongside its flagship name, JDE Peet's operates across more than 100 countries worldwide.

The company's financial health remains robust; recent reports indicate organic sales growth of 5.3% along with significant cash flow generation—a testament to their strategic positioning within both developing and developed markets.

Moreover, exciting developments are on the horizon! In August 2025, Keurig Dr Pepper announced plans to acquire JDE Peet’s for €15.7 billion (approximately $17 billion). This acquisition will lead KDP into restructuring efforts aimed at creating two independent publicly traded entities focused solely on beverages and global coffee respectively—a move anticipated by many industry experts as beneficial given current market trends toward specialization.

It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that's still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,"" Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it's “clear our shareholders agree,"" as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner's studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner’s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount’s bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things.","NEW YORK (AP) — Skydance-owned Paramount is again extending the tender offer window in its $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that’s still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,” Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it’s “clear our shareholders agree,” as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner’s studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner’s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount’s bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

MIO: Memories in Orbit is a neon-tinged metroidvania about a nimble little robot waking up on a massive, overgrown ark called the Vessel with nothing but fractured memories and a whole lot of trouble coming its way. Dart through low-gravity corridors, chain together elegant wall-runs, glides and grapples, and tangle with rogue machines as the Vessel itself quietly steals the spotlight — moody, decaying and just alive enough to keep a few secrets.

It started several multi-year PPAs during the year, securing around 3 TWh of additional annual low-carbon electricity. This compares with 2.5 TWh signed in 2024.

The agreements are concentrated in regions with carbon-intensive power grids, including China and South Africa. In 2025, Air Liquide also signed its first PPAs in India, marking its entry into a market where electricity demand rose by nearly 75% between 2013 and 2023.

In South Africa, the company is working with chemicals and energy firm Sasol to source close to 700MW of renewable electricity for the Secunda site, described as the world’s largest oxygen production facility.

According to its 2024 figures, more than 40% of Air Liquide’s total purchased electricity now comes from low-carbon sources, including wind and solar.

Electricity sourcing is one of three pillars of the group’s decarbonisation roadmap, alongside asset optimisation to reduce energy consumption and the deployment of carbon capture and storage.

“[We aim to secure] additional low-carbon capacity on top of grid transition in geographies where we operate,” said Diana Schillag, a member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee.

The strategy is complemented by the electrification of selected air separation units. In China, the electrification of the Shaanxi ASU, combined with low-carbon power sourcing, is expected to reduce the group’s emissions by up to 550,000 tonnes per year.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, European financials were restricted by regulators on dividends and share buybacks.
“European banks were on average very well managed, lean machines before rates inflected,” Wedekind says.","European banks enjoyed a record year for returns in 2025, in which the Euro Stoxx Banks index surged 98.1%.

Financials, and banking stocks in particular, was one of a narrow collection of sectors driving European market returns as a whole last year. Given the record run, investors are beginning to ask whether the sector continue its momentum in 2026.

Portfolio Adviser asks European and global fund managers for their views on the sector moving forward.

What has driven recent returns?

The rally in European banking stocks has been stark, with the sector up over 331.7% over the five years to the end of last year.

Société Générale was the highest returning stock within the 29-holding Amundi Euro Stoxx Banks ETF last year, returning 159.28%, according to Morningstar data. Names such as Commerzbank, Banco Santander and ABM AMRO Bank also returned over 100% last year alone. Strikingly, every member of the index fund was up for the year.

The sector has enjoyed multiple tailwinds which have contributed to the run since the Covid-19 pandemic. Looking at recent financial results from last year, Marc Stacey, a senior portfolio manager within RBC Bluebay Asset Management’s investment grade team, highlights a particular trend to demonstrate the remarkable run.

“The last quarter saw the vast majority of the sector report earnings, with trends continuing in line with our bullish view on fundamentals,” he says. “Pre-provision operating profits beat on aggregate by 4%. This is the 27th quarter in a row of outperformance. This is an incredible statistic, given it’s against increasingly lofty market expectations.”

European equities more broadly have also participated in a value rally, with financials one of the key beneficiaries.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, European financials were restricted by regulators on dividends and share buybacks. These limits, combined with uncertainty around the longer-term economic impact, pushed valuations to meaningfully depressed levels, notes Allspring Global Investments global equity portfolio manager Jonathan Drexel.

“As clarity returned and restrictions were lifted, valuations reverted toward more historical norms,” he says. “Since the pandemic, European banks have significantly improved both profitability and balance sheet strength, leading to a rerating of the sector alongside renewed earnings momentum.”

However, Frank Wedekind, global equity research analyst at William Blair Investment Management, says the outperformance in European Banks is not just part of a value rally or a ‘fluke’, rather it is due to a combination of sector dynamics.

He particularly notes the fundamental lack of economic growth in Western Europe, which has forced the sector to adapt to stay competitive. Management teams have had to become more efficient, adapt their product range and, in many cases, consolidate.

The changing interest rate environment has also contributed. “European banks were on average very well managed, lean machines before rates inflected,” Wedekind says. “The higher rates then fell on very fertile ground, that dropped through to the bottom line.”

What’s the investment case from here?

Moving forward, Mirabaud Discovery Europe fund portfolio manager Hywel Franklin says the sector still offers meaningful upside, with many European financials still set to deliver 10–15% annual earnings growth alongside substantial dividend payouts.

“Valuations remain compelling, especially versus the US, where parts of the market now trade at stretched multiples,” he says.

“With Europe continuing to rebound and investor flows gradually shifting, the environment remains supportive. Well-run banks such as Credem in Italy highlight how undervaluation and strong fundamentals can coexist.”

In terms of positioning, Franklin is maintaining the fund’s exposure to the sector.

“Earnings momentum is intact, valuations remain attractive, and the sector continues to benefit from improving macro conditions. More broadly, Europe appears to be in the early stages of a re-rating cycle, and financials remain one of the clearer beneficiaries.”

Considering the re-rating that has taken place within the sector already, however, William Blair’s Wedekind says the focus from here is on being selective with exposure.

“We continue to like the space and continue to see attractive investment stories for many individual names. But, as the sector valuation is not as attractive as it has been and as many stocks are trading close to or in some cases above what we would consider as fair value, we have become a lot more selective.”

Markus Hansen, portfolio manager at Vontobel Quality Growth, adds his focus within the sector is on countries with a disciplined competitive banking market set up, such as the UK, Scandinavian nations and Greece.

“We have been tactically adding to the names we own: NatWest Group, Den Norske Bank DNB, Svenska Handelsbanken and Eurobank Ergasias.

“We also think international investors have been cautious towards European banks given the recent history and there may still be political backdrop worries, hence focus on more quality, sustainable growth names is key for us.”

“We maintain our conviction in the banks over the medium term due to their high and attractive shareholder returns and modest valuation compared to historic averages, despite the recent strong performance,” adds Brian Hall, co-manager of the BlackRock Greater Europe Investment Trust.",https://s44696.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/euro-bank-notes-V1.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 08:40:01.082892

The bank claims that it will do so not through redundancies, but by retraining existing employees and transferring them to other parts of the business.

Describing the move as “favouring internal career moves,” the bank said it will leverage “internal mobility” and “the development of employees’ skills” to support staff whose existing roles are at risk of being eliminated.

Société Générale didn’t detail the types of roles that could be affected by these changes but said that the change would occur within the framework of the measures set out in an Employment Agreement signed on in December last year with three trade unions.

The bank has proposed making the job cuts between 2026 and 2027.

These proposed job changes form part of a wider strategic roadmap being implemented by Société Générale to increase sustainability across its organisation. Announced in September 2023, the plans are aimed at simplifying operations, increasing efficiency and reskilling employees at the bank.

The latest phase of the roadmap, which includes the role net reduction proposals, is a so-called “organisational simplification” project conducted by 2,000 employees throughout all areas of the bank.

According to the bank, its employees came up with thousands of ideas to “optimise tools and procurement, simplify processes and structures, pool teams, and strengthen automation and the use of artificial intelligence”.

The bank also wants to undergo what it calls an “organisational revolution”, in which it aims to simplify the way it operates to become “more efficient” and “agile”.

The bank claims the move is to better serve clients. Société Générale said this would affect how much of its headquarters operates and how it organises retail banking regionally, though its branch network will stay the same.

When it comes to retraining staff, the organisation plans to establish a mobility and skills campus. Focused on driving internal mobility, it will be designed to help staff forge and succeed in new careers at the bank.

Attachment Liquid Carbon Dioxide Market","Dublin, Jan. 22, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Liquid Carbon Dioxide Market Report 2026"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The liquid carbon dioxide market is poised for robust growth, with the market size increasing from $6.54 billion in 2025 to an anticipated $9.23 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1%. This growth is driven by rising adoption of supercritical CO2 for sustainable processing, demand for liquid CO2 in precision cooling, and expansion in fire suppression solutions. The increased deployment of carbon capture infrastructure and advancements in liquefaction technologies are also crucial growth factors.

The food and beverage industry remains a significant driver, utilizing liquid CO2 for carbonation, refrigeration, and preservation. Statistics Canada reported in June 2025 that food and beverage sales comprised nearly one-quarter of Canada's total retail spending in 2024, highlighting rising consumer demand. This growth is further supported by technological innovations such as liquid carbon dioxide carriers, designed to optimize storage and reduce transportation costs, exemplified by Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. Ltd.'s introduction of a new carrier in 2025.

Strategic acquisitions are also shaping the market landscape. In January 2025, Alto Ingredients Inc. acquired Kodiak Carbonic LLC, a move aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and profitability through the optimized use of byproduct CO2. Such acquisitions highlight the focus on securing sustainable revenue streams and expanding market presence.

Major companies such as Linde plc, Air Liquide Deutschland GmbH, and Praxair Inc. are leading innovations across various applications from food and beverage processing to metal fabrication and pharmaceuticals. North America was the largest market in 2025, but Asia-Pacific is expected to lead growth through the forecast period, reflecting the dynamic regional shifts within the industry.

However, the market faces challenges from global trade relations and tariffs, potentially reshaping dynamics by increasing import costs for industrial gases and related equipment. These factors have prompted local manufacturers to bolster regional capacities, enhancing supply security and competitiveness amid rising international costs.

Overall, the liquid carbon dioxide market offers considerable opportunities for growth and innovation. With advancements across multiple sectors and strategic actions by key players, the market is set to thrive despite potential geopolitical challenges. This market analysis provides a comprehensive exploration of current trends, future opportunities, and strategic insights for stakeholders invested in the future of the liquid carbon dioxide industry.

What This Activity Could Signal for Medtronic Investors

The BCI partnership with Precision Neuroscience and the planned stake of up to US$90 million in Anteris point to Medtronic leaning further into neurosurgery and structural heart devices that are still early in their commercial journey. For you as an investor, it highlights that management is prepared to allocate capital to higher complexity procedures that could deepen Medtronic’s role in brain and heart interventions if clinical and regulatory progress stays on track.

How This Fits Into The Medtronic Narrative

Recent moves, including the spin off plan for the diabetes unit, regulatory clearance for the Hugo robotic surgery system, and now investments in BCI and transcatheter valves, all point to a tighter focus on hospital based B2B technologies. For investors who already view Medtronic as a broad medtech platform, this news can reinforce a story that is tilting more toward advanced surgery, neuroscience, and cardiology, while still backed by a long record of dividend increases.

Risks and Rewards To Keep In Mind

BCI integration with the StealthStation system and exposure to a new transcatheter valve could expand Medtronic’s addressable procedures in neurosurgery and structural heart care.

Management is supporting these bets from a position that screens as good value and with a dividend that has risen for 48 consecutive years, which some income focused investors may appreciate.

Clinical and regulatory timelines for both BCI systems and aortic valve devices can be long and uncertain, so payoffs may be uneven or delayed versus expectations.

More capital tied to new technologies adds execution risk, particularly if competitors move quickly or trial results and reimbursement decisions do not support broad adoption.

What To Watch Next

From here, the key things to track are progress in the PARADIGM trial for Anteris, clinical integration of Precision’s Layer 7 interface with StealthStation in real world neurosurgical workflows, and any updates around the diabetes spin off and Hugo robotic rollout, as these all shape how concentrated Medtronic’s future earnings mix becomes.

Summary

I conduct a comprehensive technical scan of all S&P 500 stocks to gauge macro market trends and sector rotation.

Current ETF analysis highlights DIA, QQQ, and SPY, with special attention to the democratization trend beyond the top 50 stocks.

RSP is rallying but has only recovered recent underperformance versus XLG; the sustainability of smaller stock outperformance remains uncertain.

Out of 500 S&P 500 stocks, I found only 15 to list that I'd say have ""good"" charts. Most of the rest are either high risk or going nowhere.

ICEYE satellite data will be used to monitor floods, fires and storms as it expands predictive risk services.

AXA DCP, which uses AI to assess threats, said the satellite data will be applied across areas including natural catastrophes, cybercrime and geopolitical risk analysis.

AXA DCP CEO Pierre du Rostu said: “We are responding to the challenge of the polycrisis by evolving. Our goal is to make use of the very best solutions available to move beyond response to prediction and prevention.

“ICEYE is a world leader in monitoring natural catastrophes and provides the real-time insights our clients require even when it is dark, when there are clouds, when there is dust, smoke, or volcanic ash.”

ICEYE runs what it describes as the world’s “largest” constellation of SAR microsatellites, providing imagery to governments, defence organisations, intelligence bodies and commercial clients.

Its satellites are capable of near real-time observation regardless of weather or daylight, offering global coverage, frequent revisit rates and image resolution of around 25cm, the press statement read.

The company also merges SAR imagery with other intelligence sources to produce flood analytics, which will now feed into AXA DCP’s platform.

AXA DCP said the agreement supports its shift towards greater emphasis on prediction and prevention, helping customers anticipate disruptive events and limit potential damage.

It added that the collaboration is intended to strengthen AXA DCP’s capacity to evaluate and manage weather-related exposures through satellite-derived insights.

ICEYE Solutions senior vice-president Stephen Lathrope added: “Scaling access to ICEYE’s advanced SAR technology through AXA DCP is a transformative step for the insurance and risk management sector. It enables organisations to harness cutting-edge innovation at scale, unlock new insights, and fundamentally change how they prepare for, respond to and recover from catastrophic events.”",https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2026/01/shutterstock_2655645491.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 05:59:55.260706

Yet, Trump has made several moves that critics view as pressure on the central bank to go along with his wishes for lower interest rates.
U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, has pushed for continued Fed independence, even as he remains aligned with Trump on the need for lower rates.

In his quest to gain more control over the Fed, Trump will have to jump though hoops in the Supreme Court and Congress while stomaching discontent from Wall Street, a tall task even for a president accustomed to blowing past rules and norms.

“The defenses against presidential intrusion are multilayered and very well designed,” said Gary Richardson, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, and the Fed’s historian from 2012 to 2016.

Trump is on a campaign to get the Fed to slash the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight, which influences the interest rates consumers pay on credit cards, mortgages and car loans.

It currently sits between 3.5% and 3.75%, putting a slight damper on spending to keep inflation manageable.

The president told The Wall Street Journal in December he’d like that figure to fall to “1% and maybe lower than that.” He’s also insulted Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a “moron” and a “stubborn mule,” among other critical remarks, for supporting only slight reductions in interest rates.

Supply and demand

Bringing rates down fast likely would juice the economy in the short term while sowing long-run cost hikes, according to John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst at Oxford Economics. That may be a fine trade-off to term-limited presidents looking to project strength, but it’s a bad outcome in the view of economists.

“When demand exceeds supply, you get inflation,” Canavan said. “If rates are kept too low, the economy will overheat.”

Unduly cutting rates also would violate the Fed’s congressional mandate to pursue stable prices and maximum employment regardless of the political climate.

Yet, Trump has made several moves that critics view as pressure on the central bank to go along with his wishes for lower interest rates.

In August, he tried to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud. She has not been charged and denies the claims.

Cook sued the government in response, arguing the law only allows presidents to dismiss Fed officials “for cause.” The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case Wednesday and seemed to favor keeping Cook in her job, although a decision likely won’t come until the summer.

A ruling favorable to the Trump administration would eliminate evidence of wrongdoing as an obstacle to remaking the Fed’s seven-member board of governors.

“If an allegation alone is enough to define cause for removal, then that could be done to anybody sitting on the board,” said Loretta Mester, a University of Pennsylvania finance professor and head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland from 2014 to 2024.

The Cleveland district covers Western Pennsylvania along with Ohio, eastern Kentucky and the West Virginia panhandle. Its current head, Beth Hammack, declined to comment.

Powell is also the subject of a criminal investigation related to cost overruns during renovations at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. The Department of Justice issued subpoenas Jan. 9 related to the probe, which Trump said he has no knowledge of and Powell has dismissed as politically motivated.

Even with the Supreme Court on his side, the Senate could stop Trump from handpicking Fed governors, which typically serve staggered 14-year terms.

Lawmakers have thrown up red flags, including many Democrats and several Republicans. U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has said he won’t vote on any Fed nominees until the legal matter with Cook is resolved.

U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, has pushed for continued Fed independence, even as he remains aligned with Trump on the need for lower rates.

Speaking with bankers in Juniata County last week, McCormick said he finds it “very hard to believe that Chairman Powell was involved in anything criminal.”

Presidential resistance

It’s a common impulse among presidents to resent Fed independence.

Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Richard Nixon all mounted attempts to influence the central bank’s key interest rate in their day.

Roosevelt was the most successful, but only because he got Congress to change the law, according to Richardson. None have leaned on the courts and personal threats against Fed members as heavily as Trump, he said.

Market reactions also could restrain Trump in his bid to chip away at Fed independence.

Rising long-term bond yields would be one sign that investors fear the central bank’s decision-making could become clouded by politics. That happened to only a limited extent following news of the Powell investigation.

“That may be because the reaction was so strong by the political class that Wall Street was reasonably assured that there’s not going to be much of a challenge to independence,” said Chester Spatt, a finance professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

But the topic is clearly on the minds of prominent bankers.

Robin Vince, CEO of BNY Mellon, has warned the erosion of Fed independence could be “counterproductive” to the Trump administration’s efforts to lower the cost of living.

“Questioning one of the tenets that underlies the bond market runs the risk of doing the opposite — pushing interest rates higher — because markets may feel they have to worry about something they frankly shouldn’t have to worry about,” Vince said on a call with reporters last week.

Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan Chase, has made similar comments, prompting Trump to say he’ll be suing the company for “debanking him” after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.

PNC Bank declined to make an executive available for an interview.

Political conflict aside, many economists believe the Fed should hold firm on the interest rate, for now. Inflation clocked in at 2.7% last month, reflecting a jump in prices compared to December 2024.

The Fed typically targets a 2% rate of inflation.

“I haven’t been convinced by the data I’ve seen that it’s on its way back down to 2%,” Mester said. “I think they’re in a good spot. This is a good time to just wait.”",https://storage.googleapis.com/ownlocal-adforge-production/articles/external/600/722da09b-bc8b-4baa-a75a-1e5cd6c56e57.webp,N,,2026-01-22 06:39:07.539757

The round was co-led by New York-based Thrive Capital and DST Global, bringing total disclosed funding to roughly $700 million, according to company statements and industry reports.

In the second half of 2025, OpenEvidence had secured a $200 million funding round at a $6 billion valuation. The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from top-tier venture firms including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Blackstone, Thrive Capital, Coatue Management, Bond and Craft.

Founded in 2022 by Daniel Nadler, who previously founded an AI start-up that was sold to S&P Global for $550 million, and Zachary Ziegler, OpenEvidence has rapidly established itself as an indispensable tool for physicians and nurses by serving as what many users describe as “ChatGPT for medicine.” Its AI is trained on authoritative medical journals such as JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine, enabling clinicians to access verified, evidence-based answers swiftly to support patient treatment decisions. The platform is offered free to verified medical professionals, supported through advertising revenue, and has expanded to more than 10,000 hospitals and medical centers nationwide.

“Without a technology like OpenEvidence, doctors may miss critical new findings or guidelines simply because they lack the time to find them,” said Nadler. “Doctors want to provide the best care to patients. OpenEvidence is the tool that safely allows them to do that. Our mission is to help doctors save lives and improve patient care.” The company also said a recent independent study by Offcall showed that OpenEvidence is used by more American physicians than all other AI tools for physicians combined.

OpenEvidence’s user metrics have been cited repeatedly by company spokespeople and business press: roughly 40%-45% of U.S. physicians now use the platform, which the company says reaches more than 10,000 hospitals and medical centers. Usage escalated sharply through 2025, with reports that the platform processed about 18 million clinical consultations in December, up from a few million per month a year earlier.

The company says it generates revenue primarily through advertising and reported more than $100 million in annualized revenue, driven largely by organic adoption and physician-to-physician referrals, and up to 30% month-on-month growth. OpenEvidence has emphasizes a high retention and referral rate, claiming that 95% of new users learn about the app from other doctors. Those figures are part of the company’s pitch to investors that a physician-first product can scale without enterprise sales teams.

Nadler has framed OpenEvidence as purpose-built for clinicians while drawing a contrast with products based on generalist large language (LLM) models. “If you only squint from a distance, OpenEvidence is ‘ChatGPT’ for doctors. If you look closely, it’s a very different organism,” Nadler told New York Post.

Uber is betting big on India’s growing appetite for premium mobility, announcing plans to double the fleet size of its Uber Black service in 2026 as it expands the availability of luxury rides across Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

The expansion marks a sharpened focus on high-end urban commuters willing to pay more for comfort, reliability and top-rated drivers, even as India remains one of the world’s most price-sensitive ride-hailing markets.

Uber Black, positioned as the “business class” of Uber’s offerings, currently operates in the three metros with a curated fleet of high-quality vehicles and drivers. The company said the service has seen strong demand from riders seeking elevated service standards, particularly for airport travel and business use.

As part of the push, Uber has set up dedicated Uber Black pickup zones at major airports, including Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport (Terminals 1 and 2) and Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (Terminal 2). The premium zones are designed to offer faster, more seamless pickups using luxury vehicles.

To support the scale-up, Uber said it has made a Series A investment in Carrum, a fleet management firm backed by the CarDekho Group. Carrum has been a long-standing fleet partner for Uber in India, and the investment will be used to expand its vehicle base and operational capacity.

Live Events

""We’re witnessing strong demand for premium mobility in India, driven by riders who value comfort and elevated service standards,"" said Prabhjeet Singh, President, Uber India and South Asia.

Uber has also rolled out its Reserve feature on Uber Black in Delhi, allowing riders to pre-book premium rides from two hours up to 90 days in advance — a move aimed at frequent flyers and corporate users who value certainty.

As competition intensifies in India’s ride-hailing market, Uber’s premium push suggests the company is looking beyond scale alone — betting that a slice of India’s fast-growing urban middle and upper-middle class is ready to pay extra for reliability, comfort and a smoother ride.

India, a key growth market

The expansion underlines India’s importance to Uber at a time when the company is sharpening its focus on profitability and higher-value services globally. While Uber built its scale in India on mass-market offerings such as autos, bikes and budget cars, premium products like Uber Black signal a maturing urban customer base and rising discretionary spending in large cities.

Uber entered India in 2013 and now operates across 125 cities, offering services that range from two-wheelers and autos to cars, transit tickets and intercity travel.

Alongside premium rides, Uber is also seeing traction for Uber One, its paid membership programme that offers savings across multiple mobility options. The company said more than one million riders in India are already enrolled, reflecting growing loyalty among frequent users.

This also allows Air Liquide to provide its customers with gases with a lower carbon footprint, thereby supporting their own decarbonization goals.
Air Liquide sources more than 40%1 of its total purchased power from low-carbon sources, underscoring its commitment to structurally transforming its energy mix on a global scale.","Air Liquide confirms the effectiveness of its voluntary low-carbon electricity sourcing program, a core lever of its Climate Transition Plan, delivering concrete and impactful results. In 2025, significant 3 TWh per year multi-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) were started, securing its long term decarbonization trajectory.

This proactive approach is particularly focused on geographies with carbon intensive power grids to maximize emission reduction and impact, such as China and South Africa. In 2025, the Group also signed its first PPAs in India, covering a new geography with a highly carbon-intensive energy mix.

Since 2020, as part of its Climate objectives, the Group has signed PPAs that represent a total reduction of 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year, with full ramp-up expected by 2027. This also allows Air Liquide to provide its customers with gases with a lower carbon footprint, thereby supporting their own decarbonization goals.

Air Liquide sources more than 40%1 of its total purchased power from low-carbon sources, underscoring its commitment to structurally transforming its energy mix on a global scale. The sourcing of massive amounts of low-carbon electricity is one of the three levers of its decarbonization roadmap, which also includes asset management to reduce energy consumption, but also carbon capture and storage.

This sourcing approach is further complemented by the electrification of the few remaining non-electrified Air Separation Units (ASUs). For example, the electrification of the Shaanxi ASU announced in December 2025 combined with low-carbon energy sourcing are projected to yield a significant annual reduction of the Group’s emissions by up to 550,000 tonnes.

Diana Schillag, member of Air Liquide's Executive Committee notably in charge of Sustainable Development, stated:

“The ongoing deployment of our voluntary low-carbon electricity sourcing program is concrete evidence of our commitment to transforming our energy mix, securing additional low-carbon capacity on top of grid transition in geographies where we operate. Our goal is to maximize the impact of our actions on overall emissions reduction. It highlights the Group’s agility in using the best levers at hand to lower emissions as effectively as possible, particularly in carbon-intensive countries, while providing our customers with low-carbon solutions and supporting their own decarbonization efforts.”

The leather-clad CEO said this during the first episode of the “A Bit Personal with Jodi Shelton” podcast, wherein Shelton asked him where he gets his confidence.
Shelton is a self-proclaimed ""longtime leader in the global semiconductor industry,"" and is also the CEO and co-founder of the Global Semiconductor Alliance.
“By the way, Morris will be happy to know Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer now.” The AI GPU company was once TSMC’s top customer in the early 2000s.
But if the AI bubble pops and we’re left with a lot of AI data centers with no customers, then we expect Apple to retake its position as TSMC’s number one customer.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said in an interview that Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer at the moment, dethroning Apple, which has previously held the record for some time. The leather-clad CEO said this during the first episode of the “A Bit Personal with Jodi Shelton” podcast, wherein Shelton asked him where he gets his confidence. Shelton is a self-proclaimed ""longtime leader in the global semiconductor industry,"" and is also the CEO and co-founder of the Global Semiconductor Alliance.

“I remember Morris Chang has a similar story when he first met you, that you immediately said, ‘I’m going to be your biggest customer or one of your biggest customers. And he’s like, ‘Wow, that’s a lot of gumption.’ So, where did that confidence come from at such an early age?” Shelton asked. “Well, you know, it’s rough to know everything — I’m just kidding,” Jensen said with a laugh. “By the way, Morris will be happy to know Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer now.”

The AI GPU company was once TSMC’s top customer in the early 2000s. However, it was overtaken during the 2010s by Apple when TSMC took it on as a customer to build the iPhone and iPad processors, after Intel fumbled the potential partnership with Cupertino. This was especially true during recent years when the iPhone overtook Samsung in market share across the globe.

But even if Apple’s smartphones, tablets, and even the legendary Apple silicon on Macs and MacBooks are driving record sales for the company, the AI boom is also pushing demand for Nvidia’s AI GPUs, resulting in skyrocketing revenue for the company. More than that, enterprise customers are willing to pay billions and billions to Team Green to get as many AI processors as they can, whereas many consumers have a price ceiling after which they will go with another brand if a smartphone, tablet, or laptop is priced too high.

Aside from losing its top spot, there are also rumors — reported by WCCFTech from the Apple leaker Fixed Focus Digital — that TSMC is hiking up the prices it’s charging Apple for chips, especially as the AI demand is squeezing capacity for other semiconductors. Furthermore, Cupertino might no longer have production priority. However, this is just speculation, and even if it’s true, the companies will likely keep information like this confidential.

Nvidia’s success is directly tied to the AI hype, with many tech companies pouring money into acquiring thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of GPUs just to get the horsepower to train the most advanced models. And with Team Green cornering the market for AI processors, it’s basically printing cash as long as companies feel that they can make more money by adding more computing power. But if the AI bubble pops and we’re left with a lot of AI data centers with no customers, then we expect Apple to retake its position as TSMC’s number one customer.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmoK3D8rdHXmLPVrrh8tTk-2000-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 03:38:27.180915

Amid intensifying competition pressures across its core creative markets, analyst sentiment surrounding Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) remains cautious. On January 14, 2026, Baird reduced its price target on the stock from $410.00 to $350.00, while reiterating a ‘Neutral’ rating.

The cautious sentiment was reinforced on January 9, 2026, when BMO Capital downgraded Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from ‘Outperform’ to ‘Market Perform’ and reduced its target from $400.00 to $375.00. While acknowledging that competition among smaller businesses, students, and freelancers remains heightened, the investment firm believes the stock appears reasonably priced. However, the firm expects the shares to remain range-bound due to the lack of near-term catalysts.

Some analysts also hold a bearish stance. On January 12, 2026, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), assigning a ‘Sell’ rating with a $290.00 price target. The investment bank attributed its sentiment to growth slowing down among high-end users and the company’s limited exposure to the growing, budget-conscious segment.

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) leverages its Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing segments to provide digital marketing and media solutions. With its offerings, the company enables content creation, customer experience optimization, and digital collaboration worldwide.

Donald was born on March 18, 1938, in Albany, New York, to Jay and Beatrice Dillenbeck. He spent his childhood on a farm in Greene, New York, where he developed a lifelong love of land, hard work, and self-reliance.

On June 29, 1957, he married Rose Ann Snitchler at the Binghamton Pilgrim Holiness Church. Their marriage was a true partnership that spanned nearly seven decades and was marked by shared work, adventure, and devotion.

Donald and Rose raised four children: Judy Dillenbeck; Donna (Robert) Dunning; Denise (Mark Goodenberger) Dillenbeck, and Donald (Marlena) Dillenbeck Jr. He was a proud grandfather to eleven grandchildren and a great-grandfather to seven great-grandchildren.

He is survived by his sister, Joyce Knefley, and her husband, Michael. He was predeceased by his brothers Jay, David, and Mark.

From 1956 through 1987, Donald worked as an engineer at IBM in Glendale, Endicott, and Owego, New York. After retiring from IBM, he continued a life of purposeful work, including driving school buses for the Johnson City School District, managing receiving and maintenance at The Bon Ton department store at the Oakdale Mall, driving buses in Denali National Park, driving trucks for the American Red Cross and Midstate Litho, and working on various construction projects over the years. In his later years, he devoted himself to managing and caring for the woodland and farming acreage he and Rose called home.

Donald possessed a meticulous, engineering-minded approach to every project he undertook. He was always ready to help neighbors, assisting with road clearing after Hurricane Irene in 2011, volunteering more than 800 hours at Endicott Nazarene Church following the 2001 flood, and contributing to maintenance and building projects at Community Bible Church in Binghamton. A true pioneer at heart, he built his home with his own hands alongside Rose. Together, they shared adventures across the country, including working in Denali National Park, a cherished highlight.

Donald found deep joy in caring for his land and watching wildlife pass through it. A faithful and loyal husband, he took great pleasure in working side by side with Rose throughout their life together. He passed away at home after a day spent doing what he loved—working on the land that meant so much to him.

A funeral service will be held on Saturday, January 24, at 11:00 a.m. at Community Bible Church, 602 Chenango Street, Binghamton. The family will receive friends on Saturday at 10:00 am until the time of the service.

Barclays has said it has initiated plans to relocate its European headquarters from Dublin to Paris.

The banking giant said it was “confident this is the right step forward” in its efforts to be strategically closer to growing markets.

The move from the Irish to the French capital is not likely to be completed until the first half of 2027, and is subject to approval by regulators.

It is understood to be expected to have a minimal impact on staff in Ireland.

Barclays shifted billions of pounds worth of assets to Dublin and increased the size of its workforce in the city in the wake of Brexit.

But it first raised the possibility in 2023 of it relocating the European base to Paris which has blossomed into a trading hub for the bank.

The shift is expected to bring the bulk of its decision-making closer to the majority of its investment banking activity on the continent.

Francesco Ceccato, the chief executive of Barclays Europe, described the move as a “strategic milestone” that will help it better meet the needs of its clients.

“After extensive discussions at all levels of the organisation, we are confident this is the right step forward – both for the entity and for our clients,” he said.

The disclosure arrived only months after Kraft Heinz announced plans to split into two public companies and was met with immediate market pressure, sending the shares sharply lower in early New York trading.

The filing reflects a gradual but deliberate pullback by Berkshire after years of frustration with the investment's performance. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has previously said the 2015 merger that created Kraft Heinz did not unfold as hoped and voiced disappointment last year when the company opted to separate. Berkshire, which partnered with 3G Capital to back the original deal, has already taken steps to unwind its involvement, giving up board seats in May and recording a $3.8 billion impairment charge in August to reflect the stock's decline. At the time, some analysts suggested the writedown could open the door to a full exit, a view that now appears increasingly relevant.

For Kraft Heinz, the potential overhang comes during a period of strategic reset following years of underperformance. After the stock fell 21% last year, lagging the S&P 500 Index's 16% gain, the company announced in September that it would unwind its $46 billion mega-merger by separating into two businesses. One entity will house faster-growing global brands such as Heinz ketchup and other condiments, generating $15.4 billion in annual sales, while the other will include slower-growing grocery products like Oscar Mayer and Lunchables, which currently produce $10.4 billion in revenue. The split is expected to be completed in the second half of this year, alongside a leadership change and a renewed effort to simplify the corporate structure and sharpen capital allocation, though investor sentiment could remain sensitive as Berkshire's next move takes shape.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 12:40:54.586246

""This contract secures 300 highly skilled jobs at Leonardo's Edinburgh site, and 100 at our Luton site.","(Alliance News) - UK Defence Secretary John Healey is set to announce a GBP453 million investment to fit Typhoon fighter jets with ""cutting-edge"" radar systems, securing up to 1,300 jobs.

The Defence Secretary is visiting the Edinburgh site of Rome-based Leonardo Spa's UK subsidiary on Thursday morning, where he will confirm the award of a contract to upgrade the Royal Air Force's Typhoon fleet.

Under the new contract, defence firms including London-based BAE Systems PLC, Leonardo UK and Cleveland, Ohio-based Parker-Hannifin Corp subsidiary Parker Meggitt will equip the aircraft with state-of-the-art radar systems over the coming years.

In addition to securing 300 skilled roles in Edinburgh, the work will secure 120 jobs in Lancashire and more than 100 in Luton.

In all, the full Typhoon programme supports more than 20,000 jobs across 330 UK companies.

The announcement comes amid growing pressure on Nato as a result of US President Donald Trump's stated intention to acquire Greenland.

Healey said: ""Our Typhoon fleet is the backbone of UK and Nato air defence, operated across Europe by the Royal Air Force and our allies to protect our skies and security.

""As the threats we face increase, and as Russian drones continue to strike Ukraine and violate Nato airspace, this cutting-edge radar capability will keep Britain secure at home and strong abroad for many years to come.

""In Edinburgh and across the UK, we're backing more than 20,000 skilled workers on the Typhoon programme who ensure our RAF remains ready to protect Britain.

Earlier this week, the government announced a GBP205 million contract for the long-term provision of specialist Typhoon engineering support by QinetiQ Group PLC.

It said this week's combined investment shows defence is an ""engine for growth"" that can create skilled jobs and strengthen national security.

Healey added: ""Our government has backed their high-skilled work with more than GBP650 million of investment this week alone, securing British jobs and making defence an engine for growth in Scotland and beyond.

""This massive workforce will be sustained for years following the biggest fighter jet exports deal in a generation, worth GBP8 billion which we secured with Turkiye in October.""

The latest contract will see 40 advanced European Common Radar System Mk2 radars fitted to RAF Typhoons, including 38 new systems and modifications to two test systems.

The radars will simultaneously detect, identify and track multiple targets in the air and on the ground.

The government said the technology will ensure the RAF maintains its operational advantage in contested environments by providing high-powered jamming capability whilst engaging targets beyond the reach of threats.

Scotland Secretary Douglas Alexander said: ""This GBP453 million contract award to build state-of-the-art radar systems for Typhoon fighter jets shows just how vital Scottish expertise is to the UK's national security, and why Scotland is globally recognised as a centre of defence excellence.

""This upgrade to the RAF fleet – sustaining 300 jobs at Leonardo in Edinburgh and many more in the supply chain – is the latest in an impressive line of defence dividend wins for Scotland.

""The UK government is transforming our defence sector into an even more powerful engine for growth, because when we back our service personnel and Scottish industry, we keep ourselves and our allies secure whilst delivering skilled jobs and growth for communities and workers.""

Mark Stead, senior vice-president of radar and advanced targeting at Leonardo UK, said: ""ECRS Mk2 isn't just an exceptional radar – it's equipped with advanced electronic surveillance and electronic attack capabilities which will make RAF's Typhoons more potent against their adversaries, adapting to new and unpredictable threats.

""This contract secures 300 highly skilled jobs at Leonardo's Edinburgh site, and 100 at our Luton site.

""As well as supporting over 71 UK-based suppliers, we hope ECRS Mk2 will see wider adoption by other Typhoon export users given its advanced capabilities against current and future threats.""

The UK government committed to continue upgrading RAF Typhoons as part of its strategic defence review, and the planes are set to continue protecting British skies until at least the 2040s.

With thousands of sponsor-backed firms spread across sectors and geographies, most deal teams are forced to react after the market moves.

Investors, bankers, and service providers struggle to know which private companies are gearing up for a transaction or capital raise. Signals are scattered, opaque, and nearly impossible to track across thousands of PE- and VC-backed businesses.

Dakota centralizes those signals (holding periods, funding rounds, platform acquisition dates, ownership changes, and exit timing patterns) into one predictive transaction-readiness tool. Instead of waiting for headlines, users can see which companies are showing the strongest likelihood of pursuing a sale, recapitalization, or new financing before the market knows.

Below is today’s list of five PE- or VC-backed companies that, based on their hold period, financing stage, and last transaction date, appear to be credible candidates for a sale or next-round raise.

Nothing is guaranteed, but these companies fall squarely within the timing windows where sponsors typically look to generate liquidity or secure additional capital.

Sector: Financials

Industry: Insurance

Last known transaction date: Seed, $4.7M, announced in March 2025

Major sponsors/backers: Led by Fika Ventures, with participation from TTV Capital and Dash Fund

Why timing suggests a near-term transaction: With a seed round completed in March 2025, Outmarket AI is entering the typical 12–18 month window when early-stage insurance technology companies begin pursuing follow-on capital. As product adoption, carrier or broker engagement, and early revenue signals take shape, this period often aligns with a seed extension, Series A raise, or strategic minority investment from industry-focused partners.

Major sponsors/backers: Led by Cambridge Innovation Capital and SV Health Investors’ Dementia Discovery Fund, with participation from M Ventures, Pfizer Ventures, Eli Lilly and Company, MP Healthcare Venture Management, Cambridge Enterprise Ventures, and Start Codon

Why timing suggests a near-term transaction: Following a sizable $31M seed round in March 2025, TRIMTECH Therapeutics is entering the period when well-capitalized early-stage pharma companies often begin advancing key preclinical milestones. As data readouts, IND preparation, or strategic partnering discussions progress, this stage frequently aligns with a Series A raise or a strategic investment from larger pharmaceutical or biotech partners.

3. Ataraxis

Ataraxis AI is a New York-based company specializing in AI-driven precision medicine for oncology. Their flagship product, Ataraxis Breast, is the first AI-native prognostic test for breast cancer, aiming to enhance treatment selection and patient outcomes by integrating multi-modal data.

Major sponsors/backers: Led by AIX Ventures with participation from Thiel Bio, Founders Fund, Bertelsmann Investments, Giant Ventures, Obvious Ventures, and angel investors including Mario Schlosser and Ryan Fukushima

Why timing suggests a near-term transaction: After raising a $20.4M Series A in March 2025, Ataraxis is entering the typical 18–24 month window when healthcare technology companies begin evaluating their next capital step. As clinical adoption, product validation, and revenue visibility improve, this stage often aligns with a Series B raise or a strategic minority investment from healthcare systems, payers, or industry partners looking to support scaled deployment.

Why timing suggests a near-term transaction: After closing a $23.5M Series A in March 2025, Auxia is entering the typical 18–24 month post-raise window when software companies begin preparing for their next financing. As enterprise adoption, revenue scaling, and product expansion funded by the Series A mature, this period often aligns with a Series B raise or a strategic minority investment to accelerate go-to-market execution.

George Noble says 'the low-hanging fruit is gone'

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pictured on February 3, 2025. Ex-Fidelity manager George Noble says the AI researcher is ""falling apart in real time.""

Bearing the brunt of Tuesday's steep 2% retreat in the S&P 500 was tech, as the Magnificent 7 shed a collective $683 billion in market cap, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Our call of the day from ex-Fidelity manager George Noble warns of an ""astronomical"" risk profile from adjacent investment plays to AI researcher and developer OpenAI.

Flagging his post on X was ""The Big Short's"" Michael Burry, a steady critic of the AI boom who shot to fame for accurately calling the housing bust. ""This is not surprising and will not end with OpenAI,"" he said of Noble's post.

A respected Wall Street veteran, Noble's career began in the early 1980s at Fidelity, where he worked alongside legendary investor Peter Lynch and ran the company's first international fund, the Fidelity Overseas Fund FOSFX, which was the No. 1 fund in the U.S. for several years. He also launched two billion-dollar hedge funds.

Noble's Monday post - ""OPENAI IS FALLING APART IN REAL TIME"" (yes, all caps) - is a rundown of the warning signs he sees over OpenAI, such as rising competition and falling traffic for ChatGPT. He also flags its heavy losses, quoting Deutsche Bank estimates that the company would see $143 billion in cumulative negative cash flow before turning a profit.

""I've watched companies implode for decades. This one has all the warning signs,"" he wrote.

Noble said there's been little discussion of the vast energy needed to keep these AI companies going, saying it will cost five times the energy and money to make models two times better.

""The low-hanging fruit is gone. Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more computer, more data centers, more power,"" said Noble. Add to that its failures with GPT-5, a ""talent exodus,"" and then a lawsuit by Elon Musk, he said.

""Here's what I think happens next: The AI hype cycle is peaking. The diminishing returns are becoming impossible to hide. Competitors are catching up,"" he said.

""OpenAI needs to generate $200 billion in annual revenue by 2030 to justify their projections. That's 15x growth in five years while costs keep exploding,"" said Noble.

He sees high risk in AI adjacent plays, warning that valuations are way too elevated. ""If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming. The gap between promised revolution and delivered reality has never been wider,"" he says.

""The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals. Small and midcaps are trading near decade lows relative to Big Tech while earnings growth is only marginally lower,"" he said. ""Markets can price risk, but they can't price chaos.""

Echoing concerns by others over the U.S.-Greenland feud, Noble wrote in a separate post on X that Big Tech is in trouble if Europe rolls out its Anti-Coercion Instrument or ""trade bazooka.""

""$108 billion in counter-tariffs. Plus restrictions on U.S. services, procurement access, regulatory approvals, and IP protections. This hits Big Tech, financial services, and the digital economy where U.S. dominance actually lives,"" he said.

""Smart money is repositioning: Trimming U.S. large-caps. Adding gold and silver. Building positions that don't require transatlantic trade stability. Again: NOT because Greenland matters... But because when foreign policy becomes a domestic political release valve, and trade partners respond with credibility wars instead of negotiations, you're in uncharted territory,"" he said.

In May 2024, Noble told Fox News that gold was a ""suitable replacement for bonds,"" because the U.S. was ""spending money like drunken sailors."" He flagged SPDR Gold Shares GLD and VanEck Gold Miners ETF GDX at the time as inflation hedges.

In a separate interview in May 2025, he discussed his bearish view on Mag 7 stocks, which would go on to rally following the Liberation Day selloff.

Finally, foreign investors holding of U.S. stocks jumped to a record $20.8 trillion in the period.

Over a longer horizon, the 1-year total shareholder return of 49.45% and 5-year total shareholder return of 305.66% point to strong compounding. This may indicate that positive momentum has been building rather than fading.

If this kind of boardroom shift has caught your attention, it could be a good moment to broaden your search and check out .

With Ralph Lauren trading at $369.58, sitting about 5% below the average analyst price target and following years of strong shareholder returns, investors may ask whether there is still a buying opportunity or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Price to Earnings of 26.2x: Is it justified?

Ralph Lauren shares last closed at $369.58, and the company is trading on a P/E of 26.2x, which screens as expensive against some benchmarks, despite strong recent returns.

The P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share, so at 26.2x, investors are paying a relatively higher price for each dollar of earnings. For a consumer durables and luxury brand like Ralph Lauren, this often reflects what the market is willing to pay for its profitability profile and brand strength rather than just current earnings alone.

On one hand, Ralph Lauren is described as expensive versus its estimated fair P/E of 18.6x, a level the market could potentially move toward if sentiment cools. On the other hand, the same 26.2x P/E is labelled good value against a peer average of 48.2x, suggesting investors are paying a lower earnings multiple than for some other luxury names even though Ralph Lauren shows high quality earnings and a 33.1% return on equity.

Compared with the broader US Luxury industry, Ralph Lauren’s 26.2x P/E is higher than the industry average of 19.6x, which is a strong premium. That premium sits alongside its high return on equity and recent profit growth, so the market appears willing to pay more for Ralph Lauren’s earnings than for the typical luxury peer.

Result: Price-to-Earnings of 26.2x (OVERVALUED)

However, you also have to weigh risks, such as any slowdown in annual revenue or net income growth or a shift in luxury spending that pressures earnings.

Another View: Cash Flows Point To A Rich Price

Our DCF model takes a different angle by focusing on Ralph Lauren's future cash flows rather than today’s earnings multiple. On this view, the current share price of $369.58 sits above an estimated value of $295.08, which flags the stock as overvalued on cash flow assumptions.

That gap suggests less room for error if growth or margins come in below expectations. It also raises a simple question for you as an investor: are you comfortable paying a premium today for a business the SWS DCF model values lower on its own numbers?

From 31 March 2026, HMRC and Companies House will permanently close their free joint online filing service for company accounts and Corporation Tax returns – commonly known as the CATO portal. Once it’s switched off, you won’t be able to use the service or access any previously submitted returns through it.

From 1 April 2026, all companies will need to use commercial software to file their annual accounts and Corporation Tax return.

For many one-person businesses and micro-companies that currently file for free, this represents a significant shift. With less than three months to go, here’s what you need to know – and how to prepare.

Why is the free service being withdrawn?

HMRC’s official reasons are that the current service:

No longer meets modern digital standards;

Doesn’t align with changes to company law or the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, which push towards tagged digital accounts and more detailed data from companies.

In practice, this move also fits with HMRC’s wider direction of encouraging businesses to use advisers and recognised software.

While this may improve accuracy, it will inevitably increase costs for small businesses. This will be particularly frustrating for affected businesses given that many inaccuracies stem from the complexity of the tax system itself!

What is changing?

From 1 April 2026:

Corporation Tax

All companies must file their CT600 using HMRC-recognised commercial software.

Accounts to Companies House

For now, accounts can still be filed via Companies House WebFiling, on paper, or through commercial software.

Companies House has been working towards software-only accounts filing from April 2027, although this may yet be scaled back following concerns raised by small business groups about cost and data disclosure. Watch this space.

What is certain is that the free joint filing portal will close on 31 March 2026, and Corporation Tax filing will move entirely to paid third-party software from that point.

What should you do next?

If you already use an accountant or commercial software to file your company accounts and tax returns, you’re unlikely to notice much difference.

However, if you currently file your returns yourself using the CATO portal, you should start preparing now.

Download and securely save at least the last three years of tax returns before 31 March 2026 – you won’t be able to access them afterwards.

Treat 31 March 2026 as a hard deadline. HMRC has provided a list of commercial software suppliers that can produce one or more of the elements required for a Company Tax return.

Need Support?

Managing company accounts and Corporation Tax can be complex and time-consuming. If you’d prefer not to deal with the transition yourself, we can prepare and file your annual accounts and company tax returns on your behalf, ensuring everything is accurate, compliant, and submitted on time using the appropriate software.",https://www.cowgills.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/AdobeStock_208067609.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 06:39:14.188404

-OneArabia

H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum used a World Economic Forum 2026 panel in Davos to stress that trust, credibility, and values now define soft power. Speaking to global leaders, Sheikha Latifa linked storytelling, culture, and lived practice to how countries and cities shape influence in a fragmented world.

The session, held at the Congress Centre in Davos and livestreamed worldwide, formed part of the World Economic Forum’s 2026 programme. Titled ‘Stories and Strength,’ it examined how narratives guide confidence, cooperation, and resilience across governments, markets, and societies, especially as geopolitical and economic competition intensifies.

The panel brought together senior voices from business and media alongside H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed. Maurice Lévy, Emeritus Chairman of Publicis Groupe and Chair of the France Community of Chairpersons, and Richard W. Edelman, Chief Executive Officer of Edelman, joined the discussion. Brendan Vaughan, Editor-in-Chief of Fast Company, moderated the session and focused debate on innovation and influence.

H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed explained that soft power in a polarised global landscape no longer comes from scale or force. It grows from credibility that is earned, not claimed. She pointed to integrity, consistency, and authenticity as the key conditions for sustaining trust when audiences face many competing messages.

""When we speak of soft power at the city level, it must begin with a purpose that goes beyond the institution itself to genuinely serve people and society. Once that purpose is clear, the responsibility is to act with integrity, authenticity, and consistency. Regardless of external pressures or changing circumstances, trust is built when values remain steady, and actions align with intent.""

Sheikha Latifa stated that actions carry more weight than visibility in this environment. When values are lived through policies and conduct, credibility follows. When they are only communicated, trust weakens. She linked this view to how leadership decisions shape public confidence and long-term partnerships across borders.

Drawing on the UAE’s record, H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed said the country’s soft power is rooted in daily practice rather than promotion. Residents from 195 nationalities live side by side, coming from different cultural, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds. They are able to speak their languages, follow their religions, and celebrate their cultures in public life.

She highlighted that this environment is guided by leadership that promotes deep respect and openness towards other traditions. According to Sheikha Latifa, this approach creates strong belonging and shared ownership of the emirate’s success. People can live, work, and contribute while feeling valued for who they are, not just for their roles.

At the centre of Sheikha Latifa’s reflections was the link between heritage and openness. She described this balance as central to how the UAE defines its identity and manages its diversity in practice, especially as more cultures and viewpoints interact every day in the country’s cities and communities.

""UAE is home to people from many cultures and nationalities; as Emiratis, we carry a deep responsibility to ensure that every voice feels seen and valued. UAE is often recognised for being forward-thinking, innovative, and progressive, but what truly defines us is our deep-rooted culture and traditions. We live our values every day in how we dress, how we welcome others, and how we interact with one another through hospitality, respect, and integrity. These values shape the fabric of our society and create a ripple effect across our communities. With so many stories and perspectives coexisting in one place, the unifying principle is a shared belief in collective success. In the UAE, when one person succeeds, that success is felt by all, and it is this spirit of mutual uplift that strengthens our society,"" H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed said.

World Economic Forum Davos 2026 culture, creativity and storytelling

H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed also described culture and creativity as powerful bridges between societies at the World Economic Forum 2026 discussion. She said creativity encourages curiosity, which she called the opposite of fear. At a time of anxiety and division, curiosity makes people listen, and listening can open a route to understanding.

Sheikha Latifa added that effective storytelling for policy or strategy starts with listening carefully. In her work with the creative and cultural sectors, engagement begins with dialogue. Stakeholders are involved from the start, their challenges are mapped, and solutions are designed jointly across government entities and private organisations to build shared ownership.

Reflecting on how the UAE presents its story internationally, H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed said credibility always starts with delivery. She noted that trust comes when governments and institutions meet commitments rather than issue statements. Clear expectations from the UAE’s leadership require that each strategy produces measurable outcomes with defined accountability.

""The guiding purpose behind everything we do is the happiness and well-being of people; it is this principle that shapes our decisions and informs how we engage with the world,"" she said.

The panel formed part of the wider World Economic Forum summit programme, held under the theme ‘A Spirit of Dialogue.’ The theme calls for renewed cooperation and rebuilding trust as global systems face complexity and fast change. Narrative, trust, and dialogue were presented as linked tools for navigating this environment.

H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed’s role in Davos 2026 marked the second year in which Sheikha Latifa led the UAE delegation to the World Economic Forum, after heading the delegation in 2025. This ongoing presence signals the UAE’s intention to contribute views grounded in culture, collaboration, and human connection to international discussions.

Her engagement at the World Economic Forum 2026 underlined how the UAE pairs its internal experience of diversity and heritage with a wider global dialogue on soft power and storytelling. By aligning values, policies, and narratives, the UAE aims to build trust-based relationships while navigating a more complex and competitive international landscape.

According to the FDA website, Boston Scientific sent a letter on Dec. 19, 2025, to all affected customers recommending the immediate halt of use and distribution of any remaining impacted devices.

Boston Scientific reported that certain AXIOS Stent and Electrocautery-Enhanced Delivery Systems have shown increased reports of difficulty with stent deployment and expansion.

These complications arise at the time of delivery and do not affect stents that have already been successfully implanted.

In some cases, difficulty deploying the stent may extend procedure times and require the device to be replaced. If the first flange fails to deploy or expand, additional endoscopic or surgical intervention may be necessary to remove the stent and close the puncture site.

As of December 23, Boston Scientific reported 167 serious injuries and three deaths associated with the issue.

The AXIOS Electrocautery-Enhanced Stent and Delivery System is used to enable endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts or walled-off necrosis.

Certain models are also indicated for gallbladder drainage in high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis who are not suitable candidates for surgery.

The company instructed facilities to remove the products from inventory, segregate them in a secure location, and arrange for their return.

The agency emphasized that patients with successfully implanted AXIOS stents should continue standard follow-up care, as the reported issue occurs only during delivery, not after implantation.

Boston Scientific also advised healthcare providers to prominently post the notification near affected products to ensure visibility for all users and handlers.

Facilities were instructed to share the alert internally with healthcare professionals and externally with any organizations that may have received the devices.

Distributors were told to forward the notice to customers, while hospital systems were asked to notify other facilities within their networks that may hold the products.

The FDA said it is actively reviewing information related to what it described as a potentially high-risk device issue and will provide updates as significant new details become available.

Last Thursday, Boston Scientific agreed to acquire Penumbra, Inc. (NYSE:PEN) in a cash-and-stock deal, representing a roughly $14.5 billion enterprise value.

In December 2025, Medtronic Plc (NYSE:MDT) notified customers to remove certain Left Heart Vent Catheters from use and sale, citing safety concerns.

According to Medtronic, the affected catheters may fail to hold their shape when bent, despite being designed to remain malleable and retain shaft positioning.

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-21 23:12:43+00:00,NVIDIA Technical Blog,Streamlining CUB with a Single-Call API | NVIDIA Technical Blog,Giannis Gonidelis,,,,,https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/streamlining-cub-with-a-single-call-api/,"This post explains the shift from this API to the new CUB single-call API introduced in CUDA 13.1, which simplifies development by managing memory under the hood without sacrificing performance.
The existing CUB two-phase API CUB is widely recommended for harnessing the full computational capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs.
The following is a conventional CUB call: // FIRST CALL: determine temporary storage size cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(nullptr, temp_storage_bytes, d_input, d_output, num_items); // Allocate the required temporary storage cudaMalloc(&d_temp_storage, temp_storage_bytes); // SECOND CALL: run the actual scan cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_temp_storage, temp_storage_bytes, d_input, d_output, num_items); The CUB interface introduces a practical challenge.
The new single-call CUB API Given the wide usage of wrappers throughout many production codebases, there is a recognized need to extend CUB by introducing the new single-call API: // SINGLE CALL: allocation and execution on a single step cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items); The example shows that no explicit memory allocation is required.
d_temp_storage = mr.allocate(stream, bytes); mr.deallocate(stream, d_temp_storage, bytes); .","The C++ template library CUB is a go-to for high-performance GPU primitive algorithms, but its traditional “two-phase” API, which separates memory estimation from allocation, can be cumbersome. While this programming model offers flexibility, it often results in repetitive boilerplate code.

This post explains the shift from this API to the new CUB single-call API introduced in CUDA 13.1, which simplifies development by managing memory under the hood without sacrificing performance.

What is CUB?

If you need to run a standard algorithm (such as scan, histogram, or sort) on a GPU, CUB is likely the fastest way to do it. As a principal component of the NVIDIA CUDA Core Compute Libraries (CCCL), CUB is designed to abstract away the complexity of manual CUDA thread management without sacrificing performance.

While libraries like Thrust provide a high-level, “host-side” interface similar to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) for quick prototyping, CUB provides a set of “device-side” primitives. This enables developers to integrate highly optimized algorithms directly into their own custom kernels. To learn how to use CUB, check out the NVIDIA DLI course Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with Modern CUDA C++.

The existing CUB two-phase API

CUB is widely recommended for harnessing the full computational capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs. Nevertheless, it carries some intricacies in its usage that may feel non-trivial. This section takes a step back to put these underlying mechanisms in perspective.

A straightforward, single-pass execution flow is often assumed, where a single-call to a function primitive suffices to execute the underlying algorithm and retrieve the results right after. The function’s side effects, such as modifying a variable or returning a result, are expected to be immediately visible to the next statement.

The CUB execution model diverges from this familiar single-pass pattern. Invoking a CUB primitive is a two-step process that requires first calculating the necessary device memory size (the first call), and second, explicitly allocating and then executing the kernel (the second call).

The following is a conventional CUB call:

// FIRST CALL: determine temporary storage size cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(nullptr, temp_storage_bytes, d_input, d_output, num_items); // Allocate the required temporary storage cudaMalloc(&d_temp_storage, temp_storage_bytes); // SECOND CALL: run the actual scan cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_temp_storage, temp_storage_bytes, d_input, d_output, num_items);

The CUB interface introduces a practical challenge. The primitives must be invoked twice: first to determine the amount of temporary memory needed, and then a second time to execute the actual algorithm with the allocated storage.

A significant drawback of the traditional two-phase API is the lack of clarity regarding which arguments must remain consistent between the estimation and execution steps. Taking the snippet above for reference, it’s not programmatically clear which parameters influence the internal state and can change between the calls, because the function signatures for both phases are identical. For example, the d_input and d_output arguments are only actually being used during the second call.

Despite its intricacies, the existing design serves the following fundamental purpose: by keeping allocation separated from execution, the user can allocate a chunk of memory and reuse it multiple times or even share between different algorithms.

While this design is important for a non-negligible subset of users, the overall user base leveraging this feature is rather limited. That is why many users wrap their CUB calls, to abstract away the two-step invocation required for every use. PyTorch is a case in point, which employs macros to wrap its CUB invocations into single-calls and provide automatic memory management.

The following source code is from the pytorch/pytorch GitHub repo:

// handle the temporary storage and 'twice' calls for cub API #define CUB_WRAPPER(func, ...) do { \ size_t temp_storage_bytes = 0; \ AT_CUDA_CHECK(func(nullptr, temp_storage_bytes, __VA_ARGS__)); \ auto& caching_allocator = *::c10::cuda::CUDACachingAllocator::get(); \ auto temp_storage = caching_allocator.allocate(temp_storage_bytes); \ AT_CUDA_CHECK(func(temp_storage.get(), temp_storage_bytes, __VA_ARGS__));\ } while (false)

The use of macros presents its own drawbacks, as they can obscure control flow and parameter passing, resulting in opaque code that is difficult to understand and significantly hinders debugging.

The new single-call CUB API

Given the wide usage of wrappers throughout many production codebases, there is a recognized need to extend CUB by introducing the new single-call API:

// SINGLE CALL: allocation and execution on a single step cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items);

The example shows that no explicit memory allocation is required. Note that the allocation process is still occurring under the hood, nevertheless. Figure 1 shows that the single-call interface—which includes temporary storage estimation, memory allocation, and invoking the algorithm—introduces zero overhead compared to the two-phase API.

Figure 1 compares the GPU runtime for the original two-phase ExclusiveSum call against the newly introduced single-phase call. The x-axis represents multiple input sizes, while the y-axis shows the normalized execution time for each type of invocation. Two major conclusions drawn from this performance data:

The new API introduces zero overhead

Memory allocation remains under the new API; it just happens under the hood

The second point can be verified by peeking inside the implementation of the new API. Asynchronous allocation is embedded within the device primitive:

cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items, env = {}) { . . . d_temp_storage = mr.allocate(stream, bytes); mr.deallocate(stream, d_temp_storage, bytes); . . . }

The two-phase APIs have not been removed—those are still valid calls of existing CUB APIs. Rather, the single-phase calls are added on top of existing APIs. It’s expected that the majority of users will use these.

The environment and memory resources

Beyond resolving the problems previously mentioned, the new single-call CUB API also expands the execution configuration capabilities of the invoked primitive. It introduces an environment argument, which can either customize memory allocation using memory resources or just provide a stream to execute on (like the two-phase API).

Memory resources are a new memory utility for allocating and freeing memory. The environment argument to single-call APIs can optionally contain a memory resource. When a memory resource is not provided using the environment argument, the API will use a default memory resource provided by CCCL. Conversely, you can elect to pass one of the non-default CCCL memory resources provided as part of the codebase, or even pass your own custom memory resource.

// Use CCCL-provided memory resource type cuda::device_memory_pool mr{cuda::devices[0]}; cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items, mr);

// Create and use your custom MR my_memory_resource my_mr{cuda::experimental::devices[0]}; // Use it with CUB cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items, my_mr);

With the new API, the execution CUDA stream handling is not alleviated but rather encapsulated within the new env variable. Of course it can also be passed explicitly as before, even if temp allocation handling is removed. CUB now also provides cuda::stream_ref that is type safe and its usage should be preferred. You can also pass cuda::stream which owns the underlying execution stream.

Combining execution options

The single-call API enables more than just passing a memory resource or a stream as a last argument. Going forward, the environment argument will be the place for all execution-related knobs, including deterministic requirements, guarantees, user-defined tunings, and much more.

With the introduction of the single-pass API, CUB has unlocked a massive suite of execution configuration features. With the plethora of new execution features, the question becomes: What is the best way to combine them all?

The solution lies in the new env argument. By leveraging cuda::std::execution, CUB provides a central endpoint that acts as a flexible “control panel” for your algorithm. Instead of rigidly defined function arguments, the environment enables you to create a combinatorial mix of any features you need. Whether you want to pair a custom stream with a specific memory pool, or combine strict deterministic requirements with a custom tuning policy, the env argument handles it all in a single, type-safe object.

cuda::stream custom_stream{cuda::device_ref{0}}; auto memory_prop = cuda::std::execution::prop{cuda::mr::get_memory_resource, cuda::device_default_memory_pool(cuda::device_ref{0})}; auto env = cuda::std::execution::env{custom_stream.get(), memory_prop}; DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum(d_input, d_output, num_items, env);

CUB currently provides the following algorithms that support the environment interface, with more to come:

cub::DeviceReduce::Reduce

cub::DeviceReduce::Sum

cub::DeviceReduce::Min/Max/ArgMin/ArgMax

cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveSum

cub::DeviceScan::ExclusiveScan

The company's shares have outpaced broader equities over this period.

However, a lot is changing within Intuitive Surgical's competitive landscape. Can the medical device leader still perform well over the next five years? Let's find out how things might unfold for the company through 2031.

The da Vinci 5 will make progress

Intuitive Surgical is best known for its da Vinci systems, robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) devices that help physicians perform minimally invasive surgical procedures. In 2024, the company earned clearance for the fifth generation of this famous system. The rollout of the da Vinci 5 is still ongoing, but over the next five years, we could see it gain significantly more traction. Intuitive Surgical will launch software updates and other upgrades for the da Vinci 5 based on real-world data and physician feedback. The device should also earn additional indications for its use over the years.

This matters for Intuitive Surgical's prospects, as it will help boost its installed base and procedure volume, which are important drivers of revenue growth. Intuitive Surgical makes the majority of its revenue from instruments and accessories needed for the da Vinci systems, as well as servicing the devices and training. The more of its devices are out in hospitals and medical offices, the more surgeries are performed with it, and the more instruments and accessories it sells, and the more servicing and training are needed. Intuitive Surgical's work with the da Vinci 5 should be an important thing to watch over the next five years, though its older devices will still play a role.

There will be even more competition

Intuitive Surgical has had little competition over the past couple of decades. That is now changing. Last year, Medtronic received U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for its Hugo RAS system for urologic procedures, an indication for which the da Vinci system is also approved. Medtronic won't stop there. It is already running additional clinical trials, including in hernia repair, to expand the device's approved indications.

By 2031, Medtronic's Hugo will likely have a much longer list of approved indications. Then there is Johnson & Johnson, which is inching closer to earning approval for its own robot device, the Ottava system. These new devices could steal some market share from Intuitive Surgical and put pressure on revenue and earnings growth over the next five years.

Is Intuitive Surgical stock a buy?

Even with mounting competition, Intuitive Surgical could produce strong returns over the medium term. Here are two reasons why. First, the RAS market is underpenetrated. More competition might help drive broader adoption of robot systems, which would be good for Intuitive Surgical and its peers. Second, Intuitive Surgical arguably benefits from a wide moat. It already has a vast installed base and real-world data demonstrating its value for patient outcomes.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851078%2Fphysicians-in-an-operating-room.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-21 19:02:20.854773

It elevated search into a new sphere and gave billions of people the tools to ask anything.

Unsurprisingly, many of these queries concerned health. According to OpenAI, more than 230 million people worldwide ask ChatGPT health- or wellness-related questions weekly. Yet, this unprecedented access to health advice hasn’t been without its controversies.

There are ethical concerns around accountability, inaccurate information, the threat of hallucinations, a lack of contextual awareness, and transparency. And there are the obvious security, compliance, and privacy concerns that come with unsolicited health information.

Now, OpenAI is addressing these issues by announcing the upcoming launch of a dedicated health experience, ChatGPT Health, grounded in two core concepts: security and expert guidance.

ChatGPT Health

OpenAI describes ChatGPT Health as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together, to help you feel more informed, prepared, and confident navigating your health.”

The ChatGPT Health experience is a dedicated feature within the ChatGPT interface that provides additional layers of protection for users. It includes built-in safety measures and conversation isolation features, ensuring that health discussions remain separate from other chats. Users can also connect wellness apps, such as Apple Health, and access their medical records.

OpenAI says that the purpose of ChatGPT Health is not to replace medical care, diagnose conditions, or provide treatment plans. Instead, it is designed to assist users with everyday health questions and monitor health patterns over time as a supportive resource.

AI Agent & Copilot Summit is an AI-first event to define opportunities, impact, and outcomes with Microsoft Copilot and agents. Building on its 2025 success, the 2026 event takes place March 17-19 in San Diego. Get more details.

Ethics and Security

While conversations within ChatGPT already benefit from blanket encryption, ChatGPT Health introduces purpose-built encryption and isolation, ensuring that no data is used for model training. Furthermore, users can enhance access security by deploying multi-factor authentication (MFA). For secure access to U.S. medical records, OpenAI has partnered with b.well, a leading connected healthcare provider.

From an ethical standpoint, OpenAI has developed ChatGPT Health alongside more than 260 physicians who have practiced in 60 countries. Collectively, these physicians have provided OpenAI with feedback on “model outputs over 600,000 times across 30 areas of focus.” This expert guidance has helped OpenAI to develop ChatGPT Health into a service that not only has an inexhaustible knowledge base, but can respond in a manner that prioritizes safety, delivers clear advice, and understands the context of when to suggest follow-up with a registered clinician.

Outputs are measured against the HealthBench framework, developed by OpenAI in collaboration with medical professionals. This framework ensures that responses are evaluated using physician-developed rubrics that incorporate essential criteria for answers, rather than relying on basic Q&A.

Closing Thoughts

There was no doubt that users would quickly turn to ChatGPT to ask health-related questions. In 2022, the same year ChatGPT was launched, a study by The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) found that 58.5% of adults used the internet to find health or medical information.

However, with the emergence of GenAI, the depth of knowledge available instantaneously, as well as the way users actively seek advice, has changed both the methods and consequences of delivering online health information. The AI Era is constantly evolving. What matters most is that companies leading the field adapt to these changes, remain responsive to user feedback, and sometimes even make U-turns. They must evolve their services to create an ecosystem of AI tools that prioritize user safety, privacy, and agency and to that end, OpenAI is making major strides.",https://cloudwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/OpenAI.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:45:32.747725

New York Adopts Two Bills Regulating Commercial Use of AI-Generated Content

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

New York AG Scrutinizes Instacart's Algorithmic Pricing Practices

On January 8, 2026, the New York Attorney General's Office sent a formal information request to Instacart seeking details about its pricing practices and compliance with New York's recently enacted Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act. The AG's letter follows a December 2025 report by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative alleging that Instacart users were shown materially different prices for identical products at the same stores and at the same time.

The AG's letter raises concerns that Instacart's pricing experiments—and the tools it offers to retailers and CPG brands—may constitute ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" under New York law, which requires a clear and conspicuous disclosure whenever an algorithm sets prices using personal data. The Attorney General specifically questions whether Instacart's current disclosures, which appear only through fine-print links on certain pages, satisfy the statute's disclosure requirements.

Although Instacart has publicly stated that it ended item-level price testing in December and that its testing did not rely on personal or behavioral data, the AG notes that Instacart has also acknowledged that retail and brand partners may continue to test promotions and discounts on the platform. The letter seeks extensive information about Instacart's pricing tools (including Eversight and smart cart technology), agreements with retailers and brands, the scope of any price experiments, and how consumer data may be used in pricing or promotions.

Why it matters: This inquiry signals heightened enforcement attention on algorithmic pricing and transparency—particularly where platforms, retailers, or brands rely on automated tools to test prices, discounts, or promotions. Companies operating in New York should carefully evaluate whether any pricing variability could be viewed as ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" and whether disclosures are sufficiently clear, prominent, and consistently presented wherever prices are displayed.

New York Adopts Two Bills Regulating Commercial Use of AI-Generated Content

New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed two bills on December 11, 2025, that together expand New York's approach to AI transparency and post-mortem rights of publicity in entertainment-adjacent contexts.

Synthetic performers in advertising (S.8420-A / A.8887-B). The first law amends New York's General Business Law to require a clear and conspicuous disclosure when an advertisement includes an AI-generated ""synthetic performer."" The law includes carveouts for certain audio advertisements and for situations where AI is used solely to translate the language of a human performer, and it generally does not apply to ads or promotional materials for certain expressive works (e.g., films/TV/streaming/video games) where the use of the synthetic performer is consistent with its use in the expressive work. A first violation may result in a $1,000 civil penalty, with $5,000 for subsequent violations. The disclosure requirement becomes effective 180 days after enactment (approximately June 2026, based on the December 11, 2025, signing).

Post-mortem name/image/likeness and digital replicas (S.8391 / A.8882). The second law strengthens New York's right of publicity framework by requiring consent from heirs or executors for the commercial use of a deceased individual's name, image, or likeness after death. In addition, it updates the definitions and liability standards applicable to digital replicas—including tightening the rules for using a deceased performer's digital replica in certain expressive works by moving from a disclaimer-oriented approach toward a prior-consent model. The bill takes effect immediately.

Key Takeaways

These bills illustrate an accelerating state-level push to address AI-enabled impersonation and consumer confusion in advertising while simultaneously expanding protections against unauthorized post-mortem commercialization. For advertisers and studios, the practical compliance focus is (i) auditing whether campaigns use synthetic performers (and whether an exception applies), (ii) building disclosure into production workflows ahead of the June 2026 effective date, and (iii) obtaining appropriate rights and permissions—particularly where a campaign uses a deceased individual's identity or a digital replica in a way that could trigger New York's consent requirements.

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

Supergoop! was the target of a proposed California class action alleging that its marketing of certain sunscreen products as ""100% Mineral"" and ""Mineral"" is false and misleading under state consumer protection laws.

According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that reasonable consumers interpret ""100% Mineral"" claims to mean that the entire product formula, not just the active sunscreen ingredients, consists solely of mineral or natural ingredients and does not contain synthetic, chemically altered, or otherwise non-mineral components. The plaintiff further alleges that Supergoop's use of ""100% Mineral"" language creates a net impression that the products are free from non-mineral or highly processed ingredients.

This complaint challenges labeling and marketing for more than a dozen Supergoop sunscreen products sold nationwide, including products marketed for adults and children. Plaintiff alleges that, contrary to the challenged representations, the products contain numerous non-mineral ingredients. In addition, the complaint asserts that certain ingredients derived from minerals or natural sources have been subjected to significant chemical processing or modification, resulting in ingredients that are materially different from their original mineral or natural form.

The lawsuit asserts claims under California's Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law and seeks restitution, injunctive relief, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees on behalf of a proposed statewide class of California purchasers. Supergoop denies the allegations, and the case is in its early stages.

Key Takeaways

The case reflects continued litigation risk around ""100%"", ""free-of,"" ""natural,"" and ""mineral"" claims—particularly where plaintiffs argue that consumers reasonably interpret such claims to apply to an entire formulation rather than discrete components. While some courts have been open to crediting reasonable consumers with the ability to read ingredient declarations, this isn't universal and frequently turns on the specifics of the label. One thing is certain, which is that ingredient-based claims remain the most common risk point for CPG claims. Brands can manage this risk through thoughtful use of qualifiers and marketing copy.

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

The Federal Trade Commission has reopened and set aside its December 2024 consent order against Rytr LLC, concluding that the complaint underlying the order failed to plead facts sufficient to support a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.

Rytr offers an AI-enabled writing assistance service, including functionality that could be used to generate draft consumer reviews. In 2024, the FTC alleged that this service provided the ""means and instrumentalities"" for deception and constituted an unfair practice because it could generate large volumes of reviews without regard to accuracy. Rytr agreed to settle those allegations through a consent order that broadly barred it from offering any AI-enabled service designed to generate consumer reviews or testimonials.

In its December 2025 Order Reopening and Setting Aside the 2024 Order, the Commission determined that the complaint did not adequately plead either theory of liability. With respect to the means-and-instrumentalities claim, the FTC concluded that the complaint failed to allege that Rytr itself created deceptive marketing content, that its service was inherently deceptive, or that Rytr knew or had reason to know its customers would use the tool to violate the law. The Commission emphasized that providing a general-purpose tool with legitimate, pro-consumer uses—such as assisting users in drafting or editing review content—does not, without more, establish liability under Section 5.

The FTC also concluded that the complaint failed to plead an unfairness violation. The allegations did not establish that Rytr's service caused or was likely to cause substantial consumer injury, nor did they plausibly allege that any such injury outweighed countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Because the complaint failed to plead a cognizable Section 5 violation, the Commission found that the consent order provided no consumer benefit and was therefore not in the public interest.

In reaching this conclusion, the FTC also cited recent federal policy directives calling on agencies to review and, where appropriate, set aside final orders that unduly burden artificial intelligence innovation. The Commission stressed, however, that its decision rested on the legal insufficiency of the complaint itself. The FTC reiterated that it would continue to pursue enforcement where AI tools are used to deceive consumers or where companies misrepresent the capabilities or outputs of AI-enabled products.

Key Takeaways

The FTC's decision reflects both legal pleading concerns and a broader policy shift favoring AI innovation.

While the Commission grounded its analysis in Section 5 doctrine, the Order repeatedly cites Executive Order 14179 and the Administration's AI Action Plan, suggesting that current federal AI policy materially informed the public-interest analysis.

The outcome should not be read as a blanket rejection of means-and-instrumentalities theories.

The FTC's criticism focused on the specific allegations pleaded against Rytr and the nature of its AI tool; it remains unclear whether the Commission would apply the same analysis to non-AI companies or to tools with fewer legitimate consumer uses.

General-purpose AI tools appear to receive particular solicitude under the current framework.

The Commission emphasized that Rytr's product had pro-consumer applications and rejected theories premised on hypothetical misuse, but it is uncertain whether products outside the AI context—or AI tools marketed more aggressively for consumer-facing claims—would be treated similarly.

The Order narrows—but does not eliminate—unfairness and scienter theories in the AI context.

The FTC signaled skepticism toward speculative harm and attenuated knowledge allegations, yet stopped short of announcing new standards, leaving open how future complaints may be pleaded to address these deficiencies.

The decision is best viewed as fact- and moment-specific rather than a durable safe harbor.

Companies should be cautious about extrapolating broadly from Rytr, particularly given the role of current executive policy and the possibility that a future Commission could revisit similar conduct under a different enforcement posture.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7498_5140.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 17:05:19.636862

What powered that gap: strong underwriting profits (with a P&C combined ratio below 91%), robust investment income benefiting from higher interest rates, disciplined cost control, and shareholder returns (dividends and buybacks).

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

AXA has kept growth steady rather than flashy, with consistent mid-single–digit topline growth. In 2024, it grew gross written premiums and other revenues by 7% and increased underlying earnings per share (UEPS) by 8%.

Management’s “Unlock the Future” plan targets 6%–8% UEPS CAGR through 2026. The building blocks are pretty clear: pricing actions in P&C, favorable net flows in Life & Savings, and the €0.5 billion acquisition of Prima to strengthen its direct franchise in Italy.

Other growth drivers include continued rate increases in P&C, expansion in higher-growth markets (Asia and North America), digital distribution initiatives, and selective bolt-on acquisitions to deepen specialist capabilities (for example, climate advisory and cyber insurance).

Quality & Moat

AXA’s moat comes from doing a lot of different insurance businesses, in a lot of different places, at serious scale. That diversification helps smooth out bumps from any single market.

On the balance sheet, AXA reports a Solvency II ratio above 216%, which is a meaningful capital buffer. Profitability also looks strong: return on equity (ROE) is around 16.7% (vs. a sector median of 12.9%), and that’s improved from its five-year average of 11.6%.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is more modest at 1.2%, but still above the sector median, pointing to efficient capital use in select lines.

AXA has also been returning cash to shareholders aggressively: over €5 billion of share buybacks in 2025 and a 9% dividend increase. That supports free cash flow generation and helps explain the current 5.3% dividend yield.

Valuation

AXAHF trades at a P/E of approximately 10.4x trailing earnings and 10.0x forward earnings. That’s below sector medians of about 14x and 12.1x, respectively.

On other measures, the discount shows up too: price/sales is 0.83x (vs. the market average of 4.48x), and price/free cash flow (P/FCF) is 3.8x, sitting at a multi-year low.

That cheaper price can be justified by AXA’s conservative underwriting approach and modest ROIC. But it also gives investors a margin of safety, especially if AXA keeps delivering stability and hits its growth targets.

Market Sentiment

Sentiment is upbeat. Of 17 sell-side analysts, 15 rate AXA a Buy, and the average 12-month price target implies about 15% upside.

Positioning looks calm: short interest is negligible at 0% of float. Ownership looks broad too, with over 450 institutional investors holding AXA.

Recent moves — including the Prima acquisition and capital return programs — have landed well with investors. Social media commentary on AXA’s digital initiatives has also stayed constructive.

Key Risks

Underwriting Volatility: AXA’s P&C combined ratio can come under pressure from large natural catastrophes and reserve development. If catastrophe experience is worse than expected, underwriting profits could take a hit.

Interest Rate and Investment Risk: Higher interest rates help investment income, but they can also create mark-to-market losses on fixed-income portfolios. Rates normalizing can also affect client savings products.

Currency Exposure: With major operations across Europe, Asia, and North America, AXA carries FX risk. A strengthening euro, in particular, can weigh on reported earnings in USD.

Regulatory and Capital Requirements: Insurance regulation can shift quickly. Changes such as Solvency II updates could raise capital charges or restrict product offerings, which would affect returns and growth flexibility.

Market Sensitivity: AXAHF is relatively more sensitive to equity market swings, with a beta of 1.45 and volatility of about 33% vs. a 24.6% market average. That can amplify share price drawdowns during downturns.

Bull Case

Attractive Valuation: The stock trades at a multi-year low multiple (about 10x P/E and 0.8x P/S), offering a margin of safety compared with peers.

Strong Capital Position: AXA’s Solvency II ratio above 216% and net debt/EBITDA of zero give it financial flexibility and resilience.

Robust Shareholder Returns: A 5.3% dividend yield plus €5 billion of buybacks in 2025 can support total returns and help offset dilution.

Consistent Profit Growth: AXA targets 6%–8% UEPS CAGR through 2026, supported by P&C pricing, net flows in Life & Savings, and cost efficiency gains.

Global Diversification: Six operating segments spanning mature and higher-growth markets can reduce the impact of regional downturns and create cross-selling opportunities.

Strategic Acquisitions: The Prima Italy acquisition, plus a focus on specialty lines like cyber and climate, expands AXA’s addressable market and can lift margins.

Bear Case

Catastrophe Risk: A surprise spike in natural disasters could damage underwriting profits and push the combined ratio above target.

UK Market Softness: Weaker pricing in UK motor insurance and higher claims frequency may squeeze P&C margins in an important market.

Currency Headwinds: A stronger euro or weaker major emerging-market currencies could reduce translated earnings from overseas operations.

Asset Management Divestiture Impact: Selling AXA IM cuts fee income and may reduce earnings variability, putting pressure on management to replace that income elsewhere.

Regulatory Uncertainty: If the proposed Solvency II recalibration tightens capital rules, AXA could face higher required capital and lower returns.

Economic Downturn: A global slowdown could weaken premium growth, increase lapse rates in savings products, and reduce investment returns.

On Our Radar

Q4 2025 Earnings Release: Scheduled for Feb 26, 2026. Investors will be watching the combined ratio, UEPS growth, and any updated guidance.

Ex-Dividend Date: May 5, 2026. This can affect near-term share demand around the payout.

Integration of Prima Italy: Watch for synergies and net flows from the January 2025 acquisition. Initial results are expected by mid-2026.

Regulatory Developments: The EU consultation on Solvency II reforms is expected in H1 2026, and could change capital requirements.

Investment Conclusion

AXA SA offers a compelling risk-reward setup. Its diversified, scale-driven business and robust balance sheet support steady mid-single–digit earnings growth. At the same time, the stock’s discount to peers and strong capital returns create attractive total return potential.

Still, this isn’t a “set it and forget it” situation. Underwriting volatility, currency swings, and evolving regulation can all move the story — and the share price.

For long-term, income-oriented investors, AXAHF’s 5.3% dividend yield, ongoing buyback programs, and valuation discount may look like an appealing entry point. That appeal needs to be weighed against AXA’s cyclical sensitivities and its dependence on the broader macro backdrop.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2026-01-21 18:02:32.618048

Here's why,"Zev Fima, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-ai-wont-be-the-job-killer-everyone-fears-heres-why.html,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday that artificial intelligence will lead to more jobs, not fewer.
At the heart of the exchange, the CEO of Club name Nvidia said that AI is a platform shift.
Tempering the not-so-irrational fears out there about AI replacing human workers, Jensen offered a more optimistic view.
Asked about investments in AI, Jensen pretty much put to bed the idea of a spending bubble.
We remain in the early stages of the AI infrastructure buildout, before we even start to really think about the application layer of the stack touching every aspect of our daily lives.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday that artificial intelligence will lead to more jobs, not fewer. In an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jensen methodically explained how AI differs from other technological innovations of the past and how it can be an incredible engine for economic growth and prosperity. Jensen's sitdown with Fink, who co-chairs the WEF, was a high-level conversation about what AI is and what it is not, and what investments are needed and why, and how much. At the heart of the exchange, the CEO of Club name Nvidia said that AI is a platform shift. Examples of platforms include personal companies, the internet, smartphones, and the cloud — both physical and digital infrastructure that applications that we all use in our daily life are built on top of. Just as those platforms laid the foundation for so much economic growth, so too will AI. While ChatGPT and other large language models may technically be applications themselves, the difference is that new, AI-oriented applications will be built on top of these LLMs. Jensen sees five layers to the buildout of the AI platform: (1) enough energy to run everything; (2) chips/compute infrastructure, where Nvidia dominates; (3) cloud infrastructure/services; (4) AI models; and (5) the application layer, which is the key layer where the economic benefits of AI will be realized. Tempering the not-so-irrational fears out there about AI replacing human workers, Jensen offered a more optimistic view. Outside of the jobs being created by the physical build-out of AI infrastructure — such as electricians, plumbers, construction workers, and so on — Jensen said that implementing AI will lead to more demand for goods and services that, in turn, will lead to more hiring. Not as many employees per customer may be needed, but the customer growth that comes with a more efficient corporation can still result in demand for more workers For example, Jensen said that the number of radiologists has increased because hospitals can now process more patients thanks to AI. While AI may be reading the scans, humans are still needed to review and confirm diagnoses. More patients, more scans to review, more human radiologists needed. The bonus is that with AI doing the scans, the radiologists have more time to spend with patients or to discuss results with peer clinicians. Jevons Paradox ? Seeing a radiologist becomes easier as the radiologist becomes better and more efficient at their job, resulting in an overall increase in demand from patients looking to see radiologists. Radiology was a timely analogy as Club name Bristol Myers Squibb said Tuesday it will work with Microsoft's AI-powered radiology platform to develop and launch imaging algorithms aimed at accelerating early detection of lung cancer. These new tools, which can be used to analyze X-rays and CT scans, will help clinicians see hard-to-spot lung nodules and identify patients with earlier stages of disease. The alliance is the latest way health care and artificial intelligence are rapidly intersecting. On stage with Fink on Wednesday, Jensen noted a similar dynamic in nursing to what's going on in radiology. Nurses spend about half of their time charting. Thanks to AI, however, Jensen said nurses can spend more time visiting patients and providing that human touch that is often lacking when a hospital suffers a staffing shortage. By reducing the nursing bottleneck, hospitals can see more patients more quickly. As a result, more demand for hospitals leads to improved financials and, in turn, the ability to hire more nurses. In Jensen's view, the key to understanding how AI will impact a given job is to first differentiate between the purpose and the task. Going back to the radiology example, he said the purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose patients — and that at the end of the day, the job for both radiologists and nurses is to care for people. Reading charts and scans is crucial to that purpose, but it is a task that needs to be done to achieve the job's ultimate objective. By automating certain tasks, we can make people better at their actual jobs. So, AI, in the context of medical settings, should not result in fewer doctors and nurses, Jensen argued, but should lead to more doctors and nurses spending more time with their patients while providing better outcomes. Asked about investments in AI, Jensen pretty much put to bed the idea of a spending bubble. So, when asked instead if investment levels are too low, he provided an easy way to think about the spending and whether there's a bubble or if more spending is warranted. He said it comes down to the fact that despite millions of Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) now available in the cloud, the spot price for GPU rentals is increasing, not only for the latest generation, but even for those chips two generations in the rear view mirror. He attributed this to the number of AI companies being created. When a two-generation-old GPU is seeing its rental price increase, it's clear that supply (overall, not just as it relates to the latest chips) is falling well short of demand. Bottom line While there may be bubble-like areas of the market, that word has no place in the conversation when discussing names like Nvidia or the mega-cap cloud infrastructure players that generate real earnings and trade at reasonable valuations. We remain in the early stages of the AI infrastructure buildout, before we even start to really think about the application layer of the stack touching every aspect of our daily lives.

Dive Brief:

Almost eight in 10 executives believe 2030 will be the year AI starts significantly contributing to enterprise revenue, more than double the number of executives — 40% — who say AI is currently boosting revenues, according to a study published Friday by the IBM Institute for Business Value.

AI investment as a percentage of revenue will more than double over the next four years,but 68% of executives fear that integration issues will cause AI efforts to fail, according to the global study of 2,000 C-suite executives.

Still, AI is anticipated to drive enterprise growth through 2030, the study found. “AI won’t just support businesses, it will define them,” Mohamad Ali, SVP of IBM Consulting, said in a press release.

Dive Insight:

AI’s return on investment remains a question mark for business executives who believe in the technology’s potential, yet struggle to predict when its full value will be realized.

While 2030 appears to be a promising year for AI’s contribution to revenues, only 24% of executives can clearly identify where that revenue will derive from, according to IBM.

Executive views on when new technology investments will pay off vary, with some anticipating only a 27% benefit realization in the next two years, according to a Rimini Street C-suite survey published last month.

Spending on AI is not slowing, despite ROI concerns. In 2026, global AI spend is anticipated to increase 44% year over year to $2.52 trillion, according to a Gartner report. In the enterprise, IBM found that 47% of executives’ AI spend is currently focused on driving productivity and efficiency gains, while 62% believe their AI spend will be dedicated to product and service innovation between 2026 and 2030.

The financial services industry has been heavily investing in AI, with big banks including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachsbetting on future efficiency gains.

“There’s going to be teething pain on this stuff,” Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said in the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call. However, the “technological advancement is real,” he added.

Indeed, executives are sold on the value of AI when it comes to bolstering productivity, according to IBM. Surveyed executives expect AI will boost productivity by 42% in the next four years. Two-thirds of leaders expect to realize most AI-driven productivity gains by 2030.

WMT continues to sharpen the strategic edge of its third-party Marketplace by expanding into higher-value, specialized categories, with the launch of a Premium Musical Instrument Shop. While musical instruments represent a relatively small category, the move reflects Walmart Marketplace’s broader push to move beyond everyday essentials and into curated, brand-led verticals that can support faster online growth.

Premium Instruments Join Walmart’s Curated Digital Offerings

The new digital storefront features professional-grade instruments and accessories from globally recognized brands such as Fender, Roland, Boss and Zildjian. The offering spans guitars, amplifiers, pedals, drum accessories and related gear, adding a curated assortment that sits alongside WMT’s broader general merchandise selection. It shows Walmart Marketplace’s effort to add well-known brands in categories where customers care about quality and delivery.

Marketplace strength was evident in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, when Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales increased 28% year over year, driven by Marketplace, advertising and store-fulfilled pickup and delivery. Marketplace-led categories, including electronics, apparel, toys and hardlines, grew more than 40% during the quarter, underscoring the platform’s role in driving general merchandise growth amid a shifting consumer mix.

Marketplace activity is also closely linked to Walmart’s expanding digital revenue streams. In the third quarter, Walmart’s global advertising business grew more than 50%, with U.S. advertising up more than 30%, supported in part by increased seller participation on the Marketplace. Advertising and membership income together represented approximately one-third of consolidated adjusted operating income during the quarter, reflecting the rising contribution of seller-driven services.

The addition of premium musical instruments broadens Marketplace’s category mix while leveraging Walmart’s existing fulfillment and traffic scale. Although the category itself may be relatively small, it aligns with WMT’s focus on strengthening assortment quality and supporting sustained e-commerce growth.

The regulator pushed its decision date to April 10 from a prior expectation of late-March. Markets often react negatively to such postponements as they delay a product's market launch and extend uncertainty over its potential sales, which can limit revenue growth. The drug was part of the administration's fast-track review program, which promised quicker decisions for medicines considered critical to public health.

Eli Lilly is flat since the beginning of the year, and at $1,080 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $1,110 from November 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Eli Lilly’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,339.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/eli-lilly-cover-image-3d82148895e3_2025-02-04-094122_uhvj.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 17:05:11.491946

Walmart currently controls about 21 percent of the U.S. grocery market, data from research firm Numerator shows. Its two biggest challengers are Kroger, which accounts for 8.5 percent of the market, and Costco, which accounts for 8.2 percent. Amazon and Whole Foods, with 1.6 percent each, trail behind the pack.

While an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider these figures “underrepresent” the e-commerce company’s market share, it seems to be on a mission to improve its standing.

Just last week, Amazon announced the launch of its first big-box retail store, which will be located in the suburbs of Chicago. Walmart already operates more than 4,000 big-box stores, including 3,500 supercenter locations and 600 Sam’s Club locations, according to its website.

Risk Disclosures: Investing in the stock market involves risks, including the potential loss of principal. Growth stocks may be more volatile than other stocks as their prices tend to be higher in relation to their companies’ earnings and may be more sensitive to market, political, and economic developments. Investing in companies of medium capitalizations involves the risk that such issuers may have limited product lines or financial resources, lack management depth, or have limited liquidity. Companies involved in, or exposed to, AI-related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel as they face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence, and many depend significantly on retaining and growing their consumer base. These companies may be substantially exposed to the market and business risks of other industries or sectors, and may be adversely affected by negative developments impacting those companies, industries or sectors, as well as by loss or impairment of intellectual property rights or misappropriation of their technology. Companies that utilize AI could face reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and/or an adverse effect on business operations as content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications produce may be deficient, inaccurate, biased, misleading or incomplete, may lead to errors, and may be used in negligent or criminal ways. AI technology could face increasing regulatory scrutiny in the future, which may limit the development of this technology and impede the future growth. AI companies, especially smaller companies, tend to be more volatile than companies that do not rely heavily on technology. A significant portion of assets may be invested in securities of companies in related sectors, and may be similarly affected by economic, political, or market events and conditions and may be more vulnerable to unfavorable sector developments. Assets may be focused in a small number of holdings, making them susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory event than a more diversified portfolio. Active trading may increase transaction costs, brokerage commissions, and taxes, which can lower the return on investment. At times, cash may be a larger position in the portfolio and may underperform relative to equity securities.

ETF shares are based on market price rather than net asset value (“NAV”), as a result, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund may also incur brokerage commissions, as well as the cost of the bid/ask spread, when purchasing or selling ETF shares. The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation and/or redemption process of the Fund. Any of these factors, among others, may lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Thus, you may pay more (or less) than NAV when you buy shares of the Fund in the secondary market, and you may receive less (or more) than NAV when you sell those shares in the secondary market. The Manager cannot predict whether shares will trade above (premium), below (discount) or at NAV. The Fund may affect its creations and redemptions for cash, rather than for in-kind securities. Therefore, it may be required to sell portfolio securities and subsequently recognize gains on such sales that the Fund might not have recognized if it were to distribute portfolio securities in-kind. As such, investments in Fund shares may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an ETF that distributes portfolio securities entirely in-kind. Brokerage fees and taxes will be higher than if the Fund sold and redeemed shares in-kind. Certain shareholders, including other funds advised by the Manager or an affiliate of the Manager, may from time to time own a substantial amount of the shares of the Fund. Redemptions by large shareholders could have a significant negative impact on the Fund.

New York

With a Ph.D. in biology from MIT and the Whitehead Institute, where she was a NSF fellow, Irena represents plaintiffs and defendants in their most complex pharmaceutical and biotech patent cases. Over the last 20 years, pharmaceutical and biotechnology innovators have relied on Irena again and again for cases involving small molecules, biologics, recombinant DNA technology, gene therapy, gene editing, manufacturing processes, formulations and drug-eluting medical devices, including numerous multi-billion dollar cases involving many of the world’s best-selling drugs.

Irena has significant experience in litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act (ANDA and 505(b)(2) actions) and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), as well as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings, license disputes and matters with parallel ex-U.S. litigation and proceedings in foreign patent offices. Irena also helps life sciences companies and organizations develop the law in the most important cases for the biopharma industry. She has been principal counsel on numerous amicus briefs to the United States Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit in key biopharma cases.

For plaintiffs, Irena has successfully defended generic challenges to patents protecting blockbuster medical therapies, including multi-billion dollar cancer, antiviral, diabetes and anti-psychotic drugs, including recently obtaining attorneys’ fees in a hard-fought ANDA action. She also represents innovators in biosimilar litigation from its outset, including in some of the first cases under the BPCIA involving antibodies. Irena also represents clients in innovator vs innovator disputes. For defendants, she defeated a $530 million claim of patent infringement of a competitor’s biotech patent, obtaining dismissal of all claims and discovery sanctions against the patent owner. In another high-stakes case, she obtained summary judgment of noninfringement and exclusion of plaintiff’s experts under Daubert as well as a full award of attorneys’ fees. A registered patent attorney, Irena also handles inter partes review (IPR) proceedings. For patent owners, she has obtained denial of IPR for patents protecting blockbuster drugs and has leveraged IPR for defendants to obtain freedom to operate.

Irena also coordinates U.S. proceedings with parallel ex-U.S. litigation and proceedings in foreign patent offices, recently obtaining freedom to operate for a biotech innovator’s gene therapy. She provides strategic counseling in biologics and pharmaceuticals and advises clients on their IP portfolios and transactions. Irena also represents clients in high-stakes license disputes involving biotech patents, and, in a dispute concerning the use of a recombinant protein as an enzyme replacement therapy, obtained one of the largest settlement awards over the life of the contract.

Chambers USA has recognized Irena as a leading lawyer in intellectual property, where clients have described her as “excellent,” “knowledgeable, aggressive,” “knows the science forward and backward” and “an incredibly smart lawyer.” Benchmark Litigation named her one of the “Top 250 Women in Litigation” for the last eight years and a litigation star in intellectual property. Irena was also named to the Crain’s New York Business list of “Notable Women in Law.” She is also recognized as a leading lawyer by Legal 500. Irena writes and lectures widely on biopharma patent issues and biosimilar litigation. Irena also is frequently quoted on patent-related issues, including in the Washington Post, Financial Times, Nature Biotechnology, Bloomberg and Pink Sheet.

A Shifting Industry Landscape: Beyond the Net Interest Income Trap US Bancorp’s 2025 performance fits into a broader industry trend toward ""fee-income resiliency.""
A Blueprint for Regional Banking Success The takeaway from US Bancorp’s 2025 results is clear: scale and diversification are the new prerequisites for regional banking survival.","On January 21, 2026, US Bancorp (NYSE: USB) reported its full-year 2025 financial results, marking a transformative year for the Minneapolis-based lender. The bank ended the year with record net revenue of $28.7 billion, driven by a powerful combination of realized synergies from its MUFG Union Bank acquisition and a sophisticated ""payments-first"" strategy that has significantly decoupled its earnings from the volatility of interest rate cycles. As the financial sector enters 2026, US Bancorp’s results signal a successful pivot from a traditional regional player to a diversified financial services powerhouse.

The year-end performance highlights a bank that has successfully navigated the ""higher-for-longer"" interest rate environment of early 2025 while preparing for the easing cycle that began in the fourth quarter. With a Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) reaching 18.4% and an efficiency ratio improving to 57.4%, the firm has demonstrated that its multi-year investment in digital infrastructure and specialized commercial niches is paying off. This solid finish across consumer and commercial segments sets a high bar for the industry as 2026 begins with shifting macroeconomic expectations.

The Year of Optimization: US Bancorp's 2025 Performance

US Bancorp’s stellar 2025 was not an overnight success but the culmination of a three-year strategic overhaul. The headline figure for the fourth quarter—a record $7.4 billion in quarterly revenue—was supported by an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26, handily beating the consensus analyst estimate of $1.18. The timeline leading to this moment began in late 2022 with the $8 billion acquisition of MUFG Union Bank from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (NYSE: MUFG). By the end of 2025, the bank had finally fully integrated these operations, capturing the promised $900 million in annual cost synergies and vaulting to the fifth-largest deposit market share in the lucrative California market.

A key player in this success was the bank’s Payment Services division, which emerged as the star performer of 2025. Merchant processing revenue grew 5.0% year-over-year, while credit card fee revenue rose 5.3%, fueled by the bank’s ""Payments Transformation"" initiative. This program effectively embedded payment tools directly into the software used by its 1.4 million small business clients, making US Bancorp as much a fintech provider as a traditional lender. Meanwhile, the Wealth and Institutional Banking segment saw a 7.6% increase in fee income, further diversifying the top line.

Initial market reactions to the year-end report have been overwhelmingly positive. Shares of USB traded up 4.2% in early morning trading following the announcement, as investors cheered the bank's ability to maintain a healthy Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 2.71% even as the broader industry faced narrowing spreads. Analysts noted that the bank’s disciplined underwriting kept its net charge-off ratio at a modest 0.54%, despite lingering concerns about the commercial real estate (CRE) sector that have plagued other mid-sized lenders.

Winners, Losers, and the Battle for the Middle Market

In the wake of US Bancorp’s results, a clear divide is emerging between ""diversified"" regional banks and ""interest-rate-dependent"" peers. US Bancorp stands as a clear winner, alongside larger money-center banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), which also benefit from vast non-interest income streams. By generating 42% of its total revenue from fees—significantly higher than the 30% industry average for regional banks—US Bancorp has insulated its shareholders from the ""NII trap"" where earnings collapse when interest rates fall.

Conversely, the ""losers"" in this environment appear to be smaller regional institutions that lack the scale for significant payment processing or wealth management divisions. Banks heavily concentrated in traditional lending and those with significant exposure to maturing commercial real estate loans may find the 2026 environment challenging. As US Bancorp continues to gain market share in California and the Midwest, these smaller competitors face the prospect of either aggressive consolidation or margin compression as they compete for high-quality deposits.

The middle-market commercial space is also seeing a shift. US Bancorp’s Commercial and Industrial (C&I) loans grew by over 7% in 2025, largely at the expense of regional competitors. By offering a unified platform that combines lending with sophisticated treasury and payment solutions, USB is increasingly winning clients that previously might have utilized multiple smaller banks. This ""one-stop-shop"" appeal is proving to be a formidable competitive advantage in the current economic landscape.

US Bancorp’s 2025 performance fits into a broader industry trend toward ""fee-income resiliency."" Historically, regional banks were the most vulnerable to Federal Reserve policy, seeing their margins expand rapidly when rates rose and contract just as quickly when they fell. US Bancorp has provided a blueprint for breaking this cycle. By investing heavily in its Global Fund Services (GFS) and its ""Payments-as-a-Service"" model, the bank has created a revenue stream that is often counter-cyclical or at least rate-neutral.

This shift has significant regulatory and policy implications. As the Federal Reserve moves toward a more accommodative stance in 2026, regulators are closely watching how banks manage the transition. US Bancorp’s stable 34% deposit beta—the rate at which it passes interest rate changes to depositors—suggests that its high-quality, ""sticky"" consumer deposit base from the Union Bank acquisition provides a lower-cost funding source than its peers. This stability is likely to be viewed favorably by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve as they evaluate systemic risk in the post-2023 banking environment.

Historically, US Bancorp’s success mirrors the path taken by Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) in the early 2000s, focusing on deep customer relationships and ""cross-selling"" (now rebranded as ""ecosystem integration""). However, USB has avoided the pitfalls of its predecessors by prioritizing digital transparency and compliance-first growth. The comparison to historical precedents highlights that while the tools have changed—from branch-based cross-selling to software-embedded payments—the fundamental strategy of diversifying revenue remains the gold standard for banking stability.

Looking Toward 2026: Navigating the Easing Rate Cycle

Looking ahead to 2026, the primary challenge for US Bancorp will be managing the transition as the Federal Reserve is expected to implement two to three rate cuts, bringing the benchmark rate toward the 3.50%–3.75% range. The bank has issued a ""cautiously optimistic"" 2026 outlook, forecasting total net revenue growth of 4% to 6% and loan growth of 3% to 4%. Unlike many of its competitors, US Bancorp expects its Net Interest Margin to actually expand in 2026, targeting a NIM of over 2.80%.

This optimistic NIM forecast is based on ""balance sheet remixing."" As fixed-rate loans originated during the ultra-low-rate era of 2020-2021 mature, they are being replaced by new assets with significantly higher yields. Simultaneously, the bank expects to lower its deposit costs more aggressively than its loan yields fall. Furthermore, the bank’s $1 billion acquisition of institutional broker-dealer BTIG, announced in early January 2026, is expected to close in the second quarter. This move is a strategic pivot to capture more capital markets and institutional trading revenue, adding an estimated $175 million to $200 million in quarterly fee revenue by the end of the year.

Strategic adaptations will be required if the economy faces a harder-than-expected landing. While current GDP projections sit at a steady 2.0%, any spike in unemployment could test the bank’s consumer credit card portfolio, which saw balances grow 15.7% in 2025. However, US Bancorp’s management appears confident that their disciplined credit culture will allow them to lean into market opportunities while others are forced to retrench.

A Blueprint for Regional Banking Success

The takeaway from US Bancorp’s 2025 results is clear: scale and diversification are the new prerequisites for regional banking survival. By finishing the year with solid performance in both consumer and commercial segments, and specifically by supercharging its fee-based income, USB has proven it can thrive regardless of the Federal Reserve’s next move. The integration of MUFG Union Bank has not only provided the necessary scale but has also refreshed the bank’s deposit franchise in a way that will pay dividends for years to come.

As the market moves forward into 2026, the significance of US Bancorp’s results lies in its role as a bellwether for the ""super-regional"" class. Investors should watch for the closing of the BTIG deal and the continued expansion of the payments segment as key indicators of whether the bank can maintain its momentum. If US Bancorp can achieve its NIM expansion targets in a falling-rate environment, it will likely be rewarded with a valuation premium that separates it from the rest of the regional banking pack.

Ultimately, US Bancorp enters 2026 from a position of undeniable strength. Its ability to balance the traditional requirements of commercial banking with the high-growth potential of fintech-style payment services makes it a unique entity in the financial landscape. For investors and industry observers, the coming months will reveal if this diversified model can indeed provide the consistent, ""all-weather"" performance that management has promised.

AAPL and HPQ Performance Image Source: Zacks Investment Research HP shares are cheaper compared with Apple.","Apple AAPL and HP HPQ are well-known personal computer (PC) makers in a market that is expected to see a significant rise in DRAM and NAND/SSD prices due to a supply shortage driven by strong demand from AI data centers. IDC expects PC vendors to increase selling prices as cost pressures intensify in the second half of 2026. IDC expects PC shipments to contract between 2.2% and 8.9% in 2026 compared with 6.6% growth in 2025 due to challenging memory supply issues. So, PC vendors best able to manage their supply chain are expected to benefit in 2026. Nevertheless, rising demand for AI-powered PC is expected to be a key catalyst. So, Apple or HP, which PC vendor is well-positioned to ride these trends?

The Case for Apple Stock

Apple’s Mac business is benefiting from the latest macOS Tahoe 26 and the M5 chip. The company’s macOS Tahoe 26 introduces a stunning new design and powerful capabilities that enable users to get even more done with their Macs. Tahoe 26 offers personalized features, including an updated Control Center and new color options for folders, app icons and widgets. The Phone app on Mac now allows users to access familiar features from iPhone — including Recents, Contacts and Voicemails — and new ones like Call Screening and Hold Assist.

The M5 chip is built using 3 nm technology and introduces a next-generation 10-core GPU architecture, with a Neural Accelerator integrated into each core. This design enables GPU-based AI workloads to run, offering more than four times the peak GPU compute performance of M4. The new GPU also brings enhanced graphics capabilities and third-generation ray tracing, together delivering up to 45% higher graphics performance compared to M4. In October, Apple launched the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, powered by the M5 chip.

Apple’s strong Mac portfolio helped it gain market share in calendar 2025. Per IDC, Apple had a market share of 9%, up 30 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Shipment grew 11.1% year over year to hit 25.6 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal Mac sales is currently pegged at $8.43 billion, which indicates 9% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.

Apple’s diversified manufacturing base, which now includes India and Vietnam, is expected to help the iPhone-maker manage its supply chain. The company is now expanding its Apple Manufacturing Academy with new virtual programming as a part of its plan to invest $600 billion in the U.S. economy over the next four years.

The Case for HP Stock

Growing interest in Generative AI-enabled PCs might give a fresh boost to HP’s PC sales. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, AI PCs accounted for more than 30% of HP’s total PC shipments, reaching this milestone a quarter earlier than expected. These devices also deliver 5-10% higher average selling prices (ASPs) than traditional PCs, improving revenue mix and margins. Partnerships with Microsoft, Adobe and Zoom are accelerating adoption, as more applications are optimized for AI functionality. HP expects AI PCs to represent 40-50% of shipments in fiscal 2026, indicating a continued mix shift to richer configurations and higher ASPs.

HP’s forecast for fiscal 2026 PC demand raises concerns about the company’s growth prospects in the near term. The company expects PC unit volumes to fall in fiscal 2026, with only slight revenue growth coming from higher specifications, not from more buyers. The PC demand boost from the Windows 11 upgrade cycle is anticipated to fade in the second half of fiscal 2026, raising concern for investors. Rising DRAM and NAND prices may weigh on HP’s bottom-line performance in fiscal 2026. The company expects about 30-cents hit to non-GAAP earnings from higher memory costs in fiscal 2026.

Per IDC, HPQ had a market share of 20.2%, up 10 bps on a year-over-year basis in calendar 2025. Shipment grew 8.4% year over year to hit 57.5 million.

Earnings Estimate Revision Trend Positive for AAPL & HP

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $3.00 per share, down by 15 cents over the past 60 days, indicating an 4% decrease over fiscal 2025’s reported figure.

Is the retail media market entering a new phase of development and maturity?

Albertsons Media Collective announced in early January the launch of an in-store measurement system designed to assess the incremental sales impact of in-store advertising. The company said the approach uses a matched-market framework to compare sales results at stores running in-store ads with a control group of stores that do not display advertising. The method aims to isolate the effect of advertising by estimating how sales would have performed without media exposure.

Ahold Delhaize USA is expected to launch Edge, a custom-built advertising technology platform, this month. The platform will create new ways for consumer packaged goods suppliers to connect with the more than 26 million shoppers who interact with Ahold Delhaize USA banners each week through on-site display, sponsored search and in-store digital screens.

Is the retail media market entering a new phase of development and maturity? Coresight believes so and says 2026 will mark a critical inflection point. The firm attributes this shift to the need for existing retail media networks to scale more effectively and to growing advertiser demand for stronger performance, improved capabilities and greater standardization.

The global advisory and research firm released its “10 Trends Driving Retail Media” report on Jan. 9, grouping the trends into three categories: retail media platform expansion and channel evolution; technology, data and measurement transformation; and market structure and organizational realignment. The trends span topics ranging from in-store media to AI-driven ad formats.

1. Retail media networks expand beyond incrementality to support full-funnel advertising: As retail media networks improve audience reach, frequency control and insight into shopper behavior, brands are likely to increase their use of retail media for brand-building objectives.

2. In-store media accelerates as the next major retail media growth frontier: By 2026, retailers will expand in-store media through deeper partnerships with signage and content platforms and use AI to tailor messages to real-time traffic and shopper behavior. As cross-retailer frameworks link in-store impressions to basket-level outcomes, standardized measurement will strengthen advertiser confidence.

3. Closed-circuit television (CTV) emerges as a catalyst for retail media’s full-funnel expansion: Conversion in the lower funnel represents CTV’s primary value, given its ability to move viewers from awareness to action, often referred to as performance-driven CTV. This approach reflects the evolution of television advertising into a measurable, optimizable and commerce-connected channel, allowing advertisers to apply performance marketing discipline to premium video environments. With the introduction of shoppable features such as interactive overlays, QR codes and TV-to-cart experiences, CTV enables retailers to test and refine ways to shorten the path from discovery to purchase. These features give viewers a direct way to engage with ads and complete transactions.

4. Marketplaces continue to expand as key enablers of retail media scale: Retail marketplaces are driving retail media network growth by allowing retailers to expand product assortments, increase traffic and attract new advertisers. By opening online platforms to third-party sellers, retailers broaden coverage and expand visibility and conversion opportunities, lifting incremental media revenue.

5. Measurement standardization advances as industry frameworks and third-party solutions take hold: This year, the market is expected to move toward a more standardized, transparent and independently measured retail media ecosystem.

6. Self-service and programmatic capabilities expand, reshaping retail media operations: Retailers will continue expanding self-service tools that allow brands to control audience targeting, creative optimization, pacing and budgets. Programmatic integrations and automated workflows, supported by connections to demand-side platforms, identity solutions and planning tools, will bring greater consistency and transparency to pricing, reporting and optimization. These capabilities will connect on-site, off-site, CTV and in-store channels through a single interface and help unlock additional advertiser revenue.

7. AI transforms ad formats, targeting and workflow automation: The combination of AI-driven automation and real-time consumer targeting will enable retailers, brands and shoppers to engage more efficiently at every stage of the purchase journey.

8. First-party data grows in importance in a privacy-first environment: Retail media first-party data will play a critical role in shaping advertising strategies. As retailers and brands strengthen data partnerships and incorporate AI, ads are expected to deliver stronger results in both performance and privacy.

9. Emerging retail media networks gain traction through category and audience differentiation: Networks will need to continue investing in measurement, attribution and advanced targeting capabilities to demonstrate value to advertisers and capture greater market share.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/blt2b1ed4be71aeeda6/6971189eaeb0362e5b115bbe/A_hand_typing_on_a_laptop_with_shopping_cart_symbols.webp?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-21 15:07:13.376845

Conclusion The SFO's return of £400,000 to victims is more than a one-off.","[co-author: Alex Cumming]

On 8 January 2026, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced that it will return £400,000 to nine victims of a global email fraud dating back more than two decades. The move, achieved through a civil recovery order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA), highlights an innovative use of the SFO's powers: enabling victim compensation, rather than remittance to HM Treasury, and deploying flexible legal tools where prosecution is impracticable.

A novel route to restitution

The fraud, orchestrated by Abdallah Ali Jammal between 2001 and 2002, was essentially an advance fee fraud and involved unsolicited emails promising commissions for helping release funds from overseas accounts. Some £4.4 million was stolen from 18 individuals worldwide. Jammal fled before he could be charged and is believed to remain in Lebanon.

Investigators froze assets during the original probe, including funds linked to Jammal Trust Bank; a bank later liquidated after US sanctions were imposed for its links to a terrorist organisation. With no realistic prospect of a criminal conviction, the SFO applied to the High Court on behalf of the victims for a declaration that the money was recoverable property under section 281 POCA.

Under this section, if certain statutory conditions are met – namely that the applicant was deprived of the property by unlawful conduct, the property was not recoverable property immediately before they were deprived of it, and the property belongs to the applicant – the court may declare the property as belonging to the victim. The ruling, obtained in 2023, enabled the SFO to redirect frozen funds to victims rather than HM Treasury. This approach was appropriate as the victims could establish a proprietary claim to funds traceable to their losses, rather than the funds being treated as general criminal assets to be forfeited to the state. It also avoided the complexities associated with criminal prosecution, particularly where the perpetrator remains outside UK jurisdiction.

This is the first time that the SFO has used POCA in this way, and their announcement states that they will “now seek to use this technique across other relevant cases.”

How does this fit with the SFO's wider posture?

This novel method of enforcement illustrates two themes running through the SFO's 2024-29 Strategy and 2025-26 Business Plan: a commitment to international partnership and a willingness to use every tool available to deliver tangible outcomes. The latter has been a strategic focus of Nick Ephgrave since he became Director of the SFO. In his first speech as Director in February 2024, Ephgrave emphasised the need for innovative investigative techniques and a results-driven approach.

In this case, tracing and verifying victim accounts required multi-agency cooperation. The SFO worked with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Australian Federal Police, Belgian Police, the French Liaison Magistrate and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office to locate the victims and secure their consent for the action. This level of collaboration highlights the complexity of cross-border fraud cases and reflects the SFO's ambition to be “the partner of choice both domestically and internationally”.

More broadly, the restitution move aligns with a discernible shift in the SFO's approach: flexibility, pragmatism, and victim-centric outcomes. Historically, the agency's enforcement model has been criticised for lengthy timelines and limited visible impact. Recent developments, however, suggest a recalibration.

In 2025, the SFO secured its first Unexplained Wealth Order and executed coordinated dawn raids in connection with its investigation into Basis Markets, signalling a more assertive use of powers and a determination to accelerate case progression. The agency also issued new guidance on cooperation and enforcement, introducing a presumption in favour of Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) for corporates that self-report and cooperate fully, alongside commitments to faster timelines.

The restitution initiative now adds a third dimension to this evolving approach: prioritising victim compensation even where criminal prosecution is not viable. Taken together, these developments point to a pragmatic enforcement model that combines speed, partnership, and tangible outcomes, reshaping expectations of how the SFO will deploy its powers in the years ahead.

Practical implications for corporates

Expect civil recovery to feature more often where prosecution is impractical, with implications for disclosure and asset-tracing support.

Victim compensation is now a priority in enforcement outcomes and may influence DPA negotiations.

Cross-border readiness matters: multi-agency cooperation brings accelerated timelines and complex data requests.

Legacy risks can persist: old issues can resurface if money was frozen at the time – or if it can still be traced.

Conclusion

The SFO's return of £400,000 to victims is more than a one-off. It signals a broader shift toward flexible enforcement, international collaboration, and victim-centric outcomes. For corporates, that means recalibrating expectations and readiness for an enforcement landscape where civil recovery and international partnership are firmly part of the toolkit.

I'm your host, Arnold Davick, reporting from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Here are the top IT stories you need to know for Wednesday, January 21st.

Up first, Google just launched a new AI shopping standard called the Universal Commerce Protocol, or UCP. It's an open standard that enables different AI agents, payment systems and stores to collaborate through a common language with partners like Shopify, Etsy, Walmart and Target and payment giant Visa and MasterCard.

UCP aims to make checkout frictionless. Soon, instant checkout could be coming to AI mode in search and the Gemini app. The big change is fewer redirects and less tab hopping. From CIO, IBM is stepping up its push into sovereign computing with Sovereign Core.

It is a software stack designed to run across multiple cloud platforms, not just one provider's environment. Sovereign deployments typically try to combine cloud benefits with strategic autonomy. The focus is on keeping data encryption keys and access policies under local authority.

Meanwhile, applications would still move between on prem systems, regional partners and major clouds. IBM is also emphasizing continuous compliance and support for sovereign AI as regulations tightening. And from CSO Online, the World Economic Forum warns cyber risk is accelerating in 2026 and AI is a major driver.

The widespread integration of AI systems adds an expanded attack surface that creates novel vulnerabilities that traditional security controls were not designed to address. Attackers can scale phishing fraud and exploit supply chain weak spots faster.

Ophthalmic device business BVI has named former Insulet CEO Jim Hollingshead as its next leader, the company said Monday.

Hollingshead led Insulet, which sells the Omnipod insulin pump, for three years before resigning in 2025. Ashley McEvoy, the former head of Johnson & Johnson’s medtech business, replaced Hollingshead.

Hollingshead will now replace Shervin Korangy as CEO of BVI. The change in leadership comes after BVI raised $1 billion in capital last year. BVI is using the money to accelerate product innovation and expand its global footprint.

Adobe Systems (ADBE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this software maker have returned -17.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Adobe belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Adobe is expected to post earnings of $5.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.44 points to a change of +11.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.56 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Adobe is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Adobe is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

In the case of Adobe, the consensus sales estimate of $6.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.9%. The $26.03 billion and $28.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.5% and +9.4%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Adobe reported revenues of $6.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.5%. EPS of $5.5 for the same period compares with $4.81 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.5%. The EPS surprise was +2.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Adobe is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Adobe. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Hershey’s was founded in 1894 — and has been a chocolate favorite for 132 years.

The company, which relied on in-store displays for decades, shifted to media ads in 1970 to confront competition. Brand campaigns have been intermittent — “Hershey. It’s Your Happy Place” — is the first since 2018.

The new work launches with five U.S. Winter Olympic and Paralympic athletes and their families ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympic (Feb. 6) and Paralympic Games (March 6). The athletes are Brenna Huckaby, parasnowboarding, Erin Jackson, speedskaking, Hilary Knight, ice hockey, Jason Brown, figure skating, and Jordan Stolz, speedskating.

Two spots are here and here.

IPG's The Martin Agency is producing creative throughout the year, with various social and digital executions. The spots position Hershey's as a familiar source of happiness. MiltonONE is a dedicated team formed by Publicis Groupe specifically to handle U.S. media for The Hershey Company. Digitas, part of that team, handles integrated media.

""It’s actually a pretty bold statement to say you exist as a brand to make people happy, and it’s refreshing to help make work that’s able to follow through. Also, I definitely didn’t cry on set. My eyes just got really watery for some reason,"" Patrick Wells, associate creative director, The Martin Agency, told Agency Daily.

Jerry Hoak, Chief Creative Officer at The Martin Agency, added: ""The Opening Ceremony of the Olympics is the perfect place to launch a new brand platform for one of America’s most storied brands. We’ve spent decades telling athletes that gold is everything. Win gold. Happiness follows. But this first brand work proves that it goes way deeper than that. It’s the journey, the memories and the people who got you there that represent your true Happy Place.""

In addition to ads, limited-edition Hershey’s chocolate medals, crafted with embossed designs and wrapped in gold foil, will drop on Feb. 13 at The Hershey's Store and TikTok Shop.

Hershey's has a sizable candy line, including Reese's, Kisses, KitKat, Jolly Rancher and Twizzlers, which propel more than $11.2 billion in annual revs, per the company.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2026/01/19/brown_hersheys_l0T8PWS.png,N,,2026-01-21 11:09:50.716330

She then went back in 2012 as part of Expedition 32/33 and became the space station commander for Expedition 33.
Williams had 608 days in space, the second-longest cumulative time in space by a NASA astronaut.
She has done something that no one else has: run a marathon in space, NASA said.
She was the director of Operations in Star City, Russia, and established a helicopter training platform to help future astronauts for moon missions, NASA said.","Suni Williams, one of the NASA astronauts whose trip to the International Space Station was extended from days to months, has retired from the agency.

NASA announced her retirement, saying that it was effective on Dec. 27, 2025.

“Suni Williams has been a trailblazer in human spaceflight, shaping the future of exploration through her leadership aboard the space station and paving the way for commercial missions to low Earth orbit,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a news release. “Her work advancing science and technology has laid the foundation for Artemis missions to the Moon and advancing toward Mars, and her extraordinary achievements will continue to inspire generations to dream big and push the boundaries of what’s possible. Congratulations on your well-deserved retirement, and thank you for your service to NASA and our nation.”

Williams is originally from Needham, Massachusetts, and has a bachelor’s degree in physical science from the U.S. Naval Academy.

She earned a master’s degree in engineering management from Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida.

The retired Navy captain is also a helicopter pilot and fixed-wing pilot, logging more than 4,000 flight hours in 40 different aircraft, NASA said.

But space is her place.

“Anyone who knows me knows that space is my absolute favorite place to be,” Williams said in the announcement. “It’s been an incredible honor to have served in the Astronaut Office and have had the opportunity to fly in space three times. I had an amazing 27-year career at NASA, and that is mainly because of all the wonderful love and support I’ve received from my colleagues. The International Space Station, the people, the engineering, and the science are truly awe-inspiring and have made the next steps of exploration to the Moon and Mars possible. I hope the foundation we set has made these bold steps a little easier. I am super excited for NASA and its partner agencies as we take these next steps, and I can’t wait to watch the agency make history.”

Williams first went into space on the shuttle Discovery in 2006 and returned on the shuttle Atlantis. She then went back in 2012 as part of Expedition 32/33 and became the space station commander for Expedition 33.

Williams had 608 days in space, the second-longest cumulative time in space by a NASA astronaut.

She also performed the sixth-longest single spaceflight by an American. Williams and is tied with Butch Wilmore. Both were on the Boeing Starliner as part of a test mission and then returned to Earth as part of SpaceX Crew-9 in March 2025, after there were issues with the Starliner, which kept the pair on the ISS for 286 days.

Williams also completed nine spacewalks for 62 hours and six minutes, the longest amount of time for a female astronaut and the fourth most cumulative hours.

She has done something that no one else has: run a marathon in space, NASA said.

Williams didn’t just contribute to NASA with her trips into space. She was part of the NEEMO crew, or NASA Extreme Environments Mission Operations, living for nine days in an underwater habitat.

She was the director of Operations in Star City, Russia, and established a helicopter training platform to help future astronauts for moon missions, NASA said.

Simply Wall St has no position in any stocks mentioned.","Approach 2: Eli Lilly Price vs Earnings

For a profitable company, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to gauge how much investors are paying for each dollar of earnings, which makes it a useful cross check against a DCF model.

What counts as a “normal” P/E depends a lot on how fast earnings are expected to grow and how risky those earnings are. Higher growth and lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty usually calls for a lower one.

Eli Lilly currently trades on a P/E of 50.64x. That compares with a Pharmaceuticals industry average P/E of 20.49x and a peer average of 17.07x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Eli Lilly is 42.00x, which is its proprietary estimate of a suitable P/E given factors such as earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk profile. This Fair Ratio can be more informative than a simple comparison to peers or the industry, because it adjusts for company specific characteristics rather than assuming all firms deserve similar multiples. On this basis, Eli Lilly’s current P/E sits above its Fair Ratio, which points to the shares looking expensive on earnings.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Eli Lilly Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about Eli Lilly linked directly to your own numbers for future revenue, earnings, margins and a fair value estimate. A Narrative starts with how you see the company, turns that story into a financial forecast, then ties that forecast to a fair value you can compare with the current share price to help you decide whether the stock looks attractive or stretched for your goals. On Simply Wall St, Narratives sit inside the Community page, where millions of investors share and refine these story plus numbers views in an accessible format you can copy, adjust and make your own. Each Narrative automatically refreshes its fair value when new information arrives, such as news or earnings, so your view stays aligned with the latest data rather than a static spreadsheet. For Eli Lilly, one investor might set a relatively high fair value based on optimistic assumptions about future margins while another might choose a lower fair value with more cautious expectations, and you can see both side by side.

Livingston S. A compounding pharmacy hits back at Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk with antitrust lawsuit.","An Arizona-based compounding pharmacy has filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk of unlawfully restricting competition in the market for GLP-1 medications, escalating a legal battle over compounded versions of blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs.

Strive Compounding Pharmacy filed the complaint on January 14, 2026, in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging that the 2 pharmaceutical manufacturers engaged in exclusionary conduct designed to suppress compounded GLP-1 products and preserve market dominance for their branded therapies.

Allegations of Anticompetitive Conduct

According to the lawsuit, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk entered into exclusive agreements with telehealth companies that prohibited those platforms from working with compounding pharmacies. Strive claims these arrangements prevented clinicians from prescribing, and patients from accessing, compounded GLP-1 medications—particularly personalized versions tailored to individual patient needs.

The complaint alleges that Lilly also disparaged compounded GLP-1 drugs by falsely characterizing them as unsafe and grouping them alongside “counterfeit” or “fake” medications. Strive contends this messaging was intended to discourage prescribers and telehealth providers from issuing prescriptions for compounded GLP-1 therapies.

“Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk’s conduct has unlawfully restricted competition and directly harmed GLP-1 patients in the United States,” the complaint states. Strive alleges that patients have been forced to pay higher prices and have faced reduced access to GLP-1 medications as a result.

Background: GLP-1 Shortages and Compounding Practices

Compounding pharmacies have historically produced customized versions of branded medications during periods of drug shortages or when patients require formulations not commercially available, such as alternative dosages or the removal of allergenic ingredients. While compounded drugs are not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, compounding facilities are regulated by the FDA and state boards of pharmacy.

Between 2022 and 2025, shortages of GLP-1 medications created an opportunity for compounding pharmacies to produce copies of semaglutide and tirzepatide products to fill gaps in patient access. Although the FDA later declared the shortages resolved, many compounding pharmacies continued producing customized GLP-1 formulations.

Strive argues that it introduced meaningful competition by offering compounded GLP-1 medications “at a fraction of the price” of branded alternatives. The lawsuit claims Lilly and Novo responded not by competing on price or access, but by working to limit prescriptions for compounded drugs.

Prior Litigation Between the Parties

The lawsuit follows earlier litigation initiated by Eli Lilly against Strive. In April 2025, Lilly sued Strive over its compounded tirzepatide products, alleging the pharmacy made false claims regarding safety, efficacy, and personalization. That case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, though Lilly refiled the lawsuit in Arizona in October.

A Lilly spokesperson responded to Strive’s antitrust filing by stating that the lawsuit is “wrong, on both the facts and law,” and characterized it as an attempt to deflect attention from Strive’s own conduct. Novo Nordisk did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.

Claims of Market Interference

Strive’s complaint also alleges that Lilly interfered with its relationships with medical practitioners, technology platforms, and payment processors. According to the filing, public disparagement of compounded GLP-1 drugs contributed to social media platforms removing GLP-1-related groups and prompted payment processors such as Tebra and Stripe to warn prescribers that payment processing could be paused for issuing prescriptions for compounded medications.

Strive claims these actions collectively restricted its ability to operate and limited patient access to compounded GLP-1 therapies.

Key Takeaways

Antitrust scrutiny is expanding into pharmaceutical manufacturers’ relationships with telehealth companies and their impact on compounded drug access.

Compounding pharmacies continue to face legal and regulatory pressure following the resolution of GLP-1 drug shortages.

Pharmacy professionals should monitor how exclusive contracting and product disparagement claims may influence prescribing practices and patient access to personalized medications.

Responses to the RFP will help inform partnerships, procurement strategies, and infrastructure planning as part of a broader reindustrialization effort.","AI research and deployment company and ChatGPT supplier OpenAI has a long-term ambition to establish US-based hardware manufacturing and assembly that reflects US values, supports resilient supply chains, and fosters national innovation leadership. As part of that effort, the company has launched a new Request for Proposals (RFP) focused on US-based manufacturing across key parts of the AI supply chain, including data center inputs, consumer electronics, and robotics. The goal is to identify and enable domestic manufacturing capacity that can help shorten timelines, strengthen resilience, and extend technology leadership as AI infrastructure scales.

OpenAI is making these investments to accelerate US capability building in this critical sector. Over the next 10 years, OpenAI seeks to localize significant portions of the manufacturing for its hardware devices and data centers, including key components, modules, and final assembly. This Request for Proposals (RFP) seeks strategic US partners who can scale advanced manufacturing in support of OpenAI hardware programs in consumer electronics, AI data centers, and robotics, aligned with long-term US industrial goals and OpenAI commercial roadmaps.

The company views building the infrastructure required to power advanced AI as a historic opportunity to strengthen domestic supply chains and reindustrialize the country by catalyzing US manufacturing, modernizing the energy grid, creating well-paid jobs, and strengthening American leadership.

The company is seeking proposals from manufacturers, suppliers, and partners who are building—or are prepared to build—critical components and systems for the AI ecosystem in the United States, including:

Modules, tooling and equipment, and final assembly for consumer electronics.

Manufacturing for compute, power, cooling, and supporting data center hardware.

Critical inputs for advanced robotics (e.g., gearboxes, motors, power electronics).

When people talk about AI infrastructure, the conversation often stops at chips and data centers. But advanced AI depends on a much broader ecosystem of physical components: the racks, cabling, networking gear, cooling systems, power systems, power electronics, electromechanical modules, and testing and assembly capacity are all required to bring it online at scale. This RFP aims to build on momentum that already exists by identifying where targeted partnerships, demand signals, and coordination can help unlock faster growth, larger scale, and more durable US leadership in AI.

Responses to the RFP will help inform partnerships, procurement strategies, and infrastructure planning as part of a broader reindustrialization effort. The company will review proposals on a rolling basis and follow up with selected respondents on next steps. The deadline to submit a proposal is June 2026.

Summary

IREN Limited has executed a successful AI pivot, outperforming peers like MARA Holdings and positioning itself as a leading data center provider. It is a first mover, like Nvidia in 2021.

My DCF-based valuation model suggests IREN is worth $80–$580 per share, with a current price near $55 presenting a compelling entry point.

IREN's upside depends on scaling data center capacity, prudent capital allocation, and sustained AI demand; risks include overleveraging and a potential slowdown in AI.

I assign IREN stock a Buy rating, viewing it as a relatively safe investment rather than an asymmetric bet, given current market expectations.

MARA may outperform IREN going forward, but I find IREN's investment case more compelling today. I entered a position in the stock and partially reallocated from MARA.

Throughout 2025, I made the mistake of stubbornly focusing on MARA Holdings (MARA) as an asymmetric AI bet. My fundamental investment thesis was not incorrect: moving data center capacity from Bitcoin (

Decoding markets beyond P/E. As an investor, I either put my money into low cost funds or in single stocks that (I think) are asymmetric bets. My portfolio is roughly 50/50 between the two. I like to write about Macro and Fundamentals, with the (painful) awareness that Momentum and Sentiment are what really matters. That’s why I never try to time the market and I only buy stocks if I am willing to hold them for at least 10 years.When it comes to fundamentals, everybody knows the market is forward looking, but few understand what that means. I don’t look at a P/E number and decide to buy if a stock is “cheap”. I see markets as literally just the meeting point between demand and supply. Predicting human behavior is key.I always try to understand what the market is seeing in a stock beyond the numbers, which often implies trying to understand sectors, industries and long term growth trends. My approach requires ingenuity, curiosity and a good dose of naivete, as well as being comfortable in (sometimes) going against the current.I am based in Geneva, Switzerland (hence my SA name) and I have a Master’s Degree in Business.

The investment from NPS into the Single Family Housing Fund will be used by Long Harbour to deploy up to £600 million, including leverage, into single-family homes across the UK.

The loan will fund the development costs for the current and pipeline schemes associated with the London-headquartered manager’s Single Family Housing Fund.

Barclays’ loan finances the first two transactions by the manager on behalf of the vehicle, which totalled £180 million in acquisition costs. The first deal was the forward funding of 105 homes in Newhall, Derbyshire, in May 2025, followed by the purchase in December of 369 rental homes from Dandara in Horsham and Great Dunmow, and Miller Homes in Kent.

Barclays was an active lender in the residential sector in 2025. The bank lent across UK residential rental, build‑to‑rent and social housing schemes, typically via corporate and fund‑level facilities. In May, the bank provided a £50 million revolving credit facility to the Urban Splash Residential Fund to support the continued creation of UK rental homes, replacing a £20 million facility issued by Barclays in 2023.

During the first three quarters of 2025, Barclays lent a total of €7.96 billion and had a loan book of €12.9 billion, according to REC Europe’s Active Lenders 2025.

Single-family housing fund

In January 2025, Long Harbour secured a seed equity commitment of £300 million from South Korea’s National Pension Fund. The vehicle, which is targeting £1.2 billion of capital commitments over the next 18 months, will acquire new-build family homes across the UK, focussing on the south and southeast of England.

The investment from NPS into the Single Family Housing Fund will be used by Long Harbour to deploy up to £600 million, including leverage, into single-family homes across the UK. The deployment target for the fund is £1.6 billion.

The manager anticipates holding a second close for the vehicle during 2026 with a final close expected in 2027. Should it reach its target size, the fund will be Long Harbour’s largest-ever closed-end fundraise, as per affiliate title PERE.

Jack Spearman, managing director of single-family housing at Long Harbour, said: “Scaling [the fund’s] portfolio and meeting our ambitious deployment targets requires well-structured debt funding that can support forward funding for our investments. The option to extend the size on the loan with Barclays based on future acquisitions gives us flexibility while we focus on identifying the best opportunities in the market.”

Established in 2009, Long Harbour has £3.3 billion of residential assets under management across the UK and Europe. Its first investment in single-family assets was in 2013, with the acquisition of a portfolio of homes from Lloyds Bank, and it subsequently invested in the sector through its LHIF I fund, which was fully divested by 2022.",https://media.recapitalnews.com/uploads/2026/01/02-Corner-Turner.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:08:57.740348

These companies represent breakthrough innovations across quantum computing, artificial intelligence, biotech, and other foundational technologies, and will participate in Alchemist’s flagship six-month program designed to accelerate fundraising outcomes, expand enterprise traction, and prepare startups for scalable growth.

Selected from a competitive pool of nearly 400 applicants, Alchemist Chicago’s Phase 1 featured 27 startups representing more than 10 cities and five countries. Following the program’s customer validation and proof of concept curriculum, startups in Phase 2 have demonstrated exceptional technical strength, market potential, and readiness for commercialization

“Alchemist Chicago was built to help deep tech founders bridge the gap between breakthrough science and real-world impact,” said Samir Mayekar, managing director of the Polsky Center. “These teams have shown not only technical excellence, but also the discipline and market focus required to build lasting companies.”

Phase 2 of Alchemist Chicago is designed to help founders sharpen commercial readiness, build traction, and prepare for fundraising by aligning technical innovation with clear customer value. During this phase, teams receive customized 1:1 coaching, curated investor introductions, and direct access to Alchemist’s global investor and enterprise network, culminating in Demo Day in May 2026.

“This is where we see founders translate their technology into compelling commercial opportunities,” said Shyama Majumdar, senior director of science accelerators and investments at the Polsky Center. “These startups are tackling some of the hardest problems in science and engineering, and this next phase provides the tailored support, capital exposure, and partnerships needed to move from proof to market.”

QodeX Quantum and SQK, two startups participating in Alchemist Chicago, also benefit from the University of Chicago’s collaboration with IBM Ventures to advance quantum computing software and algorithm development through Duality, the nation’s first quantum startup accelerator.

Through this collaboration, these startups will have access to IBM technical expertise, plus funding support, and may gain access to IBM’s cloud-based quantum computing resources, including the opportunity to work on the IBM Quantum System Two that’s planned to be deployed at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park (IQMP).

“We’re looking forward to collaborating with Qodex Quantum and SQK and equipping them with the resources, mentorship, and strategic connections they need to succeed,” said Emily Fontaine, global head of venture capital at IBM. “By providing access to IBM quantum technology, valuable networks, customer ecosystems, and clear pathways to practical applications, we aim to help these founders drive sustainable, long-term growth. This effort is strengthened by the University of Chicago’s collaboration with IBM, which reflects our shared commitment to advancing breakthrough technologies and accelerating real-world impact through quantum computing.”

Launched last year, Alchemist Chicago combines Alchemist’s global track record of launching category-defining B2B companies with the University of Chicago’s research leadership, national laboratory affiliations, and commercialization expertise.

Alchemist Chicago operates as part of Alchemist’s flagship accelerator platform, enabling founders in the Midwest and beyond to tap into a global venture ecosystem while remaining closely connected to the University of Chicago’s research enterprise. The program is open to founders worldwide, with no University affiliation required.

“Deep tech – the novel bits, atoms and science powering the future’s most impactful innovations – has never been more relevant or important,” said Ian Bergman, partner and managing director at Alchemist. “We’re thrilled to see a group of founders who have shown remarkable vision and momentum advance to Phase 2 of Alchemist Chicago, joining Alchemist’s flagship Class 41 and accessing the network, resources, and community that will help them take the important next steps on their journey.”

LLY's oral obesity drug is expected to differentiate the company, expand patient access, and accelerate global scaling, particularly in markets where injectables face adoption barriers.

LLY faces intensifying generics competition and price wars, especially in ex-US markets like China, which could pressure margins despite its robust pipeline and diversification.

LLY's forward multiple has compressed to 33x, near its 10-year average, indicating the market has priced in execution risks but still supports a Buy given healthy consolidation and upcoming catalysts.

A new report, Watering the New Economy: Managing the Impacts of the AI Revolution, provides what Xylem calls the most comprehensive assessment to date of how AI is reshaping global water use.
It also highlights practical ways to meet that demand while strengthening water security for communities.
By the middle of the century, this expansion is projected to add 30 trillion liters of water demand, annually, fueled by a surge in power generation (~54% of the increase), semiconductor fabrication (~42%), and data center expansion (~4%).
“Our projections examine water use across the full AI value chain – from chip fabrication and data center operations to indirect demand from power generation – and assess how technology choices shape future demand,” said Christopher Gasson, CEO, Global Water Intelligence.","The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is set to drive a 129% increase in global water demand across the AI value chain by 2050, according to new research by Xylem and Global Water Intelligence (GWI).

A new report, Watering the New Economy: Managing the Impacts of the AI Revolution, provides what Xylem calls the most comprehensive assessment to date of how AI is reshaping global water use. It also highlights practical ways to meet that demand while strengthening water security for communities.

Citing a report from Gartner, the research notes spending on AI is forecasted to approach $2 trillion in 2026, accelerating the modernization of infrastructure across the world. By the middle of the century, this expansion is projected to add 30 trillion liters of water demand, annually, fueled by a surge in power generation (~54% of the increase), semiconductor fabrication (~42%), and data center expansion (~4%).

On one important note, the report finds that this additional demand does not have to result in competition between industry and communities.

Today, global water systems process roughly 320 trillion liters of wastewater annually and lose an estimated 100 trillion liters through aging infrastructure – volumes that, if recovered through targeted investment, could substantially offset AI’s projected growth in water use and reduce strain on freshwater resources, the report says.

The report calls for a coordinated “water transition” centered on water reuse, digital infrastructure, and cross-sector partnerships – to ensure water is a resilient foundation for economic growth, rather than a constraint on innovation.

“AI is placing new demands on water supplies, but many of the tools needed to address the challenge already exist,” said Matthew Pine, Xylem’s president and CEO. “Advanced treatment technologies, for example, allow us to recycle water rather than waste it. Digital systems can help better manage supply in real time, reducing water lost to leaks. It’s time for a water transition built on targeted investment and collaboration between industry, utilities, and governments to ensure water systems can support both growth and community resilience.”

The analysis also highlights rising geographic risk. Nearly 40% of existing data centers are already located in regions experiencing high water stress, and future growth is expected to concentrate in similarly constrained watersheds, citing a report from S&P Global. This underscores the need for localized, basin-level solutions, even as global efficiency gains create headroom for growth.

“Our projections examine water use across the full AI value chain – from chip fabrication and data center operations to indirect demand from power generation – and assess how technology choices shape future demand,” said Christopher Gasson, CEO, Global Water Intelligence. “The greatest pressure points emerge in semiconductor manufacturing and in fast-growing data center hubs in the United States, East Asia, and South Asia. In these regions, expanded wastewater reuse, leakage reduction, and targeted infrastructure investment can fully offset future growth.”

The report points to early examples of how collaboration can deliver shared benefits. In Mexico, for example, utilities in Mexico City and Monterrey worked together with Amazon and Xylem on smart pipeline upgrades to reduce leaks. A system of sensors and advanced analytics will save more than 1.3 billion liters of water a year and help improve the reliability of water supplies for residents.

Nvidia was a $5 trillion company, but only briefly Nvidia entered 2025 valued at just over $3 trillion, so it would take a significant gain for it to breach the $5 trillion mark.
Following President Trump's tariff announcements in April, this prediction was in even worse shape as Nvidia was nearly a $2 trillion company.
However, as the market rallied throughout the year, Nvidia became the first $5 trillion company in October, although it is no longer at that level.","At the end of 2024, I predicted that Nvidia (NVDA +1.21%) would be a $5 trillion company in 2025. The reasons for this prediction were rather simple: The AI hyperscalers would continue spending at a rapid pace, and I was right on that account.

However, I was wrong about Nvidia's valuation multiples. Nvidia breached the $5 trillion market cap level, and although it's below that threshold right now, I think it will return in 2026.

Nvidia was a $5 trillion company, but only briefly

Nvidia entered 2025 valued at just over $3 trillion, so it would take a significant gain for it to breach the $5 trillion mark. Following President Trump's tariff announcements in April, this prediction was in even worse shape as Nvidia was nearly a $2 trillion company.

However, as the market rallied throughout the year, Nvidia became the first $5 trillion company in October, although it is no longer at that level.

What drove it there was the insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), and AI hyperscalers willing to spend a near-unlimited amount of money on computing equipment. That trend didn't shift throughout 2025, and there are no indications it will change in 2026. As a result, I think Nvidia will end the year solidly in the $5 trillion club.

However, one part of my projection was wrong.

Nvidia's valuation is cheaper than I expected

At the end of 2024 (when I made the initial prediction), Nvidia had a price-to-forward earnings ratio of 45. I called that a bit expensive, but it's slightly cheaper now at 40 times forward earnings.

Make no mistake; Nvidia's stock still isn't cheap. However, the other big tech stocks' valuation levels have climbed to around the 30 times forward earnings level. That gives Nvidia a slight premium over its peers, but I still think that it's a much better buy. After all, which big tech company will be able to match Nvidia's growth this year?

The fourth quarter earnings season is picking up speed.

After several big banks reported last week, more financials will deliver results, with reports from Charles Schwab (SCHW) and regional banks like Fifth Third (FITB) on the schedule. But the attention will likely shift to Netflix (NFLX) and Intel (INTC), headlining the earnings calendar.

An optimistic consensus is forming: As of Jan. 16, 7% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have reported fourth quarter results, according to FactSet data, and Wall Street analysts estimate an 8.2% increase in earnings per share for the fourth quarter. If that rate holds, it would represent the 10th consecutive quarter of annual earnings growth for the index.

Heading into the reporting period, analysts were expecting an 8.3% jump in earnings per share, down from the third quarter's 13.6% earnings growth rate. Wall Street has raised its earnings expectations in recent months, especially for tech companies, which have driven earnings growth in recent quarters.

Although Big Tech continues to set the tone, this earnings season promises to test the improved stock market breadth that has emerged at the start of 2026. Plus, the themes that drove the markets in 2025 — artificial intelligence, the Trump administration's tariff and economic policies, and a K-shaped consumer economy — will continue to provide plenty for investors to parse.

In addition to quarterly reports from Netflix and Intel, the earnings releases highlighting this week's schedule include United Airlines (UAL), 3M Company (MMM), D.R. Horton (DHI), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), GE Aerospace (GE), Procter & Gamble (PG), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), and Capital One (COF).

Netflix stock falls as Warner Bros. Discovery bid adds pressure

Netflix (NFLX) stock dropped more than 4% in after-hours trading as the company's fourth quarter earnings were closely scrutinized amid Netflix's bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).

The creator of ""Squid Game"" and other popular shows said it would ramp up new content in the year ahead and pause its share repurchase program, given the M&A deal with Warner Bros. Discovery.

Netflix posted diluted earnings per share of $0.56, coming in ahead of Wall Street's forecasts of $0.55 per share. Revenue of $12 billion also beat estimates of $11.96 billion, according to Bloomberg data.

The company's operating margin declined slightly to 24.5% from 28.2% last quarter but increased from Q4 2024. For the current quarter, Netflix guided for an operating margin of 32.1%, which was a bit lighter than the Street expected.

Charles Schwab stock rises as trading volume boosts results

Charles Schwab (SCHW) stock rose over 1.7% on Wednesday after the brokerage and asset manager posted 22% annual revenue growth, supported by record trading volumes, but missed the high expectations set by Wall Street.

Fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.33 fell short of analyst estimates of $1.35 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $6.33 billion also came up short of expectations for $6.39 billion.

""While we had anticipated some moderation in client trading activity towards the back end of the year, we instead saw an acceleration in activity, which contributed to higher volume-related costs, inclusive of performance-based compensation,"" Charles Schwab CFO Michael Verdeschi said on the earnings call.

Net interest revenue grew 25% year over year to 3.1 billion. Asset management revenue increased 14% to $1.7 billion. And revenue from trading surged 22% to $1 billion.

Schwab brought in record client assets during the quarter, the company said, as total client accounts grew 6% year-over-year to 46.5 million.

Halliburton stock climbs after the oil services giant posts better-than-expected profits

Oil services provider Halliburton (HAL) posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, sending its shares up 2%.

The Houston-based company reported profits of $0.70 per diluted share, beating Wall Street estimates of $0.55 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Profits were flat from a year ago, when the company also posted earnings of $0.70 per share.

Revenue of $5.7 billion also came in stronger than the $5.4 billion estimated. It was also higher than the $5.6 billion in revenue reported a year ago.

Halliburton's revenue in its Completion and Production segment was roughly unchanged from a year ago at $3.3 billion, while revenue in the Drilling and Evaluation unit was $2.4 billion, also flat.

While the oil majors have shown reluctance in exploring Venezuelan oil following the US's removal of Nicolás Maduro (ExxonMobil's (XOM) CEO called it ""uninvestable""), oil infrastructure companies like Halliburton have shown more eagerness to revisit the country.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that the company has started looking at resumes for roles in the country, in a sign that Halliburton may be ready to reenter Venezuela.

The stock has started the year off strong, with an 11% gain since the beginning of 2026.

Fastenal stock declines after execs note headwinds in the 'sluggish industrial economy'

Industrial bellwether Fastenal (FAST) is battling a ""sluggish industrial economy,"" the company's executives said on an earnings call on Tuesday.

After reporting earnings per share of $0.26, in line with analyst estimates, the company's new CFO Max Tunnicliff said that the industrial sector has ""continued to see mixed signals."" Tunnicliff noted that ""while some areas showed resilience, others faced continued headwinds that impacted demand and supply chains.""

Shares of Fastenal, which produces an array of products such as bolts, nuts, screws, and studs for industrial manufacturing and construction materials, fell more than 2.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday.

Sales of $2.02 billion slightly missed analyst estimates for $2.04 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Touching on the company's heavy manufacturing markets, Fastenal president Jeffery Watts added that, while the company hasn't seen declines, demand has been flat.

""We're not really seeing [the economy improve], but we're also not seeing any declines in our manufacturing as far as the year-over-year usage,"" he said.

U.S. Bancorp earnings beat on record consumer deposits, CEO says credit card rate limit would be 'detrimental' to 'crushing' for consumers

U.S. Bancorp (USB) gained about 1% in midmorning trading on Tuesday after the Minneapolis-based super-regional bank reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter on the back of strong consumer deposits.

The U.S. Bank parent reported $4.31 billion in net interest income, a 3.3% annual rise that topped Wall Street estimates for $4.28 billion. Revenue of $7.36 billion also beat estimates of $7.31 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Earnings of $1.26 per share came in higher than the $1.19 per share the Street was expecting.

U.S. Bancorp said it achieved record consumer deposits in the fourth quarter and saw green shoots in the beaten-down commercial real estate sector.

""The effectiveness of products like bank smartly, more sophisticated pricing capabilities, and a significant overhaul of skills, training, digital tools and incentives, together with investments in our branches drove our performance,"" CEO Gunjan Kedia said on the earnings call. ""Additionally, commercial real estate loans also showed modest growth after 11 quarters of decline.""

Like other bank executives, Kedia weighed in on the proposed 10% credit card rate limit President Trump has floated. Kedia estimated that over 90% of U.S. Bancorp's clients would see ""a detrimental impact"" if that rate cap were enacted, and that 50% would face a ""crushing"" impact.

""We have observed that just in the last few days, the conversation around the rate cap has shifted more productively to options for customers to help them in the short term,"" Kedia added.

D.R. Horton stock rises on better-than-expected earnings

Homebuilder D.R. Horton's (DHI) first quarter earnings were better than expected, but a sluggish housing market marked by affordability concerns weighed on results.

The company reported earnings per share of $2.03, beating estimates of $1.93, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $6.8 billion also topped expectations of $6.6 billion, but fell from $7.6 billion a year ago.

Net sales orders increased 3% to 18,300 homes, which was slightly below estimates. Homebuilders have increased sales incentives in recent months to try and entice buyers off the sidelines. That, coupled with lower mortgage rates, has sparked some optimism that the housing market could improve.

D.R. Horton reiterated its full-year 2026 guidance for revenue in a range of $33.5 billion to $35 billion. The company expects to close 86,000 homes to 88,000 homes by the end of the year.

3M adjusted earnings beat, but the stock is sinking

Post-it Note maker 3M (MMM) reported adjusted earnings per share that beat Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, but the stock fell 5% as part of a broader market sell-off.

The Minnesota-based company posted adjusted earnings, which strip out one-time costs, of $1.83, compared to analysts' forecasts of $1.80, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company expected temporary charges from tariffs and stranded costs from removing PFAS materials from its products. In Q4, 3M realized $0.56 per share in net costs from litigation.

Sales grew 2.1% in Q4 to $6.1 billion, topping expectations for $6 billion in sales.

For 2026, the company expects adjusted sales growth of around 4% for full-year adjusted EPS of $8.06. Full-year operating cash flow is expected to be $2.3 billion.

""2025 was an important year for 3M as we build a strong foundation that is reshaping our operating model and driving sustainable value creation,"" 3M CEO William Brown said.

J.B. Hunt stock falls after revenue declines year over year

Freight and logistics company J.B. Hunt (JBHT) reported a 2% decline in revenue year over year, led by weaker volumes and revenue in its main Intermodal segment.

The Arkansas-based company posted diluted earnings per share of $1.90 for the fourth quarter, topping Wall Street analysts' expectations of $1.82 per share, according to estimates on S&P Global Market Intelligence. Total revenue of $3.1 billion came in line with estimates but declined slightly from $3.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.

In the Intermodal segment, its largest by revenue, the company reported a 2% decline in volume, driven by a 6% decrease in transcontinental network loads between US ports, Mexico, and Canada year over year (though eastern network loads increased 5%). J.B. Hunt also saw weakness in its last-mile segment due to softer demand in end markets, the company said.

Morgan Stanley results show boom in Wall Street dealmaking

Like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley's (MS) fourth quarter benefited from a boom in Wall Street dealmaking.

Morgan Stanley reported an 18% lift in profits in Q4 as its total client assets in wealth and investment banking grew by $350 million to reach $9.3 trillion. Net income rose to $4.4 billion, or $2.68 per diluted share, from $3.7 billion a year ago. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $2.45, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The standout in the quarter was Morgan Stanley's investment banking revenues, which increased 47% year over year to $2.4 billion. The company's debt underwriting revenue, in particular, nearly doubled year over year to $785 million.

Revenue in the wealth management unit also surged 13% to $8.4 billion, compared with $7.5 billion a year ago.

Fortune’s list is based on a survey conducted with Korn Ferry. Starting with about 1,500 candidates, the list was narrowed to 685 top-revenue companies across 31 countries.

To determine the best-regarded companies, Korn Ferry asked executives, directors and analysts to rate companies within their industry on nine criteria, including management quality, product quality, social responsibility and talent attraction. A company’s score must rank in the top half of its industry survey to be listed.

To select the top 50, Korn Ferry asked senior executives, directors and industry analysts to select the 10 companies they admired most and rank each one on various attributes. They chose from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys; ranked in the top 3 within their industry the previous year (top 4 for non-U.S. companies); or a company that ranked among the top 50 All-Stars last year and did not make any of the above cuts.

Talked to a female fellow associate today about the stresses of this job. This woman apparently sleeps on average 3 hours per day and works -unbilled- after hours to show up prepared and impressive for the next day’s work.

Some of her quotes:

""Why not dedicate yourself to your career while you’re young and energetic""

""My dad used to wake me up at 4AM through junior high and high school and make me run on the treadmill so I could get better at soccer. Stop complaining about no sleep"".

Someone a year senior to me just provided 2 days notice of a vacation Friday-Monday. Was not given the option to not cover or get out of it as it was phrased as having already been cleared by partner (and had not been given any prior notice). I have a doctor’s appointment and other family obligations over the weekend. Although I am always “on call”over weekends, this really is one where I have important obligations. Would you advise going over the associate to make it clear this is not ok?

Is Microsoft hiring freeze still going on? I attended interviews in June end for SDE opening in Azure & cleared it. Post which I got to know that the position went to on hold & dint hear back anything from HR. Do they even come back once the freeze is lifted? Does it make sense to wait?

I've heard vets tell new FAs to go for the ""low hanging fruit"", what are some examples of this? How can I meet affluent investors? I keep finding really small ones. I don't want to give up. Any tips?

DETROIT – Before they get started racing in this weekend’s 64th Rolex 24 At Daytona, General Motors IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship drivers Jack Aitken and Alexander Sims paid a visit to Detroit for a double duty round of promotional efforts for both the 64th Rolex 24 At Daytona and Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix.

Aitken, co-driver of the No. 31 Cadillac Whelen Cadillac V-Series.R in the Grand Touring Prototype (GTP) class and Sims, defending Grand Touring Daytona Pro (GTD PRO) champion and co-driver of the No. 3 Corvette Racing by Pratt Miller Motorsports Corvette Z06 GT3.R, finished this weekend’s Roar Before the Rolex 24 test at Daytona International Speedway and departed for Detroit.

They started off the week at Monday night’s Boston Celtics vs. Detroit Pistons’ game, part of NBC and Peacock’s return to broadcasting the NBA for the first time in more than two decades, sitting courtside across from the Detroit Pistons bench at Detroit’s Little Caesars Arena. The Pistons won by one point, 104-103, in a thriller over their Eastern Conference rivals to extend their lead in the conference to 5.5 games.

Aitken and Sims moved onto the Detroit Auto Show’s annual “Racing Day” on Tuesday to participate in a pre-event media tour for both this weekend’s Rolex 24 to kick off the 2026 WeatherTech Championship season, and also for the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix held in downtown Detroit encircling the Renaissance Center in late May.

Aitken and Sims toured the show with Auto Show and Detroit GP executives and key stakeholders, participated in several rounds of media interviews, engaged in fan Q&As at the Cadillac and Chevrolet displays, and took fans around an indoor “DGP” track in Chevrolet E-Rays and Cadillac CT-4s. The key word here is “indoor” with temperatures in the low single digits and “feels like” temperatures below zero on a sunny, yet cold Tuesday in Detroit.

“It’s been great fun,” Sims said. “It started off last night with the NBA game with the Pistons playing in a pretty tight contest. Being courtside for that was a really cool experience. Today, to see the Auto Show for the first time, see all the cars on display and all the amazing GM products is really nice. To meet some of the IndyCar guys, meet the fans, do some hot laps, see some smiles on some faces, it’s been really good fun.

“We were given some (Corvette) E-Rays to thrash around for a while and give some hot laps to the fans with some controlled drifting and putting some rubber down, which the fans seemed to love. It was good fun for everyone.”

Aitken added, “It’s been a fun time. It’s been great to see such a big presence from GM and Cadillac. We did some hot laps on a scale circuit of the GP Track and it’s been a great show put on by the Detroit GP. I had a lot of fun and met a lot of new people and hopefully we’re going to see them again in May. I can’t wait to get back on the streets of Detroit. We got to see a bit of a corker; it was tight down to the wire. We had courtside seats and I’ve never had that before. It was really cool and got us into the spirit of the hometown heroes. It was a fun day.”

The two IMSA drivers weren’t alone, as four full-time IndyCar Series drivers also made the voyage. That included David Malukas, Rinus VeeKay, Marcus Armstrong and Kyffin Simpson. Simpson, of note, is also competing in the Rolex 24 this year as part of the Tower Motorsports No. 8 ORECA LMP2 07 in Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) entry. VeeKay has started a Rolex 24 before and Malukas and Armstrong would be rookies in any future Rolex 24 appearances.

Both WeatherTech Championship races air live on network NBC. The Rolex 24 starts this Saturday, January 24, at 1:30 p.m. ET on NBC and finishes on the network as well, with flag-to-flag streaming on Peacock.

Real returns rise in Türkiye, supporting monetary easing Keller said he expects inflation to continue declining steadily this year, adding that the central bank only changes policy rates when it sees, or can clearly anticipate, that inflation is falling.
Türkiye's annual inflation fell to 30.9% in December 2025, while the policy rate stands at 38%, implying a 7.1% real return gap.

According to Keller, Türkiye is historically well-positioned to manage periods of global uncertainty.","Türkiye’s declining inflation trend is expected to sustain real returns on lira-denominated assets through 2026, strengthening investor confidence and reinforcing capital inflows, according to Barclays Global Head of Economic Research Christian Keller.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 56th Annual Meeting in Davos, Keller told the state-run Anadolu Agency that the Turkish central bank’s monetary policy, which is steering the country’s disinflation path, has begun to yield results.

Real returns rise in Türkiye, supporting monetary easing

Keller said he expects inflation to continue declining steadily this year, adding that the central bank only changes policy rates when it sees, or can clearly anticipate, that inflation is falling. ""This prevents the bank from trailing behind developments and gives investors confidence that the real interest rate will stay at a certain level,"" he said.

Türkiye's annual inflation fell to 30.9% in December 2025, while the policy rate stands at 38%, implying a 7.1% real return gap. This situation allows the central bank to implement further cuts at the next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on Thursday, with market participants expecting a 150 basis point reduction. As of Wednesday, Türkiye’s two-year treasury yield declined to 35.44%.

Keller noted that the current macro framework is functioning effectively. ""There is money flowing into Türkiye, the central bank is able to accumulate reserves, and at the same time, the country’s competitiveness does not appear to have been hurt,"" Keller added.

As of the week ending Jan. 9, the central bank’s total reserves rose to $196.08 billion, while net reserves excluding swaps reached $70.1 billion. Preliminary data indicate that total reserves have reached a new record above $200 billion this week, with net reserves excluding swaps above $80 billion. During the same period, the total carry trade volume also increased to $54.78 billion.

Türkiye gains ground on stability, growth, global resilience

Keller said the Turkish economy frequently surprises to the upside in terms of growth, citing its underlying dynamism. The Turkish economy grew by 3.7% in the third quarter of 2025, and according to government estimates, the full-year growth rate was 3.3%.

He stressed the importance of continuing the ongoing macroeconomic stabilization program and underscored the central bank’s performance in rebuilding policy credibility. ""The central bank is doing a good job in regaining trust,"" he noted. According to Keller, Türkiye is historically well-positioned to manage periods of global uncertainty. ""Türkiye is one of the best countries in coping with uncertainty, and it has been that way for a long time,"" he said.

Keller highlighted that Türkiye’s geopolitical standing may offer a buffer against escalating international tensions. He pointed out that Türkiye is not currently in the ""negative spotlight"" compared to economies such as China, Russia, or European Union member states under U.S. pressure.

Emerging markets that maintain balance in global relations may be better placed to navigate volatility, Keller added. ""If Europe revives its economy and invests more, Türkiye could also benefit,"" he said.",https://img.turkiyetoday.com/images/2026/1/21/turkiye-to-continue-offering-real-gains-through-2026-as-inflation-declines-barclays-3213304_20260121143520.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 13:03:46.247180

Well, let's talk a little bit about your business in India, you know. Sukses one of your key markets, not j. Some logistics point of view and mobility point of view, but also from a technology perspective, layout for me what the year ahead for India for Uber will look like. So you're, you're right from a technology perspective, I mean, First off, I'd say we have tremendous talent in India. The Uber team in India is great. It's our largest engineering center outside the Bay Area and we're continuing to grow, grow the center. We're doing a lot of our new AI work out of our India team. So we've got a, a program called Uber AI Solutions. Which is really participating almost as a human in the loop in AI development and that's being innovated out of India and for Uber globally, for Uber globally, clients all over the world's. Most of the team is in India that's building that, that offering. But it's super compelling, it's new, it's interesting. We're participating in government technology schemes like ODBC, which I think is a really interesting approach to try to grow marketplace businesses across a number of sectors. And a lot of our global products actually debut in II is a tremendously competitive. Environment competition brings the best out of us and and we're seeing a lot of awesome. That's the competitive intensity increase or you know, is, is, is it status quo there? India has always been competitively intense. You know, it's not a question of growth for us in India. It's, you know, how sustainable is that growth? And would I give credit to the ecosystem for is there's new players that pop up, they innovate, they bring new business models, they bring lower cost products, which I think are popular with Indian consumers. So it's as intense as ever, but I think we're faring. Well, in that competition, and again, a lot of what we're learning in India is making its way into our 75 countries around the world and, and that's a good thing. What's been the biggest learning from India that you're taking to the world? I think your ability to continue to innovate on the consumer experience while being mindful of price is really, really critical. I mean, we, we're a marketplace business at the end of the day, we're trying to meet the needs of both the drivers and couriers who unearned money on our platform and consumers who depend on us for services. And actually that balancing act is, is challenging. And in India, I think it's probably the hardest market for that balancing act and it's made us better on both fronts. You know, you have now restarted M&A. Is India likely to see some action on that front for you? You know, I never love speculating on M&AI. Think there's lots of interesting technology companies in India that of course we'll take a look at. And and you know, for us, we've been doing the deals that make sense for our customers, that makes sense for our platform. You know, Uber is increasingly becoming a daily use case. And so if we can plug more modes of moving or give you more access to local selection in your city, then we're going to do that either organically or through M&A. Well, you know, you talked about how Uber wants to position itself as a daily use service. What will that mean in India? You know, you exited the Uber Eats business, but you're now re entering that space while ODC take me through the new bets and the new avenues that you hope to double down on in India. We've we've got a tremendous driver base in India, right? And we've got drivers who use cars as their vehicles, 3 Wheelers or two Wheelers and increasingly that sort of two and three Wheeler section in the market is also doing deliveries. And so our ability to actually give our drivers more opportunity to either do consumer to consumer package delivery or. The full fulfill for retailers, I think that's interesting in India. So no plans to re enter the food delivery market, but I do think you'll see us experimenting and growing some segments that sort of further complement our offering.

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is included on our list of the best undervalued wide moat stocks.

On January 13, 2026, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) announced that it will acquire Wall Street brokerage BTIG for up to $1 billion in cash and stock. With this move, the company marks a strategic expansion into capital markets.

In addition to $725 million upfront, the deal includes an additional $275 million contingent on performance over three years. BTIG has served as the bank’s equity capital markets referral partner since 2014, bringing strengths in investment banking, institutional sales and trading, research, and prime brokerage. The firm has helped U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) diversify beyond traditional banking. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026.

Within this context, Piper Sandler analysts noted,

While U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) certainly has capital markets capabilities, they have historically been ‌much ‌more limited than those of several peers. This transaction therefore rounds out USB’s offerings to become more competitive with those of other large banks.

On the same day, Keefe Bruyette spoke out on the recent development, viewing it as a modest positive for U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). The firm noted the company’s strategy of gradually growing its internal capital markets capabilities amid rising industry-wide demand. The firm maintained its ‘Market Perform’ rating with a $58 price target.

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), founded in 1929 and headquartered in Minneapolis, offers comprehensive banking services, including lending, deposits, wealth management, mortgages, credit cards, and brokerage services across the U.S.

While we acknowledge the potential of USB as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

U.S. Bancorp Earnings Call Signals Strong Momentum Despite Regulatory Clouds

U.S. Bancorp’s latest earnings call carried a distinctly upbeat tone, as management emphasized record revenues, double‑digit adjusted EPS growth, and broad-based business strength. Executives highlighted improving net interest income and margin trends, solid fee income, disciplined expense control, and better asset quality, all underpinned by clear forward guidance that points to continued revenue growth and positive operating leverage. While they acknowledged meaningful near-term pressures—from merger-related costs, regulatory uncertainty, and select segment softness—the overall message was that the bank’s earnings power and strategic positioning are improving faster than the risks are building.

Record EPS and Revenue Underscore Earnings Power

U.S. Bancorp posted adjusted diluted earnings per common share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter, up roughly 18% year over year, underscoring robust underlying profitability. Net revenue reached a record $7.4 billion for Q4 and $28.7 billion for the full year, with quarterly total net revenue climbing 5.1%. Management framed these results as evidence that the company is executing well on both sides of the balance sheet, even as it absorbs integration and investment costs. The combination of strong top-line growth and firm cost control is driving operating leverage and supporting attractive returns on capital.

Net Interest Income and Margin Trends Turn Favorable

Net interest income (NII) moved higher, a key point for bank investors focused on rate and spread dynamics. NII rose 3.3% year over year on management’s commentary, with fully taxable-equivalent NII at $4.3 billion—up 1.4% from the prior quarter. Net interest margin ticked up 2 basis points sequentially to 2.77%, a modest but important sign that pressure from funding costs is easing. Management pointed to mix improvements and balance sheet discipline as drivers, while cautioning that a large investment portfolio and lower long-term rates will moderate how quickly margin can expand from here.

Fee Revenue Delivers Broad-Based Growth

Fee revenue was a bright spot, reinforcing the bank’s status as a diversified franchise rather than a pure rate play. Fourth-quarter fee income rose 7.6% year over year, with full-year fee revenue up 6.7% and accounting for about 42% of total net revenues in 2025. Growth was broad-based across payments, institutional, and consumer fee businesses, reducing reliance on NII and improving earnings stability. Management stressed that this balanced revenue mix is strategic, positioning U.S. Bancorp to generate growth even in less favorable rate environments.

Positive Operating Leverage and Tight Expense Control

The bank delivered meaningful positive operating leverage, signaling that revenue is growing much faster than costs. Adjusted operating leverage reached 440 basis points in the quarter and about 370 basis points for full-year 2025, aided by nine consecutive quarters of largely stable expenses. Productivity initiatives and disciplined cost management helped absorb severance and other one-off items while still supporting technology and growth investments. Looking ahead, management expects to maintain positive operating leverage of at least 200 basis points in 2026, a key pillar of their long-term earnings story.

Asset Quality and Credit Metrics Improve Further

Credit performance remains a support rather than a drag on results. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and ORE fell to 0.41%, improving both sequentially and year over year. The net charge-off ratio improved to 0.54%, down 2 basis points from the prior quarter, suggesting losses are well-contained despite credit card and commercial growth. The allowance for credit losses stood at $7.9 billion, or 2.03% of period-end loans, giving management comfort that the reserve is appropriate for the current environment. Investors worried about late-cycle credit deterioration likely took some reassurance from these trends.

Balance Sheet Growth in Deposits and Loans

U.S. Bancorp showed healthy balance sheet momentum, with total average deposits up 0.7% sequentially to $515 billion. The bank reported record consumer deposit growth, while noninterest-bearing deposits rose both sequentially and year over year, holding around 16% of total deposits—an important offset to higher funding costs. Average loans climbed 1.4% quarter over quarter to $384 billion, led by strong year-over-year growth in commercial (about 10%) and credit card loans (roughly 15.7%). Those faster-growing categories now make up around 48% of total loans, helping support NII growth but also requiring tight credit discipline.

Capital Strength and Attractive Returns

Capital levels and shareholder returns remained robust. Tangible book value per common share increased 18.2% year over year, reflecting both retained earnings and balance sheet marks moving in the right direction. Return on tangible common equity was a healthy 18.4%, while return on average assets was 1.19% for the quarter—both solid figures for a large regional bank. The efficiency ratio improved to 57.4%, highlighting management’s success in extracting more revenue from each dollar of expense. Together, these metrics support a narrative of a well-capitalized bank generating strong, improving returns.

BTIG Acquisition Targets Fee Upside and Capital Markets Scale

The pending acquisition of BTIG was presented as a strategic bolt-on that deepens U.S. Bancorp’s capital markets capabilities and fee revenue potential. The two firms have already worked together on more than 350 deals over a decade-long partnership, giving management confidence in cultural and operational fit. BTIG is expected to contribute $175 million to $200 million of fee revenue per quarter once integrated, though current guidance for 2026 excludes this upside. Executives highlighted expected revenue synergies and the ability to offer a broader set of advisory and trading services to institutional and corporate clients.

Global Fund Services Delivers High-Growth Niche

Global Fund Services (GFS) continues to emerge as a fast-growing, strategically important niche. GFS total net revenue grew about 12% in 2025 and has delivered an approximately 11% compound annual growth rate since 2021. The platform onboarded nearly half of all new U.S. ETF launches in 2025, underscoring its competitive positioning. Beyond fee income, GFS is attracting operational deposits and money market assets under management, creating additional balance sheet and revenue benefits. Management portrayed GFS as a scalable, high-return business that enhances the overall growth profile of the franchise.

Merger Costs and BTIG Capital Impact Temper Near-Term EPS

While broadly bullish on BTIG’s strategic benefits, management acknowledged near-term financial trade-offs. They expect merger-related costs over the coming quarters to offset the initial pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) contribution, making earnings per share effectively neutral in the short run. The BTIG transaction will reduce the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by approximately 12 basis points, modest but not immaterial as the bank balances growth, regulatory expectations, and shareholder returns. Near-term buyback capacity could be somewhat muted while integration costs flow through, though management framed these as manageable and temporary.

Regulatory and Tailoring Uncertainty Looms Over Growth

A key overhang discussed on the call was regulatory and supervisory uncertainty, particularly around capital and tailoring rules. With period-end assets at $692 billion—close to the $700 billion threshold associated with tighter Category Two treatment—management is closely monitoring potential changes that could affect capital, liquidity, and operational requirements. While no specific rule outcomes were predicted, leadership acknowledged that shifting regulatory expectations could influence how aggressively the bank grows, manages its balance sheet, and returns capital to shareholders.

Expenses and One-Off Items Could Pressure Margins

Noninterest expense rose about 0.7% sequentially to roughly $4.2 billion, as severance charges and other one-time items partly offset favorable FDIC expense. Management emphasized that strategic investments—in technology, infrastructure, and growth businesses—will ramp up in 2026. While the plan assumes revenue continues to outpace expenses, there is recognition that if top-line growth slows, these investments could temporarily pressure expense ratios and margins. Still, the bank’s track record of nine quarters of stable expenses gives management confidence in its ability to calibrate costs to conditions.

Policy Risk: Credit Card Rate Caps and Competition Act

Executives flagged macro policy risk, especially around proposals to cap credit card interest rates and the Credit Card Competition Act. Using a hypothetical 10% rate cap as an example, management estimated that more than 90% of their clients would be negatively affected, arguing such caps could restrict access to credit rather than protect borrowers. They view aspects of these proposals as materially negative for both customers and earnings, given U.S. Bancorp’s meaningful credit card exposure and growth ambitions in that segment. While still in the legislative and regulatory arena, these policy developments were framed as real risks that investors should track.

Mixed Results Across Payments Segments

Despite overall payments strength, not all segments are firing equally. Corporate payments, including corporate card and treasury-related activity, remained negative year over year and are expected to stay weak into the first half of 2026 before recovering. Management suggested that broader macro conditions and client spending patterns are weighing on this line, even as other parts of the payments franchise improve. Investors were encouraged to view these headwinds as cyclical and transitory, but they do add some noise to the otherwise strong fee growth narrative.

Investment Portfolio Size Limits Near-Term NIM Upside

The bank’s sizable $171 billion investment portfolio remains a swing factor in net interest margin performance. Management noted that the portfolio can flex depending on loan growth opportunities, but a larger fixed-rate book means more assets will reprice in 2026 at narrower spreads given lower long-term interest rates. This dynamic may cap how quickly NIM can expand, even as deposit mix improves and higher-yielding loans grow. For investors, the message was that NIM progress will likely be gradual rather than explosive, shaped as much by asset repricing as by rate cuts or loan growth.

Guidance Points to Continued Growth and Capital Returns

Looking ahead, U.S. Bancorp guided to full-year 2026 total net revenue growth of 4%–6%, with at least 200 basis points of positive operating leverage, excluding any benefit from BTIG. Management expects mid-single-digit growth in both NII and fees for the year, supported by projected loan growth of 3%–4%, led by commercial and card. For the first quarter of 2026, they see NII (on an FTE basis) up 3%–4% versus 2025, fee revenue up 5%–6%, and noninterest expenses up roughly 1%. Capital return plans call for increasing share repurchases from about $100 million to $200 million this quarter, on a glide path toward an approximately 75% payout target over time. They also reiterated a path for net interest margin expansion from the current 2.77% toward around 3% by 2027, though BTIG-related merger costs and a roughly 12-basis-point CET1 impact will offset some near-term benefits as integration proceeds.

In closing, U.S. Bancorp’s earnings call painted the picture of a bank with rising earnings power, strong balance sheet and credit metrics, and a clear plan to grow both interest and fee income while keeping expenses in check. Strategic moves like the BTIG acquisition and the expansion of Global Fund Services aim to deepen high-value fee streams, even as management navigates regulatory uncertainty, policy risk, and pockets of weakness in corporate payments. For investors, the story is one of solid, diversified growth with manageable near-term headwinds—making U.S. Bancorp a name to watch as it executes on its 2026 and 2027 targets.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_1150180799-750x406.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:07:53.318615

The chocolate maker said CEO Peter Feld would leave his role on 26 January “to pursue other career opportunities” after less than three years on the job.

The CEO change signals the business is still not developing as hoped, analysts from Zeurcher Kantonalbank said in a note to investors.

One of the world’s top cocoa processors, which supplies chocolate for Magnum ice cream and Nestlé’s Kit Kat bars, said its sales volume fell 9.9% to 509,401 metric tonnes in the first quarter that ran from September to November.

Analysts were expecting 512,000 tonnes on average in a company-provided poll.

Shares of the company, which also confirmed its outlook for the financial year, were trading 3.4% higher at 0957 GMT, a move than analysts attributed largely to the CEO change.

Vontobel analysts wrote, “The appointment of Hein Schumacher lands like a small bombshell.”

‘In The Right Position At The Right Time’

Talking to analysts on a call, chairman Patrick De Maeseneire said Barry Callebaut was undergoing the biggest transformation in its history, having been unable to foresee the volatile geopolitical situation and record cocoa prices that have shaken the market.

De Maeseneire said, “People often forget the right leader is in the right position at the right time.

“And the right time is often forgotten. And doing a transformation requires a certain profile of leader.”

He however denied that the company was exploring a separation of its global cocoa unit from the rest of the group, as reported by Reuters last month.

AlphaValue analyst Filippo Ercole Piva noted that Schumacher was behind the separation of Unilever’s ice cream business Magnum.

He said, “They are hiring a guy that has experience spinning off certain businesses, so I think they are paying for that.”

Leadership Change

Barry Callebaut’s change of leadership is the latest of several for leading consumer companies over the last 18 months.

Schumacher, a Dutch national ousted by Unilever in February 2025, will benefit from already having deep industry relationships with Barry’s key customers, Vontobel said in a note.

Feld began his role as CEO in April 2023 and has steered the company through high cocoa prices, to which Barry is more exposed than consumer-facing firms, and a subsequent fall in demand.

The latest quarterly data on cocoa grind, a proxy for chocolate demand, showed a slum in Asia and fell 8.3% year-on-year in Europe, which represents roughly two-fifths of Barry’s revenue.

Barry buys cocoa beans that it processes into cocoa butter and powder.

Manufacturers then use its product to produce chocolate and candy which is sold to consumers directly.

After three cuts to the company’s volume guidance last year, it guided in November for a mid-single-digit percentage decline in sales of cocoa products in 2025/26.",https://img.resized.co/checkout/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA5XFxcLzAxMTI1ODM2XFxcL0hlaW4tU2NodW1hY2hlci1Gcmllc2xhbmRDYW1waW5hLmpwZWdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmNoZWNrb3V0LmllXFxcL2lcXFwvbm9pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiMzEyNTJjZGYwZGU2MTdlMzQwMjcwMTU4Yzc5NjQzNWExYjM1MjEzOSJ9/barry-callebaut-taps-ex-unilever-boss-schumacher-as-ceo-checkout.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 11:09:32.166984

According to GSK in a Jan. 20, 2026, press release, IgE is the only clinically validated systemic target shown to protect against harmful allergic and inflammatory immune responses, with approximately 94% of severe food allergies mediated through this pathway (1).
“Food allergies cause severe health impacts to patients with existing treatment requiring injections as frequently as every [two] weeks.
What could this deal mean for the future food allergy treatment landscape?
Food allergies impose a substantial economic and societal burden, with US families facing an estimated $33 billion in annual costs (5).","GSK’s newly announced $2.2 billion acquisition of RAPT Therapeutics reflects a broader industry shift toward immunology assets that pair validated biological targets with improved treatment durability. Central to the transaction is ozureprubart, a long-acting anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody (mAb) in Phase IIb development for prophylactic protection against food allergens (1).

As food allergy prevalence continues to rise, the deal highlights how dosing frequency, manufacturability, and late-stage risk reduction are shaping biopharmaceutical acquisition strategies (1,2).

According to GSK in a Jan. 20, 2026, press release, IgE is the only clinically validated systemic target shown to protect against harmful allergic and inflammatory immune responses, with approximately 94% of severe food allergies mediated through this pathway (1). Existing therapies require injections every two to four weeks, however, which creates challenges for patients in terms of adherence, care delivery, and healthcare utilization—particularly given that most patients with severe food allergies are children (1).

“We are excited to enter into this agreement with GSK, which offers an attractive path forward for our programs, particularly the opportunity we envision for ozureprubart in food allergy,” said Brian Wong, president and CEO, RAPT Therapeutics, in the release (1). “This transaction has the potential to provide access to the global development and commercialization capabilities, resources and infrastructure that GSK has to offer and ultimately bring added value to our pipeline, patients, and stockholders.”

Why does extended-interval anti-IgE dosing matter for food allergy care?

Ozureprubart is designed to extend dosing intervals to approximately 12 weeks, a change that could materially alter prophylactic treatment paradigms. Less frequent dosing may reduce treatment burden for patients and caregivers while also influencing how healthcare systems manage chronic allergy care (1).

From a development perspective, long-acting biologics require precise control over formulation stability, pharmacokinetics, and batch consistency, placing added emphasis on mature manufacturing platforms (3).

Data from a Phase IIb trial (prestIgE) evaluating ozureprubart as monotherapy are expected in 2027, and Phase III trials are planned across adult and pediatric populations at risk of severe reactions. In the United States, more than 17 million people are diagnosed with food allergies, and over 1.3 million experience severe reactions annually, resulting in more than 3 million emergency and hospital visits each year (1).

“The addition of ozureprubart brings another promising new, potential best-in-class treatment to GSK’s pipeline,” said Tony Wood, chief scientific officer, GSK, in the release (1). “Food allergies cause severe health impacts to patients with existing treatment requiring injections as frequently as every [two] weeks. Ozureprubart offers the opportunity to bring sustained protection to patients with dosing every 12 weeks and is consistent with our approach to acquire assets that address validated targets and where there is clear unmet medical need.”

How does this acquisition reflect shifts in biopharmaceutical development strategy?

The transaction underscores growing industry preference for mid-stage clinical assets with established mechanisms of action. Anti-IgE therapies benefit from regulatory and clinical precedent, allowing innovation to focus on durability, patient eligibility, and long-term safety rather than target validation.

Approximately 25% of patients are currently ineligible for existing therapies, suggesting potential for broader access if late-stage trials support ozureprubart’s clinical profile (1). Long-acting mAbs also introduce new considerations for manufacturing scale-up and lifecycle planning.

Extended dosing intervals may stabilize demand forecasting, but they require early alignment between development, formulation science, and global supply infrastructure to ensure consistent product availability (4).

What could this deal mean for the future food allergy treatment landscape?

Food allergies impose a substantial economic and societal burden, with US families facing an estimated $33 billion in annual costs (5). For biopharma developers and manufacturers, therapies offering sustained protection with fewer administrations may improve adherence while reducing variability in production and distribution.

If confirmed in late-stage trials, ozureprubart could help redefine expectations for durability in allergy biologics and reinforce industry momentum toward differentiated, long-acting immunology therapies (1).

The Nasdaq-listed company said it will invest $50m in development capital through Glenfarne Alaska Partners, while also lining up as the preferred tonnage provider for at least six LNG carrier newbuilds to support the export phase of the project.

Under the agreement, Danaos would construct and operate the LNG carriers that will ship cargoes from Alaska to global markets once the project moves into its export phase.

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two standalone stages. Phase one centres on a 765-mile pipeline from Alaska’s North Slope to supply the state’s domestic gas demand. Phase two adds liquefaction and export infrastructure designed to handle up to 20m tonnes per annum of LNG.

Glenfarne took over as lead developer of Alaska LNG in March last year and has since secured preliminary offtake commitments for around 11m tpa from buyers in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. The project’s partner list also includes Baker Hughes and POSCO International. Glenfarne holds a 75% stake in Alaska LNG, with the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation owning the remaining 25%.

For Danaos, the move marks a step into LNG shipping and energy-linked investments, adding another leg to a business best known for its containership exposure.

Chief executive John Coustas said the project opens up a new supply source for the North Pacific and gives Danaos an opportunity to deploy its shipping expertise in LNG transportation.

The deal comes as Danaos continues to build out its wider fleet. The company currently controls 75 containerships and has more than 20 newbuildings on order.

French personal care giant L’Oréal announced plans to invest Rs 3,500 crore (350 million euros) over the next five years in Telangana, with its new Global Capability Centre (GCC) set to be inaugurated in Hyderabad this November. The facility will focus on advanced beauty-tech solutions, artificial intelligence, and digital innovation.

The company said the Hyderabad GCC will create around 2,000 highly skilled jobs, including positions for AI specialists, data scientists, and technology engineers. The hub is expected to accelerate the development of AI-driven beauty products and services, positioning Hyderabad as a key centre for global digital operations.

L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus made the announcement on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. He described the GCC as “the world’s first Beauty Tech Hub of its kind,” serving as a flagship for AI-powered beauty innovations. “With an initial investment of over Rs 3,500 crore through 2030, this hub will become a global powerhouse, integrating AI, generative AI, and other emerging technologies,” Hieronimus said.

The centre will function as L’Oréal’s innovation, technology, data, and supply chain hub, supporting the company’s global digital transformation. Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy welcomed the investment, highlighting its alignment with the state’s “Telangana Rising: 2047 Vision” and the creation of high-value jobs. “This decision reflects the confidence global leaders have in Telangana’s innovation ecosystem and talent pool,” he said.

Industry Minister D. Sridhar Babu noted that Hyderabad’s selection for the GCC was a “strong endorsement” of the state’s ability to attract leading global companies. He added that the state government is committed to extending full support to L’Oréal and other international investors.

Hieronimus emphasized India’s strategic role in the company’s global plans, citing over three decades of L’Oréal’s presence in the country. “The future of beauty lies at the intersection of science, technology, and creativity. Hyderabad will now sit at the heart of our AI and digital ambitions,” he said.

The new hub will operate alongside L’Oréal’s global technology network in countries including France, the US, China, Singapore, Spain, Poland, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico. Officials said the GCC will foster collaboration across L’Oréal’s global teams to co-create innovations for the beauty industry.

Telangana’s Special Chief Secretary (Industries) Sanjay Kumar also invited L’Oréal to explore potential manufacturing opportunities in Hyderabad, in addition to the GCC investment. Hieronimus expressed interest in expanding the company’s footprint in the state, signaling further potential investments in the near future.

What brands need are guided and trusted conversations when users finally arrive on their apps or websites,” he added.
Further, with AI lowering entry barriers, he said that when it comes to content, quality now matters more than quantity.","With user search now shifting towards an agentic web, the World Wide Web is no longer what it once was. As a result, it has become important for brands to build digital experiences not just for humans but also for AI, as per Vyshak Venugopalan, Senior Director, India & JAPAC Partner at Adobe India. While this is worrying for brands, as they lose some control over how they are represented, it also means they must adapt to how discovery is changing.

“Brands should recognise that they are now building for both humans and AI. This is not the end of SEO; it is about combining SEO with generative optimisation. Without this, brands risk not being accurately represented in AI-driven environments,” said Venugopalan.

There are risks here. If a company’s content is not structured and AI-readable, their brand can be misrepresented, as per Venugopalan. “We have already seen this happen to platforms that once dominated user journeys. Revenue models are changing because consumer opinions are being shaped elsewhere. What brands need are guided and trusted conversations when users finally arrive on their apps or websites,” he added.

Further, with AI lowering entry barriers, he said that when it comes to content, quality now matters more than quantity. He added that while the demand for content has grown exponentially, it also goes stale far more quickly than it did even six months ago.

If a company has eight products, once you factor in channels, languages, and formats, this can translate into hundreds of thousands of content assets, he added. “Many enterprises are unprepared for this. Creating content that is authentic, structured, brand-aligned, and scalable is very different from producing generic material,” he further explained.

This means companies must assess whether they have a content supply chain that is AI-accelerated but human-led. While AI can generate volume, human oversight is essential to ensure brand integrity. According to Venugopalan, this is a journey rather than a quick fix and requires a clear roadmap to create content that is efficient, cost-effective, compelling, and conversion-driven.",https://media.assettype.com/outlookbusiness/2025-08-07/eqqbeqtn/ABC.avif?w=1200&amp;ar=40%3A21&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true&amp;mode=crop&amp;enlarge=true&amp;overlay=false&amp;overlay_position=bottom&amp;overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-21 08:59:37.639876

A great starting point for your Kraft Heinz research is our analysis highlighting that could impact your investment decision.
If Kraft Heinz has sparked more questions than answers, do not stop here.","What Kraft Heinz’s Recent Returns May Signal for Investors

Kraft Heinz (KHC) has seen its share price under pressure recently, with negative returns over the past month, past 3 months, year to date, and past year, even as annual revenue and net income figures remain positive.

At a share price of $23.76, Kraft Heinz’s momentum looks muted, with a 30 day share price return of a 3.06% decline and a 1 year total shareholder return of a 14.58% loss, pointing to fading enthusiasm despite positive annual revenue and net income figures.

If this kind of mixed performance has you looking around the market, it could be a good moment to broaden your search with .

With Kraft Heinz trading at $23.76 and indicators like analyst targets and intrinsic value estimates suggesting a discount, the key question is whether this is a genuine value opportunity or whether the market already sees limited future growth.

Price-to-Sales of 1.1x: Is it justified?

On a P/S of 1.1x at a share price of $23.76, Kraft Heinz screens as good value against peers in some checks, but looks more expensive in others.

The P/S ratio compares what investors are paying for each dollar of revenue. It is often used for companies where earnings are weak or volatile. For Kraft Heinz, this tilt toward sales-based metrics fits with its current unprofitable status and the reliance on future earnings improvement rather than present profits.

Against its own fair P/S estimate of 1.3x, Kraft Heinz trades at a lower level. This suggests the market price is sitting below where our fair ratio work indicates it could settle. Yet when you stack that 1.1x P/S next to the broader US Food industry average of 0.8x, the stock looks more expensive than many peers, hinting that investors are still assigning a premium even with recent share price pressure.

Result: Price-to-Sales of 1.1x (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, you also need to weigh risks such as Kraft Heinz’s recent net income loss of $4.4b and a 30.7% three-year total shareholder return decline.

Another View: What the SWS DCF Model Suggests

While the P/S of 1.1x makes Kraft Heinz look roughly in line with its fair ratio work, our DCF model points in a different direction. It estimates future cash flows at $68.79 per share versus today’s $23.76 price, which flags a sizeable potential undervaluation.

That kind of gap can signal either an opportunity or that the cash flow assumptions are too optimistic, so it is worth asking which story you think fits Kraft Heinz better, and why.

Now, that option is coming to its premium cabins as well.

The airline revealed during a Q4 earnings call last week that it will soon begin offering tiered fares for both Business and First class, becoming the first U.S.-based airline to do so.

Although the details have not yet been revealed, it's likely that these fares will operate similar to Basic Economy, which unbundles the airline seat itself from other perks like lounge access, seat selection, and the ability to earn SkyMiles. An exact timeline has not been announced, but the company plans to launch the new offerings sometime this year.

Delta is also set to offer an Extra tier for its premium cabins, mirroring a tier already offered in its Main cabin. The Extra Economy tier currently offers boarding and SkyMiles upgrades as well as increased ticketing flexibility.

No other U.S. airline currently offers lower-cost options for its premium cabins, although international carriers like Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad offer similar products for their Business class fares.

Airline President Outlines New Strategy

Delta President Glen Hauenstein said in the call that the airline plans to offer “three categories for every product, which is basic, main, and extra.”

Hauenstein explained his reasoning, saying passengers will appreciate the added flexibility across all of its cabins.

“I think that if you were offered a $500 ticket, there was no reason for you to ever want to pay more than $500 because it was fully loaded,"" he said. ""Now that seat is $500, but you can buy it for $450 if you’re willing to get the seat assignment at 48 hours, if you’re willing to have it non-refundable, and then all the way up to extra where it’s fully refundable and you get the best seats unlocked at that time.""

Ticket Update Comes Amid Changing Airline Economics

Delta's decision to offer both pared-back and premium options for all its tickets comes as the economics of air travel have changed. The airline sold over a billion dollars less in main cabin tickets last year, but still had its most profitable year ever due to jumps in business and first class ticket sales as well as co-branded credit cards. As The New York Times reported, Delta planned to have premium-cabin revenue supplant main cabin by 2027. It ended up happening by 2025, two years earlier than projected.

Meanwhile, budget airlines like Spirit and Frontier are struggling. Spirit continues to teeter on the verge of bankruptcy, while low-cost carriers Sun Country Airlines and Avelo Airlines recently announced plans to merge in order to better compete against its larger rivals. The introduction of Basic fares like Delta offers is largely credited with the shift, and it seems likely that new Business and First class ticketing tiers are likely to further shake up the economics of air travel.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/men_s_journal_718/fe5a537ad50284f02595b35bda60c09a,N,,2026-01-21 02:58:39.421065

Scheduled for a November 2026 opening, the facility marks a significant shift in how beauty giants integrate technology. Rather than a traditional administrative office, this hub is designed as a global powerhouse for innovation, data science, and supply chain logistics.

The announcement followed a meeting at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 between L'Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus and the `Telangana Rising’ delegation, led by Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy.

A Global Nerve Center for Digital Transformation

The Hyderabad GCC will not merely serve regional interests but will act as the digital backbone for L'Oréal’s global operations. CEO Nicolas Hieronimus highlighted that the solutions developed in Telangana—ranging from Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advanced data analytics—will be exported to L'Oréal facilities worldwide. ""This facility will support our digital transformation on a global scale. Tech solutions generated here in Hyderabad will be supplied to our facilities all around the world,"" Hieronimus explained during the summit.

Highlights of the Strategic Discussion

The meeting between the Telangana delegation and L'Oréal leadership covered several key pillars of growth:

The Beauty-Tech Niche: Minister D Sridhar Babu emphasized that while Hyderabad is already a leader in med-tech and health-tech, L'Oréal’s entry creates an entirely new category—Beauty-Tech—expanding the state’s GCC portfolio.

The AI Connection: The delegation presented the newly launched Telangana AI Innovation Hub (TAIH). Hieronimus expressed a strong interest in the hub, noting that AI is central to L'Oréal’s future strategy for personalized beauty and virtual ""try-on"" experiences.

Future Manufacturing: Beyond the tech hub, special chief secretary Sanjay Kumar formally invited L'Oréal to establish a manufacturing unit in the state. Citing Telangana’s robust infrastructure and existing ecosystem, the proposal was met with a positive response, with L'Oréal agreeing to explore future investments in local production.

A Growing Ecosystem: The Minister noted that L'Oréal joins an elite group of global giants—including Netflix, Vanguard, and Marriott—that have recently chosen Hyderabad as their global base.

What is a Beauty-Tech GCC?

To understand the scale of this investment, it helps to look at the ""Beauty-Tech"" ecosystem L'Oréal has been building. The Hyderabad center is expected to focus on:

Hyper-personalization: Using AI to analyze skin and hair types for custom product recommendations

Smart Supply Chain: Real-time data tracking to optimize global distribution and reduce carbon footprints

Augmented Reality: Developing the next generation of virtual makeup and hair color testing tools

Big Data: Analyzing global consumer trends to predict the next big beauty movements

Looking Ahead

Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy and Minister D Sridhar Babu have been officially invited to lead the inauguration ceremony in November 2026.

Levi Strauss (LEVI) has drawn fresh investor attention after topping a major apparel brand loyalty ranking and rolling out its Wear Longer Project, a national program centered on clothing repair, customization, and sustainability education.

Despite the positive brand news, Levi Strauss’ recent share price performance has been subdued, with a 1-day share price return decline of 3.68% and a 30-day share price return decline of 3.45%. At the same time, the 1-year total shareholder return of 23.02% and 3-year total shareholder return of 36.90% point to momentum that has built over a longer stretch.

If brand strength and sustainability are on your radar, this could be a good moment to widen the lens and check out as another corner of the market to research.

With Levi Strauss posting a 1-year total shareholder return of 23.02%, trading at $20.96, and sitting at roughly a 30% discount to the average analyst price target, you have to ask: is there real value here, or is the market already baking in future growth?

Price to earnings of 15.7x, is it justified?

At a last close of US$20.96, Levi Strauss trades on a P/E of 15.7x, which screens as good value against both its own fair P/E and key peer groups.

P/E compares the company’s share price to its earnings, so it is a quick way to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of profit. For a branded apparel group like Levi Strauss, this matters because earnings quality, return on equity and growth expectations often influence how far that multiple can stretch.

Here, the 15.7x P/E sits below the estimated fair P/E of 18x, which suggests the market price is not fully reflecting the level of earnings being generated. It also comes alongside high quality earnings, a 24.2% return on equity and earnings that grew much faster than their 5 year average. This provides some context for why a higher multiple could potentially be supported over time.

Against the wider market, the P/E appears more compressed. It is lower than the US Luxury industry average of 20.1x and well below the peer average of 31.9x. This points to a gap that could close if sentiment shifts toward companies with stronger profitability metrics.

Result: Price-to-earnings of 15.7x (UNDERVALUED)

However, you still need to weigh risks such as recent short term share price weakness, as well as the possibility that brand driven expectations outpace actual revenue and earnings trends.

Another view on value

Our DCF model points in the same direction as the P/E comparison but from a different angle. With Levi Strauss trading at US$20.96 versus an SWS DCF fair value estimate of US$25.52, the shares sit at about an 18% discount on this method as well. If both signals are pointing to value, what factors could potentially influence the story from here?

The packaged food giant has been struggling with sluggish sales amid a lack of innovation, underinvestment in brands, fierce competition from healthier alternatives, and rising food prices. The filing does not confirm a sale but enables the selling shareholder to dispose of its holding.

Why Is Berkshire Exiting Its Stake?

Warren Buffett first acquired shares during the 2015 merger between Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, alongside Brazilian private equity group 3G Capital. However, the combined company did not progress as expected. Buffett has called the investment a mistake due to excessive optimism about its prospects.

Under Buffett’s leadership, Berkshire already wrote down the KHC investment twice and took huge losses: a $3 billion write-down in 2019 and another $3.76 billion in August 2025.

Kraft Heinz Prepares for a Split

Berkshire’s potential sale comes ahead of Kraft Heinz’s planned split in the second half of this year. In September 2025, KHC announced the breakup, citing the merged company’s complex structure, which has hindered effective capital allocation, initiative prioritization, and scaling of promising areas.

The split will create two companies, one for groceries and the other for sauces and spreads, so each can focus resources better and improve results. Kraft Heinz also pointed to shifting consumer tastes toward healthier foods and weak sales, including a 3% drop in 2024, as factors driving the decision.

KHC appointed new CEO Steve Cahillane on January 1, 2026, to oversee the split, the same day when Greg Abel took over Berkshire’s helm from Buffett. Both Abel and Buffett have opposed the split, which could also be one of the reasons for Berkshire’s potential exit.

Why Is Kraft Heinz Stock So Low?

KHC stock has lost 19.4% over the past year amid ongoing challenges. On TipRanks, Kraft Heinz has a Hold consensus rating based on zero Buys, 13 Holds, and one Sell rating. The average Kraft Heinz price target of $25.38 implies 6.8% upside potential from current levels.

Overview

French beauty giant L'Oréal is launching its inaugural global technology hub in Hyderabad, India. The move signals a substantial ₹3,500 crore investment through 2030, aiming to create 2,000 tech roles. This strategic development places India at the forefront of L'Oréal's global digital and AI strategy, leveraging local talent for AI-led solutions and digital platforms.

French beauty conglomerate L'Oréal has formalized its strategic partnership with the Government of Telangana. This collaboration centers on establishing the company's first global Beauty Tech Hub in Hyderabad.

The agreement, formalized at the World Economic Forum in Davos, outlines a significant investment exceeding ₹3,500 crore through 2030. L'Oréal plans to create approximately 2,000 high-value technology roles over this period.

Investment and Job Creation

These positions will span AI specialists, engineers, and data professionals, bolstering the company's capabilities in data, artificial intelligence, and generative AI. This Hyderabad facility is set to become the company's sole global hub dedicated to beauty technology.

India at the Forefront of AI Strategy

The hub will operate as a key node within L'Oréal's international technology and AI network, supporting global teams in developing and scaling digital tools and platforms. This move significantly elevates India's role in the company's overarching technology and services roadmap.

State Government Collaboration

Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy stated the partnership directly supports the state's ""Telangana Rising: 2047 Vision"" by generating jobs and positioning the state as an AI and digital excellence epicenter. The initiative also aligns with the 2026 India-France Year of Innovation.

Global Network Integration

L'Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus highlighted the group's 31-year commitment to India, emphasizing the harnessing of local tech and AI expertise. He posited that Hyderabad will now be central to the company's digital ambition, aiming to invent the future of beauty.

The announcement was made following a high-level meeting at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 between D. Sridhar Babu, Hon’ble Minister for IT, Electronics & Industries, Sanjay Kumar, Special Chief Secretary, Government of Telangana, and Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L’Oréal.

Billed as the first Beauty Tech hub of its kind globally, the Hyderabad facility will serve as a flagship centre for developing the next generation of AI-powered beauty innovation and services. With an initial investment of over ₹3,500 crores (€350 million) through 2030, the hub will focus on Data, AI, Generative AI, Agentic AI, and other emerging technologies. It is expected to create 2,000 highly skilled jobs, including roles for AI specialists, tech engineers, and data scientists, while accelerating the global deployment of AI-led beauty solutions at scale.

The partnership between L’Oréal and the Government of Telangana was formalised at Davos and stands as a key milestone in the 2026 India–France Year of Innovation. Beyond infrastructure investment, the collaboration emphasises talent development and upskilling, with the vision of building “from India, for the world” AI-driven beauty solutions. By establishing the hub in Hyderabad, L’Oréal aims to contribute to Telangana’s growing stature as a centre for digital excellence and high-value technology talent.

The India Tech Hub will also play a strategic role within L’Oréal’s integrated global AI and Tech ecosystem, complementing existing hubs in France, the USA, China, Singapore, Spain, Poland, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico. Together, these centres are designed to foster global collaboration and co-create the future of Beauty Tech.

Welcoming the development, Revanth Reddy, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Telangana, said, “We are delighted that L’Oréal has chosen Hyderabad for its new global tech hub, a decision that reflects the deep confidence global leaders place in Telangana’s innovation ecosystem and highly skilled talent pool. This partnership directly supports our ‘Telangana Rising: 2047 Vision’ by creating 2,000 high-value jobs and positioning our state as a global epicentre for AI and digital excellence.”

Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO, L’Oréal, said, “For over 31 years, L’Oréal has been deeply committed to India. Building on this legacy, we are harnessing India’s world-class tech and AI engineering expertise to power our new global Tech Hub.

At ServiceNow, we’re actively realigning our Finance & Strategy organization for an AI-native future. As AI becomes embedded in how decisions are made, our workforce must evolve just as quickly. For us, AI fluency is now table stakes. Every role in Finance & Strategy must confidently leverage agentic tools—from research platforms and summarization engines to forecasting copilots and modeling assistants—to accelerate insight and execution. But fluency alone is not sufficient. The real shift is toward hybrid talent: professionals who combine deep financial and strategic judgment with the ability to work with, interrogate, and govern AI at scale. These are the architects of modern finance automation and decision-making. Within our teams, this includes emerging roles such as: * The AI Finance Strategist, who understands the business strategies and identifies key opportunities in finance for execution through AI. * The Finance Ops Specialist, who builds and implements AI workflows that power forecasting, scenario planning, and decision support. * The AI Risk Specialist, who safeguards integrity by monitoring and mitigating risks tied to AI-driven decisions.

ServiceNow just signed a three-year deal with OpenAI. This is the specialization model playing out in real time. ServiceNow is excellent at workflow platforms. OpenAI is excellent at AI models. Neither is trying to do the other's job. Each focuses on what they do best and partners for the rest. This validates what I keep hearing from vendors: ""We don't have the bandwidth to build everything."" ServiceNow could have tried building their own models. They have the resources. They did if I recall correctly. But building world-class AI models would pull focus from what actually differentiates them - their workflow platform and enterprise integration capabilities. OpenAI gets distribution into one of the largest enterprise software platforms without building workflow tools. ServiceNow gets leading AI models without years of R&D investment. Both win because they're not trying to own layers they don't need to own. The article (link in comments) mentions ServiceNow has similar deals with OpenAI's competitors. That's the point. They're platform-agnostic because their value isn't the AI models themselves. Their moat is the workflow layer, the data layer, and how well they integrate into enterprise operations. When AI models commoditize, differentiation comes from everything around the models. This includes the workflows, the context, and the integration quality. This is the same model Unito operates on. We specialize in the integration layer so vendors can focus on what they do best while their systems actually talk to each other. ServiceNow's partnership with OpenAI is a blueprint for how enterprise AI gets built at scale. Not by vendors trying to own the entire stack, but by specialists focusing on their layer and partnering for the rest. The vendors that figure this out will ship products people actually adopt. The ones still trying to build everything will keep struggling with complexity.

OpenAI and ServiceNow’s three-year deal embeds AI models and agents directly into enterprise workflow software. ServiceNow made a revenue commitment to OpenAI; customers will access OpenAI intelligence within ServiceNow platforms. The deal reflects AI agents becoming standard business software infrastructure, not standalone products but embedded capabilities. ∙ Distribution Strategy: OpenAI gains enterprise reach through ServiceNow’s installed base rather than selling direct. The revenue commitment structure guarantees OpenAI income while ServiceNow absorbs adoption risk—a favorable arrangement for the model maker expanding beyond consumer chatbots. ∙ Computer-Use Integration: ServiceNow will embed OpenAI’s computer-use model, enabling agents to perform IT tasks autonomously—restarting computers, accessing legacy mainframe data. This targets real enterprise pain: unlocking information trapped in old systems without costly custom integration. ∙ Voice Agent Development: ServiceNow will build customer service voice agents using OpenAI’s speech models. The workflow software + voice AI combination creates end-to-end automation for call centers and IT helpdesks—high-volume, high-cost functions ripe for agent replacement. ∙ Competitive Positioning: OpenAI faces Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft in enterprise AI. ServiceNow’s “open platform” stance—maintaining relationships with multiple model providers—means this deal provides distribution without exclusivity. OpenAI must compete on capability within ServiceNow’s multi-model environment. ∙ IT Labor Implications: The article explicitly notes AI agents will “disrupt the IT labor market, which has been in steady decline.” ServiceNow deploying “forward deployed engineers” to help customers implement automation acknowledges the product’s purpose: reducing human IT headcount through agent substitution. The partnership structure previews enterprise AI’s distribution model: workflow platforms become the surface where agents operate, model makers provide intelligence, and customers pay through existing software relationships rather than new AI contracts https://lnkd.in/ekr98TKb

It was only a matter of time, but still ""newsworthy""...not quite ""breaking news"" worth though.. #ServiceNow's deal with #OpenAI allows them to enhance their platforms by integrating the ChatGPT-maker’s AI models into ServiceNow’s products. In other words, ServiceNow doesn't have to build out the #AI capabilities on their own. Of course, this comes at a cost...for ServiceNow and ServiceNow customers. Based on the reporting, ServiceNow has made a revenue commitment to OpenAI. Specifics were not shared, but did we expect them to be? ServiceNow customers should expect an accelerated push to get adoption and usage of ServiceNow ""AI"" offerings. ServiceNow customers, that have not properly protected themselves, should also expected meaningful price increases imposed come renewal time. I also fully expect this deal and partnership to be highlighted during ServiceNow's upcoming Q4 earnings call (next week) and throughout ServiceNow's annual Knowledge conference in May. #negotiation https://lnkd.in/egi6sDnu",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E1AAQGO6VwAbBYh_Q/storylineheaderimage-shrink_400_400/B4EZvb4gNPHkAM-/0/1768920581323?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=sGDQcwwcgpx98IEtaYx6thGgctcZS8qRtG2gWVl7oYU,N,,2026-01-21 00:01:04.109201

Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) announced a $14.5b agreement to acquire Penumbra, expanding into neurovascular and mechanical thrombectomy markets.

The company also agreed to acquire Valencia Technologies, adding the FDA approved eCoin System for overactive bladder to its Urology portfolio.

Both deals mark some of the largest transactions for Boston Scientific in recent years and target underpenetrated medical device segments.

Boston Scientific comes into these acquisitions with shares at $91.2 and a long run of strong multi year returns, including 99.0% over 3 years and 148.9% over 5 years. Recent performance has been softer, with a 9.6% decline over 1 year and smaller declines over the past week, month and year to date, so investors may be watching how these transactions influence sentiment.

For shareholders and potential investors, a central consideration is how effectively Boston Scientific can integrate Penumbra and Valencia Technologies and scale the new platforms. The deals meaningfully widen NYSE:BSX exposure to neurovascular, thrombectomy and urology devices, so future updates on regulatory, clinical and commercial execution around these assets are likely to be important catalysts.

📊 The Penumbra and Valencia deals push Boston Scientific deeper into neurovascular, thrombectomy and urology, so your thesis may hinge more on these segments than before.

📊 Keep an eye on integration progress, regulatory milestones and how margins and earnings per share track against the current P/E of about 48.5.

⚠️ Simply Wall St highlights a high level of debt, which matters more when taking on large acquisitions and potential earn outs or pipeline investment.

Summary:

The dollar weakened as Greenland tensions and tariff threats escalated.

Barclays warns euro faces greater risk in a severe US–EU fallout.

NATO cohesion and European defence spending are key concerns.

Export-heavy economies like Germany are seen as most exposed.

Analysts expect limited US asset divestment even in worst case.

The US dollar weakened on Tuesday as markets reacted to an escalation in geopolitical tensions linked to President Donald Trump’s renewed push to assert control over Greenland, including threats to impose tariffs on European countries opposing the move.

While the greenback softened on the day, some strategists argue the longer-term risks from a deterioration in US–Europe relations may fall more heavily on the euro. Analysts at Barclays said that in an extreme scenario, the Greenland dispute could become a far greater problem for Europe and the single currency than for the United States.

Barclays noted that the situation has sharpened investor focus on strains within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, raising tail risks around alliance cohesion. European governments, already under pressure to lift defence spending following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, have this month deployed troops to Greenland and now face the prospect of trade retaliation from Washington. In a worst-case outcome, Barclays warned that relations between the US and its NATO partners could deteriorate to the point where Washington effectively disengages from the alliance.

Other analysts echoed the view that a tougher trade environment would be more damaging for Europe than the US. Export-heavy economies such as Germany, the region’s largest, are seen as particularly exposed, with tariffs likely to hurt European corporates and growth prospects more than their US counterparts. That dynamic, strategists argue, would ultimately pressure the euro more than the dollar.

Market moves on Tuesday reflected near-term risk aversion. The ICE US Dollar Index fell around 0.8%, extending its decline over the past year to nearly 10%, while US equities and bonds also sold off sharply.

Barclays cautioned against over-interpreting these initial reactions, arguing that knee-jerk market moves often differ from longer-term outcomes. Its base case remains that the US and Europe eventually find a compromise allowing Washington to meet its security objectives in Greenland without a full rupture in relations.

Even in a more adverse scenario, the bank does not expect a wholesale exit from US assets. Instead, any dollar weakness would likely reflect low hedging ratios among foreign investors rather than a mass divestment. Barclays added that Europe’s fiscal constraints mean the bar for policy-driven euro support remains high unless there is coordinated joint issuance to fund common defence capabilities.",https://images.investinglive.com/images/eurusd%20charrt%20update%2021%20January%202026_id_5809a09a-faac-4251-8005-82cfeef4dfac_size975.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:01:00.789090

This action is in accordance with the terms outlined in the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, which dates back to July 2, 2015. This agreement involves The Kraft Heinz Company, 3G Global Food Holdings LP, and Berkshire Hathaway. The company submitted a prospectus supplement to the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 20, 2026, to facilitate this registration exclusively for the Selling Stockholder. This move potentially positions these shares for resale in the open market.

The Kraft Heinz Company, formed through the merger of Kraft and Heinz in July 2015, stands as one of North America's largest food and beverage manufacturers.

Financial Health Analysis

Kraft Heinz's financial performance reflects a complex landscape. The company's revenue stands at $25.16 billion, with a three-year revenue growth rate of 0%. Despite a gross margin of 33.71%, the company faces challenges with a net margin of -17.35% and an EPS of -3.73. The operating margin is relatively strong at 19.45%, but the EBITDA margin is negative at -18.65%.

On the balance sheet, Kraft Heinz exhibits a current ratio of 1.13 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.51, indicating moderate leverage. The Altman Z-Score of 0.42 places the company in the distress zone, suggesting a potential risk of bankruptcy within the next two years. Insider activity reveals a trend of selling, with 250,000 shares sold in the past three months.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

In terms of valuation, Kraft Heinz's P/S ratio of 1.12 and P/B ratio of 0.68 are close to their historical lows, suggesting potential undervaluation. The forward P/E ratio is 9.47, indicating a cautious market outlook. Analyst recommendations average at 2.9, reflecting a hold sentiment. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 42.76 and moving averages suggest a neutral to slightly bearish trend.

Institutional ownership is robust at 83.5%, while insider ownership is relatively low at 0.96%. Recent insider activity has been predominantly selling, with no insider purchases in the past year.

IBM Deepens Enterprise AI Push With Governance Focus And GRAMMY IQ

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Bailey Pemberton

January 20, 2026

IBM launched IBM Enterprise Advantage, a new offering focused on enterprise AI adoption and governance.

The company announced a collaboration with e& to deploy one of the region's first enterprise-grade agentic AI governance solutions.

IBM also worked on GRAMMY IQ, applying its AI capabilities to fan engagement in entertainment.

International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is leaning further into enterprise AI with products and partnerships that aim to embed AI into core business and compliance workflows. The company’s recent moves come with the stock around $291.35 and a 1 year return of 33.3%, along with multi year gains of 129.7% over 3 years and 206.3% over 5 years.

IBM Enterprise Advantage and the e& collaboration point in the same direction: IBM is leaning into agentic, governed AI as a core part of how large organizations run workflows, particularly in risk, compliance, and complex data environments. GRAMMY IQ then shows the same toolset applied to a consumer facing setting, which may help IBM showcase watsonx and its Granite models to a wide audience while still focusing on enterprise grade use cases behind the scenes.

How This Fits the International Business Machines Narrative

These announcements line up closely with existing narratives that emphasize IBM’s focus on hybrid cloud, AI and software execution, with consulting used as the delivery engine. Enterprise Advantage, in particular, speaks to the idea that IBM aims to be the partner that helps clients weave AI into day to day decision making, while the e& deployment and GRAMMY IQ give concrete proof points that may matter to investors who are tracking execution rather than just high level AI messaging.

Risks and Rewards Investors Are Weighing

Enterprise Advantage could support IBM’s push toward higher value consulting and software style engagements if clients adopt internal AI platforms at scale.

The e& deployment and GRAMMY IQ give IBM reference cases in both regulated and consumer settings, which may help win future AI and hybrid cloud work.

Analysts have highlighted execution risk around software and AI, and these offerings still need to translate into sustained revenue growth and margins to support more optimistic narratives.

IBM’s debt level remains a consideration for some investors when assessing how much flexibility the company has to keep investing in AI, quantum and acquisitions.

What To Watch Next

From here, it is useful to watch how many large clients adopt Enterprise Advantage, how broadly the e& governance solution is rolled out, and whether high profile projects like GRAMMY IQ lead to repeat work in other industries.

That programme focuses on insurance solutions designed to support restoration and rehabilitation projects built around long-term environmental resilience.
The companies said the consortium is open to engagement with project developers, investors, and stakeholders active in ecological restoration.","Scor, a French global reinsurance company headquartered, providing life, health, property, and casualty reinsurance services worldwide, and Axa, a French multinational insurance and financial services group, have launched a Lloyd’s consortium focused on ecological restoration, targeting a segment of environmental risk long left outside mainstream insurance coverage.

The consortium aims to support financing for ecological restoration projects by reducing investment risk tied to implementation phases.

By providing insurance protection, the partners intend to unlock capital for projects restoring ecosystems damaged or destroyed by prior activity.

The initiative, branded Restore, is led by Scor Syndicate 2015 at Lloyd’s and managed by Scor Managing Agency. Capacity support comes from Axa XL Syndicate 2003.

Combined reach and balance sheet strength allow the structure to underwrite larger and more complex restoration projects across multiple regions.

Scor and Axa said the consortium addresses a gap in the insurance market where projects aimed at ecosystem recovery struggle to secure protection during early and execution-heavy stages.

Restore underwrites the phase where conditions for ecological recovery are established, a point where uncertainty often deters investors.

The launch builds on Scor’s Nature Restoration and Conservation initiative introduced in May 2024. That programme focuses on insurance solutions designed to support restoration and rehabilitation projects built around long-term environmental resilience.

Jean-Paul Conoscente said the Restore structure increases the probability of project completion by improving confidence for developers and financiers.

Partnering with Axa, allows Scor to expand capacity and address environmental challenges at greater scale.

The companies said the consortium is open to engagement with project developers, investors, and stakeholders active in ecological restoration.

The aim is to build a pipeline of insurable projects where risk transfer helps convert environmental ambition into deployable capital.",https://beinsure.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2-25.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 20:00:08.575978

Greater Wellington Chair Daran Ponter says that the strong rating during a time of major government reforms and uncertainty is a valuable indicator of Greater Wellington’s fiscal responsibility.

“This rating makes it clear that while Greater Wellington is doing everything it can to deliver value for money services to our ratepayers, the proposed rate caps and other pressures from central government are putting a huge strain on our ability to do so,” says Cr Ponter.

Chair of the Finance, Risk and Audit Committee, Yadana Saw, says reforms are likely to erode existing core services while also threatening the viability of longer-term strategic projects.

“Changes to the Resource Management Act, rate capping and a review of the role of regional councils could negatively affect our future financial landscape, which makes it harder for us deliver on a cleaner environment, a more flood resilient region and critical public transport improvements.”

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

New York AG Scrutinizes Instacart's Algorithmic Pricing Practices

On January 8, 2026, the New York Attorney General's Office sent a formal information request to Instacart seeking details about its pricing practices and compliance with New York's recently enacted Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act. The AG's letter follows a December 2025 report by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative alleging that Instacart users were shown materially different prices for identical products at the same stores and at the same time.

The AG's letter raises concerns that Instacart's pricing experiments—and the tools it offers to retailers and CPG brands—may constitute ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" under New York law, which requires a clear and conspicuous disclosure whenever an algorithm sets prices using personal data. The Attorney General specifically questions whether Instacart's current disclosures, which appear only through fine-print links on certain pages, satisfy the statute's disclosure requirements.

Although Instacart has publicly stated that it ended item-level price testing in December and that its testing did not rely on personal or behavioral data, the AG notes that Instacart has also acknowledged that retail and brand partners may continue to test promotions and discounts on the platform. The letter seeks extensive information about Instacart's pricing tools (including Eversight and smart cart technology), agreements with retailers and brands, the scope of any price experiments, and how consumer data may be used in pricing or promotions.

Why it matters: This inquiry signals heightened enforcement attention on algorithmic pricing and transparency—particularly where platforms, retailers, or brands rely on automated tools to test prices, discounts, or promotions. Companies operating in New York should carefully evaluate whether any pricing variability could be viewed as ""personalized algorithmic pricing"" and whether disclosures are sufficiently clear, prominent, and consistently presented wherever prices are displayed.

New York Adopts Two Bills Regulating Commercial Use of AI-Generated Content

New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed two bills on December 11, 2025, that together expand New York's approach to AI transparency and post-mortem rights of publicity in entertainment-adjacent contexts.

Synthetic performers in advertising (S.8420-A / A.8887-B). The first law amends New York's General Business Law to require a clear and conspicuous disclosure when an advertisement includes an AI-generated ""synthetic performer."" The law includes carveouts for certain audio advertisements and for situations where AI is used solely to translate the language of a human performer, and it generally does not apply to ads or promotional materials for certain expressive works (e.g., films/TV/streaming/video games) where the use of the synthetic performer is consistent with its use in the expressive work. A first violation may result in a $1,000 civil penalty, with $5,000 for subsequent violations. The disclosure requirement becomes effective 180 days after enactment (approximately June 2026, based on the December 11, 2025, signing).

Post-mortem name/image/likeness and digital replicas (S.8391 / A.8882). The second law strengthens New York's right of publicity framework by requiring consent from heirs or executors for the commercial use of a deceased individual's name, image, or likeness after death. In addition, it updates the definitions and liability standards applicable to digital replicas—including tightening the rules for using a deceased performer's digital replica in certain expressive works by moving from a disclaimer-oriented approach toward a prior-consent model. The bill takes effect immediately.

Key Takeaways

These bills illustrate an accelerating state-level push to address AI-enabled impersonation and consumer confusion in advertising while simultaneously expanding protections against unauthorized post-mortem commercialization. For advertisers and studios, the practical compliance focus is (i) auditing whether campaigns use synthetic performers (and whether an exception applies), (ii) building disclosure into production workflows ahead of the June 2026 effective date, and (iii) obtaining appropriate rights and permissions—particularly where a campaign uses a deceased individual's identity or a digital replica in a way that could trigger New York's consent requirements.

Supergoop! Sunscreen Hit With False Ad Class Action Claiming ""Mineral"" Products Contain ""Unnatural"" Ingredients

Supergoop! was the target of a proposed California class action alleging that its marketing of certain sunscreen products as ""100% Mineral"" and ""Mineral"" is false and misleading under state consumer protection laws.

According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that reasonable consumers interpret ""100% Mineral"" claims to mean that the entire product formula, not just the active sunscreen ingredients, consists solely of mineral or natural ingredients and does not contain synthetic, chemically altered, or otherwise non-mineral components. The plaintiff further alleges that Supergoop's use of ""100% Mineral"" language creates a net impression that the products are free from non-mineral or highly processed ingredients.

This complaint challenges labeling and marketing for more than a dozen Supergoop sunscreen products sold nationwide, including products marketed for adults and children. Plaintiff alleges that, contrary to the challenged representations, the products contain numerous non-mineral ingredients. In addition, the complaint asserts that certain ingredients derived from minerals or natural sources have been subjected to significant chemical processing or modification, resulting in ingredients that are materially different from their original mineral or natural form.

The lawsuit asserts claims under California's Unfair Competition Law and False Advertising Law and seeks restitution, injunctive relief, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees on behalf of a proposed statewide class of California purchasers. Supergoop denies the allegations, and the case is in its early stages.

Key Takeaways

The case reflects continued litigation risk around ""100%"", ""free-of,"" ""natural,"" and ""mineral"" claims—particularly where plaintiffs argue that consumers reasonably interpret such claims to apply to an entire formulation rather than discrete components. While some courts have been open to crediting reasonable consumers with the ability to read ingredient declarations, this isn't universal and frequently turns on the specifics of the label. One thing is certain, which is that ingredient-based claims remain the most common risk point for CPG claims. Brands can manage this risk through thoughtful use of qualifiers and marketing copy.

FTC Sets Aside Rytr Order, Finding Prior Order Was Not Supported by the Complaint

The Federal Trade Commission has reopened and set aside its December 2024 consent order against Rytr LLC, concluding that the complaint underlying the order failed to plead facts sufficient to support a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.

Rytr offers an AI-enabled writing assistance service, including functionality that could be used to generate draft consumer reviews. In 2024, the FTC alleged that this service provided the ""means and instrumentalities"" for deception and constituted an unfair practice because it could generate large volumes of reviews without regard to accuracy. Rytr agreed to settle those allegations through a consent order that broadly barred it from offering any AI-enabled service designed to generate consumer reviews or testimonials.

In its December 2025 Order Reopening and Setting Aside the 2024 Order, the Commission determined that the complaint did not adequately plead either theory of liability. With respect to the means-and-instrumentalities claim, the FTC concluded that the complaint failed to allege that Rytr itself created deceptive marketing content, that its service was inherently deceptive, or that Rytr knew or had reason to know its customers would use the tool to violate the law. The Commission emphasized that providing a general-purpose tool with legitimate, pro-consumer uses—such as assisting users in drafting or editing review content—does not, without more, establish liability under Section 5.

The FTC also concluded that the complaint failed to plead an unfairness violation. The allegations did not establish that Rytr's service caused or was likely to cause substantial consumer injury, nor did they plausibly allege that any such injury outweighed countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Because the complaint failed to plead a cognizable Section 5 violation, the Commission found that the consent order provided no consumer benefit and was therefore not in the public interest.

In reaching this conclusion, the FTC also cited recent federal policy directives calling on agencies to review and, where appropriate, set aside final orders that unduly burden artificial intelligence innovation. The Commission stressed, however, that its decision rested on the legal insufficiency of the complaint itself. The FTC reiterated that it would continue to pursue enforcement where AI tools are used to deceive consumers or where companies misrepresent the capabilities or outputs of AI-enabled products.

Click here for more details from CMS about the TAVR NCD.","The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is considering making substantial changes to how Medicare covers transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures in the United States. Some stakeholders are excited about the idea, embracing the possibility of expanded indications and fewer restrictions. Others are less enthusiastic, sharing concerns that patient care could suffer as a result.

What could change if CMS updates its Medicare policies for TAVR?

CMS first finalized its national coverage determination (NCD) for TAVR back in 2012 and then revisited that policy in 2019. Now, after receiving a formal request from Edwards Lifesciences, CMS is once again reconsidering the NCD to determine if any major updates are needed.

It is not exactly clear how far CMS is thinking about going with its changes to the TAVR NCD, but multiple major updates appear to be on the table.

The end of CED requirements

TAVR techniques and technologies have evolved significantly in recent years, and Edwards said in its request that coverage policies need to evolve as well. For example, the TAVR NCD has always included coverage with evidence development (CED) rules that require patient data to be gathered through clinical trials or registries. CED requirements are meant to be temporary, Edwards argued, and the TAVR has matured enough as a therapy that these restrictions are no longer necessary.

“TAVR is among the most rigorously studied medical device technologies subject to CED,” according to the Edwards. “Through this NCD reconsideration, CMS has an opportunity to demonstrate responsiveness to the extensive evidence collected to date by establishing a successful end to CED for TAVR.”

Approved TAVR procedures for asymptomatic patients

Edwards also asked CMS to consider fully covering TAVR in asymptomatic patients. TAVR was initially approved for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS)—no symptoms meant no procedure—but there has been a push in recent years to approve treatment in asymptomatic patients who present with signs of severe AS on medical imaging results.

Edwards has been leading that particular charge, pointing to clinical evidence from the EARLY TAVR clinical trial—which it sponsored—as proof that treating these patients right away provides significant value.

In May 2025, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officially approved Edwards’ balloon-expandable Sapien 3 TAVR platform for the treatment of asymptomatic AS, it became clear the company would be pushing CMS to rethink its current coverage policies.

Even experts who do not necessarily agree with treating asymptomatic patients with TAVR still largely believe CMS and the FDA should to be on the same page. When the FDA is approving medical devices for specific therapies, but CMS does not cover the therapy in question, it creates the potential for considerable confusion.

A changing approach to multidisciplinary heart teams

For Medicare to cover any TAVR procedure, there are rules in place that required at least one cardiac surgeon to be consulted. Now that the procedure has evolved, however, there is a belief among some TAVR advocates that surgeon evaluations are no longer necessary and an interventional cardiologist can handle any treatment decisions.

The Edwards request pointed to positive outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when collaborations were harder in healthcare for logistical reasons, as evidence that surgeons only need to be consulted on more complex cases. CMS now appears to be considering changes to these requirements.

Potential changes receive mixed feedback

CMS announced its intention to reconsider the current NCD for TAVR in December, urging stakeholders to share public comments by Jan. 14. Medical societies, medtech vendors, cardiologists, surgeons and many other stakeholders all stepped forward to share their perspective.

Leading medical societies share unified statement

Five leading U.S. medical societies responsible for the treatment of patients with severe AS collaborated on a unified response to the CMS request. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS), American College of Cardiology (ACC), Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) all signed on to the statement

One key takeaway from the statement is that the societies think it is still too early to end the CED requirements. Registry data and clinical trials have provided substantial evidence that directly led to TAVR being offered to additional patient populations, the groups wrote. They emphasized that real-world evidence and clinical data remain necessary as the procedure continues to evolve.

“The societies strongly believe that continuation of the CED paradigm is essential to address existing and emerging clinical questions,” they wrote. “Submission of data on all TAVR procedures to a national registry should remain a requirement.”

The five societies also appear to accept that TAVR may be covered for the treatment of asymptomatic patients in the near future. This remains a relatively controversial topic among cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, with some embracing the use of asymptomatic TAVR and others fearful that it could put patents at risk, but it does appear to be inevitable in the wake of the FDA’s approval of the Edwards platform.

Instead of arguing against the treatment of asymptomatic patients, the groups highlighted the importance of maintaining high-quality patient care. Treating AS requires a “comprehensive, team-based approach,” they wrote, and multi-disciplinary teams should remain at the center of any treatment decisions.

Medtronic shares its own perspective on potential TAVR coverage changes

Medtronic and Edwards are largely seen as the two leading TAVR vendors in the United States. Edwards was the company that initially got this process started, but what does Medtronic think about these potential changes? The company shared a public comment that summarized where it stands.

Overall, Medtronic said it remains in support of CED as “a mechanism to support coverage and evidence generation.” Data can be captured in a “minimally burdensome manner,” the company wrote, and doing so is beneficial for both providers and the patients they serve.

In addition, Medtronic shared its concerns about Medicare coverage being approved for symptomatic patients. While the initial approval of TAVR in symptomatic patients was based on a significant amount of data, the company wrote, there is still only limited data on the treatment of patients who present without symptoms.

“While promising, the evidence of efficacy of TAVR in asymptomatic patients is focused on one trial plus another which is noted to have inadequate statistical power, with two more randomized controlled trials currently enrolling,” according to the Medtronic comment.

Medtronic also said it still wants cardiac surgeons to be involved in treatment decisions, highlighting the importance of their experience and expertise when it comes to surgical aortic valve replacement.

Edwards provides an additional comment

Edwards did issue a public comment of its own. The company reiterated that it believes 1.) the NCD’s CED requirements have been satisfied, and 2.) TAVR should be covered for the treatment of asymptomatic severe AS.

However, Edwards also said it believes cardiac surgeons should remain a central part of any multidisciplinary heart team. Removing surgeons from TAVR discussions is one potential change the company does not appear to support.

The full Edwards statement is available here.

Other public comments show a variety of responses

CMS received a total of 170 public comments about the TAVR NCD. Many of those comments cheered the possibility that there could soon be fewer restrictions on patient car, but others included genuine concerns about how things might unfold if too many changes are put into place.

For now, CMS certainly has a lot of feedback to consider. A proposed decision memo is expected in June 2026.

SUMMARY

U.S. Bancorp (USB 0.04%) reported record revenue and earnings, citing broad-based growth in both net interest income and fee revenue. Strategic focus included disciplined expense management, sustainable operating leverage, and continued investments in technology and productivity. Management emphasized deposit growth, especially in consumer and operational accounts, along with improved capital and credit quality metrics. The planned BTIG acquisition is projected to meaningfully increase quarterly fee revenues and support capital markets growth, with minimal initial impact on capital ratios or EPS due to merger-related costs. Guidance for 2026 reflects confidence in both net interest and fee income expansion, further supported by flexibility in expense controls if revenue growth slows.

John Stern stated, ""We expect merger-related costs to happen in the next quarter or two. And so as that occurs, that will keep the EPS neutral. And so, after that, then we expect to have some, obviously, we'll see margin expansion in this business once we get through those costs.""

Loan growth expectations for 2026 are in the 3%-4% range, led by commercial, credit card, and improving commercial real estate segments.

Gunjan Kedia described robust client demand in digital assets and highlighted the launch of custody offerings for cryptocurrency and stablecoin, supporting GFS and ETF growth.

The company expects deposit growth to track loan growth, with ongoing reductions in CDs and a focus on more accretive consumer and operational deposits.

Management highlighted that productivity gains from digital investments and AI are generating cost flexibility while allowing continued investment in fee-based growth areas.

The net interest margin outlook maintains a targeted path to 3% by 2027, with contribution from asset repricing and further deposit mix improvements.

Consumer deposit balances rose $7 billion, and the company noted momentum in acquiring new client accounts and leveraging digital tools nationally.

Global Fund Services achieved nearly half of all new U.S. ETF launches in 2025, demonstrating market share gains in a high-growth, capital-efficient business.

Branch strategy centers on modernizing existing locations and achieving top-five market share in core geographies, with $200 million allocated to continuous branch investments annually.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I will begin on Slide three. This quarter, we delivered strong earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of approximately 18% year over year on an adjusted basis. Net interest income this quarter increased 3.3% year over year, supported by strong consumer deposit growth. Fee revenue grew 7.6% year over year with broad-based strength across most of our fee businesses. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, we posted record net revenues of $7.4 billion and $28.7 billion, respectively. More specifically, in the fourth quarter, total net revenue grew 5.1%, and we delivered meaningful positive operating leverage of 440 basis points as adjusted.

John will provide more details on our financial performance in his opening remarks. Moving to Slide four. A clear focus this year has been on restoring investor confidence in our ability to deliver strong and more consistent financial results. For the second consecutive quarter, more focused execution on our three key priorities resulted in us operating within all of our medium-term target ranges. On Slide five, we highlight steady progress against our expense management priority. Four signature productivity programs have helped us deliver nine straight quarters of largely stable expenses. This has meaningfully contributed to our ability to deliver positive operating leverage of 370 basis points for the full year of 2025.

Our expense initiatives continue to generate sustainable productivity in our operations and will remain foundational disciplines going forward. In 2026, we will make strategic investments necessary to drive our growth, particularly in technology, sales, and marketing. As such, we expect revenue growth to be a stronger driver of continued positive operating leverage for the year. Slide six highlights our strong fee growth and improving mix. For the full year, fee income represented 42% of total net revenues for the company and grew 6.7% year over year. A highly diversified mix of fee revenue business is a core differentiator for our franchise.

Our organic growth strategy has focused on the principle of interconnected product solutions that have created unique value propositions and deeper relationships with our 15 million clients. In '26, we will remain highly focused on executing the initiatives that we launched in 2025. In addition, we are excited to close on our acquisition of BTIG and capture the considerable revenue synergies offered by that combination. On Slide seven, we recap the strategic rationale for this bolt-on acquisition. We've had a ten-year partnership with BTIG and have completed 350 deals or more together in that time frame.

Last week, after we announced, I heard from many of our clients who applauded this next step in our partnership, which gives us confidence around the cultural fit between our two organizations and our ability to build an extraordinary capital markets franchise that can support an even broader array of client needs. We look forward to updating you on our progress there at a future analyst conference. Let me turn to Slide eight. We briefly spotlight our global fund services business, which generated strong fee revenue growth for the company this year. GFS is a highly capital-efficient business that serves our institutional clients, in particular private capital, and asset managers across the U.S. and Europe.

The products offered by GFS attract high-quality operational deposits, money market assets under management, and capital markets business such as foreign exchange. BTIG capabilities will further support growth in this business. As you can see from the chart on the left, GFS total net revenue has grown at a healthy 11% CAGR since 2021 and grew at 12% in 2025. We have some unique product capabilities for start-up and first-time ETFs and have onboarded nearly half of all new U.S. ETF launches in 2025. The underlying drivers of performance within this business are continuing to gain momentum as ETFs stay in favor with investors for their cost efficiency and recent favorable regulatory changes.

And we continue to innovate in areas like digital assets and derivative-based ETF products. Moving to Slide nine. Our payments transformation is a strategic and long-term priority for the company. Today, a payments product is oftentimes the first and the most frequent engagement with clients, especially with Gen Z. Embedded interconnected payments capabilities are fundamental to retaining, deepening, and growing our future client franchise. The chart on the left shows the steady strengthening of growth rates for our payments businesses as we execute our transformation. With our payments leadership team now fully in place, we have hit our stride on execution.

In '26, we expect to maintain momentum on our transformation and add additional focus on the small business segment for both card and merchant. Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income and margin are both improving. We delivered record consumer deposits this quarter. The effectiveness of products like BankSmartly, more sophisticated pricing capabilities, and a significant overhaul of skills, training, digital tools, and incentives together with investments in our branches, drove our performance. Additionally, commercial real estate loans also showed modest growth after eleven quarters of decline. Today, our balance sheet is poised for continued NII growth. On the loan side, we will drive commercial and credit card loans to deepen client relationships.

On the deposit side, we'll drive consumer and operational deposits to improve our funding mix. Turning to Slide 11. Operating within our medium-term target ranges has resulted in leading EPS growth as adjusted in 2025, even with more modest buybacks as compared with the industry. Let me now turn the call over to John, who will take you through more details of the quarter.

John Stern: Thank you, Gunjan, and good morning, everyone. This was another strong quarter for us, driven by continued new business momentum and an improving macroeconomic environment. If I could turn your attention to Slide 12, I'll start with some highlights for the quarter followed by a discussion of fourth-quarter earnings trends. As Gunjan mentioned, we reported earnings per common share of $1.26 and achieved record net revenue of $7.4 billion this quarter. Revenue growth benefited from improved spread income, and all fee categories performed well. Key credit quality metrics improved both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. As of December 31, our tangible book value per common share increased 18.2% on a year-over-year basis. Slide 13 provides our key performance metrics.

This quarter, we delivered a return on tangible common equity of 18.4%, a return on average assets of 1.19%, and an efficiency ratio of 57.4%. All improvements on a year-over-year basis. Slide 14 provides a balance sheet summary. Total average deposits increased 0.7% linked quarter to $515 billion as we continue to emphasize growth in our consumer and relationship-based deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased both sequentially and year over year, as we gained traction across several institutional fee businesses, like treasury management and Global Corporate Trust. Our percentage of noninterest-bearing to total average deposits remained stable at approximately 16%.

Average loans totaled $384 billion, up 1.4% from the prior quarter, on accelerating year-over-year growth in our focus areas of commercial and credit card loans, which grew 10% and 15.7%, respectively. On an ending basis, these loans now represent approximately 48% of total loans for the bank, compared to approximately 45% last year. The ending balance on our investment portfolio as of December 31 remained at $171 billion. Turning to Slide 15. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of 1.4% on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by favorable deposit mix shift.

Net interest margin increased two basis points sequentially to 2.77% as we look to achieve greater margin expansion in the medium term. Slide 16 highlights fee revenue trends within noninterest income. Total fee income was approximately $3.05 billion, an increase of 7.6% on a year-over-year basis with broad-based growth across our payments, institutional, and consumer fee businesses. For the full year, fee income increased 6.7% compared to the prior year. In 2025, we benefited from high single-digit growth in our institutional fee businesses, continued strength within Impact Finance, and stronger payments revenue. Turning to Slide 17. Noninterest expense totaled approximately $4.2 billion, up 0.7% linked quarter as FDIC expense favorability was partially offset by severance charges.

Slide 18 highlights improved asset quality trends. This quarter, our ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.41% at December 31, an improvement of two basis points linked quarter and seven basis points year over year. The net charge-off ratio improved to 0.54%, a two basis point decrease sequentially, while our allowance for credit losses of $7.9 billion represented 2.03% of period-end loans. Turning to Slide 19. As of December 31, our common equity Tier one capital ratio was 10.8%, or 9.3%, including AOCI. On Slide 20, we provide a comparison of our fourth quarter and full-year results to our previous guidance.

For the fourth quarter, net interest income, fee revenue, and noninterest expense all exceeded our previous guidance. Taken together, this resulted in another quarter of meaningful positive operating leverage for the company. For the full year, revenue growth of 4% hit the midpoint of our full-year guidance expectations, while positive operating leverage meaningfully outperformed our full-year 2025 outlook. Moving to Slide 21, I'll now provide full-year and first-quarter 2026 forward-looking guidance. Starting with the full year of 2026, we expect total net revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% compared to the prior year. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 200 basis points or more for the full year.

Our guidance excludes the impact of the BTIG acquisition, which is expected to contribute $175 million to $200 million of fee revenue per quarter. I have provided some additional details on page 30 of the appendix. Let me now provide first-quarter 2026 guidance. Net interest growth on a fully taxable equivalent basis is expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% compared to 2025. Total fee revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 6% compared to 2025. And we expect total noninterest expense growth of approximately 1% compared to 2025. Turning to Slide 22. We continue to operate within our medium-term target ranges.

Our consistent execution against these ranges will remain a key focus entering 2026, and we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to strengthen our performance and build on these results over time. Let me now hand it back to Gunjan for closing remarks.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you, John. We are wrapping up 2025 with a significant leadership transition behind us and strong momentum going into 2026. The banking industry will likely see meaningful shifts in capital supervision, digital assets, AI, and novel banks in the coming years. Our scale, business mix, and culture position us for success. We remain focused on executing our priorities to drive organic growth, high returns, productivity, and strong risk management. Finally, I would like to offer a special thanks to many of you for your well wishes for Minneapolis, where we are headquartered. With all the challenges this community is facing, we remain focused on our clients and our teams.

With that, we will now open the call for your questions.

Operator: At this time, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star and the number one on your telephone keypad. And our first question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Scott Siefers: Let's see. John, let's thought I'd start with you. Can you please speak to how you might think about the pace of share repurchase as this year plays out given you're increasing the capital ratio toward the 10% CAT two target? You'd, of course, dipped your toe back in at the end of last year, but would love to hear your thoughts on the go forward.

John Stern: Sure, Scott, and good morning. In terms of share repurchases, we've made a tremendous amount of progress in our capital build over the last several years, and we obviously have business momentum behind us. And of course, our first priority is going to be client and loan growth as we move forward with obviously then a focus on capital return to our shareholders. But knowing all that, our intention is to grow our share repurchase amount starting this quarter in a gradual way. Likely go from $100 million or so to $200 million and then the commitment to glide into our 75% payout target that we have over time.

Scott Siefers: Terrific. Okay. Good. Thank you. And then just sort of a broader question. Given all the noise regarding whether it's credit card rate caps and then, you know, newer chatter regarding the Credit Card Competition Act. Could you speak to how you all are thinking about how, I guess, how USD is thinking about these possible responses in you know, how are these granted they're all sort of in flight, but, you know, what are you all thinking about at this point?

Gunjan Kedia: Scott, good morning. You know, our estimate is that 90 plus percent of our clients will see a detrimental impact if there was an across-the-board 10% rate cap on credit cards. The impact to 50% of the clients will be crushed as it will be for the economy. We have observed that just in the last few days, the conversation around the rate cap has shifted more productively to options for customers to help them in the short term. So just as a reminder, our shield credit card offers twenty-four months of 0% APR for consumers. And in fact, most card issuers have some product of that sort.

So we think that's a productive conversation and we are thinking of ways to increase communications, financial education to try and make sure people know what options they have. But that's sort of the momentum. The CCCA, as you asked, has come and gone many times. There are very credible reasons why that would be very costly for many small merchants and not achieve the goal intended. So at this point, we continue to it, but it is not a meaningful planning that we are focused on.

Scott Siefers: Gotcha. Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much for the color.

Operator: Our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

John Pancari: Morning. I just wanna ask a bit around the revenue growth expectation of 4% to 6% for 2026. I appreciate the color you gave around the first quarter. In terms of the spread income versus the fee growth expectation. Could you possibly help us and kind of how that think about how that could play out for the full year in terms of some of the, you know, the balance sheet dynamics in terms of the growth expectations and your margin outlook. Then the same thing on the fee side, how should we think about the breakout of that total revenue when you look at '26?

John Stern: Sure. It's John. Thanks, John. So the way we think about the revenue growth this year, obviously, we gave you the 4% to 6% on that side of the thing. But given the momentum that we have and what we see today, we think that mid-single-digit growth is appropriate for both net interest income and fee revenue growth. So maybe just to break it out a little bit. So on net interest income, as an example, we expect that to strengthen over time. We have 3% to 4% here in the first quarter. But with the increase in loan pipelines that we see as well as NIM expansion as that continues, we do expect that to grow.

And then fees, we expect that to have a more consistent approach and performance as we look through the course of the year. Of course, that's gonna be led by many of our key businesses like trust capital markets, impact finance, and payments. So overall, we see a lot of momentum in the businesses. We've had several good quarters here in a row, our job is now to continue to execute on the strategy.

John Pancari: Got it. Alright. Thanks for that, John. And then, Gunjan, you mentioned that revenue rather than expenses may be a bigger driver of the expected positive operating leverage in 2026. If revenue doesn't cooperate, can you discuss the flexibility that you still may have to achieve the 200 basis points plus and positive operating leverage? Like, what are your levers and do you have flexibility around the strategic investments that you that you emphasized?

Gunjan Kedia: John, good morning. The short answer is yes. Our productivity and expense management is being created in a very fundamental way. You'll remember that for six years, we have been investing very heavily in digital capabilities. Nearly all back-end platforms have been upgraded, and that creates a lot of productivity once you start getting the operations aligned. You add to it the AI boost we are seeing in big expense pools. So we are very confident about expense management. We have aggressive plans to invest back in the business, just to drive the revenue growth, especially fee revenue growth in businesses like capital markets and payments that attract more expenses. But we have a lot of ability to flex that.

Those are not long-term investments. Things like sales and marketing are quarterly investments. So we are very committed to our meaningful positive operating leverage, and we expect it to come from revenue. But something happens in the macroeconomic environment, we have levers on expenses.

John Pancari: Great. Thank you.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you. Thanks, John.

Operator: Next question comes from John McDonald from Truist.

John McDonald: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, John, if you could expand a little bit about your outlook for balance sheet growth in 2026 and any mix shifts or trade-offs that you want to highlight between loans within loans and also loans earning assets. You had given a forecast last year, early last year about balance sheet growth by the end of the year and it had some mix shift. So I just wanna get an update on that.

John Stern: Sure. Good morning, John. Yeah. So largely, I think you're talking about the slide that we had in the first quarter of last year, talking about our asset growth and things like that. I think that still holds. We still feel like that's that range is the appropriate range for our balance sheet. Maybe just to go into some of the pieces, you know, we do expect loan growth to be stronger this year. Probably more in the 3% to 4% loan growth area led by commercial and card again. But, you know, we also see that commercial real estate is starting to grow, and we expect that to be a help in terms of growth there.

We do expect that deposits will continue to grow consummate with loans. That should be kind of one for one in the way we're looking at it. And in terms of other assets, I expect the investment portfolio to kind of flex based on if loan growth is faster, we'll probably have fewer investment portfolio and other earning assets. And if it's less, then perhaps we kind of keep the balances the same. So those are going to be kind of as we go manage through the quarter, we'll go and see how that progresses.

But all this is to say that the mix is improving in the balance sheet, and that's going to continue throughout 2026, and that's what gives us confidence in the NIM expansion as well.

John McDonald: Great. And maybe just on that note, you could give us your updated thoughts on the timeline for the NIM expansion, you know, to get to 3% over the next year or two. And in addition to that loan mix shift, what are just an update on some of the fixed asset reprice drivers. Thank you.

John Stern: Sure. Yeah. So, I think, first of all, there's no change to our outlook. We still feel there's definitely a path to 3% in 2027. The drivers of net interest margin are going to be the mix that I just mentioned as well as the fixed asset repricing. What I would say there on the fixed asset repricing is that we'll have slightly or we'll have more balances that should reprice this year than last year. But it'll be likely at a lower spread just because the nature of long-term rates have come down over the course of the year, and based on our forecast. So those are kind of the pieces.

And then the deposit mix is gonna continue to improve with the focus on consumer deposit growth, which we've been very successful at growing this year, as well as commercial deposits that are tied to strong fee categories like treasury management, institutional businesses, and things like that. So that's all, again, a big focus for us as we look into 2026 and continued NIM expansion.

John McDonald: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ebrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess good morning. Maybe, John, just hey, John. Following up on the slide 10 on the deposit growth, just spend some time talking about drivers of deposit growth. You're having the mix towards consumer deposits. What's driving that net? Is that accretive as we think should we continue to think about that mix shifting to the consumer side? And how accretive is that when we think about either deposit margin or the overall margin? Thanks.

John Stern: Sure. So, you know, on the deposit, a couple of things are going on in the deposit growth. This over the course of the year, we saw steady growth in the consumer deposits. And as that Slide 10 illustrates, we continue to believe that is accretive and it is helpful to bring in new accounts and clients to the bank typically that are younger, more affluent base that we have, and this is particularly in our BankSmartly product, which is a savings and a card tied together. We've seen very good success in growing that savings product over the course of the year. We find these clients to be stickier, and that's going to be overall long periods of time.

That's gonna be very helpful from our funding cost perspective. The other thing we're focused on the commercial side is a reduction in CDs. We reduced our CD count by $6 billion this quarter. We are at the lowest point in CD usage in the last ten quarters. So that has been that will be helpful going forward to our mix. In our wholesale and institutional balances are gonna be really driven by our core institutional and, like, fund services, corporate trust, treasury management, and other middle market and other type of accounts that's gonna give us. So the mix is gonna be very important for us as we move forward.

Gunjan Kedia: And, Ebrahim, I can just add that we are very intentional about using the balance sheet to drive deeper relationships and fee-based businesses. An expansion in the core client franchise brings a lot of payments and card revenue and merchant revenue at the back end of it. So it's very accretive in the long run and very strategic for us as well. So the focus is very much on consumer deposits and operational wholesale deposits, which come with expansion of treasury management, investment services, and some of the fee-based products. That's one of the reasons we wanted to highlight the global fund services business.

While it's, you know, billion-dollar-like business for us, so not huge enough with it's a very important source of operational deposits.

Ebrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And just a separate question, I guess, I think last quarter you all established a digital assets organization. Just talk to us. You put out a few press releases. A lot of energy around tokenization. Is there a role for USB to play there? And is that a needle mover as we think about either fees or deposit growth outlook for the bank?

Gunjan Kedia: Yes. Thank you. So let me just describe the world here a little bit from our perspective. We are obviously taking it seriously as an industry shock. That's why we stood up an organization called Digital Assets and Money Movement, and it's led by a very seasoned payments executive for us. We have seen progress in two very distinct areas. The first is on capital markets where the investment side around cryptocurrency stablecoins is leading to demand for core custody type of capabilities. We have almost $12 trillion in assets there. We were very quick to stand up a cryptocurrency custody offer. Last year, we stood up a stablecoin custody offer.

Ibrahim, I'll tell you, last year has been a very brisk place of new ETF launches, and a large majority of them have been to take advantage of the digital assets. And we are seeing the revenue model come through in a very real way. And we think that's real and there's momentum. On the bigger conversation of payments, it's more speculative. So we do press releases because there's a lot of interest every time we actually conduct a stable coin transaction with some partner platforms. We have done many of those. I can't point to a specific revenue-generating use case.

The demand specifically from the client base is not very strong or real yet, the revenue model is still to be figured out. There's enough momentum there, both from a supervisory and commercial side that we expect to be very front-footed as this world evolves around payments.

Ebrahim Poonawala: That's good color. Thank you.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Mike Mayo: Hi. Well, you announced the acquisition of BTIG. And I think there's a little confusion. Is that the reason why you're slowing down buybacks? And just more generally, there's a few covered U.S. Bancorp for a while, and this is over two decades after you spun off Piper, and now you're you know, going back into the capital markets business a little bit more than you're already there. So if you can also just talk about the investments that you'll be making with BTIG, the business lines, what else that requires. I imagine this is kind of like a link and leverage deal where you buy a firm and you leverage it over your entire franchise, but I'm not sure.

On the other side, this, you know, what do you expect in terms of cap to market fees? Other opportunities for balance sheet growth? Thank you.

John Stern: Sure, Mike. I'll start on your share repurchase comment, then maybe I'll Gunjan will comment on the other side of questions that you had. There's no impact to our buyback. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we'll be increasing our share repurchases from $100 million to $200 million this quarter. And then, thereafter, we'll glide into our eventual target of 75% that we've talked about. And so, this transaction is a 12 basis point impact on the CET one ratio. No more, no less. That's, that will be the impact no matter what the earnout or anything else. So, we feel really good about the financials, and it's not material to EPS.

This year, simply because there will be some merger-related costs that will offset any revenues for this or margin. So as we look to the following year, that will shift.

Gunjan Kedia: Mike, good morning. I'll just step back and maybe recap the strategic rationale. You know, our clients use both bank balance sheets and capital markets to manage their own balance sheets. We have had a lot of success with the fixed income side of our capital markets business that has grown organically over the last fourteen years or so, and it's now grown to about $1.4 billion in revenues for us. It's a sizable business. The last gap in our product lineup was the BTIG set of products. We've had a partnership with them for ten years. And it is true twenty years back Piper Jaffray was acquired.

And just as a reminder, we retained all of the wealth and asset management sites of Piper Jaffray, and those have become sizable businesses for us today with a lot of cultural fit. The capital markets wasn't appropriate for us at the time. It is very much more culturally aligned with what we do plus we know the property. On your balance sheet question, I think the issue is you're already deploying a very sizable balance sheet today against our commercial and corporate clients. And a broader lineup of fees leverages that balance sheet more. We do not expect the BTIG business in itself to be a big driver of additional sort of balance sheet usage.

But otherwise, lots of revenue synergies across our IS business, across our family office business. And we'll report on that more to you once the deal closes. And we give better guidance on what the economics of that deal will be like.

Mike Mayo: Alright. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Erika Najarian: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. First question, period end assets ended at $692 billion for the year. And I guess this is a two-part question. First is, as you understand it, you know, how do the tailoring for proposals or the removal of tailoring proposals in you know, Washington, how would that positively impact that $700 billion crossing? And additionally, you know, as we think about John, that path to 3%, does that consider the currently more stringent liquidity requirements that you would need to adhere to if nothing changed on tailoring?

John Stern: Sure, Erica. Thanks for the question. So on the asset side, yes, we're continuing to grow. Obviously, as you know, it's a four-quarter average of assets that is the deciding factor in how when you trip into category two. You know, we're running our business without any regard to that level. We are growing our loans consummate with the industry. We wanna make sure we're there for our clients. Any rule that happens or change to the tailoring rules over this process will take in stride. We understand there's obviously been chatter about that. As folks on, in the regulatory spheres have talked about those perhaps being reindexed, but we don't know that for sure.

So in the meantime, we're gonna continue to do what we need to do on the growth and supporting our clients through that. And then, in terms of the consideration that you had, I'm just trying to remember your second question. It was on the LCR that you LCR. I'm sorry. Yeah. Thank you. On the LCR, there is no impact to that. We have that fully loaded into our calculus here as we think about the NIM. So, as we jump from a more modified LCR to a full LCR, there's no impact, and that's all incorporated into our guidance.

Erika Najarian: That was very helpful. Thank you. And just as a follow-up question, Gunjan, during prepared remarks, you talked about, you know, faster evolution of the banking industry and also in your, you know, responses to the other analyst questions, it seems like, you know, you have a very nimble organization in terms of how you're responding to these changes.

And, you know, as we think about the investments that you have to make you know, in terms of moving the continuing to move the company forward, you know, is there just enough productivity savings that you can identify where you can continue to invest for the future, whether it's nearer term like capital markets or medium term like you know, the digital asset transformation, you know, and still deliver on that positive operating leverage, you know, of 200 plus that it has been clear message to your investor base.

Gunjan Kedia: Thank you, Erica. Good morning. It's a very thoughtful question. And let me start really by the new investments in AI and stablecoin. They are actually very capitalized. There is so much support that is being provided to us from a whole suite of sort of partners who really like our business mix, our payments, and capital markets. You know, we are unusual in having sizable capabilities on both of those. And we've organized that data. As you know, we are on the cusp of category two transition, and that has given us a lot of imperative over the last two or three years to have better data. Collectively, we are a very important partner.

So we are getting a lot of support when we do these pilots on stablecoins. They're not huge investments yet. However, we stand ready to invest as needed when the market flexes. You have to learn. You have to have your products set ready. So I would say to you that for some time, at least, you're getting a lot of benefit of industry-wide investments to just scale up our product capability. The real investments we are making is to support our fee business growth. We are doing bigger deals, they come with more upfront cost. The payments transformation, if you think about the revenue model of payments, we are looking at acquired, but not installed business.

We are looking at sales pipelines, and the revenue model follows twelve to eighteen months after you sold the business. So we are very prepared for that kind of expense inflection. But also creating productivity. So I feel very comfortable with both investing heavily for organic growth and delivering a positive operating leverage. And again, I always want to remind when you spend 5 or 6 billion upgrading your digital investments, which we did over the last six years. You have a long runway to drive productivity out of them. Which we will.

Erika Najarian: Got it. Thank you for that.

Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ken Usdin: Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up on that last point. So as you've made these all these investments, it's nice to see a little bit of improvement year over year in payments business fees in aggregate. I was just wondering just what's the pace of improvement that we could expect as you think about next year and to John's prior point about mid-single-digit growth on the fee side overall? How much does payments play a part of that? If you can kind of just talk through each of the each of the three businesses areas there. Thanks.

John Stern: Sure. Thanks. Appreciate the question. You know, absolutely, payments has a role in our mid-single-digit call for fees overall. But take it piece by piece, you know, card, we have a lot of progress with the Smart Leap program and other cards that we've introduced into the market. There's a tremendous focus on small business that we are very much focused on internally. So we have a lot of momentum there. We do expect mid-single-digit growth in this business for the year of 2026.

On the merchant side, as we talked about on our strategy, at a recent investor conference, we talked about, you know, increasing our margins through more distribution, and direct model, really being thoughtful about what verticals that we want to be a part of. And really focusing on that embedded software, and having that be a key component of our growth. And so, again, here, we think that mid-single-digit growth for the year is appropriate for this business as well. And then on the corporate payment side, clearly, you know, we saw improvement this year on a year-over-year basis, but it's still negative growth.

Just given the spend levels on the government side as well as just some caution just on the corporate T and E side of the equation. That will likely continue into the first half of the year, but should overall strengthen as we get through that. And that will, by the time we exit that, that will be more in the mid-single-digit range. So overall, single-digit for this business is what we should expect, and we're looking forward to executing our strategy.

Ken Usdin: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks, John. And just one follow-up on the credit card side on and charge-offs. That loss line has really settled down a little bit. Are we at kind of a new I know there's some seasonality, but, like, what's your expectations for card losses? You know, versus where we kinda ended the year and averaged for 25?

John Stern: Yeah. Thank you. So, you know, card, if I think about there's seasonality, so you should expect a little bit higher charge-off rate on card in the first half of the year just given that seasonality. But overall, if I just kind of look big picture on card 25 versus 26, we expect stability in that charge-off rate based on what we know today.

Ken Usdin: Okay. Got it. Alright. Thanks, John.

Operator: Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Gerard Cassidy: Good morning, Gunjan. Good morning, John.

John Stern: Good morning.

Gerard Cassidy: John, you talked about the commercial loan growth, and you talked a bit about commercial real estate. I think you said maybe the first time in the November, it may have seen a little bit of growth. Can you expand upon that for 2026 along with the commercial loan growth? Are the 10% year over year is quite nice. And can that continue, do you think, in 2026?

John Stern: Thanks, Gerard. Short answer is yes. On the continuation on the commercial side of the equation. But let me start with the commercial real estate side. Since you talked about that, I'll mention that we do expect growth in the real estate line. As you said, the first growth that we've had in eleven quarters in that line item, which is great to see. I think what we're seeing here is the continuation of the pipeline building, particularly as it relates to multifamily and industrial. I think those have been strong areas of growth. And I would also say that paydowns have actually slowed down as well.

Our office numbers, our CRE office has dropped $3 billion over the last three years and at a pretty rapid pace. And so that has started to slow down. So that has been helpful. I'll also say that this growth is not driven by data centers and things like that. We have less than a billion dollars of data centers in our portfolio, and we do select high quality in that sense. So that's kind of the story on real estate. On the C&I side, we're just seeing growth in a number of different areas. I'd just say it's very broad-based.

Even though utilization has been pretty flat, we've seen growth in subscription lines, supply chain, some of the M&A activity is picking up with our clients. And so there's just core growth on that side of the equation. We've also been going into business banking and SBA, seeing very strong growth as well as our expansion markets and middle markets. So a combination of all these things, we think, persists into 2026, and so we're looking forward to that growth.

Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And Gunjan, one of your peers in asking this question called me a curmudgeon. So I'll try to ask the question a little less negative. But the setup for you folks and your peers is really good this year. Investors see that. But being bank people that we are, we're always looking over our shoulders. Aside from the obvious geopolitical risks, do you guys keep your eye on just, you know, in case of a surprise comes up that we're not expecting right now?

Gunjan Kedia: Well, thank you, Gerard. I will not call you a curmudgeon. We worry about what's coming around the corner as much as you do. You know, the economic backdrop going into 2026 is broadly constructive. The consumer did very well through the holiday cycle, and that was all ranges of FICO scores and across discretionary and spending. As John just described, the delinquencies are coming down. While the employment picture is a little bit muddy, it's still strong, and we are not yet seeing the impact of the one big beautiful bill and some of the new tax provisions like tips and overtime, etcetera, will come into the consumer's balance sheet. So we expect that to be good.

The sentiment on the corporate side too has moved to sort of more M&A and real CapEx rather than just sort of a pause and replacement CapEx waiting for tariff uncertainty. I would say the economic backdrop feels like tailwinds rather than headwinds going into the year. So our attention really is on unexpected policy changes. In front of us is a very big capital bill. In front of us are some real discussions around stablecoin bank industry, novel charters. And so I would say our attention is really focused on the policy side with some relief on the economic front.

Gerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Betsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.

Gunjan Kedia: Good morning.

Betsy Graseck: I had one question on BTIG. I know we talked about it earlier in the call. But I wanted to get an understanding of how much of a capital call do you think this piece of the business will be? And just from my vantage point, it feels like it's a little bit less than what the fixed income would be, which you already have. But I'm not sure how much you're looking to lean in and grow, what they have and increase the balance sheet items associated with the equity book. So some color there would be helpful. Thank you.

John Stern: Sure, Betsy. So maybe just as a starting point for BTIG, they have a very low balance sheet. There's not a lot of loans and balance sheet with that. I think that potentially could be one of the synergies that's not built into our current forecast. We think the synergies are really gonna be around areas like our fund services, our capital markets as well as our ICG or our institutional client group. There could be loans associated with that. But, you know, we'll treat that in the context of the entire capital market suite.

And so this will be just another component of how we manage and have grown in the capital markets space methodically over the last fifteen years. This is another component of that journey, and so we'll grow as the market allows, and we'll be taking it into consideration with our risk management framework.

Betsy Graseck: Okay. And is it a self-funded capital call or does it pull from other parts of the organization?

John Stern: Yeah. It's self-funded. I mean, we are there's no other parts of the organization. It's all contained here at the bank.

Betsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Saul Martinez from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Saul Martinez: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'll ask also on this is more of a clarification. John. It's expected to close in the second quarter. You mentioned there are some merger costs embedded in the guidance. For it being PPNR neutral. But with that, I guess, can we surmise that it will be PPNR accretive by year-end and into early 2027, especially considering, you know, some of the synergies that you just mentioned in your response to Betsy's question.

John Stern: Yeah. Thanks, Saul. The answer is yes. We expect merger-related costs to happen in the next quarter or two. And so as that occurs, that will keep the EPS neutral. And so, after that, then we expect to have some, obviously, we'll see margin expansion in this business once we get through those costs.

Saul Martinez: Okay. That's helpful. And then, you know, I hate maybe beating a dead horse here would be the question on BTIG, and you kind of addressed this. But it does really change the composition of your capital markets business adding equities and I think, you know, one of your competitors said that this really isn't a business that makes a lot of sense. For a large regional bank. It's what we've given that, at least in their view, it really does require massive scale and there's more suitable for, you know, for a larger bank. Guess, what makes you think that these businesses, especially equity makes sense for U.S.

Bancorp and that you why are you confident that you'll be successful in extracting value with that business under your umbrella?

John Stern: Yeah. I thanks for the question. You know, I think I'll and Gunjan, you can add on here. But, you know, our view is that these businesses, we added because we had an opportunity here with a partner that we know, a known that fits into our risk management. But, also importantly, it's what our clients have been asking for. We have had very good reach out from clients across the board that have wanted to have us participate more in their financings, have us participate more in their broader activities, but have not been able to give that to us freely, in terms of the full spread and wallet share that they would have liked or intended to do.

So this is something that's really gonna, it's something that our clients have asked for. It fits well within our risk management profile as that has been built up internally here over the last several years. And so it is a great fit for us.

Gunjan Kedia: You know what I'll add, Saul, that you have to look at our track record in growing the fixed income book, which not all regionals have been able to do. So everybody has a different strategy here. Our confidence in leaning in heavily into the capital markets comes not just from the client conversations. From the real success we have seen just holding our own. The market is not uniform. There's a lot of need for family offices, for middle market clients that are unique, that require high touch, and so we think at our size, we definitely have the ability to carve out a very nice business given the size of our balance sheet here.

Saul Martinez: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Steven Chubak: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to start off with one on Global Fund Services, and I appreciate the additional disclosure that you provided in the slides. You noted you're seeing strong growth in GFS. You outlined the strength of the ETF servicing capabilities. I was hoping you could speak to the competitive landscape in that area. How much of the growth that you've seen since '21 is tied to organic efforts versus some of the rate and market tailwinds that transpired and just how that informs what you believe is the sustainable growth rate or outlook over the medium term relative to the mid-single-digit guidance that you offer at the firm level?

Gunjan Kedia: Steven, thank you for that. Let me start. GFS has a very niche specific set of products for highly complex small boutique type of firms around private capital, private credit. So you have to play the game right. We have done this for now many, many years, and there's a very sustainable competitive path for this business going forward. We do like to highlight smaller businesses don't get airtime. Just to teach you last quarter, we just gave you some visibility to our impact finance business. So we see this being a real engine of growth as the whole world of investments overall growth. Obviously, when you have good strong equity markets, do slightly better.

In other times, you do slightly worse. But the core organic growth and market share gains here are very real.

Steven Chubak: That's great. And for my follow-up, on deposit mix, looking at noninterest-bearing deposits, you saw solid growth 4%, sequential increase on average. Recognizing some of that is gonna be seasonal. But do you feel we've reached a sustained inflection in noninterest-bearing deposits? And within the NII guidance for the full year, what are you assuming for deposit remixing and shrinkage in time deposits? As well as betas with some of the upcoming rate cuts.

John Stern: Sure. Thanks. Appreciate that. In terms of noninterest-bearing, and yes, we have grown both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. That year-over-year basis has not been achieved in quite some time. So it was very nice to see that. And we do expect that to continue into 2026. So in our call here for growth, on both loan and deposit, I would anticipate it's both a mix of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits with roughly the mix probably being in the same area that it is today is kinda how we think about it.

You know, in terms of deposit mix and rates and things like that, I'm just gonna kinda go back to, you know, we're focused very much on growing our consumer business as well as these key areas that are gonna help us grow in our fee revenues, the treasury management areas, the institutional businesses, and several and select corporate clients. So that's gonna be our focus as we think about deposits this upcoming year.

Steven Chubak: That's great color. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you could give a quick update on your branch strategy. Your branch count, I think, is down about four or 5% versus a year ago. I think you've talked about kind of not being that interested in bank deals. So kind of bringing that all together and in lieu of some other banks maybe announcing branch expansion strategies. You know, just talk about the branch strategy and, you know, again, if there's any change on the M&A, I think. Thanks.

Gunjan Kedia: Matt, thank you. Let me begin. So just for historical context, U.S. Bank had a very, very heavy presence in-store branches. And before our digital tools, that's what provided servicing access to people over the weekends and after hours. You don't need that anymore. So the vast majority of our branch closures is really these small servicing units. What we are building instead is multi-client hubs that have many products represented in more hub-like branches. We invest about $200 million in our branches. We find that to be a very effective channel, continuing to be a very effective channel.

So our strategy, though, is to try and get to top five market share in the places that we are in and create sort of modern interconnected branches in those areas. So for example, in Denver, we've just finished the renovation of all our branches into the new format. We are continuing to lean in on branches as a source of growth and client service. It's just our starting point was slightly different. So we have to close all these sort of in-store branches and then rebuild from that point onwards. And on your second question, there's no change in our strategy. We are very focused on our organic growth opportunities and seeing a lot of momentum there.

Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's all helpful. And then so if we strip out the in-store branches. Any numbers on kind of the remaining branch network, and then from your perspective, like, how much more refurbishing or retrofitting is there still to do for the traditional branches? Thanks.

John Stern: Sure. So on how much to do, you know, the $200 million is going to be kind of a consistent always-on approach to remodeling, to adding and branches and things of that variety. So we've had several hundred branches remodeled this year. We expect to have that occur next year as well, and that'll be just a continuation of our strategy that Gunjan just laid out.

Gunjan Kedia: Matt, it's very much always on, you know, because you refresh these formats over and over again. So it's not sort of one and done. But the message here really is we are investing very much in our branch. It's an important channel for us.

Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Our last question will come from Chris McGratty from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris McGratty from KBW. Your line is open.

Chris McGratty: Oh, sorry about that. Was on mute. John, when you look at your top five goal for market share, and across your footprint, the metro market, where would you not be where you need to be? Where do you need to invest a little bit more to get the market share?

John Stern: You know, in terms of are you speaking more on the consumer side or on the commercial side?

Chris McGratty: Consumer side?

John Stern: Sure. So, you know, like Gunjan just laid out, the Denver area, we've certainly been making investments here in our hub here in headquarters here in Minneapolis, Nashville, Arizona, areas, of course, in California, given the Union acquisition where we've combined, where locations were very close to each other and obviously, took the premier spot or refurbished those areas. So, what we're doing is really we're refurbishing and we're building branches in areas where there's high growth in those MSA areas. So not every area is, of course, the same, so you have to go kinda market by market. But that's been the course of our strategy over the last couple of years.

Chris McGratty: Great. And my follow-up would be on just consumer checking account growth. It's gotten a lot of attention this quarter. You guys had good consumer deposit growth in the quarter. Can you share any statistics about the checking account growth over the past, you know, year or two that would give you optimism? It's gonna be this could continue?

John Stern: Thank you. Yeah. So I think the important thing is really, I mean, accounts are good, of course, and we watch that. But it's really about the balances is what we're really focused on. And so our consumer amounts were up two and a half percent, or $7 billion or so this past year. Not many peers grew consumer deposits this year. It's a very competitive market. And I think what's important for us is we've developed a very nice set of products that can meet a number of different clients. And we have pricing capability tools that we've been building over the last several years that have helped us in this regard as well.

So the combination of all that is really, I think, is what is giving us strength in that consumer number. As well as our capability digitally to compete anywhere across the country. So it doesn't have to be just our footprint. That is necessarily the case. So all those are leading factors to where why we think that consumer growth will continue.

Gunjan Kedia: I'll just add that the branch performance has inflected very nicely too with all of the investments that we have made, all the tools that we've put in the hands, all the AI-powered next best solutions, you know, collectively that has created a fair amount of momentum, and we've been building towards those capabilities all of 2025. And beginning to show up in our results here.

Chris McGratty: Great. Thank you so much.

Whether driven by growth, aging facilities, or new research directions, redesigning or moving a laboratory can feel overwhelming, especially for managers tackling their first major project. The challenge is not just about fitting equipment into a new footprint. It’s about balancing staff workflows, safety requirements, budget realities, and future flexibility, often under tight timelines.

By understanding why space planning matters, defining clear decision criteria early, and learning from lessons others have already experienced, lab managers can approach planning with greater confidence and fewer surprises.

Understanding the “why” behind laboratory space planning

Space planning directly affects safety, productivity, and long-term adaptability. Hastily planned labs may technically function on day one, but they often carry hidden costs, like inefficient workflows, operational workarounds, compliance challenges, and staff frustration that builds over time.

Organizations increasingly prioritize flexible layouts, shared equipment zones, and smarter use of utilities to support changing research demands and sustainability goals. Instead of placing equipment simply where it fits, lab users should consider how the space supports science and workflow.

Many labs operate in spaces that have barely changed in decades, says Chris Orlando, BSN, RN, president of VOC Associates, a Cleveland-based laboratory equipment planning firm. “They've been following the same process, same protocol, with just minor modifications as equipment has come online. They've kind of rigged it up so it works, but they're so used to that that we've heard quite often, ‘Well, that's just not going to work.’”

Through careful discussions and visits to comparable sites, Orlando notes, the tone often shifts to “I guess that could work.” He explains that reluctance to change doesn’t stem from pure doubt, but from a need for more information and exposure to new ideas.

Key lab planning decision criteria for lab managers

While every project is unique, several decision criteria consistently shape successful outcomes.

Start with workflow mapping

Effective lab planning begins with understanding how people, samples, and materials move through the lab. This means involving the people who do the work (not just leadership) in mapping current and future workflows.

Orlando emphasizes that excluding end users often backfires. “The people that actually do the work, as you get deeper into operational planning and get into the meat and potatoes of actually planning the lab move, may say, ‘Wait a second, that's not how we do it. How did this get designed that way?'” Ensuring the right people are involved early allows the lab to be designed correctly from the start, rather than retrofitting or adjusting operational workflows later.

Plan equipment placement in detail

Equipment planning goes beyond large, floor-mounted instruments. Even smaller benchtop equipment consumes space, power, and clearance—and overlooking it adds up quickly.

Danielle Benford, senior vice president at VOC Associates, cautions against relying solely on cut sheets: “Spec sheets, while great, don’t actually account for the real-time use of a piece of equipment.” Handles, hinges, monitoring devices, and seismic bracing can add inches that derail layouts if not planned for early.

Prioritize safety and compliance

Environmental health & safety (EHS) teams, chemical safety professionals, and regulatory stakeholders should be involved from the earliest design phases. For example, flammable cabinets are sometimes positioned based on available space rather than volume calculations and fire barrier requirements—both essential for proper smoke compartmentation. Delaying EHS involvement can lead to costly redesigns and user resistance.

“Make sure you have your EHS folks at the table in schematic design,” says Benford. “I think the biggest issue we see is when those folks aren't involved until later. They have a lot of knowledge that they bring to the table.”

Lab staff moving from grandfathered spaces may also struggle to understand why updated rules now apply. “A lot of these groups have lived in their space for decades, so regulations were very different 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago,” Benford notes. Taking the time to explain the reasoning behind these requirements, rather than simply enforcing them, is essential.

Design for flexibility and growth

Resist the urge to fill every available space, Benford advises. “If at all possible, try not to fill every single inch of space that you have in your design.” Overpacking layouts leaves no room for growth and magnifies the impact of even modest equipment changes.

Projects that rely on “cookie-cutter” bench and shelving layouts frequently result in the removal of costly, unused casework after move-in because equipment lids interfere with shelves or required clearances were overlooked.

Get utilities and infrastructure right early

Power, HVAC, data, and specialized utilities must align with both current and legacy equipment. Orlando notes how often teams discover late in design that facilities lack required power: “‘We did an inventory and we’ve got a bunch of 240V equipment.’ And the first thing the product team says is, ‘We don’t have 240V power.’” These gaps often lead to unplanned costs and operational compromises.

Lessons from the field: what successful projects have in common

Across projects, a few consistent themes emerge.

First, be transparent and involve staff in the process. “Good projects have good communication,” says Orlando. “Things can't be overcommunicated enough, whether it's meeting minutes, whether it's having recurring meetings with the individual laboratories to plan out their moves so that they understand the subtleties.”

Second, be honest about internal capacity. Moving or redesigning a lab is labor-intensive. Organizations that assume they can handle everything internally often realize too late that planning has consumed thousands of hours and stretched staff beyond sustainable limits. “Moving your lab should not be an experiment,” Orlando says.

Third, budget realistically up front. Improper budgeting often leads to value engineering that saves capital dollars but increases operational costs for decades. Projects may finish on budget, but workflows suffer, and staff dissatisfaction grows because early trade-offs have long-term consequences.

Actionable takeaways for lab managers

While no checklist replaces thoughtful planning, several practical steps can help guide the process:

Define “must-haves” versus “nice-to-haves” early. This clarity supports better decisions when budgets tighten.

Inventory everything, no matter its size. “Almost no equipment is too small to include in your planning,” Benford emphasizes.

Document current and future states. Understand what processes look like today and what you want them to become.

Leave room to grow. Plan layouts closer to 80–85 percent capacity rather than at maximum fill.

Invest in communication tools. Meeting minutes, site visits, and visual aids help users envision change and reduce resistance.

Utilize smart design tools and software. Tools such as space audits, utilization tracking, digital modeling, and even VR walkthroughs help stakeholders visualize workflows and catch issues before construction or move-in.

Seek outside perspective when needed. Change management specialists and lab planning experts can ask difficult questions that internal teams might overlook or avoid.

Thoughtful laboratory space planning is more than a logistical exercise. It’s a chance to create safer, more efficient, and future-ready environments that truly support science. By understanding the drivers behind space planning, involving the right voices early, and designing with flexibility in mind, lab leaders can turn redesigns or relocations from stressful disruptions into opportunities for improvement.",https://cdn.labmanager.com/assets/image/55728/lab-planning-m.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:01:36.319324

The rumor suggests that both NVIDIA and AMD have informed their partners about a hike in the GPU memory bundles.

NVIDIA and AMD Rumoredly Informed AICs About Higher GPU Memory Prices; NVIDIA's Price Increase is Reportedly Lower Than AMD

Higher GPU prices are imminent, and we have not just been tracking the prices of the latest-gen GPUs, but have been continuously reporting on the new pricing and supply strategy by the GPU giants. Most reports have centered on NVIDIA GPUs, as there have been rumors regarding the discontinuation of some RTX 50 series GPUs temporarily, which have ultimately been denied and put to rest by NVIDIA itself. Though there is no doubt about the reports that suggest higher GPU prices in the coming days.

On January 16th, NVIDIA officially notified its AIC partners that all bundled GDDR6 and GDDR7 memory packages are now increasing in price. We have been informed of the price increase through familiar AIC partners, but we won't specify the exact price here. What we can say is that NVIDIA's new prices are still lower than those announced by AMD to its AIB partners.

via Benchlife

NVIDIA promised that it would absorb the memory costs to ensure gamers can still get GPUs at an affordable price, and so did AMD. It appears that both GPU manufacturers have now informed their board partners about the price hike in memory chips. Both supply the GPU and memory chips to their board partners, and therefore, the AIBs will have no choice but to increase the GPU prices. However, it's said that NVIDIA's newly announced GPU memory prices are still lower than what AMD told its board partners.

So, if higher costs are passed down to the AIBs, one can expect a noticeable increase in AMD GPU prices vs NVIDIA. That said, the AIBs can decide how much they want to charge for various editions, and we have already seen NVIDIA's high-end RTX 50 series GPUs costing nearly twice as much. AMD RX 9000 GPUs have also seen a significant price change in recent days, and since AMD is expected to focus more on the 16 GB cards, the GPUs may see a higher price hike.

On the other hand, the shipment volume of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT has consistently exceeded that of the Radeon RX 9070, so the focus on the Radeon RX 9070 XT is somewhat puzzling... After all, they both use the same NAVI 48 chip, differing only in XTX, XT, XL, and XTW versions...

via Benchlife

Keep in mind that it's reported that neither NVIDIA nor AMD is changing their MSRP for the GPUs, which means the suggested retail prices will remain the same. As of right now, NVIDIA & their partners have denied special treatment to a specific line of GPUs. AMD, on the other hand, is said to have increased the shipment capacity of its higher-end RX 9070 XT GPUs rather than focusing on more mainstream models such as the RX 9070.

United joined its rival Delta Air Lines in forecasting potential record earnings for the year. The two carriers accounted for almost all of the U.S. airline industry's profit in the first nine months of 2025. Other airlines are set to report later this month.

United's unit revenue fell 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared with last year. Still, United said premium revenue rose 9% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year over 2024. Restrictive basic-economy ticket sales, which compete with discount airlines, were up 7% in the last three months of 2025.

Most airlines are chasing revenue from higher-priced tickets like first class, racing to add in fresh, new cabins that command a premium.

Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.10 adjusted vs. $2.94 expected

Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.4 billion expected

The carrier's fourth-quarter profit rose 6% from a year earlier to $1.04 billion, or $3.19 a share, while capacity rose 6.5% from the same period in 2024. Adjusting for one-time items, United posted earnings of $1.01 billion, or $3.10 a share.

This included Trump saying additional 10% import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain — all already subject to U.S. tariffs.

The tariffs would increase to 25% on June 1 and continue until a deal was reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Leaders of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and Denmark have insisted the island is not for sale.

The reinjection of tariff threats into global markets harkens back to April’s ""Liberation Day,"" when Trump’s levies on global trade partners pushed the S&P 500 to near bear market territory.

The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, spiked to 20.09 points, its highest close since November 24.

Trading volumes were also higher: around 20.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Tuesday, up from the 17.01 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

While investor sentiment was frayed on Tuesday, the question being asked is whether Greenland represents a knee-jerk selloff, or something that will have longer-term implications for markets.

Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said he was not seeing indications investors were fleeing.

""I’m not at the point yet where I’m willing to say what is happening with Greenland, and the resurgence of the tariff threat back and forth, is going to precipitate a correction in the equities markets,"" he said, adding he would be surprised if there was a 3% to 5% drop this week.

BOND MARKETS SPILLOVER

A potentially more significant action, in Cox’s eyes, would be whether Japanese authorities intervene in financial markets.

Japanese government bonds plunged on Tuesday, sending yields to record highs, while Tokyo stocks and the yen also fell after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s call for a snap election shook confidence in the country’s fiscal health.

The moves helped push the cost of longer-term European government bonds higher, while a selloff in U.S. Treasuries was more pronounced on the long end of the curve.

Despite tariff talk, and notable bond movements, the U.S. economy remains in a strong position.

Investors are due a host of fresh data this week on the state of the U.S. economy, including the third-quarter U.S. GDP update, January PMI readings and the Personal Consumption Expenditures report, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.

Earnings season is also kicking into higher gear, with several industry bellwethers set to report their quarterly earnings this week.

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $2.04 billion, up 22.9% from the prior-year quarter.
The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.6%.
Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HBAN’s quarterly earnings has been unchanged at 39 cents per share.
Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BOH’s quarterly earnings has been unchanged at $1.25 per share.","U.S. Bancorp’s USB fourth-quarter 2025 earnings per share of $1.26 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. The bottom line increased 24.7% from the prior-year quarter.

Results benefited from lower expenses and higher non-interest income. Also, a rise in net interest income (NII) and a strong capital position were tailwinds. However, a rise in provision was concerning.

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $2.04 billion, up 22.9% from the prior-year quarter.

In 2025, earnings of $4.62 per share surpassed the consensus estimate of $4.55 and rose from $3.79 in 2024. Net income was $7.6 billion, up 20.2% from the prior-year quarter.

USB’s Revenues Rise, Expenses Decline

Total revenues in the reported quarter were $7.36 billion, up 5.1% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.6%.

For 2025, total revenues were $28.54 billion, which marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.61 billion. The top line rose 4.4% year over year.

Tax-equivalent NII totaled $4.31 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter. The increase primarily resulted from loan growth and fixed asset repricing.

The net interest margin of 2.77% expanded 6 basis points year over year.

Non-interest income moved up 7.8% year over year to $3.05 billion. The upside was driven by a rise in almost all components.

Non-interest expenses declined 1.9% year over year to $4.23 billion. The decrease was due to lower compensation and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by higher marketing and business development expenses, technology and communications expenses and other expenses.

The efficiency ratio was 57.4%, lower than the year-ago quarter’s 61.5%. A decline in the ratio indicates an improvement in profitability.

U.S. Bancorp’s Loan & Deposit Balances Increase

Average total loans rose 1.3% to $384.3 billion from the previous quarter. Average total deposits moved up slightly from the previous quarter to $515.1 billion.

USB’s Credit Quality Improves

Total allowance for credit losses was $7.94 billion, down marginally year over year. As of Dec. 31, 2025, U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets amounted to $1.59 billion, down 13.2% from the year-ago period.

Net charge-offs were $527 million, down 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.

The provision for credit losses in the reported quarter was $577 million, up 3% from the prior-year quarter.

U.S. Bancorp’s Capital Ratios Improve

The Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.3% as of Dec. 31, 2025, up from 12.2% in the prior-year quarter. The Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel III standardized approach was 10.8% as of Dec. 31, 2025, up from 10.6% in the year-ago quarter.

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.7%, up from the prior-year quarter’s 5.8%.

Our Take on USB

U.S. Bancorp’s diversified revenue streams, solid balance sheet and disciplined cost control continue to support its strong financial performance. Growth in NII and non-interest income, coupled with improved efficiency, bodes well for future profitability. Although provisions rose modestly, USB remains well-positioned to deliver steady returns on tangible common equity and maintain positive operating leverage in the upcoming quarters.

Marla was the youngest of seven children raised by John and Jane Kleinheinz in Lake Oswego, OR. She was born with Down syndrome but never let that stop her from living a full life. Her older brothers and sisters loved her unconditionally, and she thrived off the energy that constantly filled the house at 74 Touchstone — a home always full of kids, parents, and friends.

From the beginning, her mother Jane insisted that Marla lead as normal a life as possible. She attended Uplands Elementary and graduated from Lake Oswego High in 1993. In 1996, John Janko, then store manager at Albertsons in Lake Grove, gave her a chance, and she worked there for the next twenty-three years. She was always quick with a “hi” and a hug to everyone she met.

Marla had boundless energy. She competed in Special Olympics skiing, swimming, and occasionally track and field. She loved bowling and golfing. She also enjoyed dancing and singing and was never shy to grab the microphone and make a speech. She savored life and was rarely angry. She taught all of us to love everyone and, most importantly, not to take ourselves too seriously.

The other slots were “still up in air.” Altman asked, “would [redacted] be ok with you?” “No,” Nadella wrote.
“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella posted on X.","The launch of the AI lab that would redefine Microsoft caught the tech giant by surprise.

“Did we get called to participate?” Satya Nadella wrote to his team on Dec. 12, 2015, hours after OpenAI announced its founding. “AWS seems to have sneaked in there.”

Nadella had been Microsoft CEO for less than two years. Azure, the company’s cloud platform, was five years old and chasing Amazon Web Services for market share. And now AWS had been listed as a donor in the “Introducing OpenAI” post. Microsoft wasn’t in the mix.

In the internal message, which hasn’t been previously reported, Nadella wondered how the new AI nonprofit could remain truly “open” if it was tied only to Amazon’s cloud.

Within months, Microsoft was courting OpenAI. Within four years, it would invest $1 billion, adding more than $12 billion in subsequent rounds. Within a decade, the relationship would culminate in a $250 billion spending commitment for Microsoft’s cloud and a 27% equity stake in one of the most valuable startups in history.

New court filings offer an inside look at one of the most consequential relationships in tech. Previously undisclosed emails, messages, slide decks, reports, and deposition transcripts reveal how Microsoft pursued, rebuffed and backed OpenAI at various moments over the past decade, ultimately shaping the course of the lab that launched the generative AI era.

More broadly, they show how Nadella and Microsoft’s senior leadership team rally in a crisis, maneuver against rivals such as Google and Amazon, and talk about deals in private.

For this story, GeekWire dug through more than 200 documents, many of them made public Friday in Elon Musk’s ongoing suit accusing OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman of abandoning the nonprofit mission. Microsoft is also a defendant. Musk, who was an OpenAI co-founder, is seeking up to $134 billion in damages. A jury trial is scheduled for this spring.

OpenAI has disputed Musk’s account of the company’s origins. In a blog post last week, the company said Musk agreed in 2017 that a for-profit structure was necessary, and that negotiations ended only when OpenAI refused to give him full control.

The recently disclosed records show that Microsoft’s own leadership anticipated the possibility of such a dispute. In March 2018, after learning of OpenAI’s plans to launch a commercial arm, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott sent Nadella and others an email offering his thoughts.

“I wonder if the big OpenAI donors are aware of these plans?” Scott wrote. “Ideologically, I can’t imagine that they funded an open effort to concentrate ML [machine learning] talent so that they could then go build a closed, for profit thing on its back.”

The latest round of documents, filed as exhibits in Musk’s lawsuit, represents a partial record selected to support his claims in the case. Microsoft declined to comment.

Elon helps Microsoft win OpenAI

Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI has been one of its key strategic advantages in the cloud. But the behind-the-scenes emails make it clear that Amazon was actually there first.

According to an internal Microsoft slide deck from August 2016, included in recent filings, OpenAI was running its research on AWS as part of a deal that gave it $50 million in computing for $10 million in committed funds. The contract was up for renewal in September 2016.

Microsoft wanted in. Nadella reached out to Altman, looking for a way to work together.

In late August, the filings show, Altman emailed Musk about a new deal with Microsoft: “I have negotiated a $50 million compute donation from them over the next 3 years!” he wrote. “Do you have any reason not to like them, or care about us switching over from Amazon?”

Musk, co-chair of OpenAI at the time, gave his blessing to the Microsoft deal in his unique way, starting with a swipe at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos: “I think Jeff is a bit of a tool and Satya is not, so I slightly prefer Microsoft, but I hate their marketing dept,” Musk wrote.

He asked Altman what happened to Amazon.

Altman responded, “Amazon started really dicking us around on the T+C [terms and conditions], especially on marketing commits. … And their offering wasn’t that good technically anyway.”

Microsoft and OpenAI announced their partnership in November 2016 with a blog post highlighting their plans to “democratize artificial intelligence,” and noting that OpenAI would use Azure as its primary cloud platform going forward.

Internally, Microsoft saw multiple benefits. The August 2016 slide deck, titled “OpenAI on Azure Big Compute,” described it as a prime opportunity to flip a high-profile customer to Azure.

The presentation also emphasized bigger goals: “thought leadership” in AI, a “halo effect” for Azure’s GPU launch, and the chance to recruit a “net-new audience” of developers and startups. It noted that OpenAI was a nonprofit “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” — an organization whose research could burnish Microsoft’s reputation in AI.

But as the ambition grew, so did the bill.

‘Most impressive thing yet in the history of AI’

In June 2017, Musk spoke with Nadella directly to pitch a major expansion. OpenAI wanted to train AI systems to beat the best human players at competitive esports, Valve’s Dota 2. The computing requirements were massive: 10,000 servers equipped with the latest Nvidia GPUs.

“This would obviously be a major opportunity for Microsoft to promote Azure relative to other cloud systems,” Musk wrote in an email to OpenAI colleagues after the call.

Nadella said he’d talk about it internally with his Microsoft cloud team, according to the email. “Sounds like there is a good chance they will do it,” Musk wrote.

Two months later, Altman followed up with a formal pitch. “I think it will be the most impressive thing yet in the history of AI,” he wrote to Nadella that August.

Microsoft’s cloud executives ran the numbers and balked. In an August 2017 email thread, Microsoft executive Jason Zander told Nadella the deal would cost so much it “frankly makes it a non-starter.” The numbers are redacted from the public version of the email.

“I do believe the pop from someone like Sam and Elon will help build momentum for Azure,” Zander wrote. “The scale is also a good forcing function for the fleet and we can drive scale into the supply chain. But I won’t take a complete bath to do it.”

Ultimately, Microsoft passed. OpenAI contracted with Google for the Dota 2 project instead.

‘A bucket of undifferentiated GPUs’

Microsoft’s broader relationship with OpenAI was starting to fray, as well. By January 2018, according to internal emails, Microsoft executive Brett Tanzer had told Altman that he was having a hard time finding internal sponsors at Microsoft for an expanded OpenAI deal.

Altman started shopping for alternatives. Around that time, Tanzer noted in an email to Nadella and other senior executives that OpenAI’s people “have been up in the area recently across the lake” — a reference to Amazon’s Seattle headquarters.

The internal debate at Microsoft was blunt.

Scott wrote that OpenAI was treating Microsoft “like a bucket of undifferentiated GPUs, which isn’t interesting for us at all.” Harry Shum, who led Microsoft’s AI research, said he’d visited OpenAI a year earlier and “was not able to see any immediate breakthrough in AGI.”

Eric Horvitz, Microsoft’s chief scientist, chimed in to say he had tried a different approach. After a Skype call with OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, he pitched the idea of collaboration focused on “extending human intellect with AI — versus beating humans.”

The conversation was friendly, Horvitz wrote, but he didn’t sense much interest. He suspected OpenAI’s Dota work was “motivated by a need to show how AI can crush humans, as part of Elon Musk’s interest in demonstrating why we should all be concerned about the power of AI.”

Scott summed up the risk of walking away: OpenAI might “storm off to Amazon in a huff and shit-talk us and Azure on the way out.”

“They are building credibility in the AI community very fast,” the Microsoft CTO and Silicon Valley veteran wrote. “All things equal, I’d love to have them be a Microsoft and Azure net promoter. Not sure that alone is worth what they’re asking.”

But by the following year, Microsoft had found a reason to double down.

The first billion

In 2019, OpenAI restructured. The nonprofit would remain, but a new “capped profit” entity would sit beneath it — a hybrid that could raise capital from investors while limiting their returns.

Microsoft agreed to invest $1 billion, with an option for a second billion, in exchange for exclusive cloud computing rights and a commercial license to OpenAI’s technology.

The companies announced the deal in July 2019 with a joint press release. “The creation of AGI will be the most important technological development in human history, with the potential to shape the trajectory of humanity,” Altman said. Nadella echoed that sentiment, emphasizing the companies’ ambition to “democratize AI” while keeping safety at the center.

So what changed for Microsoft between 2018 and 2019?

In a June 2019 email to Nadella and Bill Gates, previously disclosed in the Google antitrust case, Scott cited the search giant’s AI progress as one reason for Microsoft to invest in OpenAI. He “got very, very worried,” he explained, when he “dug in to try to understand where all of the capability gaps were between Google and us for model training.”

Nadella forwarded Scott’s email to Amy Hood, Microsoft’s CFO. “Very good email that explains why I want us to do this,” Nadella wrote, referring to the larger OpenAI investment, “and also why we will then ensure our infra folks execute.”

Gates wasn’t so sure. According to Nadella’s deposition testimony, the Microsoft co-founder was clear in “wanting us to just do our own” — arguing that the company should focus on building AI capabilities in-house rather than placing such a large bet on OpenAI.

Nadella explained that the decision to invest was eventually driven by him and Scott, who concluded that OpenAI’s specific research direction into transformers and large language models (the GPT class) was more promising than other approaches at the time.

Hood, meanwhile, offered some blunt commentary on OpenAI’s cap on profits — the centerpiece of its new structure, meant to limit investor returns and preserve the nonprofit’s mission. The caps were so high, she wrote, that they were almost meaningless.

“Given the cap is actually larger than 90% of public companies, I am not sure it is terribly constraining nor terribly altruistic but that is Sam’s call on his cap,” Hood wrote in a July 14, 2019, email to Nadella, Scott, and other executives.

If OpenAI succeeded, she noted, the real money for Microsoft would come from Azure revenue — far exceeding any capped return on the investment itself.

But the deal gave Microsoft more than cloud revenue.

According to an internal OpenAI memo dated June 2019, Microsoft’s investment came with approval rights over “Major Decisions” — including changes to the company’s structure, distributions to partners, and any merger or dissolution.

Microsoft’s $1 billion made it the dominant investor. Under the partnership agreement, major decisions required approval from a majority of limited partners based on how much they had contributed. At 85% of the total, Microsoft had an effective veto, a position of power that would give the company a pivotal role in defining the future of the company.

‘The opposite of open’

In September 2020, Musk responded to reports that Microsoft had exclusively licensed OpenAI’s GPT-3. “This does seem like the opposite of open,” he tweeted. “OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft.”

Nadella seemed to take the criticism seriously.

In an October 2020 meeting, according to internal notes cited in a recent court order, Microsoft executives discussed the perception that the company was “effectively owning” OpenAI, with Nadella saying they needed to give thought to Musk’s perspective.

In February 2021, as Microsoft and OpenAI negotiated a new investment, Altman emailed Microsoft’s team: “We want to do everything we can to make you all commercially successful and are happy to move significantly from the term sheet.”

His preference, Altman told the Microsoft execs, was “to make you all a bunch of money as quickly as we can and for you to be enthusiastic about making this additional investment soon.”

They closed the deal in March 2021, for up to $2 billion. This was not disclosed publicly until January 2023, when Microsoft revealed it as part of a larger investment announcement.

By 2022, the pressure to commercialize was explicit.

According to a transcript of her deposition, Mira Murati, then OpenAI’s vice president of applied AI and partnerships, had written in contemporaneous notes that the most-cited goal inside the company that year was a $100 million revenue target. Altman had told employees that Nadella and Scott said this needed to be hit to justify the next investment, as much as $10 billion.

Murati testified that Altman told her “it was important to achieve this goal to receive Microsoft’s continued investments.” OpenAI responded by expanding its go-to-market team and building out its enterprise business.

Then everything changed.

The ChatGPT moment

On Nov. 30, 2022, OpenAI announced ChatGPT. The chatbot became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million users within two months. It was the moment that turned OpenAI from an AI research lab into a household name.

Microsoft’s bet was suddenly looking very different.

OpenAI’s board learned about the launch on Twitter. According to deposition testimony, board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley received no advance notice and discovered ChatGPT by seeing screenshots on social media.

McCauley described the fact that a “major release” could happen without the board knowing as “extremely concerning.” Toner testified that she wasn’t surprised — she was “used to the board not being very informed” — but believed it demonstrated that the company’s processes for decisions with “material impact on the mission were inadequate.”

Altman, according to one filing, characterized the release as a “research preview” using existing technology. He said the board “had been talking for months” about building a chat product, but acknowledged that he probably did not send the board an email about the specific release.

As its biggest investor, Microsoft pushed OpenAI to monetize the product’s success.

In mid-January 2023, Nadella texted Altman asking when he planned to activate a paid subscription. “Overall getting this in place sooner is best,” he wrote.

Two weeks later, Nadella checked in again: “Btw …how many subs have you guys added to chatGPT?”

Altman’s answer revealed what they were dealing with. OpenAI had 6 million daily active users — their capacity limit — and had turned away 50 million people who tried to sign up. “Had to delay charging due to legal issues,” he wrote, “but it should go out this coming week.”

ChatGPT Plus launched on Feb. 1, 2023, at $20 a month.

In the meantime, Microsoft invested another $10 billion in OpenAI. The companies had begun negotiating the previous summer, when OpenAI was still building ChatGPT. The product’s viral success validated Microsoft’s bet and foreshadowed a new era of demand for its cloud platform.

Ten months later, it nearly collapsed.

‘Run over by a truck’

On Friday afternoon, Nov. 17, 2023, OpenAI’s nonprofit board fired Altman as CEO, issuing a terse statement that he had not been “consistently candid in his communications with the board.” Greg Brockman, the company’s president and cofounder, was removed from the board the same day. He quit hours later.

Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, was not consulted. Murati, then OpenAI’s chief technology officer and the board’s choice for interim CEO, called Nadella and Kevin Scott to warn them just 10 to 15 minutes before Altman himself was told.

“Mira sounded like she had been run over by a truck as she tells me,” Scott wrote in an email to colleagues that weekend.

The board — Ilya Sutskever, Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner, and Adam D’Angelo — had informed Murati the night before. They had given her less than 24 hours to prepare.

At noon Pacific time, the board delivered the news to Altman. The blog post went live immediately. An all-hands meeting followed at 2 p.m. By Friday night, Brockman had resigned. So had Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s head of research, along with a handful of other researchers.

A “whole horde” of employees, Scott wrote, had reached out to Altman and Brockman “expressing loyalty to them, and saying they will resign.”

Microsoft didn’t have a seat on the board. But text messages between Nadella and Altman, revealed in the latest filings, show just how influential it was in the ultimate outcome.

At 7:42 a.m. Pacific on Saturday, Nov. 18, Nadella texted Altman asking if he was free to talk. Altman replied that he was on a board call.

“Good,” Nadella wrote. “Call when done. I have one idea.”

That evening, at 8:25 p.m., Nadella followed up with a detailed message from Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and top lawyer. In a matter of hours, the trillion-dollar corporation had turned on a dime, establishing a new subsidiary from scratch — legal work done, papers ready to file as soon as the Washington Secretary of State opened Monday morning.

They called it Microsoft RAI Inc., using the acronym for Responsible Artificial Intelligence.

“We can then capitalize the subsidiary and take all the other steps needed to operationalize this and support Sam in whatever way is needed,” Smith wrote. Microsoft was “ready to go if that’s the direction we need to head.”

Altman’s reply: “kk.”

The company calculated the cost of absorbing the OpenAI team at roughly $25 billion, Nadella later confirmed in a deposition — enough to match the compensation and unvested equity of employees who had been promised stakes in a company that now seemed on the verge of collapse.

By Sunday, Emmett Shear, the Twitch co-founder, had replaced Murati as interim CEO. That night, when the board still hadn’t reinstated Altman, Nadella announced publicly that Microsoft was prepared to hire the OpenAI CEO and key members of his team.

“In a world of bad choices,” Nadella said in his deposition, the move “was definitely not my preferred thing.” But it was preferable to the alternative, he added. “The worst outcome would have been all these people leave and they go to our competition.”

‘Strong strong no’

On Tuesday, Nov. 21, the outcome was still uncertain. Altman messaged Nadella and Scott that morning, “can we talk soon? have a positive update, ish.” Later, he said the situation looked “reasonably positive” for a five-member board. Shear was talking to the remaining directors.

Nadella asked about the composition, according to the newly public transcript of the message thread, which redacts the names of people who ultimately weren’t chosen.

“Is this Larry Summers and [redacted] and you three? Is that still the plan?”

Summers was confirmed, Altman replied. The other slots were “still up in air.”

Altman asked, “would [redacted] be ok with you?”

“No,” Nadella wrote.

Scott was more emphatic, giving one unnamed person a “strong no,” and following up for emphasis: “Strong strong no.”

The vetting continued, as Nadella and Scott offered suggestions, all of them redacted in the public version of the thread.

Nadella added Smith to the thread. One candidate, the Microsoft president wrote, was “Solid, thoughtful, calm.” Another was “Incredibly smart, firm, practical, while also a good listener.”

At one point, Scott floated a joke: “I can quit for six months and do it.” He added a grinning emoji and commented, “Ready to be downvoted by Satya on this one, and not really serious.”

Nadella gave that a thumbs down.

The back-and-forth reflected a delicate position. Microsoft had no board seat at OpenAI. Nadella had said publicly that the company didn’t want one. But the texts showed something closer to a shadow veto — a real-time screening of the people who would oversee the nonprofit’s mission.

By evening, a framework emerged. Altman proposed Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo as the board, with himself restored as CEO. Taylor would handle the investigation into his firing.

Smith raised a concern. “Your future would be decided by Larry [Summers],” he wrote. “He’s smart but so mercurial.” He called it “too risky.” (Summers resigned from the OpenAI board in November 2025, following revelations about his correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein.)

Altman wrote, “id accept it given my conversations with him and where we are right now.” He added, “it’s bullshit but i want to save this … can you guys live with it?”

Nadella asked for Summers’ cell number.

At 2:38 p.m., Altman texted the group: “thank you guys for the partnership and trust. excited to get this all sorted to a long-term configuration you can really depend on.”

Nadella loved the message.

Two minutes later, Smith replied: “Thank you! A tough several days. Let’s build on this and regain momentum.”

Altman loved that one.

Nadella had the last word: “Really looking forward to getting back to building….”

Later that night, OpenAI announced Altman’s return with the newly constituted board.

“We are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,” Nadella posted on X. “We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.”

The crisis was resolved, but the underlying tensions remained.

‘Project Watershed’

On December 27, 2024, OpenAI announced it would unwind its capped-profit structure. Internally, this initiative was called “Project Watershed,” the documents reveal.

The mechanics played out through 2025. On September 11, Microsoft and OpenAI executed a memorandum of understanding with a 45-day timeline to finalize terms.

Microsoft’s role was straightforward but powerful. Its approval rights over “Major Decisions” including changes to OpenAI’s structure. Asked in a deposition whether those rights covered a recapitalization of OpenAI’s for‑profit entity into a public benefit corporation, Microsoft corporate development executive Michael Wetter testified that they did.

The company had no board seat. “Zero voting rights,” Wetter testified. “We have no role, to be super clear.” But under the 2019 agreement, the conversion couldn’t happen without them.

The timing mattered. A SoftBank-led financing — internally called Project Sakura — was contingent on the recapitalization closing by year-end. Without the conversion, the funding could not proceed. Without Microsoft’s approval, the conversion could not proceed.

Valuation became a key focus of negotiations. Morgan Stanley, working for Microsoft, estimated OpenAI’s value at $122 billion to $177 billion, according to court filings. Goldman Sachs, advising OpenAI, put it at $353 billion. The MOU set Microsoft’s stake at 32.5 percent. By the time the deal closed after the SoftBank round, dilution brought it to 27 percent.

OpenAI’s implied valuation was $500 billion — a record at the time (until it was surpassed in December by Musk’s SpaceX). As Altman put it in his deposition, “That was the willing buyer-willing seller market price, so I won’t argue with it.”

For Microsoft, it was a give-and-take deal: the tech giant lost its right of first refusal on new cloud workloads, even as OpenAI committed to the $250 billion in future Azure purchases.

At the same time, the agreement defused the clause that had loomed over the partnership: under prior terms, a declaration of artificial general intelligence by OpenAI’s board would have cut Microsoft off from future models. Now any such declaration needs to be made by an independent panel, and Microsoft’s IP rights run through 2032 regardless.

The transaction closed on Oct. 28, 2025. The nonprofit remained (renamed the OpenAI Foundation) but as a minority shareholder in the company it had once controlled.

Six days later, OpenAI signed a seven-year, $38 billion infrastructure deal with Amazon Web Services. The company that had “sneaked in there” at the founding, as Nadella put it in 2015, was back — this time as a major cloud provider for Microsoft’s flagship AI partner.

In a post this weekend, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar made the shift explicit: “Three years ago, we relied on a single compute provider,” she wrote. “Today, we are working with providers across a diversified ecosystem. That shift gives us resilience and, critically, compute certainty.”

Revenue had grown from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion in 2025. OpenAI was no longer a research lab dependent on Microsoft’s cloud. It was a platform company with leverage.

In December 2015, Nadella had to ask whether Microsoft had been called to participate in the OpenAI launch. A decade later, nothing could happen without the Redmond tech giant.

But OpenAI would no longer be theirs alone.",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Altman-Satya-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:02:12.932093

The race is scheduled for 20 to 22 March and will replace the Argentina Grand Prix as the second round of the season.

The circuit has been fully repaved, and many safety and building upgrades have been made, including new kerbs, larger run-off areas and improvements to the pit lane, paddock, medical centre and race control. Local reports say the work is about 84% complete after some delays caused by extra requests from the FIM and Dorna.

An FIM inspection last week gave positive feedback, and officials said there was no serious reason to doubt the race will go ahead as planned. Another test event will take place from 29 February to 1 March, featuring 300cc, 600cc and 1000cc races behind closed doors to help the circuit receive full approval.

The event will be run by many of the same officials and marshals who will work at the MotoGP race, including some from the Formula 1 Sao Paulo Grand Prix. If the race happens, Brazilian fans will be able to support Diogo Moreira, who will make his MotoGP debut with LCR Honda after becoming the first Brazilian world champion in Moto2.

Adobe empowers everyone everywhere to imagine, create, and bring any digital experience to life. With over 29 billion assets generated using Adobe Firefly and a vast Adobe Stock ecosystem, the ability to search and discover relevant images or videos at scale is critical.

Achieving this at Adobe’s scale comes with complex technical requirements: running AI models that process hundreds of millions of assets, managing thousands of parallel inference jobs, and ensuring GPUs are fully utilized without breaking cost efficiency. Meeting these challenges requires an infrastructure that can handle massive data throughput, scale elastically, and minimize operational overhead.

In this post, we will share how the Adobe SDC team tackled these challenges and why AWS Batch—combined with GPU accelerated Amazon EC2 Instances—became a strong fit for our large-scale distributed inference workloads. More importantly, we’ll highlight the lessons we learned and the practices that helped us make inference very efficient.

The opportunity

Image assets from multiple sources power content retrieval, discovery and recommendations across various Adobe products—such as Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Express, Adobe Firefly and more—and are surfaced through semantic search. Embedding models are constantly evolving, which makes periodic re-computation of the embeddings for such huge data set(s) with hundreds of millions of assets increasingly critical for state-of-the-art search ranking and relevancy. As search features and experiences continue to evolve, with several experiments and evaluations across the development cycle, recomputing and updating embeddings becomes repetitive.

Computing image embeddings is similar to workflows for text, video, and audio and involves loading images into memory, running inference with Adobe’s proprietary machine learning models, and storing the results in internal systems that power semantic search, RAG, and other capabilities. Given the volume of the data, this process can only be implemented as a massively parallel process rather than sequential processing. AWS Batch, a fully managed service that simplifies running batch computing workloads, helped to achieve our goals.

Some of the key challenges included:

Model and data diversity: Different models and dataset sizes require different GPU architectures to maximize performance and speed. So, our pipelines need to be flexible to use different types of EC2 instances

High operational overhead: Building and maintaining our own container orchestration system (such as EKS) to execute these ad hoc inference jobs would involve significant engineering effort, including managing servers, auto-scaling groups, and load balancers. Instead, a simple ephemeral solution is more appropriate.

Failure detection and recovery: Even with complete automation of cluster setup, failure detection and retry mechanisms require additional business logic.

Data sharding complexity: Efficiently partitioning data and assigning work to each node in the data lake becomes increasingly challenging at scale.

Long processing times: Sequential processing can take weeks to complete for large workloads, severely limiting iteration speed.

The solution

When designing solutions, we aimed to achieve:

Immediate access to resources: Provide seamless access to GPUs across multiple instance types (e.g., g6e, g5), selected based on model requirements.

Efficient resource utilization: Ensure resources allocated are efficiently and effectively used.

Consistent job submission: Offer a standardized interface for job execution, regardless of parallelization level or EC2 instance type.

Cost optimization: Leverage a “pay-as-you-go” model and dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand. Minimize per-job costs to deliver the best possible value.

User experience: Democratize massive batch processing through a fully self-serve experience, empowering users to run jobs without deep infrastructure knowledge.

Data Preparation and Distributed Inferencing

Efficient data loading is critical to maximize GPU utilization during large-scale inference. A common bottleneck is that data is either not loaded quickly enough into GPUs, or the pipeline becomes unbalanced, leading to underutilized hardware.

For a different use case, Adobe Research customized the PyTorch Dataloader to stream samples directly from Amazon S3 into AWS Batch containers at a node level. Within each container, CPUs handle preprocessing—such as decoding and converting samples into tensors—before delivering well-formed batches to GPUs for inference. If a node has 8 GPUs, 8 dataloaders are created, each paired with its own model engine. While they all point to the same dataset, each data loader uses its assigned rank and the number of dataloaders the host is spinning up, also known as world rank, to know exactly which shard of the dataset to process, avoiding overlap and ensuring balanced throughput.

When extending the process to multiple distributed nodes, it is important for each node to be given a distinct dataset partition to process. One approach is to download the entire dataset per node and rely on dataloader rank/world size to handle partitioning. However, given the scale of the data, this would require significant extra disk usage. This is where we leveraged AWS Batch: We separated the dataset preparation and converted it into its own AWS Batch job. This preprocessing job runs multiple workers to shard the S3 bucket and compress object addresses into compact binary files.

During inference, each node only needs to download its assigned binary shard—based on its AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX—and to feed that to its data loaders. This reduces disk overhead, eliminates redundant data transfers, and ensures that every node processes a unique subset of the dataset. Together, these techniques keep GPUs well-fed with batches and maintain high efficiency across thousands of concurrent jobs. This stage was also achieved by AWS Batch service, and we leveraged Batch’s EC2 GPU instance type support capability.

How AWS Batch Supports our Solution Goals and Solved Scaling Challenges

AWS Batch provides a managed architecture that removes much of the operational burden of scaling large-scale inference workloads. It enables us to run tens of thousands of concurrent jobs without maintaining complex infrastructure, while benefiting from consistent logging, monitoring, access controls, and file system integration.

The following are some of the elements of the AWS Batch parallel processing.

Compute environment: This is where we define the EC2 instance type, launch template, and the minimum/maximum number of nodes. AWS Batch provisions an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for GPU nodes and deploys containers to these EC2 nodes based on their availability and health. This abstraction means we rarely touch low-level infrastructure. Scaling is automatic—if job volume increases or decreases, the ASG adjusts node count within the defined limits, ensuring we never pay for idle capacity.

Job queue: This determines the order in which jobs are executed against the associated Compute Environment. For example, if queue A is mapped to compute environment (CE) A, jobs in that queue will be dispatched based on available GPU capacity and queue priority. The job queue also enforces high-level execution rules, such as terminating jobs that exceed timeouts, fail due to insufficient GPU availability, or encounter other resource constraints.

Job definition: The job’s execution blueprint, like a docker run command. This specifies the Docker image, required GPU/CPU resources, disk mounts, and any environment variables or runtime configurations needed for the container to run on the EC2 host. It also defines the number of job attempts, or how many times to try to restart the container in case of failure.

Job: The process of submitting a job definition into a job queue. This triggers the provisioning of the required infrastructure. Each node in a multi-node job is automatically assigned two key environment variables—AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX and AWS_BATCH_JOB_NUM_NODES—used to shard data so that each node processes its specific portion of the workload.

When a job is submitted to AWS Batch, every job node receives the same environment variables, including an S3 URI where all data is stored. The EC2 instance from the ASG pulls the Docker image containing our inference model and logic. Once the container is up and healthy, it uses the node’s AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX and AWS_BATCH_JOB_NUM_NODES values to determine exactly which shard of data it should download and process. After the inference step completes, results are immediately stored in the search index. The container then exits with a success code and terminates, freeing the EC2 host. If additional jobs are waiting in the queue, the host picks up the next job; otherwise, the ASG scales down to release unused resources. By default, each job index also creates an AWS CloudWatch log stream, allowing us to observe container activity in real time and debug issues when needed.

Results

By redesigning a sequential workflow into a multi-step sharding and distributed parallel compute pipeline, and by implementing an efficient onload/offload mechanism for data to GPUs, we achieved 10x faster execution. From our monitoring dashboards, we often see our GPUs now consistently run at 100% utilization, delivering extremely high throughput and maximizing hardware efficiency.

AWS Batch allowed us to support this at scale by provisioning ephemeral compute with no fixed infrastructure or standing costs. AWS Batch handles the operational heavy lifting, and its flexibility to support both CPU and GPU workloads has saved us substantial engineering effort while reducing cloud spend.

In one of our largest runs—computing image embeddings for Adobe Stock—we reduced compute time from 30 days to under 20 hours, while realizing a 95%+ reduction in cost, covering not only compute but also engineering investment. This capability empowers our engineering team to accelerate production workloads and run large-scale experiments quickly and cost-effectively.

Lessons Learned

Data Organization

Efficient Data Sharding:

To process a large number of assets efficiently, pre-organizing data into smaller, manageable shards is critical. Without this, even simple operations like listing assets in S3 can take hours or may hang entirely. By organizing the data into smaller shards, we enabled parallel nodes to consume the data more effectively.

Handling S3 Rate Limits:

After organizing the data, parallel downloading by multiple nodes initially resulted in rate limit errors (HTTP 429). To address this:

We collaborated with the AWS S3 team to increase the throughput of the S3 bucket, which significantly reduced the rate limit errors.

Despite these measures, occasional 429 errors persisted. To mitigate this:

We implemented immediate retries within the same processing loop.

We added a final retry mechanism at the end of the processing. By this stage, each node was making fewer calls to S3, reducing the likelihood of 429 errors.

Batch Processing on GPUs:

When working with GPUs, processing data in optimal batches is mandatory. This applies to preprocessing, processing, and post-processing. This optimal batch size varies across applications. We experimented with various batch sizes before the big run and found an optimal size. Batch processing saved significant GPU time and reduced the overall processing time.

Data Localization:

We ensured that the data resided in the same AWS region as the batch computing clusters. This approach:

Avoided cross-region data transfer charges, which can be substantial.

Reduced latency and improved the overall operation time.

Compute

GPU Availability Challenges:

Due to the rising demand for ML computing, obtaining a high number of GPUs on demand is challenging. To address this:

We created compute definitions for various GPU instance families such as G5s, G6es, and G6s.

We leveraged hybrid compute definitions in AWS Batch to maximize flexibility.

Throughput Optimization:

Understanding the throughput of a single pod was essential. Based on this:

We defined the minimum and maximum number of vCPUs/GPUs required.

This ensured that even if the full compute capacity was unavailable, AWS Batch could start processing with the available resources and scale up as more compute became available.

Key Takeaways:

Data Organization: Proper sharding and localization of data are critical for efficient processing and cost optimization.

Error Handling: Implementing robust retry mechanisms helps mitigate rate limit errors.

Batch Processing: Processing data in batches is essential for GPU efficiency.

Compute Flexibility: Adapting to available compute resources ensures uninterrupted processing and scalability.

For established, profitable consumer brands, the P/S ratio is a useful cross check because it relates the share price to the revenue base that supports long term cash generation. Investors usually pay higher or lower P/S multiples depending on what they expect for future growth and how risky they think those cash flows are, so there is no single “right” level for all companies.

Kraft Heinz currently trades on a P/S of 1.11x. That sits above the Food industry average of 0.76x, but below the peer group average of 1.95x. To refine this further, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 1.33x for Kraft Heinz. This is the P/S level it estimates based on factors such as the company’s earnings growth profile, industry, profit margins, market cap and risk characteristics.

This Fair Ratio is often more informative than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for company specific traits rather than assuming all food stocks deserve the same multiple. Comparing the Fair Ratio of 1.33x with the current P/S of 1.11x suggests the shares may be trading at a discount on this metric.

Boston Scientific’s planned $14.5 billion acquisition of Penumbra started off the year with a bang. The two fast-growing, cardiovascular companies complement each other, with Boston Scientific seeing an opportunity to enter new markets, and Penumbra expecting its devices to gain a wider global reach.

Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney explained how they reached a deal, saying there are few companies that can accelerate Boston Scientific’s growth, earnings per share and operating income margins.

“You have basically two companies that are strong independently, and in the combination have the potential to even become much stronger,” Mahoney said on a Thursday investor call.

The acquisition is expected to close in 2026, more likely in the second half of the year, Mahoney said. Boston Scientific will pay $374 per share, funding the acquisition with about $11 billion in cash and the remainder in stock.

Here are three takeaways from the deal:

1. Penumbra is expected to expand Boston Scientific’s presence in a fast-growing market

Penumbra makes thrombectomy devices to remove clots from blood vessels. It also makes embolization devices to stop blood flow and control bleeding. Mahoney said the acquisition could help Boston Scientific enter new, high-growth segments such as neurovascular and mechanical thrombectomy.

Boston Scientific previously had a neurovascular business, but the company sold it to Stryker in 2011.

“We’ve really been looking for a long time on how to become a scaled, market-leading neurovascular company, not one that’s coming from a distance behind the pack and trying to roll up a bunch of companies,” Mahoney said.

Last year, Boston Scientific also acquired Silk Road Medical, which makes minimally invasive products to prevent stroke in patients with carotid artery disease.

Mahoney added that while Boston Scientific sells some products to vascular surgeons, such as Silk Road’s systems, Penumbra works more closely with those physicians, and an acquisition could help with those relationships.

J.P. Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus wrote in a research note that Boston Scientific’s drug eluting stents, drug coated balloons and transcarotid artery revascularization systems could benefit from working more closely with vascular surgeons. At the same time, the analyst thinks Penumbra can benefit from Boston Scientific accelerating its access to international markets.

2. Little product overlap

Boston Scientific is “the most logical acquirer” for Penumbra, Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a research note. Penumbra’s products are complementary to Boston Scientific’s cardiology and peripheral intervention businesses, Matson added, with only modest overlap between the companies’ devices.

Because of this, Matson does not expect the deal to run into antitrust issues. He also does not expect Penumbra to receive higher bids from other firms that might face more regulatory hurdles to a deal. Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Terumo, for example, all have existing neurovascular businesses.

If the deal falls through, Penumbra would be responsible for paying a break-up fee of $525 million if it enters an agreement for a better proposal or the board changes its recommendation for shareholders to adopt the merger agreement, according to a securities filing.

Boston Scientific would be responsible for a $900 million termination fee if the companies are unable to get the needed regulatory approvals or clearances, but have met the other needed conditions, including shareholder approval.

3. Boston Scientific plans to keep Penumbra as a standalone company and maintain its culture

Mahoney said his number one goal for the acquisition is to keep employees engaged. He said both companies’ cultures are aligned with a focus on innovation and clinical evidence.

“I think you see with Boston Scientific, we have a very highly engaged global workforce,” Mahoney said. “We develop our employees. We have a culture that lets them speak their mind. We care about employees, and that very much matches with Penumbra.”

Two years after the acquisition closes, he expects to retain and grow the commercial workforce and provide additional resources to support Penumbra as needed.

To allow Penumbra the flexibility and speed it needs, Boston Scientific also plans to keep the company as a standalone entity within its cardiovascular group.

Stifel analyst Rick Wise said in a research note that Penumbra works in markets that are “high-growth but also highly competitive,” and that Boston Scientific emphasized protecting Penumbra’s “rapid innovation culture and top-class commercial team.”

As a further show of support for the deal, Penumbra CEO Adam Elsesser said he would take Boston Scientific stock for all of his Penumbra shares, and would be on the combined company’s board of directors.

Il ceo e primo azionista John Bossi ha depositato la lista per il nuovo consiglio di amministrazione, che sarà eletto nell’assemblea dei soci convocata per il 3 febbraio. La novità più rilevante è la candidatura di Marina Natale, ex manager di Unicredit e già amministratore delegato di Amco, come futura presidente della banca.

La lista presentata da Bossi è destinata a ottenere la majority of seats: secondo le previsioni, potrebbe assicurarsi almeno otto posti su nove, rafforzando così la continuità del progetto strategico avviato negli ultimi anni. L’ingresso di Natale al vertice del cda rappresenta un cambio di passo, soprattutto in vista della definizione del nuovo three-year industrial plan che la banca dovrà varare nei prossimi mesi.

Il nuovo piano industriale: wealth management e CIB

Il piano industriale, atteso nei prossimi mesi, sarà incentrato su wealth management e corporate e investment banking. L’obiettivo dichiarato dalla banca è stimolare la crescita organica, puntando su servizi finanziari alle imprese e sulla consulenza patrimoniale per imprenditori e famiglie. In particolare, la divisione wealth management mira a incrementare le masse gestite fino a 4,5 miliardi entro fine 2027, un traguardo ambizioso che richiede una forte integrazione con l’attività corporate. Secondo Bossi, la banca vuole diventare un punto di riferimento per le aziende nel loro percorso di sviluppo, offrendo supporto sia nelle fasi di espansione sia in quelle più delicate, come il passaggio generazionale.

Solidità patrimoniale e ricapitalizzazione

La financial solidity resta un punto di forza per Cherry Bank: a giugno l’istituto ha superato i 4 miliardi di attivo e i 220 milioni di patrimonio, con un CET1 al 17,89%. Questo risultato è stato sostenuto anche dall’aumento di capitale da 15 milioni versato da Bossi, parte di un accordo siglato nel 2021 durante la fusione con il Banco delle Tre Venezie. In vista della ricapitalizzazione, il ceo ha riconosciuto ad alcuni soci il diritto di non diluirsi, una scelta che sarà esercitata entro marzo e porterà la quota di Bossi al 55%, rispetto a oltre il 70% attuale. Una mossa che conferma la volontà di mantenere un controllo stabile, pur favorendo la partecipazione di investitori di rilievo.

Shares of personal computing and printing company HP (NYSE:HPQ) fell 1.7% in the morning session after Morgan Stanley turned more cautious on the U.S. IT hardware sector and lowered its price target on the company's stock.

The investment bank cut its view on the North American IT Hardware industry to “cautious” from “in-line,” warning of a potential 'perfect storm.' The analysts pointed to slowing demand from businesses, rising costs for components, and high stock valuations as reasons for the more defensive stance.

Specifically for HP, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring kept an ""Underweight"" rating on the stock but cut the price target by 10% from $20.00 to $18.00. The negative sentiment impacted the broader sector, with shares of Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise also falling.

What Is The Market Telling Us

HP’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 11 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 8 months ago when the stock dropped 8.2% on the news that the company reported weak first-quarter 2025 results: its EPS and EBITDA missed, and it lowered its full-year EPS guidance, pointing to an uncertain macro backdrop and uneven recovery in printing and consumer tech spending. On the other hand, HP narrowly topped analysts' revenue expectations. Still, this was a softer quarter.

HP is down 10% since the beginning of the year, and at $19.91 per share, it is trading 42.7% below its 52-week high of $34.72 from February 2025.

Nvidia is the leading chipmaker with a market share of around 90%.

The semiconductor champion also faces less competition than IonQ does.

However, there's one path IonQ could take that could make it the next Nvidia.

10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen success that few companies could dream of. It's at the center of one of the most important technological revolutions humankind has ever experienced, and it holds an impressive market share in its sector. Furthermore, Nvidia is producing margins that are unheard of for hardware companies, and any company that can replicate Nvidia's business model will likely be a successful investment.

One area where investors are looking for the next Nvidia is in quantum computing. It's a natural progression from the accelerated computing Nvidia excels at, and Nvidia isn't pursuing a quantum processing unit. So, there could be a new winner on the block for this innovative and exciting technology.

One stock investors point toward that could achieve Nvidia-like status is IonQ (NYSE: IONQ). IonQ is a pure-play quantum computing investment that is solely focused on bringing its quantum computing solution to the market. But can it replicate Nvidia's dominance?

Nvidia is a high standard to live up to

Nvidia's competition in the accelerated computing market is fairly slim. Advanced Micro Devices is an obvious competitor, but so are companies like Broadcom that partner directly with AI hyperscalers to make custom AI chips. Still, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are at the top of the option list when outfitting a data center with computing hardware. However, that's pretty much it for competition.

Quantum computing is vastly different. Because we're in the early stages of quantum computing development, there are countless companies competing for market share. There are other pure plays, like Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum, as well as some legacy players like Alphabet and Microsoft. All of these companies are striving to reach viable quantum computing status as fast as they can, and whoever gets there first will carve out a first-mover advantage, similar to what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT in generative AI.

The beginnings of IonQ and Nvidia offer a stark contrast, as Nvidia created its GPU to process gaming graphics -- a fairly uncontested field. This allowed Nvidia's first product to flop, then it iterated to make a better solution. Eventually, Nvidia's GPUs became good enough to be used for other computing tasks, like engineering simulations and cryptocurrency mining. IonQ doesn't have that luxury. Its first products need to be its best, as there is no room for error in this fierce competitive landscape.

Another facet of Nvidia's business is its dominance. One estimate points to Nvidia's share of data center GPUs hovering around 90%. That dominance level, especially when you consider that Nvidia's products have a premium over their rivals, is absolutely incredible. It will be very hard for IonQ to achieve that level of dominance, especially with the fierce competition it's facing between scrappy start-ups and legacy tech companies with nearly unlimited resources.

The reality is, IonQ will have a very difficult time duplicating Nvidia's business model. However, there is one path that could make it possible.

IonQ is pursuing a unique quantum computing technology

There isn't just one way to perform a quantum calculation. There are multiple avenues that companies can pursue in quantum technology, but not all of them will work out in the end. The most popular strategy, by far, is superconducting. This technique is used by a few pure plays and by many of the legacy tech companies. There are benefits and drawbacks of this technique, but one of the biggest hurdles superconducting is tackling is accuracy. Right now, quantum computers aren't that accurate, and superconducting methods haven't proven to be largely successful by this measure.

IonQ uses a trapped-ion technique, which yields far superior accuracy. IonQ holds the world record for the most accurate quantum computer, and it's over 10 times as accurate as the best superconducting quantum computer. That may be an impossible challenge for its competition to overcome, which could allow it to match Nvidia's business model.

IonQ becoming the next Nvidia is far from a surefire bet. However, if IonQ can produce a superior computing system and reach an acceptable accuracy threshold, it's possible that IonQ could become the Nvidia of quantum computing. If it does, then the stock could skyrocket higher over the next decade.

Shares of computer hardware and IT solutions company Dell (NYSE:DELL) fell 5.3% in the morning session after Morgan Stanley downgraded its view on the IT hardware industry to 'cautious' and an analyst from the firm lowered the price target on Dell's stock.

The investment bank warned of a 'perfect storm' for the sector, citing slowing enterprise demand, rising component costs, and rich valuations. According to a Morgan Stanley survey, corporate hardware spending budgets were expected to see minimal growth. Specifically for Dell, an analyst at the firm maintained an 'Underweight' rating but cut the price target to $111 from $113. The negative sentiment was widespread, with other hardware stocks like HP Inc and Hewlett Packard Enterprise also falling. Broader market weakness also added to the pressure, as investors reacted to new tariff threats.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Dell? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Dell’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock gained 2.9% on the news that analyst firm Barclays upgraded its rating on the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight, pointing to strong orders for the company's Artificial Intelligence (AI) servers.

The bank expressed growing confidence in Dell's position in the AI server space and noted improving opportunities in enterprise server and storage markets. The upgrade was driven primarily by stronger-than-expected demand for its AI-focused hardware. Barclays kept its price target on the shares at $148.

Dell is down 10.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $114.12 per share, it is trading 30.8% below its 52-week high of $164.88 from October 2025.

IBM’s The Enterprise in 2030 study finds quantum computing is expected to reshape industry by the end of the decade, but most enterprises are not preparing for its adoption, creating a strategic gap that could leave even AI-advanced organizations exposed.

While 59% of surveyed executives believe quantum-enabled AI will transform their industry by 2030, only 27% expect their organizations to be using quantum computing, a disconnect IBM describes as a strategic miscalculation rather than a timing issue.

The report positions quantum as a complementary technology that will integrate gradually into hybrid classical-AI workflows, with early enterprise use cases already emerging in areas such as drug discovery and financial optimization.

IBM expects quantum computing to reshape industry by 2030, yet most enterprises are not preparing to use it — a gap that the company’s experts warn could leave even AI-advanced organizations exposed to the next major computing shift.

That warning sits at the center of The Enterprise in 2030, a study from the IBM Institute for Business Value, which surveyed more than 2,000 senior executives across 33 geographies and 23 industries in late 2025. The report’s central finding is not that quantum computing is imminent, but that it is inevitable — and that corporate strategy is lagging that reality.

According to the study, 59% of executives believe quantum-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) will transform their industry by the end of the decade. Yet only 27% expect their organizations to be using quantum computing in any capacity by that time. IBM characterizes the gap as a strategic miscalculation rather than a technology timing issue, arguing that companies focused narrowly on AI risk missing a deeper shift in how computation itself evolves.

“Quantum will never stand alone,” said Dr. Thomas Eckl, chief expert at Bosch, in the report. Classical computing, AI and quantum must work together in connected workflows.”

The study positions quantum computing not as a replacement for today’s systems, but as a complementary tool designed to handle classes of problems that strain even the most advanced classical computers — particularly optimization, simulation and probabilistic analysis. Those capabilities, IBM argues, will increasingly matter as AI systems grow more complex and data-hungry.

Readiness Gap — Strategic Consequences

IBM’s researchers frame quantum computing as the fifth and most underappreciated of five forces shaping the enterprise by 2030, following competitive pressure, productivity reinvestment, tailored AI models and the limits of automation. Unlike earlier waves of enterprise technology, the report suggests quantum’s impact will be indirect at first, most likely appearing inside hybrid workflows rather than as standalone systems.

However, the survey data show a disconnect with many executives treating quantum as a distant research topic rather than a planning priority. While nearly six in 10 respondents expect quantum-enabled AI to reshape their industry, fewer than three in 10 expect to deploy quantum tools themselves.

IBM describes that mismatch as unusual compared with prior technology transitions. In areas such as cloud computing and cybersecurity, adoption expectations and readiness tended to move together. With quantum, belief has outpaced preparation, according to the report.

The risk is not that companies will miss an early advantage, but that they will fail to adapt when quantum capabilities begin affecting markets indirectly — through supply chains, financial systems, drug discovery pipelines and national infrastructure.

“Quantum has the potential to accelerate computing — and to unlock use cases beyond the abilities of even today’s most powerful high-performance computers,” the study states.

IBM does not predict a single moment when quantum computing “arrives.” Instead, it describes a gradual integration process similar to how GPUs and specialized AI chips entered enterprise systems. IBM sees quantum arriving first as accelerators for narrow tasks, then as core components of broader platforms.

From Lab to Enterprise

To counter skepticism that quantum computing remains purely theoretical, the report covers several real-world deployments already underway inside large organizations.

One of the most detailed examples comes from Moderna, which has been applying quantum algorithms to problems in mRNA design. The challenge, according to the study, lies in predicting how strands of messenger RNA fold, a problem with an astronomically large number of possible configurations.

“Our goal is to improve human health,” said Alexey Galda, associate scientific director of quantum algorithms and applications at Moderna. “We believe it’s critical to explore every available tool — including quantum computing — to scale our progress today, rather than wait for the technology to fully mature.”

IBM reports that Moderna has used quantum systems involving up to 80 qubits to model mRNA secondary structures, surpassing prior limits in the field. The company also applied its approach to larger optimization problems using as many as 156 qubits and 950 non-local gates, with results matching those of commercial classical solvers.

The IBM team reports that the significance is not that quantum outperformed classical methods, but that it performed comparably on problems previously considered impractical for quantum systems. That parity suggests quantum computing is beginning to move from academic experimentation toward targeted enterprise workloads.

The report also cites early quantum experimentation in financial services, including a quantum-enabled algorithmic trading demonstration conducted by HSBC. In finance, where optimization and risk assessment are central, IBM suggests quantum tools may be adopted earlier than in sectors focused primarily on transactional processing.

To be clear, these examples are presented as signals rather than proof. IBM repeats throughout the report that quantum computing will not replace classical systems, nor will it deliver broad productivity gains on its own. Its value lies in addressing narrow bottlenecks that compound across complex systems.

AI Strategy not Enough

IBM calls particular attention in the report to organizations that view AI investment as sufficient preparation for the next decade. While AI dominates executive agendas — with 79% of respondents saying it will significantly contribute to revenue by 2030 — IBM argues that AI’s growth will increase demand for new forms of computation rather than reduce it.

As AI models become larger and more specialized, they generate optimization problems that classical systems struggle to solve efficiently. Quantum computing, IBM suggests, offers a way to handle those challenges without relying solely on brute-force scaling.

“By 2030, insight will be everywhere,” said Chad Gates, managing director at Pronto Software, in the report. “Interfaces will be radically different and AI will act as the business intelligence system, decision engine and a participant in operations.”

IBM’s analysis suggests that quantum computing’s most immediate role will be as an accelerator for AI-driven workflows. In other words, quantum will improve training, optimization and simulation rather than replacing existing infrastructure. That framing positions quantum readiness as part of AI governance and architecture decisions being made today.

The report also links quantum preparedness to cybersecurity, particularly as post-quantum cryptography standards move closer to adoption. While cybersecurity does not rank as a top executive priority for 2030 in the survey, IBM describes it as a “table stakes” capability that must evolve alongside emerging technologies.

In that context, quantum computing becomes less about competitive advantage and more about systemic resilience.

Plan for Inevitability, not Immediacy

IBM stops short of urging companies to deploy quantum hardware immediately. Instead, it argues that enterprises should treat quantum the way they once treated cloud computing before mass adoption. It should begin building skills, partnerships and governance frameworks sooner, rather than later.

The study calls for organizations to experiment with hybrid workflows that combine classical computing, AI and quantum tools, even if those quantum components remain small. It also urges leaders to monitor quantum developments as part of strategic risk management rather than innovation scouting.

This framing reflects the report’s broader thesis: that the enterprise of 2030 will be defined less by any single technology than by how organizations integrate multiple systems into adaptable architectures.

Competitive advantage in 2030 will come from innovation rather than resource optimization, a statement in the report that most — 64% — of the experts who were polled .

IBM’s researchers conclude that quantum computing fits that pattern. According to IBM, its impact will likely emerge unevenly, first benefiting organizations that have already mapped where advanced computation could unlock value.

According to the report, those that wait for clarity may find that the shift arrives embedded in markets and supply chains rather than announced in product launches.",https://thequantuminsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-9.59.57-AM-1.png,N,,2026-01-20 12:05:07.697488

While Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins has shifted the agency away from Biden-era climate and environmental, social, and governance initiatives, lawyers still are bracing for the Wall Street regulator’s continued scrutiny of corporate cybersecurity as it stresses disclosure of material information that could affect investors’ decision-making.

Publicly-traded companies crafting their approach for SEC filings—from Form 10-K annual reports to breach disclosures—face a new challenge: providing specific details about cyber threats tied to AI in real time as they work to understand emerging tools’ risks. They’re also on high alert for how the SEC will tackle cyber enforcement after the agency in November dropped a case against business software firm SolarWinds Corp. that cyber executives and attorneys broadly criticized as an overreach by the Biden administration.

“It wasn’t a complete retreat, but through that action and some of the other actions that the SEC has taken, it seems like they’re taking a step back from being ‘cyber auditor,’ but not taking a step back from being the enforcer of accurate disclosures around cybersecurity,” said Ilona Cohen, chief legal and policy officer at HackerOne, a security solutions provider.

Ahead of March deadlines for many companies to file their 10-Ks, businesses will juggle spelling out new AI risks with the SEC’s emphasis on materiality. The agency on Jan. 13 called for recommendations on how corporate disclosures could be curtailed to focus on details reasonable investors deem important.

The SEC signals that “you have to get your house in order and understand these risks so that you can articulate them and talk about them if they are material to you,” said Frank Esposito, partner at Squire Patton Boggs who advises boards of directors and in-house legal teams on governance and securities issues.

The SEC declined to comment on what the agency is looking for from companies when reviewing disclosures related to AI and cybersecurity in 10-Ks covering 2025.

10-K Strategy

The use of AI is growing so ubiquitous that, for many companies, it’s worth considering SEC disclosure, said Michelle Reed, co-chair of Paul Hastings LLP’s data privacy and cybersecurity group. How they’re using it internally or leveraging it as part of their cyber defense shapes those details.

“There’s no question that that is a huge discussion point on every 10-K that we’ve done so far this year,” Reed said.

Cyber risks vary and can be discussed in several sections within 10-K filings, including risk factors and management’s discussion and analysis. In its 10-K, information technology company HP Inc. said it was bracing for an increase in sophisticated cyber attacks because of AI. Broadcom Inc., which supplies infrastructure software solutions, in December flagged AI-powered cyber attacks relying on deep fakes as an area of risk for the company.

The companies didn’t respond to requests to comment on their SEC filings.

Tailoring the disclosure to the specific company and the systems it uses will provide useful information for investors and mitigate the risk of comment letters from SEC staff seeking further information, according to Debevoise & Plimpton LLP corporate partner Eric Juergens.

“You could easily draft a risk factor or some disclosure that would apply to 95% of the companies out there—but that doesn’t really tell an investor all that much,” Juergens said.

Companies should also steer away from “AI washing,” a concern that businesses’ disclosures don’t actually match their use or risks, he added.

As companies enter the final stretch of 10-K preparation, Anthony Bonaguro, partner in Grant Thornton Advisors LLC’s CFO advisory services, said he expects to see some “waiting a bit” to file their reports closer to deadline to see how others are approaching disclosures.

Talking Cyber

While cybersecurity lawyers say they expect less aggressive enforcement from Atkins’ SEC, they still advise companies to be on watch for enforcement of accurate and timely disclosures of material cyber incidents, which companies are supposed to report in 8-K filings for material events. The SEC hasn’t rolled back Biden-era 2023 cyber incident disclosure rules, which aim to give investors timely disclosure of hacks.

Determining the materiality of cyber incidents as they unfold will be a core focus for companies this year.

A ransomware attack, for example, may not always be material depending on a company’s size, balance sheet, and ability to withstand it, Paul Hastings’ Reed said. This means businesses should be documenting how they assessed an incident’s materiality ahead of regulatory probes.

“The SEC will be focused on what I call and what many commentators call ‘bread-and-butter’ securities enforcement issues and a failure to disclose a material cyber incident entirely is always going to be seen as ‘bread-and-butter,’” said Haimavathi Marlier, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster LLP’s fintech and securities enforcement practices and former SEC senior trial counsel.

The agency formed the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit in February 2025 to ferret out cyber-related misconduct and monitor companies’ compliance with cyber regulations, among other priorities.

It’s unclear where the 2023 disclosure rules rank in the unit’s priorities. The group is leveraging its staff’s “substantial fintech and cyber-related experience” to combat fraud and protect investors, the SEC said when it formed the unit.

“Again another signal that they’re primarily focused on accurate disclosures,” HackerOne’s Cohen said of the new unit. “And I will be paying attention to what they’re up to and what their plans are.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/85fa8d6/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F14%2Fe84c8bf04bc7a2328c2829ce89ba%2Fbli-hp-and-broadcom-tear-away-cover.png,N,,2026-01-20 12:05:03.698659

Under the definitive agreement, Adobe will pay $12 per share, representing a premium of roughly 77.5 percent over Semrush’s last closing price before the announcement.

Adobe plans to fold Semrush into its Digital Experience business, alongside Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Analytics, and to connect it to the recently introduced Adobe Brand Concierge. The company says this combination will help marketers understand how their brands appear across owned channels, large language models, traditional search and the wider web.

As generative AI becomes a new interface between customers and brands, marketers are beginning to treat generative engine optimisation (GEO) as a complement to search engine optimisation (SEO).

“Brand visibility is being reshaped by gen AI, and brands that do not embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe’s Digital Experience Business. “With Semrush, we are unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.”

The two boards have approved the transaction. Adobe has also secured voting commitments from Semrush’s founders and other shareholders representing more than 75 percent of Semrush’s voting power to support the deal.

A Semrush shareholder meeting to vote on the merger has been scheduled for 3 February 2026. If approved and regulatory clearances are obtained, closing is expected in the first half of 2026.

Semrush’s platform is widely used for SEO, competitive research and online visibility tracking. In its most recent quarter, the company reported enterprise annual recurring revenue growth of 33 percent year on year, and it counts Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and TikTok among its customers.

“Adobe is an industry leader in helping marketers create personalised customer experiences at scale,” said Bill Wagner, chief executive of Semrush. “With the advent of LLMs and AI-driven search, brands need to understand where and how their customers are engaging in these new channels.”

Adobe says most Fortune 100 companies rely on its software to apply AI within their workflows, naming The Coca-Cola Company, General Motors and IBM among customers. It argues that integrating Semrush’s GEO and SEO capabilities will provide marketers with a single view of brand visibility across search, LLMs and owned channels.

Regulatory assessment will include review under the US Hart-Scott-Rodino process and scrutiny in other jurisdictions, including the UK and EU, given Adobe’s scale in digital experience software. Both parties said the merger remains subject to customary conditions. Adobe abandoned a proposed Figma acquisition in 2023 following regulatory opposition, which makes the timetable for this transaction a focus for investors.

Adobe has positioned Brand Concierge at the centre of its agentic AI strategy, describing it as an application that turns brand content into conversational experiences across digital touchpoints. The company has pointed to Adobe Analytics data showing a sharp rise in traffic to US retail sites from generative AI sources, underscoring why discoverability beyond traditional search is now a priority.

Cash consideration will be funded from Adobe’s balance sheet and operating cash flow.

Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is acting as legal adviser to Adobe. Centerview Partners LLC is serving as exclusive financial adviser to Semrush, and Davis Polk & Wardwell is its legal adviser.

Mr Wagner concluded: “The combination of Adobe and Semrush provides marketers more insights and capabilities to increase their discoverability across today’s evolving digital landscape.”

Conclusion: The Investment Case for MDT Stock The Bull Case for Medtronic Medtronic stands out as a compelling option for income-focused investors.
In addition, higher R&D and restructuring spend may constrain earnings leverage, raising the risk that dividend growth slows if operational momentum does not improve.","Medtech is in an exciting place right now.

Artificial intelligence (AI), predictive monitoring, digital twin simulations and robotics are all driving rapid innovation across the sector.

R&D activity is set to expand, both at established firms and startups with potentially disruptive technologies, particularly those leveraging complex data, real-time analytics, edge computing and edge AI.

Regulatory frameworks are also evolving. In February 2026, the FDA will replace its decades-old Quality System Regulation with a modernized Quality Management System Regulation.

In Europe, meanwhile, the EU’s AI Act and European Health Data Space Regulation will push the sector toward greater transparency.

Medtronic [MDT] is at the forefront of many of these developments.

Founded in 1949 as a medical electronics repair shop in Minnesota, it pioneered cardiac pacemakers, insulin pumps and advanced surgical systems, expanding through innovation and acquisitions. Over decades, Medtronic has grown into a diversified healthcare giant, spanning cardiovascular, diabetes, neurological and surgical technologies worldwide.

The firm’s Q2 results, released in November 2025, beat expectations.

Revenue rose 6.6% to $9bn, led by a 10.8%% surge in cardiovascular sales — the firm’s best outside the Covid-19 pandemic in over a decade. Cardiac ablation grew 71% year-over-year, with the Affera pulsed field ablation system doubling its install base.

The company raised full-year guidance, lifting revenue growth to 5.5% and EPS to $5.62–5.66.

MDT stock climbed steeply following the results, although it has dipped since then. It is up 16.02% over the past 12 months as of the January 16 close.

Going into 2026, commentators and investors alike are buoyant about Medtronic’s prospects.

Medium-term Tailwinds for MDT Stock

In May 2025, Medtronic said it would spin off its diabetes unit into a standalone, publicly listed company, with the deal expected to close by year-end 2026 based on management’s guidance.

The rationale for this move is compelling, and a number of commentators have expressed approval.

Principally, Medtronic has struggled to keep up with rivals in key areas of diabetes care, notably continuous glucose monitoring, while facing intensifying competition in insulin pumps. In addition, diabetes is also the group’s only direct-to-consumer business and delivers materially lower operating margins than its other divisions.

Exiting the unit will sharpen Medtronic’s focus on higher-margin B2B segments and could help unlock more profitable, sustainable growth.

Elsewhere, in December 2025, Medtronic secured US regulatory clearance for Hugo, its robotic-assisted surgery system, initially for urologic procedures. While the approval is unlikely to drive near-term revenue growth, it opens a significant long-term opportunity. Robotic surgery remains underpenetrated despite clear advantages in minimally invasive care. Although competition is intense, growing shipments and expanded indications should allow Hugo to become a meaningful contributor over time.

The company has also announced it will be making acquisitions as it looks to expand and diversify its portfolio.

At the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco earlier in January, executives said the firm has “significant firepower” to pursue acquisitions.

The company is focused on tuck-in deals, particularly in cardiology and neuroscience, with a preference for assets that are early stage or close to commercialization, according to CEO Geoff Martha.

CFO Thierry Piéton said Medtronic’s balance sheet provides ample flexibility to complete a “meaningful number” of transactions without putting pressure on its finances. He added that the company is re-accelerating its M&A activity after a quieter period, while stressing that Medtronic’s dividend policy remains unchanged.

Management is targeting acquisitions in the low- to mid-single-digit billions of dollars, Reuters reported, aiming to complement internal R&D rather than replace it. To speed execution, Medtronic has also established a new board-level committee focused on dealmaking.

In parallel to this, the company has pursued various collaborations, including a recently announced partnership with Precision Neuroscience to integrate its StealthStation surgical platform with Precision’s Layer 7 brain-computer interface.

Medtech Leaders: MDT vs BSX vs SYK

Let’s see how Medtronic measures up against two leading peers in the space.

Boston Scientific [BSX] specializes in minimally invasive interventional devices across cardiovascular, neurovascular, urology and endoscopy segments. The company has delivered double-digit organic revenue growth and expanded margins through innovation and strategic acquisitions, including a recent $14.5bn deal for Penumbra [PEN] to bolster its cardiovascular portfolio. Boston Scientific focuses on high-growth procedural markets rather than broad device categories and, with a $130.61bn market cap, slightly outstrips Medtronic in terms of size.

Stryker Corporation [SYK], meanwhile, leads in orthopedics and surgical systems, including robotic-assisted surgery with its Mako platform, as well as neurotechnology and emergency care equipment. Its revenue growth and profitability are underpinned by strong product demand, recurring implant volumes and innovation in surgical tools. Stryker also offers a dividend, appealing to income-oriented investors. At $139.12bn, its market cap is the largest of the three.

Here go the three firms’ current fundamentals.

Source: Yahoo Finance

Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Stryker represent a scale spectrum within medtech.

Medtronic stands at the broadest end, with diversified revenue streams across chronic care, surgical and device segments, generating scale, steady cash flows and resilience to cyclicality. Its extensive portfolio and global reach position it as a core medtech holding with moderate growth and strong fundamentals.

Boston Scientific sits in the mid-growth tier, with a sharper focus on procedural and interventional devices. It has delivered robust organic growth and margin expansion through innovation and bolt-on acquisitions, though its earnings are somewhat more sensitive to procedure volumes and integration risk from recent deals.

Stryker excels in orthopedics and surgical robotics, combining above-average growth with attractive margins and shareholder returns including dividends. Its fundamentals reflect strong product demand and pricing power in elective and trauma procedures.

Collectively, the three offer diversified exposure across medtech’s core growth drivers with varying risk-return profiles.

Conclusion: The Investment Case for MDT Stock

The Bull Case for Medtronic

Medtronic stands out as a compelling option for income-focused investors. The healthcare group has raised its dividend for 48 consecutive years and currently offers a forward yield of around 3%. It is on course to achieve Dividend King status — defined as 50 straight years of dividend growth — within the next few years, with a strong likelihood of sustaining dividend increases well beyond that milestone. This income appeal is reinforced by Medtronic’s resilient free cash flow generation, investment-grade balance sheet and diversified end markets, which collectively underpin dividend durability across economic cycles.

The Bear Case for Medtronic

Despite its defensive appeal, Medtronic faces several headwinds. Organic growth has lagged faster-growing medtech peers, while execution challenges in diabetes and cardiac devices have weighed on margins. Ongoing pricing pressure, rising input costs and regulatory scrutiny could limit near-term profitability. In addition, higher R&D and restructuring spend may constrain earnings leverage, raising the risk that dividend growth slows if operational momentum does not improve.",https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/med_2225143489_1200px.jpg_medium.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:56.303388

Company Overview

With roots dating back to 1863 and a presence across 26 states primarily in the Midwest and West, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) is one of America's largest banks providing lending, deposit services, wealth management, payment processing, and merchant services to individuals and businesses.

Sales Growth

From lending activities to service fees, most banks build their revenue model around two income sources. Interest rate spreads between loans and deposits create the first stream, with the second coming from charges on everything from basic bank accounts to complex investment banking transactions. Regrettably, U.S. Bancorp’s revenue grew at a sluggish 4.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the banking sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis.

We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes, market returns, and industry trends. U.S. Bancorp’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years. Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business.

This quarter, U.S. Bancorp reported year-on-year revenue growth of 5.1%, and its $7.37 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%.

Net interest income made up 58.6% of the company’s total revenue during the last five years, meaning U.S. Bancorp’s growth drivers strike a balance between lending and non-lending activities.

Our experience and research show the market cares primarily about a bank’s net interest income growth as non-interest income is considered a lower-quality and non-recurring revenue source.

Tangible Book Value Per Share (TBVPS)

Banks are balance sheet-driven businesses because they generate earnings primarily through borrowing and lending. They’re also valued based on their balance sheet strength and ability to compound book value (another name for shareholders’ equity) over time.

When analyzing banks, tangible book value per share (TBVPS) takes precedence over many other metrics. This measure isolates genuine per-share value by removing intangible assets of debatable liquidation worth. Traditional metrics like EPS are helpful but face distortion from M&A activity and loan loss accounting rules.

U.S. Bancorp’s TBVPS grew at a tepid 3.7% annual clip over the last five years. However, TBVPS growth has accelerated recently, growing by 16.7% annually over the last two years from $21.37 to $29.12 per share.

Over the next 12 months, Consensus estimates call for U.S. Bancorp’s TBVPS to grow by 8.7% to $31.67, paltry growth rate.

Key Takeaways from U.S. Bancorp’s Q4 Results

It was encouraging to see U.S. Bancorp beat analysts’ tangible book value per share expectations this quarter. We were also happy its net interest income narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives.

In Canada, PE exits continued to decline in 2025 by deal count.
Canadian PE Activity Total Canadian private equity deal value was up and deal count was down in the final quarter of 2025.
Add-ons were the most common type of transactions—156 Canadian PE deals used this strategy in 2025.
PE Deals data is for announced or completed deals where a Canadian company is the target, as of December 31, 2025.","The private equity industry went in a number of different directions in 2025. Global dealmaking value picked up in the second half of the year but the number of deals decreased. PE exits declined year-over-year, boosting growth in alternative strategies to generate liquidity. Investors remain committed to PE according to Preqin's latest investor survey, despite exercising greater caution in short-term commitments. Macroeconomic conditions improved markedly as the year went on, after a turbulent and unexpected start.

In this edition of the Bennett Jones PE Briefing, we look at the full-year data on private equity activity in Canada in 2025 as well as:

how 2025 unfolded and what to look for in the coming year

PE exit activity and what to expect in 2026

trends in GP-stakes investing

The PE Market in 2025 and Looking Ahead

Private equity dealmakers are looking ahead to renewed growth in activity following an upswing in global transaction values during H2 2025. The third quarter was particularly buoyant with US$376.3 billion in aggregate deal value, according to Preqin. This was the best three-month tally since Q1 2022. In November, the CVCA reported the Canadian private equity market had a record-setting third quarter in 2025.

Several segments of private equity stood out with highly active years in 2025, including secondaries. The global secondary market volume now exceeds US$160 billion and fundraising is headed for another banner year. This is driven in large part by a soft PE exit environment. The flow of capital into secondaries stands in contrast to a weak fundraising environment overall in the PE industry.

The private credit market in Canada has grown to become a core allocation for institutional investors and has been a sharp area of focus in 2025. Private credit strategies have delivered outsized returns and the asset class is expected to continue growing—as deals become structurally more complex.

Leveraged buyouts were on the rise in 2025, spurred by private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds, and this is expected to continue into the new year. S&P Global data shows that PE's share of leveraged buyouts has been increasing since 2023.

The pace of exits continues to be one of the biggest challenges for PE firms. As the Wall Street Journal describes it, ""Private equity has more housecleaning to do in 2026. Recent deals boosted optimism for the new year, but firms are still sitting on a glut of portfolio companies.""

What to Expect in Exit Activity

Globally, private equity exit volume remains subdued, but average exit size increased in 2025, according to Preqin data. In Canada, PE exits continued to decline in 2025 by deal count. The aggregate value of announced or completed deals decreased in 2025, after rising from 2022-2024.

The outlook for PE exits in 2026 remains cautiously balanced between optimism and restraint. Reasons for optimism in 2026 include lower interest rates, continued pressure for exits from LPs and a reopening of the IPO window (as well as a renewed bullish sentiment in the capital markets generally), in the United States. Globally, the IPO market had its best year since 2022, according to Dealogic. The IPO market in Canada remains in a drought, however, with de-listings and companies taken private continuing to outpace IPOs on the TSX and TSXV.

Although high-quality assets are in demand for exits, valuation gaps continue to persist for many companies. PE assets nearing maturity are expected to exit at a slower pace. While the global economic picture has improved, uneven growth and ""K-shaped"" recoveries for certain sectors compared to others may continue. All of this could lead to a patchy recovery across the PE landscape. Preqin says that for now, it sees only tentative signs of a recovery in exit volumes.

GP-Stakes Investing

GP-stakes investing involves the sale of a minority, generally non-voting ownership interest in a GP entity by an asset manager to another investor. Historically, such transactions were undertaken almost exclusively by existing LPs seeking deeper alignment with the asset manager. A notable early example is the CalPERS 2001 acquisition of a minority interest in The Carlyle Group for approximately US$175 million.

Over the past decade, the buyer landscape has shifted. Specialized investment vehicles, commonly known as GP‑stakes funds, have emerged as the dominant acquirers of these interests. While a GP‑stakes investor may, in certain cases, be required to fund its pro rata share of the GP’s capital commitment and receive a corresponding limited partnership interest, the primary objective of GP-stakes funds is to capture returns linked to their share of GP economics, principally management fees and, when realized, carried interest. An early illustration of this evolution occurred when Affiliated Managers Group, a publicly traded asset manager known for acquiring GP-stakes, purchased a minority equity position from Goldman Sachs’ Petershill Fund I for approximately US$800 million. Since then, the strategy has continued to accelerate. There were US$3.4 billion of GP-stakes deals globally in 2024, the highest level since the record year of 2021, according to PitchBook data.

Although Canada has yet to see the emergence of funds dedicated exclusively to GP stakes investing, the model offers compelling opportunities for both GPs and LPs. For GPs, selling a minority, non voting stake can provide long awaited liquidity for employees, and some GPs also use the sale proceeds to strengthen their management team or facilitate succession planning. GP-stakes opportunities may also serve as incentives used to attract lead LPs. For LPs, acquiring a stake in the GP enhances alignment with the manager, and any carried interest realized can meaningfully offset overall fee expenses associated with investing in the fund. In this sense, GP stakes continues to evolve from a niche structuring solution into a recognized asset class, joining the ranks of private equity, real estate, secondaries, infrastructure, and other established alternatives.

Canadian PE Activity

Total Canadian private equity deal value was up and deal count was down in the final quarter of 2025. Fewer deals were done last year than in 2024 and the total value for announced or completed transactions declined from US$59.8 billion to US$48.3 billion in 2025.

Add-ons were the most common type of transactions—156 Canadian PE deals used this strategy in 2025. Buyouts (27), growth (26) and LP direct (21) rounded out the top five. LP direct deals and corporate carve-outs saw more deals in 2025 than the previous year.

Looking Ahead

The mood of the Canadian and global private equity markets improved as we moved through 2025. Growing sectors such as technology (including the burgeoning AI and AI-adjacent sectors) and defense will continue to create dealmaking opportunities. The AI boom has been one of the biggest stories in years, with tens of billions of dollars being invested in data centres, large-scale energy and industrial infrastructure, and the sector’s picks-and-shovels suppliers.

Challenges remain for private equity in 2026. Delayed exits, aging assets and slower fundraising may hold the industry back from a full recovery. On the buy-side specifically, add-ons and roll-ups into existing portfolios should continue to improve as sponsors look for EBITDA expansion. Conversely, GPs will likely want to remain patient and disciplined before executing on new platform investments.

All numbers are according to Preqin data in US dollars unless otherwise stated. PE Deals data is for announced or completed deals where a Canadian company is the target, as of December 31, 2025.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14667_957.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 17:02:04.688303

While the pivot is significant and the competition fierce, Coric appears undaunted.
Coric took a pipeline of experimental products from what remained and spun out a second company, Biohaven Ltd., trading under Biohaven Pharma’s original stock ticker.
Then, on January 7 just ahead of JPM, the investment firm Janus Henderson bought $125 million in shares of Biohaven.
“That’s 10% of the company” Coric said.","Vlad Coric seems unfazed by the crowd of people milling around Union Square in San Francisco. This is apparently Coric’s default demeanor, as the Biohaven CEO also appears largely unbothered by the myriad setbacks that have hit his company in recent months.

That includes a recent mid-stage miss in major depressive disorder, a November 2025 FDA rejection in a rare neurodegenerative disease and a corresponding $150 million capital opportunity lost.

Instead, he tells me about the company’s plans to repurpose its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug taldefgrobep alfa, which flunked a Phase III trial in late 2024, as a muscle-sparing drug for use alongside GLP-1s like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy or Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. He specifically points to bimagrumab, for which Lilly paused a clinical trial last September.

“A lot of folks who don’t want to take GLP-1s are concerned about the muscle loss and the bone density effects,” Coric told BioSpace on the sidelines of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. “The only thing that I think limited Lilly’s bimagrumab was the side effects. They had very high rates of side effects. We’re not seeing the side effects that Lilly ran into.” Notably, Lilly did not report a reason for pausing the bimagrumab trial in September.

Biohaven made a serendipitous discovery following the trial of taldefgrobep alfa for SMA—a neuromuscular disease that causes destruction of motor neurons; participants saw reduced weight and preservation of lean muscle and bone density while on the drug. Biohaven Is recruiting patients living with obesity or who are overweight for a Phase II study, which is set to complete in September 2026.

While the pivot is significant and the competition fierce, Coric appears undaunted. In fact, he seems only to see an opportunity.

Bimagrumab is an inhibitor that blocks activin type II receptors, preventing its inhibitory action on muscle growth while potentially causing side effects, Coric said, while taldefgrobep alfa uses a different mechanism of action to inhibit a different protein, myostatin, which itself regulates muscle size. “So we think we could deliver bimagrumab-like efficacy without the side effects. That’s a winning profile for a monotherapy.”

The Biohaven brand has had its successes. In 2022 Pfizer bought Biohaven Pharmaceutical for $11.6 billion, largely to acquire its successful migraine treatment program. Coric took a pipeline of experimental products from what remained and spun out a second company, Biohaven Ltd., trading under Biohaven Pharma’s original stock ticker.

The new company hasn’t yet been able to reproduce the original’s commercial achievements. When Biohaven’s spinocerebellar ataxia treatment troriluzole was rejected by the FDA in November 2025, the company also missed out on a $150 million payment from investment firm Oberland Capital. But Biohaven is resilient. The company went to Wall Street to raise more funds, seeking a $150 million public offering but ending up with $200 million.

Then, on January 7 just ahead of JPM, the investment firm Janus Henderson bought $125 million in shares of Biohaven. “That’s 10% of the company” Coric said. “We’re well capitalized.”

Coric’s confidence appears to stem from Biohaven’s diverse pipeline. He pointed repeatedly to BHV-1300, a protein degrader therapy for autoimmune conditions. That drug scored in March 2025 when it showed a deep reduction in IgG proteins after a four-week Phase I trial.

For all of this swagger, however, it seems Coric and Biohaven came to the conference with something to prove to the rest of the biopharma world. “I think coming into [JPM26], we wanted to make sure we were well-funded, we could show people our exciting data and focus on the degrader platform as the future.”

Despite the rollercoaster trajectory of the second iteration of Biohaven, Coric seems intent to keep the company running as its own entity—for the time being—although he is open to a potential buyout.

“I’m a firm believer you should run your company like you’re going to own it forever,” he said, “but if somebody comes in and gives you a good offer, you’ll always consider that, as we did for [Pfizer].”",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/bb92b8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4011x2256+201+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F9d%2F0c656e304f4ca2b8e793e50768ad%2Fistock-648692064.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:31.384536

USB Price Action: U.S. Bancorp shares were down 3.25% at $52.63 during premarket trading on Tuesday.","U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) stock fell on Tuesday after the lender reported fourth-quarter 2025 results.

The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, beating the analyst consensus estimate of $1.19. Quarterly sales of $7.337 billion outpaced the Street view of $7.308 billion.

The company’s provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter was $577 million, compared with $571 million in the third quarter of 2025 and $560 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The fourth quarter provision was $6 million (1.1%) higher than the third quarter of 2025 and $17 million (3%) higher than the fourth quarter of 2024.

The increase in provision expense year over year was primarily driven by loan portfolio growth, partially offset by lower net charge-offs.

Other Metrics

Net income rose 23.0% year over year to $2.045 billion.

Return on tangible common equity rose to 18.4%, while return on average assets increased to 1.19%. The efficiency ratio improved to 57.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2024.

The company delivered 440 basis points of positive operating leverage, adjusted for prior notable items. Net interest margin rose to 2.77%, up 6 basis points year over year and 2 basis points sequentially.

Noninterest expense remained relatively stable compared to the prior-year period. The CET1 capital ratio stood at 10.8% as of Dec. 31, 2025.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis rose to $4.31 billion, up from $4.25 billion in the prior quarter and $4.18 billion a year earlier.

Average deposits rose to $515.1 billion from $511.8 billion in the third quarter, while average total loans increased to $384.3 billion from $379.2 billion in the prior quarter.

“Record consumer deposits this quarter and effective balance sheet remixing contributed to net interest income growth and margin expansion. Fee income exceeded our mid-single-digit growth target and was supported by broad strength across our diversified fee businesses,” said CEO Gunjan Kedia.

Important Highlights

U.S. Bancorp signed a definitive deal to buy BTIG, LLC, expanding its investment banking and trading platform. BTIG’s roughly 700 employees across 20 locations will join U.S. Bancorp, and current leadership will stay.

The company expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approvals.

U.S. Bank also completed a cross-border stablecoin pilot, signaling readiness for future compliant commercial offerings.

Outlook

U.S. Bancorp forecast fiscal 2026 revenue of $29.85 billion to $30.42 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $30.04 billion.

“Looking ahead to 2026, we remain committed to our strategic priorities and medium-term targets as these measures will continue to drive sustainable EPS growth and industry-leading returns,” Kedia added.

Quick Insights

Underperformance was mainly due to the fund's higher exposure to growth stocks and lower exposure to value, as value outperformed growth significantly during the quarter.

I maintain a constructive outlook but anticipate investors will favor cash-generative companies with sustainable earnings and durable competitive advantages after a year of strong returns.

Absence from the aerospace & defense industry and lagging healthcare holdings were key detractors, while technology and AI-related names contributed positively.

U.S. Bancorp has demonstrated consistent revenue growth, with a 3-year revenue growth rate of 4.7%. The bank's profitability is underscored by a net margin of 25.51%, indicating efficient cost management and strong earnings potential. However, the 3-year earnings growth has been negative at -7.9%, suggesting challenges in maintaining consistent profit growth.

On the balance sheet front, U.S. Bancorp's debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.23, reflecting a moderate level of leverage. The bank's Piotroski F-Score of 8 indicates strong financial health, while the Beneish M-Score of -2.55 suggests a low likelihood of earnings manipulation.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

U.S. Bancorp's valuation metrics reveal a P/E ratio of 12.45, which is close to its 1-year high of 12.95, indicating potential overvaluation. The P/S ratio of 3.01 and P/B ratio of 1.5 are also near their respective historical highs, suggesting that the stock may be trading at a premium.

Analyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with a recommendation score of 2.3, indicating a moderate buy. The RSI of 55.5 suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, while the 50-day moving average of 51.47 provides a support level.

Risk Assessment

U.S. Bancorp's financial health is robust, as evidenced by its high Piotroski F-Score and low Beneish M-Score. However, sector-specific risks such as regulatory changes and economic downturns could impact performance. The stock's beta of 1.61 indicates higher volatility compared to the market, which could lead to significant price fluctuations.

The new company will operate under both the Wingify VWO and AB Tasty brands initially, maintaining separate product lines before gradually consolidating the platform over time.
Everstone will retain majority control and hold majority board rights, with a board structure of five to six seats including representation from Everstone, Gupta, and three to four independent directors.
Everstone's merger of Wingify and AB Tasty signals a clear bet that the future of digital optimization belongs to consolidated, AI-ready platforms rather than point solutions.","Private equity firm Everstone Capital just closed a major consolidation play in the digital optimization space, merging India's Wingify and France's AB Tasty into a single $100 million-plus revenue company. The move comes just one year after Everstone acquired a controlling stake in Wingify for $200 million, signaling an aggressive platform-building strategy aimed at competing head-to-head with players like Optimizely and Adobe.

The marriage between Wingify and AB Tasty represents something of a Silicon Valley paradox. Two rivals that have long operated in the same space - helping enterprises improve digital experiences through testing and personalization - are now joining forces under Everstone Capital's umbrella. It's a move that tells you a lot about where the market's heading and why pure-play startups are increasingly finding it hard to go alone.

Sparsh Gupta, Wingify's co-founder, will lead the combined entity as CEO. The new company will operate under both the Wingify VWO and AB Tasty brands initially, maintaining separate product lines before gradually consolidating the platform over time. Both businesses are profitable, a detail Gupta emphasized to underscore that this isn't a desperate fire sale but rather a calculated play to build something bigger.

""Both the businesses have been operating as friendly competition,"" Gupta told TechCrunch. The framing matters here - this is positioned as natural alignment rather than acquisition by necessity. The merger reflects what enterprises actually want: integrated, holistic platforms that don't require stitching together multiple vendors to cover testing, personalization, and feature delivery all in one place.

The numbers underscore the scale Everstone is assembling. The combined business will serve more than 4,000 customers globally, with roughly 90 percent of revenue coming from the US and Europe. We're talking about brands like Forbes, Walt Disney, Amway, L'Oréal, and Samsonite - enterprises across e-commerce, SaaS, travel, and media. Close to 800 employees will operate across 11 offices globally, with roughly 350 staff based outside India. The merged company will be headquartered in New Delhi.

Everstone is injecting ""significant additional capital"" into the deal beyond what was already committed when it acquired a majority stake in Wingify for $200 million in January 2025. Gupta described the fresh capital as primarily aimed at ""cleaning up"" AB Tasty's cap table - translation: paying off existing investors - and enabling the two businesses to operate as one. Financial terms weren't disclosed, though the structure includes cash and some equity rollover for existing leadership.

The executive team reflects the merging of two orgs. Alongside Gupta as CEO, Wingify co-founder Ankit Jain takes on Chief Product and Technology Officer duties. AB Tasty's co-founders - Rémi Aubert and Alix de Sagazan - become Chief Customer and Strategy Officer and Chief Revenue Officer respectively. Everstone will retain majority control and hold majority board rights, with a board structure of five to six seats including representation from Everstone, Gupta, and three to four independent directors.

Here's what's particularly noteworthy: there are no layoffs planned. Gupta framed this as ""value creation"" rather than cost-cutting, which is unusual for private equity deals but increasingly common in high-growth tech consolidations where scaling product matters more than cutting overhead.

The timing reflects a larger market shift. Enterprise SaaS M&A is on a tear. According to PitchBook data, the sector saw 270 deals worth $65 billion in Q3 alone, with deal volumes up 26.2 percent quarter-over-quarter and private equity accounting for 66.7 percent of those deals. Private equity firms have identified consolidation as a key value-creation strategy, and enterprise customers are increasingly demanding AI-ready, integrated platforms that can handle everything from A/B testing to personalization to feature flagging without vendor fragmentation.

This deal also positions Everstone to compete more directly against Optimizely, Adobe's experience cloud offerings, and other established players dominating the digital optimization category. By combining Wingify's 3,000-plus customer base with AB Tasty's 1,000-plus, Everstone gets instant scale and a deeper product suite. The focus now shifts to investing in AI capabilities - both companies have flagged this as a priority going forward - while maintaining the customer experience in the near term.

The deal is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, but expect this to close relatively quickly. Everstone's backing suggests it has a clear roadmap for the combined company, likely involving further bolt-on acquisitions, deeper AI integration, and aggressive expansion in specific verticals where the merged platform can offer unique value.

Everstone's merger of Wingify and AB Tasty signals a clear bet that the future of digital optimization belongs to consolidated, AI-ready platforms rather than point solutions. For enterprise customers tired of integrating multiple vendors, this deal means fewer technical headaches and more comprehensive capabilities. For the broader SaaS market, it's another data point confirming that private equity sees consolidation as the path to building defensible, scaled businesses that can compete against entrenched players like Adobe. Watch for Everstone to announce additional acquisitions or partnerships as it works to cement this new platform's position at the center of enterprise digital transformation.",https://charming-card-d91ad3487b.media.strapiapp.com/file_c47186ef9a.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:47.803926

If the case reaches trial, it would become the first non-settlement lawsuit targeting pharma with the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) pathway, normally reserved for mobsters.
Takeda previously agreed to a roughly $2.4 billion settlement with patients allegedly harmed by the drug.
Takeda declined to comment on the active litigation, and Lilly did not respond to an inquiry by the time of publication.
“I feel like it will induce a more open honest conversation with FDA [so drug companies can’t] be accused of any sort of deception,” James said.","A potentially paradigm-changing lawsuit targeting Eli Lilly and Takeda Pharmaceuticals has cleared a major hurdle and could wind up being decided in a courtroom. If the case reaches trial, it would become the first non-settlement lawsuit targeting pharma with the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) pathway, normally reserved for mobsters.

Wisner Baum, which filed the case, is chasing damages as high as $7 billion, alleging that the companies conspired to hide evidence their diabetes drug Actos was linked to a higher risk of bladder cancer to maintain blockbuster profits.

Takeda previously agreed to a roughly $2.4 billion settlement with patients allegedly harmed by the drug. But the law firm is leveraging a financial angle to seek more.

The key allegation being levied by a Minnesota-based union health fund, along with consumers in four states, is that the companies concealed evidence of adverse health risks from the public and the FDA. After the cancer link came to light and the FDA slapped a warning label on Actos in 2011, sales dropped by as much as 80%. Thus, prescriptions received — and paid for — before the warning label was attached led the plaintiffs to pay for more doses than they would have otherwise, said Harrison James, a senior associate attorney at Wisner Baum.

Takeda declined to comment on the active litigation, and Lilly did not respond to an inquiry by the time of publication.

The lawsuit, originally filed in 2014, cleared a major hurdle in November when a federal appeals court allowed the nationwide class action against Takeda and Lilly to move forward. But there are other barriers to clear before it makes it to trial.

The companies recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, which could halt the litigation. An answer is expected this spring, James said. If the Supreme Court declines to hear it, the companies could still attempt to convince a lower court to decertify the case by presenting additional evidence, he said. The case could get a trial date as early as next year. The companies could also decide to settle, but James thinks it’s unlikely.

A broader impact?

If this case goes to trial, the legal fallout could have industrywide implications.

Some experts believe that using the RICO statute substantially increases the risks to drugmakers. In this case, attorneys are seeking what are known as treble damages, allowed under RICO, which triple the amount of compensatory damages.

But while some predicted the case would fling open the floodgates to similar lawsuits against pharma, that hasn’t happened yet, and probably won’t, James said.

“It’s not easy to win under this statute,” he explained.

Part of what could help the plaintiffs succeed in the case is that the alleged fraud was well documented, James added. Among the evidence presented so far were internal company documents and testimony from a safety consultant who said the companies were aware of cancer-related safety signals but didn’t disclose the information publicly.

“It’s a pretty high burden to succeed here. The facts were very, very strong to meet all the elements that we needed,” James said. “It’s not every day that a case like that falls into your lap.”

Even though the outcome may not expose pharma to a high risk of similar lawsuits, James hopes the case will encourage drug companies to be more transparent about risks.

“I feel like it will induce a more open honest conversation with FDA [so drug companies can’t] be accused of any sort of deception,” James said.

The agentic AI proof of concept was built on IBM watsonx Orchestrate and designed to help e&’s employees and auditors access and interpret legal, regulatory, and compliance information. It’s integrated with IBM OpenPages and the broader watsonx portfolio, and is supposed to deliver “clear, traceable responses aligned with enterprise governance requirements.”

IBM’s Client Engineering team led the design and integration, and we’re told it showed off AI capabilities that “move beyond traditional question-and-answer tools, enabling reasoning and action while remaining aligned with e&’s governance, risk, and compliance framework.”

""Folate receptor alpha in ovarian cancer tissue and patient serum is associated with disease burden and treatment outcomes.""","INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 20, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to sofetabart mipitecan (LY4170156) for the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received prior bevacizumab and mirvetuximab soravtansine, if eligible. Sofetabart mipitecan is a novel folate receptor alpha (FRα) antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that uses proprietary linker technology and an exatecan payload.

Breakthrough Therapy designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s).

""Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer remains one of the most challenging settings in gynecologic oncology, with limited treatment options and poor outcomes for patients,"" said Bhavana Pothuri, M.D., professor of Obstetrics/Gynecology and Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health and director of Clinical Trials Office at the Perlmutter Cancer Center. ""The Breakthrough Therapy designation and preliminary clinical data for sofetabart mipitecan across all levels of FRα expression are encouraging and point to its potential as a meaningful treatment option for patients.""

""We are pleased the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for sofetabart mipitecan, reflecting the significant unmet need in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and the promising initial results shown in our Phase 1 study,"" said Jacob Van Naarden, executive vice president, and president of Lilly Oncology and head of corporate business development. ""Building on compelling results generated to date, we've initiated our Phase 3 FRAmework-01 trial with the goal of bringing a potential therapeutic option to patients with advanced ovarian cancer, across all levels of folate receptor expression.""

The FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation is based on encouraging preliminary results from the Phase 1a/b study. Lilly presented initial Phase 1 results at the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting in June and updated data at the 2025 ESMO Congress in October, showing responses at all dose levels and across all FRα expression levels, including in patients who progressed on prior mirvetuximab soravtansine. These initial data also indicate a promising tolerability profile with low rates of interstitial lung disease, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia, and no significant ocular toxicity.

Sofetabart mipitecan recently advanced into the Phase 3 FRAmework-01 study (NCT07213804), a global trial investigating the treatment as a monotherapy in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), and in combination with bevacizumab in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC). Lilly is conducting the FRAmework-01 study in partnership with the European Network for Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT - lead groups GINECO/NOGGO e.V.), the GOG Foundation (GOG), and the Asia-Pacific Gynecologic Oncology Trials Group (APGOT)

About Ovarian Cancer

Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. While most patients initially respond to platinum-based chemotherapy, approximately 70% will experience recurrence, leading to progressively shorter remission periods with each subsequent treatment. When cancer recurs during or within six months of platinum therapy, known as platinum-resistant disease, patients face limited treatment options.

About Sofetabart Mipitecan

Sofetabart mipitecan (LY4170156) is composed of an Fc-silent, folate receptor alpha (FRα) specific humanized monoclonal antibody linked to exatecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, via a proprietary cleavable polysarcosine linker (PSARlink™). Sofetabart mipitecan was designed to target FRα across all expression levels with improved therapeutic index. FRα is a cell-surface glycoprotein encoded by the gene FOLR1 that binds to the essential nutrients folic acid and reduced folates, bringing them into cells to facilitate cell division and growth.1,2 FRα is overexpressed in many solid tumors such as ovarian, non-small cell lung, and colorectal cancers.1,3,4 Sofetabart mipitecan is currently being studied in patients with ovarian cancer as well as other FRα-expressing solid tumors, NCT06400472 and NCT07213804.

Wilson, who still owns about 4.3% of the company's shares, began a proxy campaign in December to nominate three independent directors. Though he isn't seeking a seat himself, he's made it clear that any compromise would require the departure of two long-serving directors including chair David Mussafer, who represents Advent.

For Wilson, the push appears personal as well as strategic. Advent has been tied to Lululemon since its early days, but Wilson has reportedly grown frustrated with the firm's influence and what he views as an uneven record in consumer-focused investments.

A sensitive time for corporate conflicts. Elliott Management, which bought a $1 billion stake in Lululemon, is also courting former Ralph Lauren CEO Jane Nielsen for a leadership post. This has sparked expectations of top-level company changes.

Enterprise Advantage is based on Consulting Advantage, IBM’s internal AI-powered delivery platform, which in turn combines the company’s consulting expertise and workflows used to transform its internal operations.

Consulting Advantage also includes a marketplace that houses industry‑specific AI agents and applications, which has been rolled into Enterprise Advantage.

Analysts say Enterprise Advantage could help enterprises more effectively build and scale agentic and other AI applications across complex, multi-cloud environments because the service is designed to operate independently of specific cloud providers, AI models, or underlying infrastructure.

This approach aligns with the fragmented and heterogeneous IT landscapes most large enterprises already run, as they need to be able to scale AI applications within the constraints of their current IT estates without having to rip and replace any layer or infrastructure, Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research.

Echoing Gogia’s views, Pareekh Jain, principal analyst at Pareekh Consulting, pointed out that large enterprises already have sunk costs in multiple clouds and multiple model choices.

In fact, Jain sees the new service helping enterprises reduce hyperscaler lock-in and offering more flexibility of choice when it comes to choosing a specific cloud vendor or their AI stack for building an agentic or AI application.

Caution for CIOs

The flexibility offered by Enterprise Advantage could have its own set of tradeoffs for CIOs.

While Enterprise Advantage’s cloud‑agnostic pitch does help enterprises avoid getting locked into hyperscaler‑specific agent platforms like AWS Bedrock Agents or Microsoft Copilot Studio, the dependency might shift to the orchestration layer, Jain pointed out.

“If companies build their agent workflows, governance rules, and orchestration logic entirely on IBM’s Enterprise Advantage framework, migrating to another provider later could become just as difficult,” Jain added.

Rather, CIOs should internally evaluate whether their enterprise has the talent and expertise to operate the frameworks and workflows that Enterprise Advantage provides because that’s the only way that they can avoid lock-in at the orchestration and service level, Gogia said.

“If clients simply deploy Enterprise Advantage without building internal muscle, they’ll end up reliant on IBM’s platform for updates, extensions, and compliance maintenance. This could replicate the same old outsourcing trap we’ve seen before,” Gogia added.

In fact, Jain pointed out that enterprises with at least some level of AI maturity should look at adopting the new service.

While firms with very limited AI talent may find a framework-led approach too complex and instead prefer fully managed SaaS solutions, highly tech-native companies tend to build their own orchestration layers to avoid service dependency and retain control, the analyst said.

“The real sweet spot is the enterprise middle, large organizations with capable IT teams but heavy backlogs, where developers can build agents but are slowed by security, governance, and infrastructure hurdles that IBM’s service can help remove,” Jain added. The service has been made generally available.",https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4119056-0-71746000-1768910633-IBM-building.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:42.680841

Ecolab Financial Analysis

Key Takeaways

Ecolab (ECL, Financial) has partnered with CDP to launch the Water Use Efficiency Index, enhancing corporate water usage evaluation.

The company maintains a strong market position in the chemicals industry with a market cap of $78.48 billion.

Financial metrics indicate robust profitability and growth, with a focus on expanding operating margins.

Strategic Alliance and Company Overview

Ecolab (ECL) has entered into a strategic alliance with CDP to introduce the Water Use Efficiency Index. This new benchmark aims to assist companies in evaluating, comparing, and enhancing their water usage performance. By utilizing this index, organizations can gain insights into operational efficiencies and undertake informed measures to improve their environmental impact.

Ecolab Inc. is a global leader in the production and marketing of cleaning and sanitation products for various sectors, including industrial manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare, and life sciences. The company offers a comprehensive range of products and services, such as dish and laundry washing systems, pest control, and infection control products. Ecolab also provides customized water management solutions, reinforcing its stronghold in the U.S. market while expanding internationally.

With a market capitalization of $78.48 billion, Ecolab operates within the Basic Materials sector, specifically in the Chemicals industry. The company's strategic initiatives and robust product offerings position it as a dominant player in its field.

Financial Health Analysis

Ecolab's financial performance reflects its strong market position and operational efficiency. The company reported a revenue of $15.89 billion, with a 3-year revenue growth rate of 7.6%. This growth is supported by a 17.57% operating margin and a 12.49% net margin, indicating effective cost management and profitability.

On the balance sheet front, Ecolab maintains a current ratio of 1.7 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.91, reflecting a stable financial structure. The company's return on equity stands at 21.94%, showcasing its ability to generate returns on shareholder investments.

However, there are warning signs to consider. The Altman Z-Score of 5.25 indicates strong financial health, but insider activity shows mixed signals with recent insider selling.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Ecolab's valuation metrics suggest a premium market position. The company's P/E ratio is 39.81, while the P/S ratio is 4.98, both near historical highs. The P/B ratio of 8.07 also reflects a valuation close to its 3-year high.

Analyst sentiment remains positive, with a target price of $295.13 and a recommendation score of 2.2, indicating a ""Buy"" consensus. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 66.04 suggest the stock is approaching overbought territory.

Institutional ownership is robust at 80.66%, indicating strong confidence from large investors, while insider ownership is relatively low at 1.18%.

Risk Assessment

Ecolab's financial health is supported by a high Piotroski F-Score of 7, indicating a very healthy situation. The Beneish M-Score of -2.51 suggests the company is unlikely to be a manipulator.

Sector-specific risks include potential volatility in raw material prices and regulatory changes impacting the chemicals industry. The company's beta of 1.02 indicates moderate market volatility.

While Ecolab's strategic initiatives and financial metrics are strong, investors should remain vigilant of market conditions and sector-specific risks that could impact future performance.

why don’t i just take a day off?

it’s probably the mix between the love of tapping keys & hijacking minds...

and potential of helping young guys find value they need.

it’s a mix of both.

...which brings me to this...

obsession...

what is obsession...?

sure. everything could go right for you.

why wouldn’t it?

all you do is work/train/study

so, why do you still break promises to yourself?

because you don’t entirely believe it will work out.

you want to be rich, but you don’t believe you can.

honestly, you really don’t.

if you did, nothing could stop you from becoming that.

the mirror only smiles, when you do.

i smile. because i want to.

i really do.

that’s why i wake up with a grin on my face.

because i know it means i get to work on things i take deep interest in.

another day of being the best at everything i do.

& i love it.

thoroughly enjoying every second of the delusional belief that I’m better than my competition.

that’s what i wake up for.

never taking a day off...

there is still so much to get done.

the thought of not having a fully specced out mercedes, a plethora of divine females & a body of a greek god...

brings a spike of anxiety and stress...

yet... most guys won’t achieve it... until 65.

that is... if there are not dead yet.

hellish.

so, what am I so anxious about?

it doesn’t mean i won’t fail.

if i put brakes on. take a slow & steady approach.

they’ll be plenty of mfers who would love to take my spot.

business is a never ending game.

and the number of guys who want to compete with me... only grows.

but, i don’t understand it anymore...

who can compete with someone who treats life as art. obsessed with how every brush stroke brings something new to life...

i simply don’t think you can.

& this is still the reality...

you plant a seed...

the fruit doesn’t flourish overnight.

it only happens after you water it enough, consistently, for a long enough time.

for me, I have to be wired deeply every waking hour.

because I know there is a bunch of hungry pussyboys ready to rise above me...

success might float into the wrong hands. enough said.

listen to this...

if you are anything like me... hellbent to making this work, otherwise what’s the point?

then realistically... what could go wrong?

let me rephrase that...

what could go right?

everything you put in enough effort & time starts working out.

what can you gain?

financial & time freedom, peace beyond understanding, power.

why not you?

you’re a compulsively obsessed artist wired to make it work...

i mean, i don’t see why it can’t be you.

what is the best possible outcome?

i’ll leave this one to you.

but delusion & obsession in itself ain’t enough.

you have to back it up with hard work and consistency.

that’s all it takes...

if you do, your life with chance in the best possible way.

you can have everything you want, and more.

by being obsessed with what you love doing...

you’re totally in. or not.

if you don’t find your fun in being the best at everything possible.

then I guess you’re just not meant for it.

it all comes down to you.

The low-cost Go offering, first launched in India, was made available in the US and other markets around the world beginning on Friday.

Revenue model

Chief executive Sam Altman, who in the past called adverts a “last resort”, said he was “hopeful a business model like this can work”.

The adverts are to appear in a banner-like form at the bottom of the chatbot’s responses, and will be clearly labelled.

The ads are to be related to a user’s prompt, for instance showing an ad about holidays after a query about the topic.

The chatbot’s responses will not be influenced by ads, and the ads will not appear with certain topics such as politics, health or mental health, OpenAI said.

The company said it did not currently have plans to provide data about conversations to advertisers.

Personalised ads

The start-up said it would learn from feedback and refine its ad strategy over time, while allowing users to learn more about why they’re seeing a specific ad, dismiss ads, and submit feedback.

OpenAI currently relies on continuous rounds of private investment to fund its operations, with the Financial Times reporting that it operated at a loss of about $8 billion (£5.98bn) in the first six months of 2025.",https://www.silicon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/OpenAI-logo-displayed-on-a-smartphone.-Image-credit-Unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:12:06.556429

After a long weekend for US investors, attention is back on tariffs, with US President Donald Trump threatening European allies with 10% levies over their refusal to support his desire to take over Greenland.

Trump’s threats, and the possibility of European nations having to retaliate, rattled markets on the other side of the Atlantic Monday. “Higher tariffs from the US and Europe are a destructive way forward,” says Robert Bergqvist, Senior Economist at SEB.

The Greenland dispute adds to the geopolitical noise investors are having to navigate at the start of 2026. At the same time, investors are still waiting for the Supreme Court to weigh in on whether Trump’s use of tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is legal.

“The new tariffs presumably would rely on IEEPA authority, which is what the Supreme Court is reviewing,” says Preston Caldwell, Morningstar’s senior US economist. “If the Supreme Court strikes down IEEPA tariffs, the Trump administration will have to rely on statutory authority, which historically has entailed lengthy process and paperwork. Hence, it would become likely much harder to slap countrywide tariffs on and off for arbitrary reasons.”

Speaking of the Supreme Court, Wednesday will bring oral arguments over whether Trump can remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank. This at a time when investors have grown increasingly wary about Trump’s efforts to influence monetary policy and erode the Fed’s independence.

Big Bank Bumps

Fourth-quarter earnings season is now in full swing, and as investors await earnings from Big Tech in coming weeks, big banks have been in the spotlight. It was a bumpy start, as JPMorgan JPM and BankAmerica BAC stocks took a hit, while Citigroup C shares seesawed.

But it wasn’t necessarily earnings news that was driving the market. Again, it was news out of the White House as Trump proposed a 10% cap on credit card interest rates. As we wrote last week, bank executives and analysts panned the idea, saying it would limit credit availability to lower quality borrowers and hurt profits. As for the key takeaways from the actual earnings reports, the outlook looks pretty decent according to Sean Dunlop, a director at Morningstar who follows the big banks.

Here’s what Dunlop has to say:

2026 is setting up to be another solid year for banks if the current backdrop holds. Asset prices remain high. Interest rates are set to decline modestly, with Morningstar senior US economist Preston Caldwell forecasting two rate cuts in his December outlook, in line with CME estimates. And we expect still-solid 4.4% nominal gross domestic product growth … which in conjunction with a labor market that is weaker (but not dramatically so) looks like a decent setup for banks.

Consumer health looks solid. Credit and debit card spending was up 6%-7% in nominal terms basically across the board for the banks, and consumer health, proxied by charge-offs, was very strong. Barring significant deterioration in the labor market, we’re looking at an environment where sentiment and spending continue to diverge sharply.

Things might really be better at Citi. The bank reported sharply stronger results across segments, with particular improvement in wealth management and the retail bank, but every segment saw returns improve by more than 2.5 percentage points.

Key Earnings This Week

For many investors, the big earnings news is still a week off, when the likes of Microsoft MSFT, Tesla TSLA, and Apple AAPL report. In the meantime, the focus will be on regional banks and other key names.

Regional Banks: Throughout the week, regional banks will report. That includes Zions ZION and US Bancorp USB reporting Tuesday, and Truist TFC on Wednesday. Morningstar equity analyst Maoyuan Chen has this to say about what she will be watching:

Consumer health looks solid. The money center banks that have already reported have shown credit and debit card spending up 6%-7% in nominal terms across the board. Credit costs were mostly stable.

Regional banks’ net interest income will face some headwinds in 2026 from two or three rate cuts from the Fed. How much growth the regional banks can achieve will depend on balance sheet growth. We currently forecast around 3%-4% growth, but we could see bank lending growing faster from more commercial real estate loan growth (a headwind in the past three years) or higher commercial lending growth from a pickup in middle-market M&A deal activity.

2025 was a busy year for bank acquisitions, including deal announcements from PNC-FirstBank, Fifth Third-Comerica, Huntington-Cadence, and Huntington-Veritex. We will be watching out for execution updates on these deals and other regional banks’ appetite for inorganic opportunities.

Airlines: United Airlines UAL reports Wednesday. “With Delta having already reported and showing some softness among the leisure market in the fourth quarter, I’ll be watching how that played out for the other airlines and certainly listening for how their bookings are stacking up so far this year,” says Nicolas Owens, equity analyst at Morningstar. “The industry has returned to a low single-digit growth mode after several big rebound years postpandemic.”

GE Aerospace: Thursday will bring fourth-quarter earnings from GE Aerospace GE, which is up some 77% over the past year, thanks to a rally that began in the spring of 2025. For Owens, “the biggest question is just how their supply chain is holding up, as they have so much demand to meet from Airbus for new engines and from existing engine operators for parts.”

Stock Market Rotation or Another Head Fake?

As we alluded to earlier this month, stock market strategists have predicted 10 of the last two rotations out of tech stocks. Will those forecasts be wrong yet again? So far, 2026 has started off in rotation mode for stocks. It’s visible at the sector level, with tech stocks performing the worst while basic materials are out in front. The rotation can also be seen on a market capitalization basis, as small caps have jumped ahead of large caps.

The REDEFINE-4 trial is a head-to-head comparison of ’s CagriSema versus Eli Lilly’s Zepbound in obese patients without diabetes.
In terms of analyst activity, BMO Capital has reiterated its Outperform rating on Eli Lilly, maintaining a price target of $1,200.
The firm expressed confidence in Eli Lilly’s growing leadership in the obesity treatment market, projecting strength into 2026 and beyond.
These developments indicate Eli Lilly’s active engagement in strategic growth and competitive positioning within the pharmaceutical sector.","Investing.com - Morgan Stanley has reiterated an Overweight rating and $1,290.00 price target on ahead of upcoming REDEFINE-4 Phase 3 obesity trial data. The pharmaceutical giant, currently trading at $1,038.40 with a market cap of nearly $930 billion, has delivered impressive 44% returns over the past year and maintains a PEG ratio of just 0.42, indicating attractive valuation relative to growth.

The REDEFINE-4 trial is a head-to-head comparison of ’s CagriSema versus Eli Lilly’s Zepbound in obese patients without diabetes. The 84-week trial features a flexible dosing design allowing physicians to adjust dosage based on tolerability and weight loss outcomes.

Morgan Stanley outlines three potential scenarios from the trial results. In their base case, CagriSema shows similar efficacy and tolerability to Zepbound, which would likely have limited impact on Eli Lilly shares. According to InvestingPro data, analysts maintain a bullish consensus on LLY with a rating of 1.7 (where 1 is Strong Buy), with targets ranging from $770 to $1,500.

A bull case for Novo Nordisk would involve CagriSema demonstrating statistical superiority with similar tolerability, potentially causing a low-to-mid single-digit percentage decline in Eli Lilly shares. However, Morgan Stanley notes mitigating factors including Eli Lilly’s broad diabesity portfolio with next-generation options Eloralintide and Retatrutide, and potential supply chain limitations for CagriSema.

A bull case for Eli Lilly would emerge if CagriSema shows inferior efficacy or worse tolerability compared to Zepbound, which could drive Eli Lilly shares up by a low single-digit percentage.

In other recent news, Eli Lilly’s earnings and revenue results have not been highlighted, but the company is making significant moves in the industry. Eli Lilly is reportedly preparing a €15 billion offer to acquire French biotech company , although a formal offer has yet to be submitted to Abivax’s board. This potential acquisition could bolster Eli Lilly’s portfolio. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has delayed its decision on Eli Lilly’s weight-loss pill until April 10, pushing back from the expected late-March timeline. This drug was part of the FDA’s fast-track review program, intended for drugs critical to public health or national security.

10 stocks we like better than Walmart ›

Economists aren't sure what will happen with the U.S. and global economies. Certain prognosticators see a weakening domestic labor market as an indicator that economic growth will slow, and forecast a recession will soon be upon us.

However, even if it doesn't occur in 2026, at some point, the U.S. will enter a recession. That will undoubtedly hurt stock prices.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

But not all companies, and hence stock prices, will be affected the same way during a slowdown. While many retailers' sales have already been hurt by consumers stressed by higher prices and an uncertain job market, how will venerable retailer Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) fare?

Understanding the business

Walmart consists of its namesake stores around the world and a membership warehouse club, Sam's Club. The U.S. Walmart business makes up most of the company's revenue.

Opening its first retail store in the early 1960s, Walmart has mastered the art of charging low prices to customers. In fact, shoppers would be hard-pressed to find lower prices. Walmart does this by keeping an extremely tight rein on costs.

It also makes technology investments to keep up with competitors, including behemoth online retailer Amazon. These tend to focus on making shopping at Walmart more convenient, such as same-day pickup and delivery. Most of this year's capital expenditures went toward supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, and other technology.

Management's focus on low prices and convenience continues to resonate with customers. The Walmart U.S. division's fiscal third-quarter same-store sales (comps) increased 4.5%. Higher traffic contributed 1.8 percentage points, and increased spending accounted for the balance. The period ended on Oct. 31, 2025.

Management stated that it drew higher-income consumers during the quarter. This also happened during the Great Recession as the wealthier demographic sought bargains. I believe Walmart's low prices will continue to drive shoppers during the next economic downturn.

Rich valuation

Shareholders have done well by investing in Walmart's stock. The shares gained 31.2% over the past year through Jan. 14, outpacing the S&P 500 index's 19%.

The company's past success has created high expectations for future growth. Walmart's stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 42, compared to 37 a year ago. It also sells at a richer valuation than the overall market, with the S&P 500 trading at a P/E multiple of 31.

However, given the company's success, ability to succeed in all kinds of economic environments, including recessions, and its investment to keep it ahead of the competition, I believe a higher multiple is warranted.

That's why I'd be willing to pay up for Walmart's shares.

Its requirements are forcing a reckoning with enterprise architecture that supply chain leaders can no longer ignore.

Moving past the hype cycle, agentic AI is entering widespread adoption. According to the 2025 Gartner “Market Guide for PLM Software in Discrete Manufacturing Industries,” this year, more than 80% of PLM vendors will incorporate AI capabilities into their platforms, compared with less than 40% in 2025. Here’s what that stat doesn’t capture: agentic AI doesn’t just add features to existing systems. It fundamentally changes what software delivers.

Why standalone systems can't compete

Consider a typical scenario facing supply chain executives today. A critical component supplier announces a 30% tariff-driven price increase. Someone manually pulls procurement data, cross-references engineering specs in PLM, checks ERP inventory, reviews CRM customer commitments, and attempts to reconcile everything in spreadsheets. Days turn to weeks. Margins erode while leadership has to wait to see the complete picture.

No amount of better workflows or skilled analysts solves this. It's an architecture problem. Standalone systems rarely communicate in real time. They create data islands requiring human intermediaries to bridge gaps. Implementing Agentic AI exposes this limitation with brutal clarity.

Unlike generative AI that responds to prompts, agentic AI can take autonomous action within defined parameters. An agent optimizing supply chain decisions needs simultaneous access to engineering data, quality records, supplier performance, customer commitments, and financial constraints. If that data lives in five disconnected systems, the agent’s ability to function is compromised. It's like hiring an expert operations manager but only allowing them to look at one system per day.

The connected intelligence requirement

This coming generation of AI agents won't live inside individual applications. They'll coordinate across entire ecosystems, turning fragmented processes into intelligent networks. Software platforms extending data across enterprises will dominate while isolated tools fade.

Consider predictive inventory management. An effective agent, or group of agents across apps analyze demand patterns, component availability, supplier lead times, quality results, and customer forecasts. When shortages appear, it triggers procurement workflows, alerts production planning, notifies affected customers, and recommends alternative sourcing.

This orchestration requires connected data and integrated workflows across the supply chain and tech stack which standalone software can’t deliver. Manufacturers with integrated data significantly reduce development cycles because agents access comprehensive, connected data rather than siloed information. When systems no longer operate in isolation, time-to-market improvements scale with agents automatically cross-referencing engineering changes with supplier capacity, regulatory requirements, production schedules, and customer delivery commitments.

The infrastructure mistake executives make

However, this connected intelligence creates a dangerous misconception. Some executives see AI agents performing sophisticated analysis and assume the agents themselves are the solution, that powerful AI can simply work around fragmented systems. If the agent is smart enough, why invest in expensive platform integration?

Here's why that thinking fails.

Having implemented legacy systems for manufacturers during my Accenture years, I've seen what happens when companies chase technology without infrastructure foundations. Agents without structured systems are like a Formula 1 car with no track to race on. The car is impressive, but without guardrails, you're headed for disaster.

The platform provides those guardrails, enforcing the business rules, compliance requirements, and process controls that agents need to operate safely. This is especially critical in supply chain operations where regulatory compliance and audit trails aren't optional. Consider a manufacturer with a decade of supplier quality inspection records. An agent analyzing historical data might notice a compliance field completed less than 50% of the time without business impact. Based on this pattern, the agent determines the field is unimportant and stops prompting for completion.

But what if that field is an FDA reporting requirement that hasn't been audited yet? The moment inspection occurs, missing data becomes a compliance violation shutting down your entire supply chain. A proper platform enforces which fields are mandatory for agents, regardless of historical patterns. The agent becomes incredibly effective once it understands which processes are non-negotiable.

The governance reality

Can your current systems automatically control which AI agents access proprietary supplier agreements or customer pricing? If not, you're not ready for agentic AI at scale. Just as companies have focused on user access, least privilege and protecting confidential and PII data for their employees, the same regimen needs to be applied for agents.

Enterprise platforms provide the governance structure agents desperately need. Without it, you face two bad options: you can't enforce permissions at all, or you spend enormous effort manually recreating permissions in AI models. When permissions inevitably change, agents access data they shouldn't, or make decisions based on outdated rules.

When an auditor asks for the decision trail on a supplier change that impacted customer deliveries, you need more than ""the AI agent handled it."" You need documented processes, approval workflows, and clear accountability. This is what robust platforms deliver, and it's non-negotiable in supply chain operations.

Real business value emerges when supply chain data flows seamlessly across PLM, ERP, procurement, and logistics through a unified backbone. Agents can then conduct the predictive analysis and autonomous coordination that supply chain executives expect, identifying which products tariffs affect before margins erode, determining which parts need alternate sourcing before shortages hit, and adjusting production schedules when supplier capacity shifts.

The partnership imperative

Successful agentic AI demands a partnership between intelligence and infrastructure. Agents, guided by humans, provide the decision-making layer; enterprise platforms provide the operational foundation. Neither works effectively without the other in supply chain environments where speed, accuracy, and compliance determine success.

The manufacturers and supply chain organizations that recognize this interdependence now will build sustainable competitive advantages. Those that chase AI without addressing their fragmented system architecture will watch competitors pull ahead while they manage unreliable automation built on unstable foundations.

Longevity is no longer just a buzzword in 2025: it’s the beauty industry’s most radical shift in branding. The era of conventional anti-ageing fixes has given way to a new generation of consumers seeking precision skincare powered by biotechnology and wellness science. From AI-driven personalisation to next-generation delivery systems, these are the breakthroughs shaping a new wave of skin-longevity products.

When Estée Lauder shared its latest skin-longevity science at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) last year, the focus wasn’t only on showcasing a single product launch, amazing as the Platinum 6D Black Diamond Eye Cream was. The company was signalling a new era in science-backed rejuvenation – and in this case, the science was in sirtuin age-reversal technology.

The company spent more than 15 years researching sirtuin proteins, the skin’s essential longevity regulators that activate key restorative pathways to delay and even reverse visible signs of ageing in as little as 14 days. Since 2023, the brand has supported a multi-year programme with the Stanford Center on Longevity, using cross-disciplinary research on aesthetics, vitality and ageing to inform its broader skin-longevity platform. In Asia, it’s also rolled out education initiatives to familiarise consumers with the science of skin longevity.

This age-reversal technology now anchors Estée Lauder’s prestigious Re-Nutriv collection, infused with the brand’s patented SIRTIVITY-LP complex. Featured in hero products such as the Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliance Soft Crème and the Ultimate Diamond Age Reversal Eye Crème, SIRTIVITY-LP targets a novel longevity pathway through NF-κB inhibition, curbing the cellular cascade of oxidative stress, protein degradation and damage that leads to loss of elasticity and firmness. The result: skin that not only appears revitalised but operates with the resilience of youth.

L’Oréal, too, is staking a bold claim on the skin-longevity frontier. At last year’s Viva Technology conference in Paris, the group presented its latest breakthroughs as part of a new Longevity Integrative Science blueprint, positioning itself less as a cosmetics house and more as a beauty-tech powerhouse that’s now strongly invested in how skin behaves over time.

Moving away from corrective anti-ageing care to proactive longevity care is part of L’Oréal’s master framework. At Viva Technology, L’Oréal debuted its Wheel of Longevity, which decodes skin biological ageing, identifies nine interconnected hallmarks of ageing and, using its proprietary Longevity AI Cloud, translates the data into actionable care.

L’Oréal’s biggest breakthrough is probably in the Cell BioPrint, a “lab-on-a-chip” device that was created with NanoEntek, using microfluidics and proteomics to read skin biomarkers from a simple tape strip to calculate biological skin age, inflammation, skin moisture levels and sensitivity to actives such as retinol in five minutes. Marketed under its luxury brand Lancôme, the device can effectively bring longevity analytics to the beauty counter and offer consumers essential information about their own skin needs.

Beyond the store, Lancôme’s Rénergie Nano-ResurfacER 400 Booster is billed as the next generation tech-powered device developed for at-home use. The device, which is powered by patented nanochip technology, is designed to boost topical penetration into the stratum corneum, the skin’s outermost layer, amplifying the Rénergie H.C.F. Triple Serum’s performance to its fullest. It’s a tool inspired by micro- needling, but designed to be perfectly safe Shiseido’s Future Solution FX line for at-home use with no pain and no down-time at all.

Shiseido’s use of its LonGenevity Complex and the Enmei Herb in its Future Solution LX line is irrefutable proof that the group also belongs in the skin-longevity conversation. LonGenevity Complex is Shiseido’s core technology, and is an exclusive blend of four key elements including the Enmei Herb, vitamin C, green tea and Skingenecell 1P, a proprietary amino- acid derivative. Shiseido had spent decades studying the Enmei Herb, found only on sacred mountains, such as Japan’s mounts Ibuki and Koya, and has historically been linked with longevity and healing. The resulting complex enables skin to be optimised at any age by reinforcing its barrier function, improving brightness, plumpness and smoothness so that skin behaves more like younger skin over time.

Moreover, Shiseido’s broader research and development emphasises health-span science, resulting in the Beauty Alive Circulation Check to uncover our true skin health. Without contacting the skin, the device uses dual cameras to analyse both its surface and the micro-circulation underneath, capturing RGB images and thermal data to evaluate the overall balance of radiance, resilience and smoothness. For its innovation and inclusivity, the device won Shiseido the CES Innovation Award last year.

Taking inspiration from fitness trackers, AmorePacific is claiming its place in the realm of skin longevity with Skinsight, which tracks the micro-shifts in the skin’s health, anticipating problems before they even surface. Co-developed with researchers at MIT, the sensor patch can detect micrometre-level changes in skin tightness, while also measuring UV and blue-light exposure, temperature and moisture, turning skin science into a live data field instead of a static snapshot. The data is then fed and analysed by an AI engine, with the results readily accessible through an AI-powered mobile app. In an era when skincare routines are increasingly becoming personalised, this innovation is truly game-changing – which is why it’s winning an Innovation Award at the forthcoming CES 2026. And while the technology hasn’t yet arrived on the market, it’s being utilised internally, with the research already being used to substantiate the efficacy of Amorepacific’s luxury-brand products, including Sulwhasoo’s signature First Care Activating Serum.

La Prairie has talked about cellular rejuvenation long before skin longevity was a thing. The Swiss brand isn’t just into longevity, but haute longevity science. In recent years, La Prairie and Clinique La Prairie have effectively built a closed ecosystem in which the clinic develops medical-rate lifespan science, while the skincare house translates its research into products such as the new Life Matrix collection, tying daily skincare back to the brand’s original cellular-therapy heritage on Lake Geneva.

Powered by the Exclusive Matrix Complex, the Life Matrix Haute Rejuvenation Cream nurtures skin longevity from the core, working on four levels of the Skin Longevity Matrix to amplify youth, balance optimisation, make the skin resilient and improve the skin’s appearance. La Prairie’s scientists were able to identify more than 18,000 biomolecules in young and aged epidermal cells and successfully reset 394 of them with its Exclusive Matrix Complex, restoring them to a younger state and proving the cream’s potency. Science has never been more fascinating – and in the hands of the world’s leading beauty titans, it’s rapidly rewriting what skin longevity looks like, one breakthrough bottle and biometric at a time.",https://images.prestigeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/08155652/forever-young.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:11:51.836627

ID45,U.S. Bank,2026-01-20 09:18:31+00:00,AskTraders.com,US Bancorp Stock (USB) Finely Positioned Ahead of Earnings - What To Expect,Asktraders News Team,,,,,https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/us-bancorp-stock-usb-finely-positioned-ahead-of-earnings-what-to-expect/,"The question is whether management can articulate a path to sustaining earnings growth in 2026 that supports current valuation levels.

Consensus Estimates Consensus EPS of $1.12 sits at the midpoint of the $1.09 to $1.16 range, with estimate momentum turning positive over the past 30 days.
Fourth-quarter revenue at $7.18B would imply full-year growth near the upper end of guidance, assuming prior quarters’ results hold.
Similarly, strong reported results paired with cautious 2026 guidance would likely produce a negative reaction despite a fourth-quarter beat.","U.S. Bancorp reports fourth-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday, January 20 before market open. Markets are now looking for clues as to whether the ~50% rally in the USB stock price off April’s low will be supported by operational performance, rather than multiple expansion.

Trading at $54.50 leading in to the print, USB is positioned at a pivotal level, with a potential breakout above resistance, or a breakdown to support on the cards.

Wall Street consensus for the print sits at $1.12 EPS and $7.18B revenue, representing 8.7% and 5.1% year-over-year growth respectively. The setup creates asymmetric risk: the stock now trades at 12.5x earnings, a full valuation that leaves little room for disappointment on either reported results or forward guidance.

The quarter also marks the first reporting period following USB’s completion of the BTIG acquisition, adding capital markets capabilities but introducing integration risk that the market has viewed skeptically. With estimates revised upward by $0.01 over the past 30 days and four analysts raising projections in the past week, the Street is incrementally believing the improved run-rate signaled by third-quarter results. The question is whether management can articulate a path to sustaining earnings growth in 2026 that supports current valuation levels.

What the result will determine is whether USB’s transition from defensive cost-cutting to growth-oriented strategy can deliver on elevated expectations. The bank’s third-quarter beat, driven by record net revenue of $7.33B and EPS of $1.22, established a higher baseline. Fourth-quarter execution at or slightly above consensus may not be sufficient if guidance or commentary suggests the third-quarter strength represented peak performance rather than a sustainable trajectory.

Consensus Estimates

Consensus EPS of $1.12 sits at the midpoint of the $1.09 to $1.16 range, with estimate momentum turning positive over the past 30 days. Eight analysts raised projections in the past month, contributing to a $0.01 upward revision. Revenue expectations of $7.18B imply sequential deceleration from third-quarter’s $7.33B record, though year-over-year growth of 5.1% would still exceed the company’s full-year guidance midpoint of 4%. The estimate distribution suggests the Street is modeling modest sequential pullback from third-quarter strength rather than sustained acceleration.

The gap between consensus and management’s full-year revenue growth target of 3–5% is narrowing. Fourth-quarter revenue at $7.18B would imply full-year growth near the upper end of guidance, assuming prior quarters’ results hold. The key risk is whether management reaffirms or tightens this range for 2026, as any signal of deceleration below 4% growth could pressure the stock despite a fourth-quarter beat.

Management Guidance and Commentary

“We are focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth of 3 to 5 percent annually while maintaining our commitment to operating leverage and efficiency improvements.”

Management’s full-year revenue growth target of 3–5%, reiterated through the first three quarters of 2025, established a framework that consensus has consistently tested. The midpoint of 4% annual growth implies quarterly revenue in the $7.0B to $7.3B range, depending on seasonality. Fourth-quarter consensus of $7.18B sits comfortably within this band, but the market is now looking for confirmation that 2026 can sustain similar growth without relying on one-time tailwinds.

The third-quarter commentary highlighted fee revenue growth and positive operating leverage as core drivers, with management emphasizing the durability of the payments, wealth, and capital markets businesses. The BTIG acquisition, completed in late 2025, was framed as a strategic addition to fee-generating capabilities rather than a transformative deal. Investor skepticism around the acquisition centers on whether integration costs will offset near-term earnings accretion and whether the capital deployed could have generated higher returns through buybacks.

The gap between guidance and consensus is minimal on revenue but undefined on EPS, as management has not provided quarterly EPS targets. The Street’s $1.12 EPS estimate implies margin expansion and operating leverage, which aligns with management’s stated priorities. The risk is that deposit pricing pressures or BTIG integration costs compress margins, causing EPS to undershoot even if revenue meets expectations. Management’s tone on net interest margin trajectory and expense run-rate will be as important as the reported numbers.

Analyst Price Targets & Ratings

Wall Street maintains a constructive view with 82% of analysts rating shares a Buy or Strong Buy. The consensus target of $60.80 implies 11.6% upside from current levels, though this reflects the stock’s recent rally compressing the upside potential. The absence of any Sell ratings suggests analysts view the current valuation as supportable, though the concentration in Hold ratings indicates some caution about near-term momentum.

Sector & Peer Comparison

U.S. Bancorp trades at 12.5x trailing earnings and 11.1x forward earnings, positioning it near the middle of its regional bank peer group. The forward multiple sits between PNC Financial’s 11.8x and Truist’s 10.7x, suggesting the market is pricing USB at a modest premium to lower-quality peers but below PNC’s valuation. The 27.6% profit margin leads most regional peers and trails only Fifth Third’s 28.4%, reflecting USB’s historical focus on operational efficiency.

Earnings Track Record

U.S. Bancorp has beaten EPS estimates in 14 of the past 15 quarters, establishing a 93.3% beat rate with an average surprise of 3.4%. The third-quarter 2025 result represented the strongest upside in the period, with a 9.9% beat driven by record revenue and margin expansion. The pattern shows consistent execution on profitability even when top-line results have occasionally disappointed the Street, as in second-quarter 2025 when revenue came in below expectations despite an EPS beat.

Post-Earnings Price Movement History

Historical post-earnings price movement shows an average next-day decline of 0.6%, with the same negative average on beats. The pattern reveals that EPS beats alone have not been sufficient to drive positive reactions, particularly when revenue or guidance disappoints. Third-quarter 2025’s 9.9% EPS beat was followed by a 2.3% stock decline, likely due to concerns about sustainability of the record revenue print or lack of explicit upward guidance revision.

Expected Move & Implied Volatility

The options market is pricing an expected move of approximately 3.2%, or a range of $52.76 to $56.24, based on at-the-money straddle pricing. Implied volatility of roughly 22% sits modestly above 30-day historical volatility of 19%, suggesting the market sees slightly elevated uncertainty around the event but not extreme risk. The implied move aligns with USB’s historical average absolute post-earnings move, indicating options traders are not pricing for a major surprise in either direction.

Expert Predictions & What to Watch

Key Outlook: Guidance Will Drive the Trade

The fourth-quarter setup presents balanced risk. On one hand, USB’s consistent beat record and positive estimate revisions suggest the company is likely to exceed $1.12 EPS. On the other, the stock’s valuation expansion means the bar for a positive reaction is higher than the bar for simply beating estimates. The market is no longer rewarding small beats without forward confirmation of earnings power, as evidenced by the third-quarter result where a 9.9% EPS beat still produced a 2.3% stock decline.

Key Metrics to Watch

The five metrics above represent the critical data points that will determine whether USB can sustain its valuation premium. Net interest margin and fee income are the primary drivers of top-line performance, while credit provisions signal asset quality trends. BTIG integration progress addresses the market’s skepticism around capital allocation, and 2026 guidance provides the forward visibility necessary to support a 12.5x earnings multiple.

Investors should focus on the interplay between these metrics rather than any single number. A scenario where NIM expands but fee income disappoints would raise questions about business mix quality. Similarly, strong reported results paired with cautious 2026 guidance would likely produce a negative reaction despite a fourth-quarter beat. The market is demanding both execution and confidence in forward trajectory.",https://www.asktraders.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Depositphotos_69820815_s-2019.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 08:59:56.335458

Recent data highlights the urgency of this shift. According to research from the Interactive Advertising Bureau, attribution accuracy has plummeted by approximately 40% since the introduction of Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, with roughly 75% of users opting out of tracking.

This ‘measurement gap’ is not merely a technical glitch; it represents a fundamental breakdown in the performance-heavy media models that have dominated corporate strategy. As Google prepares for the eventual deprecation of third-party cookies, the mechanisms that once powered digital advertising are vanishing.

Building sustainable brand equity

For many years, brand building was dismissed on quarterly earnings calls as ‘unmeasurable’ or ‘old-fashioned,’ in favour of the immediate gratification of cost-per-acquisition (CPA) metrics. Yet, evidence is mounting that branding is the only sustainable path forward in a privacy-first world.

A longitudinal study of e-commerce brands found that companies that maintained a balanced approach, investing in both brand and performance, achieved a 23% higher customer lifetime value (CLV) than those focused solely on short-term activation.

While performance marketing is effective at harvesting existing demand, brand marketing creates the demand in the first place. Without the latter, the addressable market shrinks, and the cost of ""harvesting"" through performance channels becomes unsustainably expensive.

The 60:40 rule

The question for the modern executive is no longer if they should invest in brand, but how much. Influential analysis of the IPA Databank suggests a ‘60:40’ rule: 60% of the budget should be allocated to long-term brand building, and 40% to short-term performance activation.

However, global research from firms like Kantar suggests that this ratio must be nuanced by industry:

FMCG and high frequency: Brands with short purchase cycles often skew toward performance (roughly 55:45) to capture immediate intent.

Considered purchases: In sectors such as financial services and automotive, the ratio often swings toward 70:30 in favour of the brand. In these categories, a brand must remain in the ""consideration set"" for months or years before a purchase intent ever emerges.

Mass media returns

As digital attribution becomes less reliable, traditional mass media, television, radio, and out-of-home (OOH), are seeing a strategic resurgence. Research from Yellowwood across dozens of brands indicates that these channels consistently deliver more substantial long-term ROI than previously credited through digital-only measurement. While digital channels remain excellent for short-term activation, their impact on long-term brand equity is often negligible.

This shift requires a change in executive mindset. Strategic judgement must once again take precedence over ""precision"" data that is increasingly flawed. Marketing departments built entirely around last-click attribution and immediate conversion metrics must now restructure to value metrics that unfold over quarters and years, rather than weeks.

The ‘pendulum’ is not swinging back to brand because performance marketing has failed, but because the ecosystem that allowed performance-only strategies to thrive is collapsing.

Get C-Suite buy-in

For CMOs to drive genuine business revenue and contribute to broader economic growth, they must secure board-level buy-in for three critical shifts:

Accepting imperfection: Recognise that 100% measurement precision is a myth in the current privacy landscape.

Lengthening horizons: Secure permission to measure success over years, ensuring the brand is ""planted"" well before it is ""harvested.""

Future-proofing infrastructure: Invest in first-party data and measurement tools that will survive the death of the cookie and the rise of privacy-first operating systems.

If implemented, US brands could see their European retail prices rise by 15 to 20 percent almost overnight.","As if the European fashion industry did not have enough on its plate already in view of rapid geopolitical shifts, impending regulation and environmental unpredictability, US president Donald Trump added to its woes this weekend: Eight countries supporting Greenland’s sovereignty - Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and UK - are facing an additional 10 percent tariff on “any and all goods” from 1st February, to be raised to 25 percent on 1st June.

The fashion industry has reacted with a mix of alarm and strategic exhaustion. While some executives are simply waiting for another TACO moment (Trump Always Chickens Out) and a subsequent U-turn, others are hoping for a favourable ruling from the US Supreme Court on the tariff’s legality. Retailers have warned of an immediate 10 to 15 percent price hike on European imports like French leather, Italian silk or British wool.

Industry voices between ‘wait and watch’ and worry

“While luxury giants may be able to overcome another seismic shift, there is a fear that smaller independent designers will not survive... Aspirational shoppers are expected to be priced out,” commented Helen Brocklebank, CEO of the UK’s official body for luxury goods, Walpole, according to The Guardian.

“These tariffs will be yet another burden for businesses across our country... The use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong,” stated UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer when asked about the sentiment of British heritage brands and the UK’s luxury sector according to Yahoo News.

“European designers could end up selling mostly in Europe; American designers could sell mostly in America. This could set the industry back 50 years,” said industry analyst and CEO of Tomorrow London Limited Stefano Martinetto when commenting on the potential for a complete breakdown of transatlantic fashion trade according to The Guardian.

How are luxury groups adjusting?

Luxury giant LVMH is taking a cautious, multi-tiered approach due to its 23 percent revenue exposure to the US market. According to analysts from Morgan Stanley, while LVMH usually has high pricing power, the luxury conglomerate that is home to brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Bulgari and others can only partially offset these tariffs. In line with the fear voiced by Brocklebank, there is a risk of squeezing middle-income (aspirational) consumers who have already been hit by the inflation.

Throughout January, LVMH has been rushing shipments of leather goods and perfumes to US warehouses to beat the deadline of 1st February. Experts suggest there could be selective price hikes of 8 to 12 percent on core items like the Louis Vuitton Speedy or Dior Lady Bag toward the end of the first quarter.

French luxury group Kering, owner of brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and others, is in a more vulnerable position as it works to turnaround the Gucci brand. Unlike LVMH, Kering is more likely to absorb a portion of the tariff cost rather than passing 100 percent of it to the consumer, fearing that a price spike could stall Gucci's recovery.

The luxury giant is reportedly looking at harmonising global prices — raising prices in Europe and Asia slightly while keeping US increases moderate — to discourage US tourists from doing all their shopping in European metropolises to avoid tariff-inflated domestic prices.

French luxury brand Hermès has signalled that it would likely pass the full cost of the tariffs directly to its US clientele, thus banking on ultra-high-net-worth individuals who are on waitlists for Kelly and Birkin bags to accept a 10 to 25 percent “Greenland Surcharge.”

Many CEOs of luxury brands are currently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, attempting to lobby for a “Luxury Exemption” similar to those granted in previous trade disputes. However, if no deal is reached by 1st February, the first wave of price increases would likely appear on US e-commerce sites by mid-month.

What does this mean for US brands?

In view of the European Union currently favouring a “tit-for-tat” escalation and moving away from its usual diplomatic restraint, a subsequent “Trade Bazooka” could mean the EU retaliating with a package of measures targeting US-made clothing and denim and thus iconic American brands such as Nike, Ralph Lauren, Levi Strauss and others.

If implemented, US brands could see their European retail prices rise by 15 to 20 percent almost overnight. This would likely lead to a re-routing strategy, where they attempt to ship goods through non-targeted EU countries like Spain or Italy.",https://r.fashionunited.com/w-nu7ix2QLPDBb4SAcpCLJPAJ7MGCUClsEmLJuDyXsU/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjYvMDEvMjAvZWFnbGUtdnMtYnVsbC1haS02YjVqeW9jbi0yMDI2LTAxLTIwLnBuZw.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 05:01:36.463598

Finally, the long-awaited day is almost here.

After years of hedging and will-they-won’t-they speculation regarding the launch of a ChatGPT ads model, OpenAI announced on Friday that it’s going to begin testing ads within its main AI chatbot for users in the US. The ads will only appear in ChatGPT’s free and Go tiers (the latter being its lowest-cost subscription option, introduced as an option for US customers the same day).

Fidji Simo, CEO of Applications at OpenAI, is adamant that paid ads won’t affect product recommendations that ChatGPT deems “objectively useful,” nor will users’ data and conversations be sold to advertisers, per the announcement.

Simply put, OpenAI wants to assure users that “ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives [them].”

There’s a lot of certainty about what the ad business won’t look like.

But what, exactly, it will look like isn’t set in stone. (And we all know Sam Altman’s take on ads is famously inconsistent.)

For now, ads will exist at the bottom of ChatGPT feed and be clearly identified and separate from the organic recommendation. And the first ads will be part of a test, not a national rollout.

Still, whether you frame it as OpenAI stepping aboard its rocket ship or beginning a descent down the world’s slipperiest slope, it’s the beginning of something important.

Riding The Tube

OpenAI isn’t the only company with earth-moving advertising news from late last week.

Soon, the BBC will announce a content deal with YouTube to produce bespoke programs for the Google platform, the Financial Times reports. According to the FT, the content BBC will be producing for YouTube will counter misinformation and disinformation on the platform.

But the announcement (when it comes) is a major departure for the BBC, which in the UK does not collect ad revenue, even from content it distributes on third-party platforms.

The broadcaster also has a reputation for prioritizing its first-party assets, the iPlayer streaming platform and two traditional TV channels.

Some older BBC series may be available now on YouTube, too, though that wasn’t central to the deal, one source tells the FT.

On Principal

The times, they are a-changing.

Because ways of doing business that once would have crossed a line in the sand for marketers are now standard, accepted ways of working together.

For one, there’s the old marketing mantra that an agency or media company shouldn’t “grade its own homework.”

Some marketers still repeat the line. But when they speak with their budgets, which accrue to walled gardens, it’s clearly an antiquated notion.

Last week, the CPG data seller SPINS, which has in-store sales and share-of-shelf info, acquired the commerce-focused ad tech company MikMak. Not so long ago, these marketing functions were supposed to be separate. Now, marketers want those functions under one roof.

Another example is principal-based buying, which involves agencies buying and repackaging inventory to clients at undisclosed margins. Principal-based buying has in a few short years gone from an illicit practice discussed in hushed, abashed whispers to a de facto part of how big agencies operate.

“Marketers are looking for cost relief, agencies are looking for margin, and publishers are looking for sales and revenue,” Forrester’s VP and senior agency analyst Jay Pattisall tells Digiday. “The mechanism of arbitrage and principal media enables you to meet all of those considerations.”

It’s within this context that the 8th Annual Shopper, Retailer & Category Insights Conference returns to London on 12th February, offering a focused look at the trends, technologies and behaviours shaping the year ahead.

This year’s event gathers senior voices from Diageo, Deliveroo, The Coca-Cola Company, Sainsbury’s, Holland & Barrett, Kraft Heinz, AO, Barilla Group, Church & Dwight, Medik8, and others, offering a clear, practical lens on how brands can preserve value, build relevance and deliver growth in a price sensitive market.

Inflation, loyalty pressure and the value equation

The morning opens with sessions addressing the economic pressures driving 2026 strategy. With shoppers increasingly switching to private labels, cutting basket sizes and prioritising value over loyalty, Diageo’s Diego Infante will outline how brands can balance affordability with margin protection while sustaining trust.

His emphasis on “smart promotions, not more promotions” is likely to resonate. As promotional fatigue grows and activation budgets tighten, precision and timing are emerging as critical capability gaps.

Central Co-op’s Charlotte Castille builds on this by examining how brands can set price points that protect equity while limiting down-trading. The discussion includes which segments are most vulnerable and how pack formats, innovation and sustainability now influence retention.

Influence, hybrid journeys and non-linear behaviour

The Consumer Behaviours panel - featuring Deliveroo, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz and AO - explores how shoppers now navigate fragmented, non-linear journeys. Influence -led discovery continues to shape purchase decisions, creating a new competitive environment where credibility must be established instantly.

RTIH readers will recognise the relevance of this shift. With journeys spanning social platforms, marketplaces, brand sites and physical stores, the panel looks at how brands can maintain consistent value messaging and ensure personalisation stays helpful rather than intrusive.

AI moves from theory to operational reality

AI underpins much of this year’s programme. Holland & Barrett CFO Vineta Bajaj will highlight how AI can decode behaviour, forecast category shifts and unify data previously siloed across CRM, e-commerce, loyalty and in-store systems.

The focus is firmly on practical application — how to shift AI from insight generation to activation. With just under half of purchases expected to be influenced by AI agents by 2030*, organisational capability, governance and privacy safeguards are becoming increasingly central.

Retailer collaboration: from legacy KPIs to performance led ecosystems

Diageo’s Efrain Rosario leads the discussion on modern retailer-supplier partnerships, exploring how physical experiences, real-time orchestration and shared data are reshaping value creation. As the sector moves beyond impressions and traditional volume KPIs, outcome-led collaboration is becoming the new standard.

Private label dynamics and brand defence strategies

Private label penetration continues to accelerate. The conference offers two perspectives - from Church & Dwight and AO - on how national brands can defend their position through innovation, trust-building and clear communication.

Rather than treating private label purely as a threat, the discussion examines how national brands can complement retailer value strategies while maintaining distinctive equity.

Retail media, omnichannel performance and measurable ROI

The Retail Media panel - featuring TRIP and Barilla Group - tackles fragmentation across RMNs, TikTok Shop, YouTube and emerging formats. Measurement, duplication and incrementality remain friction points, and the session promises grounded guidance on what effective investment looks like in 2026.

Later sessions delve into omnichannel performance, sustainability and scalable personalisation, with contributions from Sainsbury’s, Medik8, Currys, Objkts Jewelry, The INKEY List and flaconi. Together, they highlight the operational realities of delivering consistency across channels, managing regulatory shifts and applying AI to unify shopper views.

A strategic snapshot of retail’s next chapter

Across inflation, consumer behaviour, AI, retail media, category innovation, convenience and sustainability, the conference provides a concise yet comprehensive view of how brands can build resilience in a fast-changing landscape. For senior commercial, digital and retail leaders, it serves as a timely checkpoint on where the sector is heading - and where competitive advantage will be won in 2026.

And who can blame them? They’ve entered the workforce in an era where optics matter, and they know that being the person who always grabs the coffee, takes notes, or organizes the lunch (also known as “office housework”) can make you look more junior and hurt progression over time.

But Stephanie Kramer, the CHRO of L’Oréal U.S., says those small tasks are often where opportunity begins — and they played a surprisingly big role in her own career to the corner office at the world’s largest beauty company.

Quest fragrances, where she worked closely with perfumers early in her career

Before joining the Fortune 500 firm, L’Oreal, Kramer’s first job out of university was at Quest fragrances. It was also the first time the value of a simple coffee run stood out.

“I really wanted to have time to get to meet this incredibly cool perfumer,” she recalls to Fortune, adding that she went early to the meeting with the mindset that she simply wanted to support her team. But she soon discovered that “something positive comes out of those little things too.”

Instead of being wrapped up in being seen as the most junior person in the room, she quickly noted it gets you access.

“If you’re the one that is going to capture the actions from the meeting and the next steps, and you’re listening and you’re observing that isn’t that isn’t necessarily a negative,” Kramer explains. “You are in the room and you are absorbing how those points are coming to be. You’re developing the skills of inference.”

“So just make sure, when you’re discrediting some of those more small tasks, that you’re not discrediting their value they bring to you and your learning. I think about that all the time.”

Take whatever you can now, be strategic later

Kramer’s résumé spans Chanel, Kiehl’s, and L’Oréal’s corner offices — but it’s the middle-school roles and the odd, early-career errands she remembers most clearly.

“Those ones stick with you,” she says. That first job probably won’t be your dream role, it certainly wasn’t hers. But over time, it will have a snowball effect on your career.

“I don’t know if those are the ones where I ever wanted to be, you know, in my whole life.” Yet, she insists, every experience adds up. “It does. It makes a big difference.”

Her message to young workers facing a freezing job market: take the role, take the task, take the coffee run — because the value will only compound over time.

“You just have to start,” Kramer insists. “I guarantee that someday, that’s what you’re going to talk about in your interview.”

“It might not be the job that you have, or that you’re not necessarily sure that you should take. Right now, maybe it’s a paycheck, or maybe it’s a platform for you to connect with other people so that you can discover what you want to do.”

“When people ask me how I ended up in HR, I tell them it’s from middle school, because in middle school I was a lifeguard, I was a Girl Scout, I was a cross country runner, which means that you have to run through the woods alone, but you’re still making points as a team….Those jobs are part of what my job is today.”

The promotions will come later — but first, focus on

As the adage goes: If you look after the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves. The same goes for your career. Kramer is far from the first exec to tell young workers that if they excel in the small tasks today, the promotions will follow.

Cisco’s U.K. chief spent 25 years climbing the ranks at the Fortune 500 Europe telecommunications giant BT, before joining Cisco in 2022 as managing director and being promoted lead its U.K. and Ireland arm just two years later.

She previously told Fortune that both Gen Z new hires and millennial middle managers need to be more “patient” in their quest for success. The promotions will come, but young aspirational workers should focus on building their skills over rushing to nab any new snazzy title to update their LinkedIn.

Pret A Manger’s CEO Pano Christou, went from working at McDonald’s for $3 an hour to earning millions as the boss of the British sandwich chain. He says he got promotion after promotion by doing his very best in the role he was in — even those junior ones.

“I’ve watched people that have been so fixated on the next role that they really take their eye off the current job they’re doing,” Christou told Fortune. “My philosophy has always been if you do a great job, people will notice you.”

Likewise, Shaid Shah, one of the most senior execs at Mars — the powerhouse behind household brands like Dolmio — said the best career hack is to stop obsessing over getting that promotion or dream job title, and embrace the many steps in between that get you there.

“It’s about acquiring the experiences that you need to realize your ambition, to realize what makes you happy, what makes you tick, what inspires you to get out of bed every day,” Shah explained. “Because career success is more than just hierarchy.”",https://allwork.space/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gen-Z-Career-Advice-From-A-CHRO-Getting-The-Coffee-Is-Strategic-Not-Pathetic.png,N,,2026-01-20 02:58:55.150290

Oral semaglutide was approved by the FDA in December 2025 as a once-daily pill (25 mg), intended to limit excess body weight and help with weight maintenance.
BoomRx Introduces Oral Semaglutide and Tirzepatide for Healthcare Providers Nationwide.","BoomRx, a pharmaceutical technology platform that simplifies prescription sourcing and fulfillment by providing healthcare professionals (HCPs) with access to weight management therapies, has now made both oral semaglutide and tirzepatide options available via its platform.1 The options will be using advanced nanoemulsion delivery, for use by medical clinics, telemedicine providers, wellness facilities, and med spas.

What is nanoemulsion technology and how does it improve drug absorption?

According to a report published in Scientifica,2 “Nanoemulsions, also known as nanometric-sized emulsions, are fine water-in-oil (w/o) and oil-in-water (o/w) dispersions of two immiscible fluids, as opposed to the milky-white hue concomitant with coarse dispersion. These 20–200 nm droplets are stabilized by adding the appropriate amphiphilic emulsifiers or emulsifiers.”

Why does delivery format matter for semaglutide and tirzepatide?

By utilizing nanoemulsion technology, the formulations convert each dose into ultra-small particles that promote uniform distribution and enhanced bioavailability. The needle-free delivery format supports greater treatment flexibility and reliability as weight-management care expands into sustained, scalable models.

""Semaglutide and tirzepatide have become foundational therapies in weight management, and how they're delivered matters,"" noted Kurt Lunkwitz, BoomRx’s founder and president in a company news release.1 ""On the clinical side, nanoemulsion delivery provides an injection-free option designed for consistency and predictability—eliminating the performance peaks and troughs that come with using these products. On the distribution side, BoomRx ensures healthcare providers nationwide can quickly and easily fulfill prescriptions for these therapies through one streamlined portal.""

As the industry knows, demand for medical weight loss therapies is on the rise. Keeping that in mind, HCPs are prioritizing delivery formats that help address patient adherence and dosing challenges. By condensing particle sizes at the molecular level, the active ingredients are not only more evenly distributed, but more readily absorbed.

What’s new with oral semaglutide approval and market availability?

Oral semaglutide was approved by the FDA in December 2025 as a once-daily pill (25 mg), intended to limit excess body weight and help with weight maintenance. It officially hit the market earlier this month, and has since been added to both the Amazon Pharmacy and GoodRx networks.

This new version of Wegovy in pill form represents the first ever oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy that’s been approved for weight management. It also now marks the third formulation of Wegovy, expanding its available options.

The GLP-1 agonist was initially approved in June 2021 for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight who have at least one related condition, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol, alongside diet and exercise. In 2024, its label was further expanded to include adults with cardiovascular disease.

Tirzepatide—often known under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound—is yet to be approved orally, but is available as an injection.

How does BoomRx’s platform simplify prescribing and fulfillment for providers?

As for BoomRx's platform, HCPs are reportedly1 able to:

Compare formulations using one centralized dashboard

Simplify ordering and fulfillment via one secure login

Scale weight-management programs across both in-office and virtual care environments

""Our role is to remove friction from how healthcare providers source and manage therapies,"" Lunkwitz added. ""As delivery options evolve, BoomRx ensures access stays simple, efficient, and built for growth.""

Guest Post: Three GTM Challenges Killing Vertical AI Startups in 2026—And Why Market Shaping GTM Solves All of Them

As AI startup funding surges while enterprise IT budgets grow only marginally, most vertical AI startups face extinction not because of weak technology but because outdated SaaS go-to-market strategies no longer align with how enterprise buyers choose vendors. The guest post argues that in 2026, only startups that abandon volume-driven SaaS tactics and adopt “market shaping” approaches — focused on narrative control, third-party validation, and early proof — will survive enterprise budget consolidation.

OpenAI Addresses ‘Capactity Overhang’ — What AI Can Do and How It’s Being Used

OpenAI argues that as AI capabilities advance faster than their real-world adoption, the central challenge for the Intelligence Age will be managing the growing “capability overhang” between what AI can do and the value society captures at scale. The company outlines principles focused on transparency, broad access to compute and tools, and user self-empowerment, contending that widespread, practical use of frontier AI is key to unlocking productivity gains, economic growth, and shared opportunity.

Power, Connectivity and the Next Phase of the AI Supercycle

Today’s AI agents mark an early phase of a much longer AI supercycle that will ultimately push intelligence out of screens and into the physical world, requiring fundamentally new infrastructure, according to the World Economic Forum. As AI workloads strain power grids and outgrow internet-era architectures, the Forum argues that distributed compute and AI-native networks — capable of moving intelligence securely and reliably across data centres, metro regions, and the edge — will become the foundation for the next wave of real-world, physical AI.

The Next AI Revolution Could Start with World Models

As AI systems increasingly falter by predicting what looks plausible rather than understanding how the world actually works, researchers are turning to “world models” that maintain a continuous, internal representation of space and time, Scientific American reports. Advances in 4D modeling — combining three-dimensional structure with temporal change — could stabilize AI-generated video, improve augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous systems, and may be a necessary building block toward more humanlike intelligence and eventual artificial general intelligence.

Moxie Marlinspike Has a Privacy-Conscious Alternative to ChatGPT

As concerns grow that AI assistants will mirror the data-harvesting models of ad-driven platforms, Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike has launched Confer, a privacy-first chatbot designed so user conversations cannot be accessed, stored, or monetized, TechCrunch reports. The service uses end-to-end encryption, trusted execution environments, and open-weight models to block data collection by design, offering a higher-priced alternative for users willing to pay a premium to keep sensitive AI interactions private.

AI’s Future: Plotting a Path to Competitiveness and Digital Sovereignty

Europe’s push for digital sovereignty is colliding with a rapidly concentrating cloud and AI market dominated by a handful of U.S. hyperscalers, but the two goals need not be at odds, according to the World Economic Forum. The organization argues that a shift toward distributed, hybrid AI architectures — combining centralized model training with regional infrastructure and edge deployment — can allow countries and companies to capture economic value while preserving control over data, security, and strategic dependencies.

The initiative was unveiled during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos and positions e& to move beyond traditional NLP-based chatbots toward governed, action-oriented AI embedded directly into core enterprise systems.

At the center of the deployment is IBM watsonx Orchestrate, which e& and IBM said can power domain-specific AI agents that reason, orchestrate tasks, and integrate with enterprise platforms under governance controls. The companies said the solution is designed to help employees and auditors access, interpret and trace legal, regulatory and compliance information more quickly, while producing responses aligned with enterprise governance requirements.

The agentic AI capability has been integrated with IBM OpenPages and the broader watsonx portfolio. e& said the deployment is intended to streamline compliance-related tasks, reduce response times and provide 24/7 self-service access across the organization, while maintaining explainability and auditability suitable for governance, risk and compliance environments.

The companies said a joint proof of concept was delivered within eight weeks by IBM, GBM (Gulf Business Machines) and e&. IBM’s Client Engineering team led the design and integration work, while GBM supported delivery through project coordination and its familiarity with e&’s existing OpenPages and watsonx Assistant environment. The proof of concept was positioned as a demonstration of agentic AI operating at enterprise scale under real-world conditions and within an established governance framework.

IBM noted that the initiative aligns with watsonx.governance, which is already in use at e&, and highlighted a hybrid deployment approach that allows large language models to run across hybrid environments, including customer-managed infrastructure, while remaining governed under enterprise controls. e& described the collaboration as a milestone in its enterprise AI journey and a foundation for broader agentic AI adoption across the organization.

KEY QUOTES:

“Our ambition is to move beyond isolated AI use cases toward enterprise-scale agentic AI that is trusted, governed, and deeply integrated into how the organization operates. By collaborating with IBM, we are embedding intelligence directly into our risk and compliance processes, enabling faster decisions, consistent policy interpretation, and a foundation for broader agentic AI adoption across the enterprise.”

Just the Beginning As we look ahead, our commitment to San Francisco remains unwavering.","San Francisco has shaped our creativity and values at Levi Strauss & Co. for more than 170 years. Last year, we built off of our efforts to continue energizing and giving back to the city we call home — mobilizing employees, investing in public art and partnering with local nonprofits that meet pressing community needs across the city.

Read on to revisit highlights from 2025.

Rallying Companies to Volunteer Together

When we helped launch the Downtown Volunteer Coalition (DVC) with four other companies in 2024, the goal was simple: bring people back to our sidewalks through regular, hands‑on service. In 2025, that coalition more than doubled in size as six additional employers joined — Citizens, Crusoe Energy, FleishmanHillard, Google, the Golden State Warriors and the San Francisco Giants. All participating companies contributed to four cross‑company service days, 30 projects and more than 700 volunteers in the downtown area.

Painting the City With ‘These City Walls’

To mark the 25th anniversary of Community Day — and to add beauty, culture and color across our neighborhoods — we collaborated with 1AM Projects and local partners to commission 25 new murals citywide, including “Beneath the Bay,” completed down the street from our San Francisco headquarters in November. From Potrero Hill to Union Square, these murals are showing up across the city to bring energy to the neighborhoods that make our city thrive.

25 Years of Community Day

We marked LS&Co.’s 25th Community Day with nearly 600 San Francisco-based employees volunteering with 20 nonprofits in one day, alongside more than $150,000 in local grants. This annual day of service was a powerful snapshot of our commitment to our values, with employees working with long-time nonprofit partners across the city like AIDS Memorial Grove and the Homeless Prenatal Program, as well as new nonprofits like Booker T. Washington and San Francisco’s Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Showing Up for Pride in Our Hometown

Our employees showed up in a big way for San Francisco Pride, supporting programming and volunteer activations that celebrate the LGBTQ+ community and the culture that makes the city thrive. We were proud to once again sponsor the San Francisco Pride parade and show up for the community through city-wide pop-ups and events.

St. Anthony’s Partnership

To meet immediate clothing needs in the Tenderloin neighborhood and beyond, we formalized an ongoing donation cadence with St. Anthony’s Free Clothing Program to match supply with demand. St. Anthony’s Foundation provides essential services like meals, medical care, free clothing and pathways to stability for individuals and families in need. Programs such as the Free Clothing Program support thousands of people each year, helping to meet immediate needs and foster long-term well-being.

The donations have been warmly received, and we’ve continued to collaborate on volunteer opportunities for our employees.

Deepening Ties With Longstanding Partners

Throughout the year, we continued to support cultural institutions like the SF MOMA, Academy of Sciences, Fine Arts Museums and the Exploratorium, as well as became a proud sponsor of the annual Stern Grove festival. After the successful inaugural year of Downtown First Thursdays (DFT) in 2024 — of which LS&Co. was a key funder — we continued our support of DFT’s expansion to Front Street as well as the Downtown Development Corporation’s launch. We also kept up our engagement with organizations that are vital to San Francisco families and youth, including Larkin Street Youth Services and the Homeless Prenatal Program, helping their missions through grants and employee volunteering on Community Day and throughout the year.

Just the Beginning

As we look ahead, our commitment to San Francisco remains unwavering. Every mural, every volunteer hour, every partnership reflects our belief that thriving communities start with showing up — again and again. We’ve believed in this city for more than 170 years, and we look forward to continuing to show up.",https://www.levistrauss.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260120_LevisSanFranciscoHometown-700x424.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 02:59:01.121018

The acquisition follows an initial investment made 15 months ago and is part of Gushcloud’s broader strategy to scale its global creator management and monetisation platform, particularly in high-growth markets.

As part of the deal, TalentPlus will rebrand as Gushcloud TalentPlus, focusing on managing MENA creators for global representation while also representing and monetising international creators and intellectual property in the region.

Don't miss: Is the influencer agency space ripe for acquisitions?

Michel Chahda will continue as CEO of Gushcloud TalentPlus and will be appointed partner at Gushcloud International. In a statement, the company said the move strengthens its capabilities across reserved media, creator IP development and cross-border monetisation, supporting creators and brands looking to scale across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Europe and the United States.

Gay Carr, chief of staff at Gushcloud International, has also relocated to the UAE to co-lead the unit. She will continue overseeing Gushcloud’s multi-year partnership with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), which supports the establishment of Gushcloud’s regional headquarters for EMEA and India in Abu Dhabi.

The company said the partnership aligns with ADIO’s economic diversification goals, including building Abu Dhabi into a regional media and entertainment hub while supporting job creation and the growth of the digital creator ecosystem.

Gushcloud’s expansion comes amid strong growth in digital consumption across the region. According to Strategy&, digital content is projected to account for 46% of the region’s estimated US$22 billion media spend, while data from GlobalWebIndex shows MENA users maintain an average of 8.4 social media accounts and spend more than three hours daily on social platforms.

The acquisition strengthens Gushcloud’s footprint in MENA as competition intensifies among global creator management firms seeking scale, monetisation depth and cross-market reach.

“The UAE has done a great job in recent years marketing itself to creators and is becoming one of the most strategic markets globally for creators to live, work, play and build their businesses and family offices out of. Hence, this majority acquisition is a strategic step forward for us at Gushcloud to have more control in this large growing market that great adds value to the creator ecosystem that Gushcloud is building,” said Althea Lim, co-founder and group CEO of Gushcloud International.

She noted that Gushcloud’s earlier investment in TalentPlus laid the groundwork for a close working relationship with Chahda and his team, citing their deep regional experience, strong local relationships and creator-first approach. Lim added that bringing TalentPlus under majority ownership and appointing Chahda as a partner supports Gushcloud’s long-term ambition to scale its operations and deliver value for creators, brand partners and stakeholders across markets.

In tandem, Michael Chahda, CEO of Gushcloud TalentPlus said, ""Combining our local insights with Gushcloud’s global network, Gushcloud TalentPlus will enable us to create a global path and more monetisable opportunities for the creators we manage and represent exclusively.""

""With Gushcloud’s growing online media inventory , extensive marketing services, and proprietary AI and data tools and platforms, we can now provide accuracy for brands to connect more effectively to their audiences via the creators, allowing more ROI for the brands,"" he added.

The acquisition builds on Gushcloud’s earlier push into the region. In August last year, the company unveiled plans to expand into MENA with the launch of its regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi, backed by a multi-year partnership with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO).

At the time, Gushcloud said the move would strengthen its presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing creator economies while supporting Abu Dhabi’s ambition to become a global media and entertainment hub. The partnership is aimed at scaling operations across the region, fostering innovation and supporting talent development, as the global creator economy continues its rapid growth.",https://marketing-interactive-assets.b-cdn.net/article_images/gushcloud-acquires-dubai-based-talent-and-influencer-firm-talentplus/1768868860_gushcloud.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 22:59:19.618790
