Starbucks is on a mission to speed up its act, setting new goals to cut wait times for both drive-thru and mobile orders in an effort to win back customers and boost sales.

Following reports of 30 to 40-minute waits last year, the coffee giant is now aiming to complete drive-thru orders in four minutes, while mobile orders should be ready within 12 minutes, according to an internal training document obtained by Bloomberg. Starbucks (SBUX-1.58%) did not immediately respond to Quartz’s request for comment on whether this goal would increase the workload for baristas. The company has said it plans to hire more workers to address staffing issues, which have left many locations operating with “skeleton” crews.

These new targets are part of Starbucks’ attempt at a Big Fix, which looks to restore the brand’s position as a premium coffeehouse. After four consecutive quarters of declining sales and growing frustration over long wait times, the company is focusing on speed. CEO Brian Niccol, who took over in Sept. 2024, has previously stated that Starbucks would make fresh-brewed coffee in under four minutes. These goals mark the first time the company has formally implemented such specific targets, per Bloomberg. Starbucks also recently announced it would limit mobile orders to a maximum of 12 items per customer.

To cut waits, Niccol is leaning on the company’s “Siren Craft System,” which it designed to speed up drink-making and customer interactions — including by pulling espresso before steaming milk instead of after. The company has also partnered with a tech firm to help meet the four-minute target while enhancing in-store operations.

As part of Niccol’s “Back to Starbucks” overhaul, Starbucks has pared down its menu by 30%, cutting underperforming drinks and adding vegan-friendly options. The company has also eliminated the up charge for dairy-free alternatives, reintroduced condiment bars and ceramic mugs, and promised more comfortable seating and power outlets, but only for paying customers.","https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/fca94de5407e25eaef6aed9e135eb30b.jpg",N,,2025-03-28 13:07:46.347319

Net Banking Income (NBI) increased by 4.17% to 5.8 billion dirhams.
Without these costs, consolidated net income would have stood at 1.4 billion dirhams.","The Supervisory Board of Société Générale Maroc, chaired by Moulay Hafid Elalamy, met on March 25 to finalize the accounts for the 2024 fiscal year. This year marks a strategic turning point: the bank’s acquisition by the Saham Group, bringing an end to Société Générale’s presence in Morocco.

The transition to Saham ownership was executed smoothly, ensuring service quality remained unaffected. A well-managed separation from the French group allowed for a seamless shift in operations. This acquisition opens a new chapter for the institution, which now seeks to strengthen its autonomy and tailor its business model to the Moroccan market.

Despite this structural shift, business activity remained strong. Deposits grew by 8.94%, reaching 80.1 billion dirhams, while outstanding loans totaled 93.9 billion dirhams. Net Banking Income (NBI) increased by 4.17% to 5.8 billion dirhams.

However, financial performance was impacted by two exceptional charges: a provision related to the empowerment program and a tax audit, amounting to 800 million dirhams. Without these costs, consolidated net income would have stood at 1.4 billion dirhams. After accounting for them, it declined to 795 million dirhams, reflecting a 41.61% drop.

Despite the decline in profits, the bank maintains some of the strongest prudential ratios in the market, with a solvency ratio of 14.61% and a Core Tier 1 ratio of 13.86%.

The group has announced swift measures, including a “reshuffle” of its store portfolio.

Closed 40 stores, more to come

Despite a 3 % increase in turnover to 55.3 billion Swedish kronor (4.8 billion euros), H&M’s net profit halved compared to a year earlier to 579 million kronor (50 million euros). Operating profit fell by 42 % to 1.2 billion kronor (100 million euros), partly due to a deteriorating gross margin that fell from 51.5 % to 49.1 %.

CEO Daniel Ervér admits the group is dealing with negative ‘external factors’, higher discounts and investments in the customer proposition. The gross margin was also under pressure due to currency effects: the Swedish krona gained in value, resulting in less favourable conversion.

The number of physical stores fell by 125 locations in one year to 4,213. In the first quarter, the group closed a net 40 stores. For the entire calendar year, H&M plans to open eighty new stores, mainly in growth markets such as Brazil and Paraguay, while 190 stores will close, mainly in established markets. Many Monki stores will disappear; a limited number of these will be relaunched as Weekday.

Second quarter should improve

H&M’s focus is increasingly shifting to large flagship stores and online sales: around 30 % of turnover was already generated online. Its renewed digital shopping environment was rolled out in more countries and was well received, according to the group. Physical stores are also being revamped, with continued investment in renovations and technological upgrades.

The group’s outlook remains cautiously positive: for March, H&M expects sales growth of 1 % in local currency. The company emphasises that the negative effects on margins in the second quarter will be significantly smaller. More intensive cooperation with strategic suppliers should ultimately lead to better margins and a stronger customer offering.",https://www.retaildetail.eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/HM_MOVE_1239-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 12:11:34.869089

The study will evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity and preliminary anti-tumor activity.

Milestone: Clinical development milestone of $7 million received from Pfizer in Q1 2024

Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2024 Financial Results

In February 2025, the Company adopted a restructuring plan to extend its capital resources in connection with initiating a process to evaluate strategic alternatives. As part of the restructuring plan, the Company’s board of directors approved a reduction of approximately 30% of the Company’s global workforce to better align resources with the Company’s focus on the evaluation of strategic options and the Phase 1 study for LAVA-1266. The Company expects approximately $1.0 million of expenses related to the restructuring to be incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2025, of which approximately $0.3 million of cash payments are expected to be made during 2025.

As of December 31, 2024, LAVA had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $76.6 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $95.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company believes its current cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund operations into 2027.

Revenue from contracts with customers was $5.0 million and $0.4 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $12.0 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to the $5.0 million milestone related to J&J’s IND filing in October 2024. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily related to $7.0 million the Company recognized in revenue in connection with its agreement with Pfizer related to the achievement of a clinical development milestone and $5.0 million the Company recognized as revenue in connection with J&J’s IND filing. In comparison, in 2023, revenue included $4.3 million related to the Company’s agreement with Pfizer and $2.5 million related to the Company’s agreement with J&J.

Cost of sales of goods and providing services was zero and $0.2 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and zero and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cost in 2023 was due to the initial drug supply delivery to Pfizer and related stability studies.

Research and development expenses were $8.6 million and $2.3 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $28.5 million and $32.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to costs associated with the discontinuation of LAVA-1207, announced in December 2024. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to reduced manufacturing scale-up costs and headcount reductions that occurred in the second half of 2023, offset by costs associated with the discontinuation of LAVA-1207.

General and administrative expenses were $3.3 million for each of the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and $13.2 million and $14.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense as a result of fewer options issued and a reduction in the Company’s share price.

Net loss was $3.8 million and $6.4 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, or $0.14 and $0.24 net loss per share for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net losses were $25.1 million and $41.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, or $0.94 and $1.57 net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Sales growth was also knocked by H&M’s plans to trim its store estate and help simplify its operations over the past year.

H&M said it had 40 net store closures over the quarter, including 35 for the eponymous H&M brand while it also closed five Monki shops.

Its recent store overhaul left the retailer with 4,213 stores at the end of last month – a reduction of 125 over the past year.

The group, which also owns the Cos and & Other Stories brands, reported that gross profit for the quarter dipped slightly to £27.2 billion from £27.7 billion.

Daniel Erver, chief executive of the business, said: “Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering.

“We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.

“Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.”",https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/03/27/13/e0e080c3ddd72d53925f53b40c0e56e5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQzMTY1NDU2-2.53258082.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,N,,2025-03-28 13:07:35.866839

The member-owned insurer's $3.3 billion acquisition of Cigna's Medicare Advantage, Part D and Medigap assets this month transformed Health Care Service Corp. into a national carrier. The company is bullish on Medicare Advantage, despite persistent headwinds. But the deal also reflects the continuing aftershocks of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's historic settlements in a pair of antitrust lawsuits.

To be sure, Health Care Service Corp. is not vying to become a healthcare conglomerate like UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna that competes nationwide in the employer, individual, Medicare and Medicaid markets.

Health Care Service Corp. has no near-term plans to go beyond Medicare in the states it accessed through the Cigna deal and has no major acquisitions on the horizon, said Arun Prasad, executive vice president and chief strategy officer and president of diversified businesses.

But the insurer was no slouch even before taking on Cigna's Medicare business. Health Care Service Corp. has 26.5 million members and is the largest nonprofit and the largest member-owned health insurance company. But a greatly expanded Medicare presence elevates its standing.

Health Care Service Corp. was limited to selling Blue Cross and Blue Shield policies, including Medicare Advantage plans, in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas before the deal.

After the Cigna acquisition, Health Care Service Corp. has a much bigger footprint and can offer Medicare Advantage in 25 more states and the District of Columbia, Part D nationally, and Medigap in 48 states and the District of Columbia. The insurer now counts 830,000 Medicare Advantage members, about four times as many as prior to the Cigna purchase.

“Medicare Advantage is here to stay and is going to be a program that will be fairly attractive,” Prasad said.

Moving up a weight class means facing dominant for-profit Medicare Advantage carriers such as UnitedHealth Group subsidiary UnitedHealthcare, Humana and CVS Health subsidiary Aetna head on. Those three insurers collectively cover 57% of Medicare Advantage enrollees, according to an analysis of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data the investment bank Stephens published in February.

Health Care Service Corp. is making a big bet on Medicare Advantage at a fraught moment when other companies are trying to reduce their exposure in this market. Medicare Advantage insurers continue to brace against rising medical costs, tightened federal purse strings and stricter regulatory enforcement.

Insurers and investors are hopeful, however, that the difficult season is waning as costs stabilize, and anticipate that President Donald Trump's administration will treat Medicare Advantage more favorably than President Joe Biden's did. Moreover, Health Care Service Corp. sees great potential in the program as the population continues to age.

“If you're looking at it over the next six to 12 months, there is some volatility,” Prasad said. “If you look over a longer period of time, it's not difficult at all.”

Duane Wright, senior research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, agreed. “They’re coming into this on the upswing,” he said.

Blues business evolving

Health Care Service Corp.'s Medicare Advantage expansion also aligns with a broader shakeup in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system.

Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, for example, have undertaken corporate restructurings in the past two years as they seek scale and diversification to compete with for-profit insurers.

A lengthy, and still incompletely resolved, legal challenge to fundamental aspects of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield model may be a big part of why Health Care Service Corp. and its peers are in the midst of an evolution.

Providers and plan sponsors such as employers initiated lawsuits against the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in 2012, alleging a multitude of anticompetitive practices. While these cases wended their way through the courts and under the terms of the deals themselves, the association made key concessions.

Crucially, prior to agreeing to terms with the plan sponsors and insurers in 2022, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association scrapped a longstanding rule that limited how much Blue Cross and Blue Shield carriers can earn from non-Blues-branded businesses.

That likely made the Health Care Service Corp.-Cigna deal possible, said Doug Wolfe, co-founder and managing partner of the law firm Wolfe Pincavage, which represents hospitals in payment disputes against insurers. “Could this have happened without the Blue Cross Blue Shield settlement? The answer to that is probably no,” he said.

Under construction

The Medicare plans Health Care Service Corp. bought will carry Cigna branding for the rest of the year, after which the company will come up with something new, Prasad said.

But Health Care Service Corp. won't be able to put the Blue Cross and Blue Shield label on its Medicare policies outside of Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas because other companies have the necessary Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association licenses in the newly acquired states.

“HCSC — let's face it: It's a mouthful. It's not a very consumer-friendly name, and they have to be consumer-friendly to compete in the MA space,” said Stephen Parente, a healthcare economist at the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management.

Health Care Service Corp. also confronts critical logistical challenges, starting with assembling provider networks in its new markets where it does not have access to the shared national Blue Cross and Blue Shield network. The company could, however, acquire or contract with other Blues plans, said Ari Gottlieb, an independent healthcare consultant.

Building a network won't necessarily be easy in the current environment, when providers are intensely displeased with Medicare Advantage carriers over reimbursements, claims processing, prior authorizations and other matters, and many are simply opting out. “Providers now more so have the leverage in this market,” said Neil Patil, health policy director at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy.

Cigna, which owns the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, will continue administering drug coverage for its former plans for four years, according to the companies. Cigna will maintain oversight of reinsurance and administrative services for an undetermined period of time, the insurers notified California regulators in August.

Spending $3.3 billion on new assets also squeezed Health Care Service Corp.'s already troubled finances.

Health Care Service Corp.'s underwriting losses more than doubled to $792.2 million last year, according to an analysis of regulatory filings the market research firm Mark Farrah Associates performed for Modern Healthcare.

The insurer borrowed $2.5 billion of the money it paid Cigna, prompting S&P Global Ratings to downgrade its credit from AA- to A+ after the deal closed this month.

Private equity firms Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management will purchase Family Dollar, the companies announced Wednesday; Dollar Tree estimated about $804 million in net proceeds from the sale, which it expects to close by June 2025.

Dollar Tree, which acquired Family Dollar in 2015 for about $9 billion, began considering a sale or spinoff of Family Dollar in June 2024 as a way to restructure the company amid a challenging retail climate with inflation and competition from big-box retailers such as Walmart and online retailers including Amazon, Shein and Temu.

Dollar Tree closed about 600 Family Dollar stores in 2024 and had plans to close another 370 – along with 30 Dollar Tree stores – when the leases came up on on those locations.

CEO Michael Creedon, who moved from chief operating officer to interim CEO and then CEO during Dollar Tree's restructuring in recent months, said the separation from Family Dollar puts Dollar Tree in position to ""achieve its full potential,"" in a call with investment analysts Wednesday.

“We will continue to grow and optimize our Dollar Tree business to maximize value for Dollar Tree associates, customers, and shareholders with an enhanced focus on compelling initiatives, including our expanded assortment, significant planned new store openings across the United States, and transactions that advance our growth strategy,"" Creedon said in a press release announcing the Family Dollar sale.

Dollar Tree adding, upgrading stores

Dollar Tree, which has 2,900 Dollar Tree stores after opening 525 during the past year, expects to open about 300 new stores in 2025, Creedon said. The discount retailer is also upgrading stores to handle items priced as high as $7. Among stores being upgraded are some among the 170 leases of 99 Cents Only Stores in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Texas acquired in May 2024.

About 1,000 combination Family Dollar-Dollar Tree stores will be sold in the deal.

Dollar Tree reported net sales of $5 billion – excluding sales from Family Dollar stores – a 2% increase in same-store sales during the three-month period ending Feb. 1, 2025. Store traffic in Dollar Tree stores rose 0.7% and shoppers spent 1.3% more per total purchase.

Total fourth quarter sales including from Family Dollar were $8.26 billion, which surpassed the $8.23 billion estimated by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Dollar Tree CEO on higher-income shoppers: 'Everybody's hurting'

Traditionally, middle-income shoppers account for about half of Dollar Tree customers, Creedon said. However, increased traffic and sales is being driven in part by ""stronger demand from higher-income customers who increasingly see Dollar Tree as a cost-effective source for an expanding range of products,"" he said.

Lower-income customers ""need us particularly to make their wallet go farther, in between paychecks,"" Creedon said. But during ""this inflationary environment, all shoppers across all income cohorts, including the higher income, is finding Dollar Tree as part of their solution,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how much money you make everybody's hurting right now.""

Tariffs could lead to some higher prices at Dollar Tree

Dollar Tree had ""mitigated"" the effects of the first round of tariffs levied on products from China by about 90%, through negotiations, changing product specifications and buying from suppliers in different countries.

But higher prices could be an option depending on how future tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada play out, Creedon said. For instance, he said, ""we're the best in the nation for prayer candles. They're made in Mexico and so we want to make sure we can still offer them. So we will look at targeted pricing on things like that.""

Dollar Tree's break with Family Dollar marks the end of a costly merger it hoped would bolster it against competitors such as Dollar General, which also bid on Family Dollar at the time.

Family Dollar stores had also been hit with some issues over the past two years including a 2023 recall of products including toothpaste, pain relievers and other over-the-counter medicines that had been stored improperly, but were shipped to stores.

In 2024, Family Dollar agreed to pay the Justice Department $41.6 million for storing food, cosmetics, drugs and medical devices in a rat-infested warehouse in Arkansas for several years, court records show.

""It is truly 'addition by subtraction' as Family Dollar had been a consistent weight on topline performance, margin rate, and management time,"" Evercore analyst Michael Montani told Reuters.

Dollar Tree shares, which had been down 11% so far this year, were up more than 9% in early trading Wednesday.

Flash PMI data to provide steer on geopolitical economic impact

Markets will be busy in the coming week assessing new tariff announcements from the US as well as worldwide PMI survey data covering both manufacturing and services, as well as the monthly US jobs report.

The major news event of the week is scheduled for 2 April, which will see the US outline the tariffs it will impose on trading partners in addition to those already announced. While President Donald Trump's so-called 'Liberation Day' is expected see a significant increase in the overall tariff burden, many are hoping that it will at least add some clarity to the US administration's trade policy to help business planning and forecasting. Insights into the degree to which trading partners respond will also be eagerly awaited.

In terms of economic data, the worldwide PMI surveys will give up-to-date feedback from businesses about the impact of recent developments. As well as updates to actual business levels, including output, employment and pricing, a key area of interest will be business confidence via the PMI's forward-looking business expectations indices.

A review of the preliminary 'flash' PMI data from the US, Europe and Japan is available here. While these early surveys showed output growth ticking higher across the major developed economies in March, growth was uneven and has remained modest so far this year. Business sentiment about prospects has meanwhile sunk to its lowest since late 2022.

The final global PMI data will add colour in particular via the extension of survey coverage to mainland China, Canada, Mexico and other key APAC economies, as well as the sector details. February, for example, saw the global autos and parts sector already contracting sharply, even before new 25% tariffs had been announced by the US, bucking a broader manufacturing upturn.

The week will by no means get less exciting as it goes on, however, as Friday is non-farm payroll day. February's payroll count disappointed with a 151k rise, and some government job cuts could depress March's reading. But we note that private sector payrolls rose by just 110k on average in the first two months of 2025, with the PMI data available so far pointing to a further sluggish rise in March. The unemployment rate meanwhile edged up from 4.0% to 4.1% in February and wage growth ticked up from 3.9% to 4.0%.

What to watch in the coming week

Worldwide manufacturing and services PMI

Global manufacturing PMI will be updated on 1 April, while services and composite numbers will be due 3 April. Additionally to the national PMIs, detailed sector data will provide insights into the key drivers of changes to economic conditions. Growth, confidence and inflation metrics will be closely watched after developed economies' flash PMI revealed opposing trends in March.

Americas: US labour market report, ISM PMI, plus trade data; Canada trade and employment figures

March US non-farm payrolls, wages and unemployment data will be released on Friday for official signals of labour market conditions after US Flash PMI revealed that employment returned to growth after falling in February. Final S&P Global PMI figures will also be due alongside the ISM readings for assessment growth and inflation trends at the end of the first quarter of the year. This comes after the flash data indicated a notable impact of tariffs on US goods prices in March.

Separately, Canada will also publish trade and employment figures, with trade uncertainty reported to have negatively affected production in Canada via February's PMI.

EMEA: Eurozone inflation; Germany factory orders and retail sales; UK mortgage data and housing prices

In addition to final PMI readings (including construction PMIs), the key data to watch in Europe will be eurozone inflation. According to flash figures, the PMI's main selling price index declined in March to a level broadly consistent with inflation running close to the ECB's target. If confirmed, markets will see increased scope for the ECB to lower rates further as insurance against downside risks to growth caused by tariff worries.

Germany factory orders and retail sales data will also be due with more up-to-date March HCOB Flash Germany PMI showing growth to have been buoyed by an upturn in manufacturing production.

APAC: RBA meeting, Australia trade; China NBS PMI; Japan Tankan survey, industrial production, retail sales

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) convenes for their April policy meeting with the possibility of a rate cut not entirely ruled out according to latest market views. March's S&P Global Flash Australia PMI showed business activity growth at a seven-month high while inflation eased, providing little impetus for an imminent move.

On the data release front, besides the series of March APAC PMI releases, the focus will be with PMI figures from mainland China's National Bureau of Statistics and Japan's Tankan survey.

H&M said sales in March had risen by 1 per cent as it reported a sluggish start to its spring/summer season.
Ervér told analysts that H&M had begun to shift its supply chain to adapt to new trade tariffs.
H&M was founded in 1947 under the name Hennes.
Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC, said: “We think H&M has taken various steps to improve its offer for customers which should lead to a stronger sales performance in time.","“We are still in a high-inflation climate where the customers’ spending power is limited, so we stay very focused on providing outstanding value for money.”

Ervér, who has led H&M since February last year, has continued with a cost-cutting plan in a bid to improve profit margins at the group. He has also boosted the company’s spending on marketing, with the singers FKA Twigs and Tyla promoting H&M’s recent lines as it attempts to win back customers amid tough competition.

H&M said sales in March had risen by 1 per cent as it reported a sluggish start to its spring/summer season.

The fashion group, which also owns brands including Arket, Cos, & Other Stories, and Weekday, experienced a rise in discounting due to Black Friday — the day in November when retailers offer deep discounts — falling later in the year. The timing of the sales period also resulted in an increase in logistics costs.

Ervér told analysts that H&M had begun to shift its supply chain to adapt to new trade tariffs. The United States is the group’s second largest market by sales. “We feel at the end of the day, it will come at the cost of the consumer,” Ervér said. He added that the company would be likely to have to increase prices to alleviate the impact of tariffs.

H&M was founded in 1947 under the name Hennes. For more than a decade it has grappled with weak profitability while struggling to keep pace with Inditex, the Spanish fashion giant that owns Zara, and which in recent years has been able to pass on inflated costs to its less price-sensitive shoppers.

The Swedish company has also experienced tough competition due to the rise of fast-fashion newcomers including Shein and Temu.

Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC, said: “We think H&M has taken various steps to improve its offer for customers which should lead to a stronger sales performance in time. However, a lot of things have to improve together and so far the recovery has been somewhat unbalanced, in our view.”

Management Commentary

“We are encouraged by the meaningful progress we made in 2024 as we implemented significant steps to strengthen our balance sheet, streamline operations, and drive efficiencies,” said Norman E. Snyder, Jr., CEO of Reed’s. “During the fourth quarter, we closed a $10 million private placement, in addition to the incremental capital, we sourced a new demand note, and completed the convertible debt restructuring during the third quarter, providing the necessary capital to invest in inventory, personnel, marketing, strategic partnerships, and international expansion — all of which we believe will position Reed’s for accelerated growth and profitability. We also increased retail penetration during the quarter, securing notable distribution gains across Kroger, Albertsons/Safeway, Harris Teeter, Stop and Shop, Giant Eagle, and Costco for multiple products, including Reed’s Ginger Ale, Virgil’s Root Beer and Vanilla Cream Cans.

“Subsequent to year-end, we welcomed Douglas W. McCurdy as our new CFO. Doug brings extensive finance, operational and leadership experience to our team. We also appointed Salvatore Vassallo, a seasoned consumer packaged goods and supply chain executive, as our new Vice President of Operations. We believe their combined leadership in finance, supply chain and operations will help drive both efficiency and scalability at Reed’s.

“Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our growth strategy with a solid foundation and strengthened balance sheet. This year we are expanding our product portfolio with the launch of our new multi-functional beverage line, expected to hit shelves in April. We have already secured over 8,000 points of distribution across key retailers nationwide. With a de-leveraged balance sheet, improved financial flexibility, and growing retail momentum, we believe we are well positioned to deliver meaningful growth and profitability in 2025.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results

During the fourth quarter of 2024, net sales were $9.7 million compared to $11.7 million in the year-ago period. This decrease was primarily driven by short order shipments due to prior inventory constraints.

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2024 increased to $2.9 million compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2023. Gross margin was 30.0% compared to 4.0% in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by one-time charges in the prior-year period, including a $1.8 million non-cash packaging inventory valuation adjustment and a $1.3 million provision for product holds related to the Company’s swing-lid program.

Delivery and handling costs were reduced by 10% to $1.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Delivery and handling costs were 17% of net sales or $3.00 per case, compared to 16% of net sales or $2.82 per case during the same period last year.

Selling, general and administrative costs were $4.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $3.0 million in the year-ago quarter.

Operating loss during the fourth quarter of 2024 improved to $3.7 million or $(0.25) per share, compared to $5.0 million or $(1.55) per share in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Modified EBITDA was $(0.7) million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $43,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Liquidity and Cash Flow

For the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company used approximately $3.9 million of cash from operating activities compared to cash used of $0.2 million for the same period in 2023.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $10.4 million of cash and $9.6 million of total debt net of capitalized financing fees. This compares to $0.6 million of cash and $27.4 million of total debt net of capitalized financing fees at December 31, 2023.

Modified EBITDA

In addition to our GAAP results, we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. However, Modified EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, changes in fair value of warrant expense, change in fair value of SAFE agreements, contract proceedings and insurance settlements, non-recurring professional fees, inventory write-offs associated with exited categories and major packaging and formula changes, one-time changes in policy, impact of changes to accounting methodology and one-time restructuring-related costs including employee severance and asset impairment.

Management considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of net loss to Modified EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 (unaudited; in thousands):

We present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts, and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions; making compensation decisions; and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following:

Modified EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

Modified EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

Modified EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; and

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.",https://static.stocktitan.net/company-logo/reed-lg.png,N,,2025-03-27 22:01:03.781749

Despite the complexity of the transformation underway, Société Générale Maroc reported solid commercial performance.
In terms of financial stability, Société Générale Maroc continues to rank among the most resilient players in the market.
With the Saham Group now at the helm, Société Générale Maroc has entered a new phase of development.
Emerging from a demanding year, Société Générale Maroc is stronger, more focused, and better equipped to move forward.","The year 2024 will be remembered as a defining chapter in the trajectory of Société Générale Maroc. A shift in majority ownership, internal restructuring, and exceptional one-off impacts could have destabilized operations. Instead, the bank demonstrated a remarkable ability to steer through change while preserving performance, continuity, and client trust.

The acquisition of Société Générale Group’s stake by the Saham Group was not merely a change in shareholders—it marked the beginning of a strategic realignment. This transition, carefully orchestrated and executed in line with a clear roadmap, enabled the progressive disengagement from legacy systems without disrupting services. On March 25, the Supervisory Board, chaired by Moulay Hafid Elalamy, reviewed the 2024 financial statements, underlining the controlled nature of this transition and the bank’s capacity to evolve without compromising its operational integrity.

Despite the complexity of the transformation underway, Société Générale Maroc reported solid commercial performance. Deposits showed a strong upward trend, and credit portfolios continued to grow. The consolidated Net Banking Income also posted a healthy year-on-year increase, reflecting the enduring trust of clients and the effectiveness of the bank’s commercial model, even in a time of institutional change.

Financial results were affected by two non-recurring items: a provision linked to an internal empowerment program and a tax inspection. These exceptional events weighed on the consolidated net income, which decreased compared to 2023. However, excluding these one-off effects, the bank’s core performance remains robust. The adjusted net income would have exceeded MAD 1.2 billion, demonstrating the institution’s strong underlying profitability and prudent management.

In terms of financial stability, Société Générale Maroc continues to rank among the most resilient players in the market. With total equity exceeding MAD 15.5 billion, a solvency ratio of 14.61%, and a Core Tier 1 ratio of 13.86%, the bank significantly surpasses regulatory requirements. These sound fundamentals are not just technical indicators—they are tangible proof of strength, reliability, and the ability to absorb shocks while continuing to support clients and the economy.

More than a financial milestone, 2024 represents a strategic inflection point. With the Saham Group now at the helm, Société Générale Maroc has entered a new phase of development. Its ambitions are no longer defined by scale alone, but by operational excellence, relational agility, and the ability to deliver high-value services in an evolving economic landscape. This repositioning reflects a deliberate choice: to be a bank that grows through efficiency, innovation, and a renewed commitment to client-centricity.

Emerging from a demanding year, Société Générale Maroc is stronger, more focused, and better equipped to move forward. This is not just a transition—it is a transformation, carried out with discipline, driven by vision, and grounded in long-term resilience.",https://en.7news.ma/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Societe-Generale-maroc.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 22:01:15.291070

(ELV) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","Harrow (HROW) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.25 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.11 per share. This compares to loss of $0.27 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 127.27%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this pharmaceutical and drug compounding company would post a loss of $0.05 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.12, delivering a surprise of -140%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

Harrow , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry, posted revenues of $66.83 million for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $36.36 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Harrow shares have lost about 17.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -2.9%.

What's Next for Harrow?

While Harrow has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

The Future of Walgreens in the United States Despite the decision to close hundreds of stores, Walgreens remains one of the leading pharmacy chains in the United States.","Amid a difficult economic situation, Walgreens has confirmed that it will close 500 of its stores in the United States during 2025. This announcement is part of a broader plan to reduce the number of locations of the chain, which plans to close 1,200 stores in total over the coming years. This decision not only reflects Walgreens's struggle but also a worrying upward trend in the face of the economic challenges facing retail in the United States.

The Impact of the Closures on Walgreens

Walgreens has admitted that a quarter of its 8,700 stores in the United States are not profitable. Despite having exceeded Wall Street's expectations regarding its earnings, the company has not been able to avoid the problems plaguing the industry. Rising costs and competition from online retailers have severely affected its profitability.

Tim Wentworth, CEO of Walgreens, explained that the company is in the middle of a ""turnaround"" and that this process ""will take time."" Despite the closures, Wentworth was optimistic about the future, assuring that the measures taken will bring both financial and consumer benefits in the long term.

The Struggle to Stay Afloat

Walgreens's business model has been especially hit by the reduction in prescription reimbursements and growing competition. Additionally, many consumers have moved away from traditional pharmacies, seeking lower prices elsewhere. Although Walgreens led vaccinations during the Covid-19 pandemic, the boost that gave them has already disappeared and the company faces a tough battle to remain relevant.

The company is not the only one going through this type of crisis: its competitor, CVS, has also closed several stores. Rite Aid, another major chain, emerged from bankruptcy with a reduced presence of 1,300 stores. However, despite these challenges, Wentworth was confident that Walgreens can overcome this situation.

The Future of Walgreens in the United States

Despite the decision to close hundreds of stores, Walgreens remains one of the leading pharmacy chains in the United States. The company still owns around 6,000 profitable stores, which will serve as a base to continue operating and rebuild its image. Wentworth highlighted that this solid base will allow Walgreens to invest in the future and adapt its business model to new market demands.

The closures, which will begin to be implemented in 2025, are part of a broader strategy to restructure the company. Walgreens, like other large chains, faces a challenging landscape in an increasingly competitive market. It is possible that, after what happened in 2019 with the pandemic, this type of establishment has lost the trust of a percentage of consumers.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-interior-walgreens-desenfocado-estados-unidos-persona-sorprendida_1200_800.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 03:59:15.101562

Management Commentary

""We are encouraged by the meaningful progress we made in 2024 as we implemented significant steps to strengthen our balance sheet, streamline operations, and drive efficiencies,” said Norman E. Snyder, Jr., CEO of Reed's. ""During the fourth quarter, we closed a $10 million private placement, in addition to the incremental capital, we sourced a new demand note, and completed the convertible debt restructuring during the third quarter, providing the necessary capital to invest in inventory, personnel, marketing, strategic partnerships, and international expansion - all of which we believe will position Reed's for accelerated growth and profitability. We also increased retail penetration during the quarter, securing notable distribution gains across Kroger, Albertsons/Safeway, Harris Teeter, Stop and Shop, Giant Eagle, and Costco for multiple products, including Reed's Ginger Ale, Virgil's Root Beer and Vanilla Cream Cans.

""Subsequent to year-end, we welcomed Douglas W. McCurdy as our new CFO. Doug brings extensive finance, operational and leadership experience to our team. We also appointed Salvatore Vassallo, a seasoned consumer packaged goods and supply chain executive, as our new Vice President of Operations. We believe their combined leadership in finance, supply chain and operations will help drive both efficiency and scalability at Reed's.

""Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our growth strategy with a solid foundation and strengthened balance sheet. This year we are expanding our product portfolio with the launch of our new multi-functional beverage line, expected to hit shelves in April. We have already secured over 8,000 points of distribution across key retailers nationwide. With a de-leveraged balance sheet, improved financial flexibility, and growing retail momentum, we believe we are well positioned to deliver meaningful growth and profitability in 2025.”

Delivery and handling costs were reduced by 10% to $1.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Despite a drop in overall beer consumption, higher prices and greater spending per beer have helped maintain revenue levels.
While beer consumption per capita has decreased—from 190 litres per person in 1974-75 to 82 litres per person in 2019-2020—revenue growth has been driven by the increasing demand for craft beer.
In response to this growth in craft beer production and consumption, some State Governments thrown support behind the sector.
The inaugural Western Australian Craft Beer Strategy brings together all parts of the craft beer supply chain to drive forward a unified and sustainable industry.","Australia’s beer manufacturing industry has seen steady growth in recent years, despite a decline in per capita beer consumption, according to the latest research from IBISWorld.

The rise of craft beer has driven much of this growth, with consumers increasingly opting for higher-priced, premium beers over traditional options. As a result, craft beer sales have outpaced those of regular beer, and independent breweries have gained market share. In response, major brewers like Asahi

and Lion have expanded their craft beer portfolios.

Lion’s 2021 acquisition of Fermentum Pty Ltd highlights how larger brewers are leveraging acquisitions to tap into the craft beer boom. IBISWorld’s market research projects the industry’s revenue will reach $8.7 billion by 2025, growing at an annual rate of 0.9 per cent between 2020 and 2025. The revenue growth has been supported by consumers shifting away from full-strength beers like Victoria Bitter and XXXX Gold and opting for more expensive craft beers.

Despite a drop in overall beer consumption, higher prices and greater spending per beer have helped maintain revenue levels.

The beer manufacturing industry in Australia remains concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria, where population density and market demand are highest. However, new breweries face challenges, including securing land, obtaining licenses, and competing for tap and shelf space.

The beer manufacturing industry is expected to continue growing until 2030, although increasing excise taxes may impact profit margins. Australia has the third-highest beer tax in the world, behind only Norway and Finland, which could affect the cost structures of breweries and their pricing strategies.

Traditional full-strength beers, such as Victoria Bitter, Carlton Draught, and XXXX Gold, remain the largest revenue drivers, despite their declining market share. Other categories, including mid-strength, light, and low-carb beers, are also growing, but have not yet surpassed full-strength beers in terms of revenue.

Overall, the industry is projected to be worth $8.7 billion, with competition rising as the number of breweries increases by 8% annually, bringing the total to 878 businesses. While beer consumption per capita has decreased—from 190 litres per person in 1974-75 to 82 litres per person in 2019-2020—revenue growth has been driven by the increasing demand for craft beer.

Despite the rise of craft beer, full-strength beer remains the most popular category, with brands like Victoria Bitter, XXXX Gold, and Carlton Draught still holding large market share. Most breweries are based in New South Wales and Victoria, where the consumer base is largest. The leading brewers by revenue are Asahi Holdings ($3.1 billion), Lion ($1.8 billion), and Coopers Brewery ($187 million).

In response to this growth in craft beer production and consumption, some State Governments thrown support behind the sector. The Western Australia Government has announced a new strategy to grow the state’s craft beer sector, create jobs and promote the industry’s ‘paddock to pint’ tourism experience.

Western Australia is considered the birthplace of Australia’s craft beer sector, with the establishment of a handful of now iconic breweries in Perth in the 1980s and 1990s. The inaugural Western Australian Craft Beer Strategy brings together all parts of the craft beer supply chain to drive forward a unified and sustainable industry.

The industry-led strategy aims to boost production, with the ambitious goal of tripling either the volume or value of locally produced beer over ten years. It also strives to improve supply chain integration, including those that produce homegrown barley, hops and malt, and the local businesses that provide packaging, distribution, and retail services.

There are now more than 120 breweries across the metropolitan area and regional WA, representing 20 per cent of the national industry.

“Our craft beer industry uses premium ingredients grown in the State’s agricultural sector and it’s that unique WA ‘paddock to pint’ experience that an increasing number of customers are drawn to,” said Agriculture and Food Minister Jackie Jarvis.

“It’s also a major draw card for tourists with more than 120 breweries across the State, half of which are in

our regions.

“The inaugural Western Australian Craft Beer Strategy will lay the groundwork for industry, Government and other stakeholders to collaborate and shape the future of the craft beer industry.”

Beer manufacturing contributed an estimated $648 million to the WA economy in 2020-21, directly supporting around 967 full-time jobs and indirectly supporting more than 4,000 jobs across Western Australia

The industry-led strategy was facilitated by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development as a partnering initiative with the Independent Brewers Association, Western Australian Brewers Association and Southwest Brewers Alliance.

The five strategic priorities are industry leadership, brand awareness, market access and export opportunities, supply chain management, and regulation.

Meanwhile, the Australian beer market is considered one of the most restricted globally, with two foreign-owned corporations, Lion (Kirin) and Carlton & United Breweries (Asahi), dominating beer supply. Additionally, two large companies dominate the retail beer sector.

Mergers, acquisitions, and regulatory factors have also shaped the market structure seen today. Market concentration in Australia is notable. As of 2024, publicly available data indicates that Lion holds a 33 per cent market share, CUB commands 50 per cent, major retailers Coles Group and Endeavour Group control five per cent, Coopers (a family-owned independent) holds five per cent, and Good Drinks Australia, an ASX-listed independent, has 1.25 per cent. The remaining 5.75 per cent of the market is shared by various independent breweries.

This independent sector figure is expected to continue to grow. In 2019, AB InBev (then owner of Carlton and United) described the Australian beer market as one of the most profitable worldwide, with a high value per hectolitre consumed.

At that time, AB InBev and Lion Nathan together held over 80 per cent of the market, both in volume and value.

The market was highly consolidated, with strong retailer relationships and modern trade structures giving both companies a competitive advantage.

All in all, the Australian beer manufacturing sector remains high profitable but also highly competitive, with 2025 expected to be another positive year.",http://www.foodmag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Beer-Consumption.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 20:01:47.033927

For 1 December 2024 to 28 February 2025, Gross profit amounted to SEK 27.16 billion (£2 billion), down from SEK 27.65 billion (£2.13 billion). H&M said this was due to ""negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering"".

Operating profit amounted to SEK 1.2 billion (£92 million), down from SEK 2.07 billion (£160 million).

During the period, the company continued to optimise its store portfolio by closing select stores. It went into the quarter with nearly 120 fewer stores compared to the same time last year, and it had 40 net store closures during the period.

Daniel Ervér, CEO at H&M Group, said: ""Operating profit and profitability were impacted by temporarily challenging development of the gross margin. Our main priorities are a strengthened product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand. Through this, we create the conditions for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth.

Looking ahead, the H&M group’s sales in the month of March 2025 are expected to increase by 1% in local currencies compared with to the year prior.

Ervér continued: ""Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.

""We can see that the improvements we have made, especially in the women’s assortment, are starting to have a positive effect. Here we have simplified the organisation and become faster at adapting to new trends and creating a more relevant assortment.

""Through our omni-model we are continuing to integrate the physical and digital sales channels, making it easier for our customers to find what they are looking for. The upgraded digital store was rolled out to more markets in the quarter and has been well-received by our customers. Upgrades to our physical stores continue to be given high priority. In addition to rebuilding key stores in several major cities, we are expanding customer experience upgrades to more stores in more markets during the year.

""With macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, it is important that we continue to focus fully on our plan and offer the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability for everyone.""",https://www.theindustry.fashion/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HM-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 05:57:54.895807

Outlook for Fiscal Year 2025 Emphasizes Growth in Operating Cash Flow

CHICO, Calif., March 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lulu’s Fashion Lounge Holdings, Inc. (“Lulus” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LVLU) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 29, 2024 and issued its financial outlook for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2025.

Crystal Landsem, CEO of Lulus, said:

“In the fourth quarter, we delivered positive sales growth in our special occasion, bridesmaid, and bridal categories, reinforcing our strength in event dressing despite the seasonally slower sales period. These gains in our occasion dress categories were offset by continued softness in casual wear, which we are actively repositioning to better align with our core focus on event attire. Building on our cost reduction efforts, we successfully completed the consolidation of our West Coast distribution facilities in late February 2025.

We have also expanded our strategic wholesale partnerships to support our focus on meeting customers across diverse shopping channels, while maintaining an efficient, scalable growth model. With continued investment in our brand and diversification of our supply chain and selling channels, optimization of product margin, and a more streamlined cost structure, we believe we can drive a pronounced growth in operating cash flow in 2025.”

Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights:

Net revenue of $315.9 million, an 11% decrease compared to 2023, driven by a 12% decrease in Total Orders Placed and higher return rates offset by a 3% increase in Average Order Value (“AOV”) from $133 to $137, compared to 2023.

Active Customers of 2.6 million, a 7% decrease compared to 2.8 million in 2023.

Gross profit decreased 12% to $130.2 million and Gross Margin decreased 50 basis points to 41.2%, in each case compared to 2023.

Net loss of $55.3 million, compared to net loss of $19.3 million in 2023. Included in this net loss was a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $28.4 million. Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, our net loss was $26.9 million.

Adjusted EBITDA* of ($9.7) million, compared to $3.2 million in 2023.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.6 million, compared to $15.4 million in 2023.

Free Cash Flow* of ($0.3) million, compared to $11.5 million in 2023.

Total debt and Net Debt* increased by $5.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, during the fifty-two weeks ended December 29, 2024.

Note: “*” represents a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics” section below for definitions of these metrics.

Tiffany Smith, CFO of Lulus, said:

“The implementation of our cost reduction plans allowed us to deliver the narrowest quarterly net loss, excluding goodwill impairment, of the past six quarters. Selling, marketing, and general and administrative expenses in Q4 were $5.5 million lower year-over-year, a 15% decline that outpaced our 12% decline in net revenue. To further optimize costs, we consolidated our West Coast distribution facilities, a process which began in late Q4 2024 and was completed in Q1 2025. With major cost reduction initiatives in place, we remain committed to ongoing and disciplined cost management.

Looking ahead, in 2025, we remain focused on strengthening our cash position, returning to profitability, and maintaining healthy inventory turns. Our 2025 net revenue outlook reflects our expectation of continued momentum in special occasion and event wear, tempered by the ongoing repositioning of our casual categories. With a healthy inventory position, we anticipate reduced markdowns and margin expansion. Direct-to-factory initiatives can further bolster our margins in the latter part of 2025, and more significantly in 2026, giving us confidence in our long-term sales and profitability targets.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 Highlights:

Net revenue of $66.1 million, a decrease of 12% compared to $75.0 million in the same period last year, driven by a 12% decrease in Total Orders Placed and a 5% decrease in AOV from $136 to $129, which was offset by improved return rates.

Gross profit decreased 15% to $25.1 million and Gross Margin decreased 120 basis points to 37.9%, in each case compared to the same period last year.

Net loss of $31.9 million, compared to net loss of $7.2 million in the same period last year. Included in this net loss was a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $28.4 million. Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, our net loss was $3.5 million.

Adjusted EBITDA* of ($3.3) million, compared to ($2.0) million in the same period last year.

Net cash used in operating activities of $2.5 million, improved from $5.7 million in the same period last year.

Free Cash Flow* of ($3.0) million, improved from ($6.7) million in the same period last year.

Note: “*” represents a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics” section below for definitions of these metrics.

Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2025:

We expect net revenue to be between $280 million and $310 million, which represents a decrease of between 11% and 2% compared to 2024.

We expect Adjusted EBITDA to be between $0 and $6 million, which represents an increase of between $9.7 million and $15.7 million compared to 2024.

We expect capital expenditures to be between $2.5 million and $3.0 million, which represents a decrease of 13% or approximately flat compared to 2024.

We expect our Net Debt position for the first quarter of 2025 to be between $3 million and $4 million, and we expect to be operating cash flow positive in 2025, including in the first quarter of 2025.

Forecasting future results or trends is inherently difficult for any business, and actual results or trends may differ materially from those forecasted. Lulus’ outlook is based on current indications for its business. Lulus’ outlook factors in our current best estimates for anticipated headwinds, including those related to the level of demand, spending and returns by our customers, macroeconomic uncertainties, inflation, supply chain pressures, shipping costs, and the intended impact of cost-reduction measures. Given the volatile nature of current consumer demand and potential for further impacts to consumer behavior due to macroeconomic factors, including continued inflation, higher interest rates, student loan repayment resumption, global political changes, including as a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration, tariffs or bans, existing and future laws, regulations, and directives (including executive orders), as well as other world events, wars, and domestic and international conflicts that affect overall consumer confidence and the predictability of consumer purchasing behavior, Lulus’ financial outlook is subject to change.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we reference in this press release and the accompanying tables the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Net Debt and Free Cash Flow. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our ongoing core operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when analyzing historical performance and liquidity and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included at the end of this release. Definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and other operating metrics are presented below. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net (loss) income on a forward-looking basis cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, as we are unable to provide reconciling information with respect to equity-based compensation expense and income tax, all of which are adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA. We also use certain key operating metrics, including Gross Margin, Active Customers, Average Order Value, and Total Orders Placed.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net loss before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude the effects of equity-based compensation and goodwill impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of the impact of equity-based compensation and goodwill impairment, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin

Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) as a percentage of our net revenue.

Active Customers

We define Active Customers as the number of customers who have made at least one purchase across our platform in the prior 12-month period. Active Customer count is measured as of the last day of the relevant period. We consider the number of Active Customers to be a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to consumer awareness of our brand, our ability to attract visitors to our digital platform, and our ability to convert visitors to paying customers. Active Customer counts are based on de-duplication logic using customer account and guest checkout name, address, and email information.

Average Order Value

We define AOV as the sum of the total gross sales before returns across our platform in a given period, plus shipping revenue, less discounts and markdowns, divided by the Total Orders Placed (as defined below) in that period. AOV reflects average basket size of our customers. AOV may fluctuate as we continue investing in the development and introduction of new Lulus merchandise and as a result of our promotional discount activity.

Free Cash Flow

Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment. We view Free Cash Flow as an important indicator of our liquidity because it measures the amount of cash we generate.

Gross Margin

We define Gross Margin as gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue. Gross profit is equal to our net revenue less cost of revenue. Certain of our competitors and other retailers report cost of revenue differently than we do. As a result, the reporting of our gross profit and Gross Margin may not be comparable to other companies.

Net Debt

Net Debt is defined as total debt, which currently consists of the revolving line of credit, less cash and cash equivalents. We consider Net Debt to be an important supplemental measure of our financial position, which allows us to analyze our leverage.

Total Orders Placed

We define Total Orders Placed as the number of customer orders placed across our platform during a particular period. An order is counted on the day the customer places the order. We do not adjust the number of Total Orders Placed for any cancellation or return that may have occurred subsequent to a customer placing an order. We consider Total Orders Placed as a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to our ability to attract and retain customers as well as drive purchase frequency. Total Orders Placed, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net revenue we expect to generate in a particular period.

The Swedish fashion giant also posted a drop in profits for the latest quarter, driven by higher markdowns and heavy investments to win over customers.

H&M revealed on Thursday that net sales were up 2% to 55.3 billion over the three months to February 28, compared with the previous year.

It added that this slowed down to 1% this month amid continued pressure on consumer finances.

Sales growth was also knocked by H&M’s plans to trim its store estate and help simplify its operations over the past year.

H&M said it had 40 net store closures over the quarter, including 35 for the eponymous H&M brand while it also closed five Monki shops.

Its recent store overhaul left the retailer with 4,213 stores at the end of last month – a reduction of 125 over the past year.

The group, which also owns the Cos and & Other Stories brands, reported that gross profit for the quarter dipped slightly to £27.2 billion from £27.7 billion.

Daniel Erver, chief executive of the business, said: “Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering.

“We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.

“Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.”

The boss added that moves to improve its assortment of female clothing were “starting to have a positive effect” in the latest quarter.

ArcelorMittal is committed to producing innovative, sustainable steel products that use less energy and emit less carbon.

Negative Aspects

Financial Analyst Perspective

From a financial analyst's viewpoint, ArcelorMittal's release of its 2024 financial statements is a critical step in maintaining transparency and investor confidence. The reported revenue of $62.4 billion is a positive indicator of the company's market position and operational scale. However, the lack of detailed financial metrics such as net income, EBITDA, or cash flow statements in the press release limits a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health. Investors would benefit from additional insights into cost management strategies and profitability margins to better assess the company's performance and future outlook.

Market Research Analyst Perspective

As a market research analyst, ArcelorMittal's strong global presence and diverse customer base across industries such as automotive, engineering, and construction highlight its strategic positioning in the steel market. The company's focus on sustainable steel production aligns with global trends towards environmental responsibility and innovation. However, the press release lacks information on market dynamics, competitive positioning, and potential risks, which are crucial for understanding the company's market strategy and growth potential. Further analysis of regional market conditions and demand trends would provide a more comprehensive view of ArcelorMittal's market opportunities and challenges.

CEO Daniel Erver remains hopeful, emphasizing future reductions in brand investment costs and improvements in womenswear. The retailer continues to enhance competitiveness through celebrity collaborations and strategic pricing adjustments.

H&M’s sales saw only a 1% rise in March, following a weaker-than-expected first quarter, the Swedish fast-fashion retailer reported on Thursday. The sluggish growth highlights a challenging start to its spring and summer season.

Despite ramping up marketing efforts to revitalise its brand, returns on investment have been slow. Shares, which have already declined by 11% since the start of the year, dropped another 1% in early trading, reflecting concerns over lacklustre sales and reduced profitability.

CEO Daniel Erver acknowledged the company’s struggles, stating, “Even though we are making important strides, we are not satisfied with our first-quarter results,” as quoted by Reuters. He attributed the underwhelming performance to ongoing inflationary pressures that continue to limit consumer spending.

Erver, who has been leading H&M for just over a year, has been pushing for a turnaround with improved marketing and trendier fashion offerings. Efforts to make the brand more competitive with Zara and Shein include collaborations with high-profile celebrities such as Charli XCX.

For the December-to-February quarter, H&M posted sales of 55.3 billion Swedish crowns ($5.52 billion), reflecting a 2% increase in local currencies but falling short of analysts’ expectations of 55.9 billion crowns. March’s 1% growth was notably weaker than the 4% rise seen in the same period last year.

Regional performance varied, with sales slightly weaker in the U.S., the Nordics, and the UK, while Germany and Poland fared better. In response to rising import tariffs imposed by the U.S., CFO Adam Karlsson indicated that H&M might raise prices in the region, carefully monitoring competitors’ pricing strategies to maintain value-driven offerings.

Profitability took a hit in the first quarter due to increased discounting, marketing investments, and external economic factors. The operating profit margin fell to 2.2%, down from 3.9% a year ago. Analysts at RBC noted that higher markdowns, especially following a later Black Friday, also impacted results.

However, Erver remains optimistic, stating that brand investment costs should lessen in the second quarter, and improvements in H&M’s womenswear collection are already showing positive signs. The retailer continues to expand its celebrity collaborations, enlisting musicians Tyla and FKA Twigs to front its latest spring and summer campaigns.

H&M, which also owns brands like Arket, Cos, & Other Stories, and Weekday, is simultaneously upgrading its stores while streamlining its retail footprint. The company now operates 4,213 stores globally, its smallest store count since 2016.

Hennes & Mauritz AB reported a significant decrease in net profit for the first quarter as its financials were impacted by markdowns, ongoing investments, and a strong Swedish krona. The company’s net income for the three months ending February 28 was 579 million Swedish kronor (approximately $57.7 million), a decline of 53 percent from 1.23 billion kronor in the same period the previous year. This figure fell well below analysts’ expectations, which had predicted a net income of 1.28 billion kronor, according to a FactSet poll.

The company also saw its gross margin, a crucial profitability metric, narrow to 49.1 percent from 51.5 percent in the year-earlier period.

Despite these challenges, H&M recorded a 3 percent increase in sales, totaling 55.33 billion kronor (about $5.47 billion) from December 1 to February 28. Sales in local currency terms rose by 2 percent, even as the retailer operated around 3 percent fewer stores than in the previous year.

Looking ahead, H&M expects a 1 percent rise in sales in local currency terms for March.

“Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,” stated Daniel Ervér, CEO of H&M.

Ervér further explained the factors influencing the quarter’s profitability: “Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering.”

He added optimism for the near future, noting, “We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.”

The company saw positive sales trends across various regions in Europe, particularly in Germany and Poland. Additionally, online sales experienced growth as H&M expanded its upgraded e-commerce platform to more markets.

In an effort to optimize its store portfolio, H&M closed 40 underperforming locations during the quarter.

Ervér emphasized the company’s strategic focus: “Our main priorities are a strengthened product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand. Through this we create the conditions for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth.”",https://theimpression.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/HM-Spring-2025-News-The-Impression-001.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 16:04:10.699419

Meanwhile, Intel bolstered its board through the appointments of Eric Meurice, former CEO of chipmaking equipment provider ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim CEO of Microchip Technology, in December.

The news comes as the company also reported it provided $27.4 million in compensation last year to former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was forced out late in the year as Intel struggled financially.

Since late last year, the company has been reshuffling its board to make it more chip industry focused as it attempts to reclaim its lost glory under new leadership.

The latest move will shrink the size of the board to 11.

Intel is in the middle of investing $28 billion into two production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany. The project has been delayed multiple years as the company has struggled financially, and it is not expected to not open until 2031 or 2032.

The members retiring include Omar Ishrak, former CEO of medical device maker Medtronic, who had in January 2023 stepped down as Intel's chairperson but stayed on as a director.

Tsu-Jae King Liu, a dean at the College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, a former professor of population health and health equity at the University of Pennsylvania, are the others leaving the board.

Meanwhile, Intel bolstered its board through the appointments of Eric Meurice, former CEO of chipmaking equipment provider ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim CEO of Microchip Technology, in December.

The changes mark a departure from Intel's previous board structure, which was populated by leaders in academia and finance, as well as former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries.

""We are committed to having the right mix of skills, qualifications and technical expertise on the Board,"" Chairperson Frank Yeary said in the filing on Thursday.

All other current directors will stand for reelection.

Focused on product and foundry

CEO Tan said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday that ""to enable great products,"" he was ""equally focused"" on the company's product business and contract chip manufacturing business - the center of a turnaround strategy championed by former CEO Gelsinger.

Gelsinger's total severance payment stands at about $7.9 million and he has forfeited all his outstanding unvested equity awards, the company said.

Tan, who in August left Intel's board due to disagreements over the company's revival plan, rejoined as a director along with his appointment as CEO.

""We will remain focused on executing this plan to reduce our operating expenses and capital expenditures, simplify our portfolio and eliminate organizational complexity,"" Tan said, referring to the cost-savings plan introduced last year under Gelsinger, which included a 15% workforce reduction.

“These declines reflect deeper issues for Starbucks, including a misalignment with customer expectations,” wrote Laurence Newell, managing director of Brand Finance Americas. “Starbucks' heavy focus on app-based sales has drawn criticism from loyal customers who value the brand's traditional coffeehouse experience. Combined with its high prices, this shift has contributed to a decline in sales and growing dissatisfaction among consumers.”

KFC, Subway, and Taco Bell maintained their spots in the top 5. Chick-fil-A surged into the top 10 following a 43% increase in its brand value. Wendy’s also leapt into the top 10 following a 12% increase in value.

“These declines reflect deeper issues for Starbucks, including a misalignment with customer expectations,” wrote Laurence Newell, managing director of Brand Finance Americas. “Starbucks' heavy focus on app-based sales has drawn criticism from loyal customers who value the brand's traditional coffeehouse experience. Combined with its high prices, this shift has contributed to a decline in sales and growing dissatisfaction among consumers.”

KFC, Subway, and Taco Bell maintained their spots in the top 5. Chick-fil-A surged into the top 10 following a 43% increase in its brand value. Wendy’s also leapt into the top 10 following a 12% increase in value.

Burger King and Chipotle dropped out of the top 10.

“Chick-fil-A's commitment to high-quality ingredients and its simple, chicken-focused menu has not only fueled its success but also pushed competitors to elevate their own chicken-based offerings. Brand Finance data underscores Chick-fil-A's strong brand equity, with top-tier scores across key metrics, including ‘familiarity’ (9.6/10), ‘meets my needs’ (9.9 out of 10), and ‘brand I know well’ (10/10),” Brand Finance said in its report.

STOCKHOLM--Swedish fast-fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz posted lower-than-expected earnings as increased discounting, investments and a negative effect from factors like currencies and freight costs all hit profitability.

H&M sales in its fiscal first quarter--which runs from December through February--rose 2% in local currencies though sales momentum slowed in the final month of the quarter. It had previously reported 4% growth in the December to January period.

Analysts at Barclays had expected first-quarter sales to rise 2% in local currencies, with a boost from the timing of Black Friday being offset by the fact that there was one fewer trading day this year after last year's leap year.

The timing of Black Friday also meant that logistics costs increased in the first quarter and there was more discounting as part of the promotional shopping period.

""Sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned - but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,"" Chief Executive Daniel Erver said.

The company is investing heavily in new product ranges and marketing as it seeks to regain market share in an increasingly competitive environment. It said headwinds from the investments, as well as from discounting and external factors such as currency, will ease going forward, having a significantly smaller overall negative effect in the second quarter than the first.

Combined with deeper collaboration with strategic suppliers, theses factors will become a tailwind in the second half, it said.

It reported a gross margin of 49.1% in the quarter, versus the 50.5% expected by Barclays, while the operating margin slipped to 2.2% from 3.9%, missing the 3.8% expected by Barclays.

H&M's Erver has made growing sales a priority at the Swedish group through investments in improving its product offering, enhancing its digital services to boost the customer experience and increase brand awareness through higher marketing spend.

H&M still counts Asia as a large sourcing region, which has left it vulnerable to extended transportation times due to the disruption in the Red Sea, but the company has also been investing to bring more manufacturing closer to its major markets, improving supply chain flexibility and product availability.

The disruption in the Red Sea with longer transport times is continuing to affect inventory, pushing the company to have more goods on hand to ensure supply. The value of inventory held in stock rose by 9% in the quarter on year and H&M expects a higher level of discounting in the second quarter than a year ago.

""With a higher share of nearshoring, a more efficient and more flexible supply chain and more purchasing in season, there are opportunities for improvement of the stock-in-trade position in the second half of the year compared with the previous year,"" the company said.

It said it continues to plan for extended transport times and to manage disruption in the supply chain while also closely monitoring developments in global trade and trade restrictions.

H&M reported a net profit of 590 million Swedish kronor ($58.7 million) for the first quarter to Feb. 28, compared with 1.24 billion kronor a year earlier as sales rose 3.1% to 55.33 billion kronor. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected net profit of 1.28 billion kronor on sales of 55.86 billion kronor.

The company said sales in March are expected to increase by 1% in local currencies, compared with the same period the previous year.

CEO Daniel Ervér said sales development was “good in western, southern and eastern Europe, with positive development in Germany and Poland”. Online sales continued to develop well too, “which shows that customers appreciate our upgraded digital store”.

He added that the business is continuing to optimise the store portfolio by closing select stores: “We went into the quarter with nearly 120 fewer stores compared to the same time last year and we had 40 net store closures during the period.”

But highlighting the sluggish sales growth and the profitability issues, he said: “We made important progress in our plan and have good cost control [yet] our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned. But the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.

“We can see that the improvements we have made, especially in the women’s assortment, are starting to have a positive effect. Here we have simplified the organisation and become faster at adapting to new trends and creating a more relevant assortment. During the year we are implementing similar improvements for all our customer groups.”

Through its omni-model, the group is continuing to integrate the physical and digital sales channels, “making it easier for our customers to find what they are looking for,” he said. “The upgraded digital store was rolled out to more markets in the quarter and has been well received by our customers. Upgrades to our physical stores continues to be given high priority. In addition to rebuilds of key stores in several major cities, we are expanding customer experience upgrades to more stores in more markets during the year”.","https://media.fashionnetwork.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=cover,width=600,height=600,format=auto/m/8735/8f73/af46/2fed/33bc/211c/9317/9cec/a9b6/d70b/d70b.jpg",N,,2025-03-27 12:17:17.964652

H&M Q1 sales miss expectations, up 2%

March sales grow by just 1%

Operating profit margin falls to 2.2%

H&M CEO says marketing investments will bear fruit

By Helen Reid

LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) – H&M’s HMb.ST sales were up just 1% in March after a weaker than expected first quarter, the Swedish fast-fashion retailer reported on Thursday, in a sign of a slow start to its spring and summer season.

H&M has ramped up marketing spend in a bid to boost its brand but the returns on that investment have been slow to appear. Its shares, down 11% since the start of the year, fell 1% in early trading in response to the anaemic sales growth and lower profitability.

“Even if we are taking important steps, we are not satisfied with our result in the first quarter,” CEO Daniel Erver said in a call with analysts.

“We are still in a high inflation climate where the customers’ spending power is limited, so we stay very focused on providing outstanding value for money.”

Erver, who has led H&M for just over a year, is trying to turn its fortunes around through better marketing and more fashionable clothes, spending on pop stars like Charli XCX to model its collections as he tries to make the brand more desirable and able to compete more effectively against Zara and Shein.

The company’s sales of 55.3 billion Swedish crowns ($5.52 billion) for the December to February quarter, were up 2% in local currencies but below analysts’ mean estimate of 55.9 billion Swedish crowns. March sales growth was weaker than the 4% increase reported a year ago.

Sales were slightly weaker in the U.S., the Nordics and the UK in the first quarter, Erver said, while Germany and Poland performed better.

In the U.S., H&M will likely hike prices to mitigate the impact of import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, chief financial officer Adam Karlsson told analysts.

“We will follow how competitors do this and we will be very diligent in how we assess that we continue to give relatively better value than anyone else,” Karlsson said.

H&M’s biggest manufacturing hubs are China, where the U.S. has already placed an additional 20% tariff on imports, and Bangladesh, one of the countries at risk of so-called “reciprocal” tariffs Trump plans to announce on April 2.

Increased discounting, marketing investments and “negative external factors” impacted H&M’s profitability in the quarter, with the operating profit margin falling to 2.2% from 3.9% in the same period a year ago.

Markdowns were higher than expected due to a later Black Friday, RBC analysts said.

Erver said the hit to profitability from investments in the brand would be smaller in the second quarter, and improvements to H&M’s womenswear product assortment were starting to have a positive effect.

H&M reported first quarter earnings that came in below expectations, with analysts saying it was another disappointing update from the high street clothing chain.

The shares fell 5% in early trading but by mid-morning were up 2%, having already fallen over 20% over the past six months.

Earnings per share were 0.37 Swedish krona (SEK), around 40% below the consensus of SEK 0.62, as group sales rose 2% in constant currency to SEK 55.3 billion, missing consensus of SEK 55.8 billion.

Gross margin declined by 240 basis points to 49.1%, impacted by higher markdowns, investment in the product range and negative external effects.

Operating expenses were flat year-on-year and represented 46.9% of sales. EBIT margin fell to 2.2%, missing the consensus forecast of 3.2%.

Inventory rose 9% to SEK 41 billion, while store numbers fell to 4,949 following 40 closures.

Current trading indicates March sales will rise 1% in local currency. Gross margin pressure is expected to persist into the second quarter, though with less impact than the first quarter.

Deutsche Bank noted limited support for the share price outside of possible share purchases by the Persson family.

""Another disappointing update from H&M today despite expectations already being relatively low,"" analysts said.

In terms of outlook, they said the external drivers for gross margin ""are expected to be negative but with less gross margin pressure"" than in the first quarter, and there is ""a risk"" of further currency translation pressure given the stronger SEK that may weigh on consensus as well.

""Given current trading is at the weaker end of expectations and [second quarter] gross margin still looks under pressure, we see the shares down LSD-MSD% [low single digits to mid single digit] today.

""The valuation provides some support but we would expect some Persson family purchasing of shares to be the only material factor to help the share price.""",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzAzXC8yMDIzLTAzLTMwLTE1LTM0LTM1LWI3ZjEyOTA1OWY4Mzg3NTFkNjBjNTEyNTIwN2JjMmM3LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-03-27 12:17:34.758413

The Swedish fashion giant also posted a drop in profits for the latest quarter, driven by higher markdowns and heavy investments to win over customers.

H&M revealed on Thursday that net sales were up 2% to 55.3 billion over the three months to February 28, compared with the previous year.

It added that this slowed down to 1% this month amid continued pressure on consumer finances.

Sales growth was also knocked by H&M’s plans to trim its store estate and help simplify its operations over the past year.

Its recent store overhaul left the retailer with 4,213 stores at the end of last month – a reduction of 125 over the past year.

The group, which also owns the Cos and & Other Stories brands, reported that gross profit for the quarter dipped slightly to £27.2 billion from £27.7 billion.

Daniel Erver, chief executive of the business, said: “Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering.

“We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.

“Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.”

The decline was attributed to external economic pressures, increased markdowns, and a strengthened Swedish krona, which negatively affected currency remeasurement.

H&M also cited extended transport delays in the Red Sea continued to affect inventory.

LONDON (Reuters) -H&M's sales were up just 1% in March after a weaker than expected first quarter, the Swedish fast-fashion retailer reported on Thursday, in a sign of a slow start to its spring and summer season.

H&M has ramped up marketing spend in a bid to boost its brand but the returns on that investment have been slow to appear. Its shares, down 11% since the start of the year, fell 1% in early trading in response to the anaemic sales growth and lower profitability.

""Even if we are taking important steps, we are not satisfied with our result in the first quarter,"" CEO Daniel Erver said in a call with analysts.

""We are still in a high inflation climate where the customers' spending power is limited, so we stay very focused on providing outstanding value for money.""

Erver, who has led H&M for just over a year, is trying to turn its fortunes around through better marketing and more fashionable clothes, spending on pop stars like Charli XCX to model its collections as he tries to make the brand more desirable and able to compete more effectively against Zara and Shein.

The company's sales of 55.3 billion Swedish crowns ($5.52 billion) for the December to February quarter, were up 2% in local currencies but below analysts' mean estimate of 55.9 billion Swedish crowns. March sales growth was weaker than the 4% increase reported a year ago.

Sales were slightly weaker in the U.S., the Nordics and the UK in the first quarter, Erver said, while Germany and Poland performed better.

In the U.S., H&M will likely hike prices to mitigate the impact of import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, chief financial officer Adam Karlsson told analysts.

""We will follow how competitors do this and we will be very diligent in how we assess that we continue to give relatively better value than anyone else,"" Karlsson said.

H&M's biggest manufacturing hubs are China, where the U.S. has already placed an additional 20% tariff on imports, and Bangladesh, one of the countries at risk of so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs Trump plans to announce on April 2.

Increased discounting, marketing investments and ""negative external factors"" impacted H&M's profitability in the quarter, with the operating profit margin falling to 2.2% from 3.9% in the same period a year ago.

Markdowns were higher than expected due to a later Black Friday, RBC analysts said.

Erver said the hit to profitability from investments in the brand would be smaller in the second quarter, and improvements to H&M's womenswear product assortment were starting to have a positive effect.

After hosting a string of Charli XCX concerts last year, H&M has continued to invest in big-name brand ambassadors, hiring musicians Tyla and FKA Twigs to model its spring and summer collection launched last week.

The retailer, which also owns brands including Arket, Cos, & Other Stories, and Weekday, has been upgrading stores and sharply reducing its overall number of stores. H&M has 4,213 stores globally, it reported on Thursday, its smallest store footprint since 2016.

As an industry, that is going to become table stakes.” Cultural Relevance Speaking of cultural moments, Gap is currently in the midst of one.","Between the tariff tug-of-war, flailing markets, insanely high egg prices and general “twitchiness” (as one strategist put it), consumers have gotten a bit hard to nail down lately. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the dominating “talk” among retail executives at Shoptalk this week has revolved around what exactly consumers want and need right now.

One thing is clear — it’s not AI. (Although AI may be the vehicle that helps retailers give it to them.) In fact, AI was held at a pleasant distance at the annual retail conference, which kicked off Tuesday in Las Vegas. While the world’s favorite two-letter acronym for the past 18 months did crop up, of course, it wasn’t the central focus of the event. Instead, executives from across the retail spectrum zeroed in on how they’re connecting with and serving consumers in this complicated economic and geopolitical moment.

Here’s what some of the leading minds in retail say consumers need now.

Products that Perform

Consumer appliance brand SharkNinja develops 25 products from the ground up every year, which puts the company in a pretty good position to know what consumers are looking for. In some cases, it may be a product that taps into the latest TikTok trend or delivers new functionality to a mainstay category like vacuums. But at the end of the day, the common theme is developing “products that consumers love; that is where our business starts and stops,” said SharkNinja CEO Mark Barrocas in a keynote address.

“The consumer is incredibly discerning — we’re not competing against other small appliance companies; we’re competing against restaurants, we’re competing against vacations,” Barrocas said. “The consumer has a certain amount of money to spend, and they’re going to decide the best way for them to spend those dollars, so we’ve got to work hard developing the best product and getting the consumer excited. We can’t be in a break-to-fix business because our products last for years. We’ve got to put our products into retirement before [the end of] their usable life [with new innovations].”

But creating innovative, high-quality products that differentiate has become even harder in a world of dupes, according to Barrocas: “You get a one-year head start,” he said. “We come to market with a product, and we know that that product is going to get bought by 50 competitors within the first month, and they’re going to tear it down, they’re going to reverse engineer, they’re going to figure out how to make it cheaper, so we need to keep innovating.”

There’s no fighting the speed at which the world now moves. Instead, Barrocas believes the only option is to “embrace the plan changing, embrace the pivoting and spot the smoke early,” he said. “Don’t wait for there to be a raging fire before you realize there’s a problem. If there’s a small puff of smoke, start pivoting and start figuring out how you need to maneuver. What I’m most proud of is the ability to be able to spot challenges in the business and react quickly.”

Persuasive Storytelling

One of the newer ways retailers are connecting with consumers (and helping brands do the same) is through media offerings. Lisa Valentino — who became President of Ads at Best Buy five months ago after years at more traditional media companies like Yahoo, ESPN, Condé Nast and Disney — talked about retail media’s power to serve at “the intersection of influence and performance.”

Regardless of its relative newness, Valentino said that retail media is still media, and traditional tenets still apply: “Media is about persuasive storytelling. It’s all about creating a palette for brands to create those really important connections with consumers; that’s what media should do,” she advised. And this applies to both the newer retail media networks and companies that have ruled the media landscape for decades.

For retailers, that storytelling must also take place in stores, which have become a unique proposition in the evolving (and expanding) media landscape. “Everything we’re trying to do is to better the customer experience and better serve them,” shared Aaron Dunford, VP of Media at Nordstrom. “How do we help people feel good and look their best? When we widen the aperture of what commerce media is and take that broader definition, it allows us to better help and serve our customers through those media channels.”

As an example, Dunford pointed to one of the retailer’s earliest offerings, which was to give brand partners access to the company’s famed stylists. He also talked about unique in-store seasonal installations that drive brand discovery, including an alpine-themed yurt and a new immersive swim shop.

“Retail should be inspirational,” Dunford said. “What we’re looking to do is create an environment for our customer in stores where they can not only find the product they love, but be inspired by some of the best brands in the world. We’ve really been focused on, not necessarily screens per se, but how do we build a curated, experiential, visually compelling content experience for our customers?”

Contextual Relevance

Another core tenet of media is ensuring that content, especially advertising, is relevant to viewers. Retailers are finding unique ways to take this to new levels via their media offerings.

Harvey Ma, VP and General Manager of the Sam’s Club Member Access Platform media offering, talked about the kinds of ads now available on its in-store “scan-and-go” mobile self-checkout devices. Beyond being delivered at a highly relevant moment, the content itself also is carefully curated to that moment. “Those ads don’t always feel like ads,” he said. “Some of them are ‘Did you forget?’ or ‘You might like this’ types of additive experiences.”

“At Sam’s Club we’ve got a very highly technical term for commerce media — shopping,” added Ma. “Joking aside, commerce media is just getting the right ads at the right time to the right people in the right space.”

And as retailers enter the media space, legacy media companies are steadily moving into commerce, bringing in contextual shopping experiences.

Alison Levin, President of Advertising and Partnerships at NBCUniversal, isn’t a huge fan of the term “legacy,” but recognizes the need to distinguish between new and more seasoned players in media: “NBCU has this incredible reach, this IP, this emotional connection and executional excellence,” she said. “Call it what you want to call it; you can call it legacy, but it works, and it’s continued to work for a really, really long time.”

Case in point was the recent Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary event. “When you think about engagement, moments that matter for a brand, there’s no better example of that than SNL 50,” said Levin. “This was a cultural phenomenon the entire country was talking about it, and we had brands that integrated into the content like they’ve never done before.” One prime example was Capital One’s “Delicious Dish” spot.

“There have been incredible advancements in shoppability on the TV screen and removing the friction that existed before we had QR codes,” Levin added. “We have AI now that scans content to find what’s in the show and [is] available to buy it after. We have cart integration. As an industry, that is going to become table stakes.”

Cultural Relevance

Speaking of cultural moments, Gap is currently in the midst of one. Following years of flagging performance, Gap’s profit and sales exceeded forecasts this past holiday shopping season, and the company is beginning to enjoy the results of a massive turnaround effort led by President and CEO Richard Dickson.

Central to this effort has been answering the question, “Why do we exist?” said Dickson. “Does anybody really need another pair of jeans or another T-shirt or Oxford, or anything for that matter? We had to find our point of difference, and then the next stage of that is taking cues from insights, cultural trends, design trends, what’s hot, what’s not, cultural conversations and [determining] how we integrate our brand into the cultural conversation to be relevant. If you’re relevant enough, it eventually drives [consumers] to you.”

Part of this effort has involved drawing on Gap’s legacy in American retail, which, among other initiatives, included the resurfacing of a series of portrait collaborations with cultural icons from the ’90s, including Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, Missy Elliott and others. The next step is identifying “who are the ‘originals’ of today and tomorrow” and working with them, said Dickson. The goal is to “perpetuate that legacy by creating narratives around today’s influencers, today’s cultural periods, today’s artists and original thinkers that ultimately will be celebrated and given a Gap portrait, which keeps the brand’s legacy alive but then translates it into cultural relevance for today.”

Immediate Access

It’s not only the product innovation cycle that has sped up — consumers also expect to find and get those products fast. DoorDash and CVS can attest to this reality.

Since its inception as a restaurant delivery service in 2013, DoorDash has rapidly expanded well beyond the food category; in fact, the company just added footwear retailer DSW to its roster of non-restaurant brands, which now also includes Home Depot, Five Below, David’s Bridal, Starbucks, Hustler Hollywood and many others.

Mike Goldblatt, VP of Grocery and Retail Partnerships at DoorDash, said that last-minute, urgent purchases are the most common entry point into DoorDash’s non-restaurant offerings for consumers who used to be, or still are, a restaurant customer of DoorDash.

“We launched seven new categories last year, and as we’re introducing these categories to customers, the typical first purchase is going to be [along the lines of], ‘I’m missing this thing; I need it right now,’” Goldblatt said. “But then a switch goes off with the consumer where we build frequency and lifetime value as they start thinking of Best Buy or Dick’s Sporting Goods on DoorDash. I know I can get a quick need, but I also know the full selection is available.”

(For a fun example, check out this TikTok of a New Yorker who DoorDashed shorts from Dick’s while on a date.)

The immediate availability of a wide array of products is the key to drawing in consumers at CVS as well, where the retail business (as opposed to its pharmacy offerings) accounted for three-quarters of foot traffic last year.

“If you want tennis balls, you can wait for them to be delivered or you can go to a big-box sporting goods store, but if you’re on the way to the courts shouldn’t you be able to go somewhere really convenient along the way?” said Musab Balbale, SVP and Chief Merchandising Officer of CVS Health during a session. “It’s almost like the old general store — that is the core of what we offer.”

Learn more about how CVS is achieving that goal with an intricate localization strategy here.

Value Without Compromise

The last but certainly not least pillar in this current economic moment is value. But as a number of executives pointed out, consumers today expect value without having to compromise convenience or ethics.

“Customers are just not willing to sacrifice,” said Kevin Tulip, U.S. President of Primark. “They want and expect value, but they’re not looking to sacrifice on experience or the environment or which trend or season they’re looking at.”

This can be a tough nut to crack, especially for companies operating at the lower end of the price spectrum. But Primark has found a way to do it. “Overall, price is what we’ve built the business around, and over the last 15, 16 years, we have continued to build on top of that quality, style and trends.",https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Shoptalk-stage-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 12:17:08.595462

ROCKVILLE, Md. and SUZHOU, China, March 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ascentage Pharma Group International (Ascentage Pharma) (NASDAQ: AAPG; HKEX: 6855) (referred hereinto as “Ascentage Pharma,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), a global, integrated biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering, developing and commercializing therapies to address global unmet medical needs primarily in hematological malignancies, today reported its unaudited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2024, and provided updates on key clinical and commercial developments.

Dr. Dajun Yang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ascentage Pharma, said, “As we reflect on our achievements in 2024, I am delighted to report that Ascentage Pharma has made remarkable strides in advancing our mission to deliver innovative therapies to patients worldwide. The commercialization of olverembatinib in China has gained significant traction in 2024 and is poised for growth in 2025 as all approved indications of olverembatinib are now covered under China’s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), markedly enhancing affordability and accessibility for patients across China.”

He continued, “Our momentum continued with the advancement of lisaftoclax. In November 2024, the New Drug Application (NDA) for lisaftoclax for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) was accepted by the Center of Drug Evaluation (CDE) of China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) with Priority Review designation. This acceptance marks a pivotal step toward bringing this novel therapy to patients in need.”

“Our clinical development programs also achieved significant progress over the past year. In February 2024, olverembatinib received clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a global registrational Phase III clinical trial (POLARIS-2), for patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase (CML-CP) with or without T315I mutation who have previously failed tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. In 2024, we also received clearance to commence two registrational Phase III clinical trials for APG-2449, a focal adhesion kinase (FAK), third generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and receptor tyrosine kinase C-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) inhibitor, for treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). At the moment, we are conducting ten global registrational trials, including two that were cleared by the FDA, for our three late-stage products, olverembatinib, lisaftoclax and APG-2449. These milestones highlight our commitment to addressing unmet medical needs through rigorous clinical innovation.”

“We believe Ascentage Pharma is on a transformative path to becoming a global leader in oncology innovation. The commercialization of olverembatinib in China, the progress of lisaftoclax, the continued development of our other clinical-stage small molecule drug assets, and our strategic agreement with Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG (Takeda) reflect the strength of our pipeline and our ability to execute on our goals. In 2025, we remain focused on accelerating the development and delivery of life-changing therapies, expanding our global footprint, and creating sustainable value for all stakeholders.”

Key Business and Pipeline Updates

Olverembatinib (HQP1351), a novel, next-generation TKI and the first third-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI, has been approved in China for treatment of patients with CML-CP or Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Accelerated Phase (CML-AP) with T315I mutations and CML-CP that is resistant and/or intolerant to first and second-generation TKIs.

Commercial progress

Revenue from sales of olverembatinib in China was US$33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$11.1 million, or 52%. As of December 31, 2024, the number of direct-to-pharmacy (DTP) pharmacies and hospitals where olverembatinib is on formulary reached 734. In particular, the number of hospitals where olverembatinib is on formulary increased 86% compared to December 31, 2023.

In November 2024, a new indication – adult patients with CML-CP resistant and/or intolerant of first-and second-generation TKIs – for olverembatinib was included in China’s NRDL through the simplified contract renewal procedure. Concurrently, the contracts for indications of olverembatinib which has been included China’s NRDL since 2022 were renewed successfully. The current indications of olverembatnib eligible for reimbursement includes adult patients with CML-CP or CML-AP with T315I mutation, and adult patients with CML-CP that are resistant and/or intolerant of first-and second-generation TKIs.

Clinical progress

After receiving clearance from the CDE of China’s NMPA in May 2024, we commenced enrollment in a registrational Phase III clinical trial of olverembatinib for the treatment of patients with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who have failed prior systemic treatment (POLARIS-3).

After receiving clearance from the FDA in February 2024, we commenced enrollment in a registrational Phase III clinical trial of olverembatinib for previously treated CML-CP patients, both with and without T315I mutation (POLARIS-2).

We continue enrollment in a registrational Phase III clinical trial of olverembatinib in combination with chemotherapy versus imatinib in combination with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+ ALL) (POLARIS-1).

We obtained Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for olverembatinib in March 2025 from the CDE of China’s NMPA for combination with low-intensity chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of newly-diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL.

Anticipated progress

We plan to seek clearance from the FDA to initiate a registrational Phase III clinical trial in newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients.

Lisaftoclax (APG-2575) is a novel, oral Bcl-2 inhibitor developed to treat a variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors by selectively blocking Bcl-2 to restore the normal apoptosis process in cancer cells.

Regulatory progress

NDA for lisaftoclax monotherapy for the treatment of R/R CLL or small SLL was accepted with Priority Review designation by the CDE of China’s NMPA in November 2024.

Clinical progress

After lisaftoclax received initial clearance by the CDE of China’s NMPA in May 2024, we commenced enrollment of patients in a global, multicenter, registrational Phase III clinical trial of lisaftoclax in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients who are newly diagnosed with higher risk (HR) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (GLORA-4).

We continue enrollment in a global registrational Phase III clinical trial of lisaftoclax for the treatment of newly diagnosed old or unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (GLORA-3).

We continue enrollment in a global registrational Phase III clinical trial to evaluate lisaftoclax in combination with the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib, versus immunochemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with CLL/SLL (GLORA-2) to validate a fixed duration of combination regimen as a first-line treatment.

We continue enrollment in a global registrational Phase III clinical trial of lisaftoclax in combination with BTK inhibitors in patients with CLL/SLL previously treated with BTK inhibitors (GLORA).

We continue Phase 1b/2 clinical trials of lisaftoclax in combination therapies for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in China and the United States.

Anticipated progress

We plan to seek clearance from the FDA to initiate a registrational Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of patients who are newly diagnosed with HR MDS.

APG-2449 is a novel, orally active, small-molecule FAK, the third generation of ALK and receptor tyrosine kinase ROS1 triple ligase TKI.

Clinical progress

APG-2449 was cleared by the CDE of NMPA in October 2024 to initiate two registrational Phase III clinical trials to evaluate APG-2449 in patients with NSCLC who are either resistant to or intolerant of second-generation ALK TKIs or treatment-naïve patients with ALK-positive advanced or locally advanced NSCLC.

Business Updates

We entered into an exclusive option agreement in June 2024 with Takeda (Exclusive Option Agreement), pursuant to which Ascentage Pharma granted Takeda an exclusive option to enter into an exclusive license for olverembatinib. If exercised, the Exclusive Option Agreement would allow Takeda to license global rights to develop and commercialize olverembatinib in all territories outside of China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Russia.

We received a US$100 million intellectual property income and option payment from Takeda in July 2024 under the Exclusive Option Agreement.

We completed a US$75 million equity investment from Takeda in June 2024.

We completed Ascentage Pharma’s U.S. initial public offering of American depositary shares in January 2025, resulting in net proceeds of US$132.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.

Full Year 2024 Unaudited Financial Results

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was US$134.3 million, compared to US$30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$103.8 million, or 342%. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an option payment of US$100 million received in June 2024 from Takeda pursuant to the Exclusive Option Agreement, sales of olverembatinib of US$33.0 million, a 52% year-over-year increase, commercialization rights income from Innovent Biologics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. and management fee income.

Selling and distribution expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$26.9 million, compared to US$26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$0.1 million, or 0.3%. The increase was attributable to selling and distribution expenses incurred in the commercialization of olverembatinib and other products.

Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$129.8 million, compared to US$97.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$32.5 million, or 34.0%. The increase was attributable to higher clinical research expenses.

Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$25.6 million, compared to US$24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$0.7 million, or 3.3%. The increase was due to the increase in the agency fees for the U.S. initial public offering.

Finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$8.8 million, compared to US$13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented a decrease of US$4.4 million, or 32.9%. The decrease was due to the interest rate incurred in relation to bank borrowings.

Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$1.2 million, compared to US$0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$0.5 million, or 74.4%. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in donation expenses.

Loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was US$55.6 million, compared to US$127.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented a decrease of US$71.8 million, or 56.2%. The loss per share attributable to ordinary equity holders was $0.18 per ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $0.45 per ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cash and bank balances for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$172.8 million, compared to US$150.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase by US$22.3 million, or 15.3%. The increase was primarily due to the US$100.0 million intellectual property income and option payment under the Exclusive Option Agreement and US$75.0 million equity investment from Takeda. Part of the Takeda option payment was treated as intellectual property income.

Following our initial public offering in January 2025, which resulted in net proceeds of $132.5 million, as of March 27, 2025, we believe that these net proceeds, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, our loan facilities, future sales and other potential payments, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2027.

Revenue exceeded 140 billion rubles, with production approaching 950,000 tonnes of finished products per year, the company told Interfax.

In monetary terms, the company's market share reached 13.2% in 2024 (data from NielsenIQ retail audit).

Last year's investment exceeded 7 billion rubles and was directed towards modernizing production and IT equipment, expanding production capacities and a number of marketing initiatives, the company said.

H&N remains one of the largest purchasers of raw milk in Russia, it said. It currently works with over 300 farms. Milk procurement volumes increased 14.3% in 2024. The company purchases approximately 95,000 tonnes of raw milk each month.

Over 20 import substitution projects for packaging, ingredients and services were implemented last year, including scarce production materials. The majority of packaging used (over 94%) is produced in Russia, with some types sourced from partners in China and the UAE.

One of the company's strategic priorities is export. Regular shipments have been established to Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Armenia, Georgia and Mongolia. Exports of ultra-pasteurized milk to China have begun. Pilot sales are being prepared for Middle Eastern markets (UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia).

H&M on Thursday posted weaker-than-expected sales in the fiscal first quarter in a slow start to the year as depressed demand continues to weigh on the world's second-largest clothing retailer.

Sales at the Swedish fashion giant rose 2% in local currencies to 55.33 billion Swedish krona ($5.5 billion) year-on-year in the three-month period to Feb. 28, slightly below the 55.86 billion forecast by LSEG analysts.

Shares were down 1.6% by 8:08 a.m. London time.

Operating profit totaled 1.2 billion in the company's first quarter, versus 1.9 billion Swedish krona expected, resulting in an operating margin of 2.2%.

The retailer attributed the weaker operating profit to ""negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering,"" which impacted gross margins.

The company noted, however, that such factors were ""estimated to already be significantly smaller in the second quarter,"" pointing to an anticipated 1% annual uptick in March sales.

""Our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,"" CEO Daniel Ervér said in a statement.

""Our main priorities are a strengthened product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand. Through this we create the conditions for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth,"" he added.

It follows several consecutive quarters of weak sales for the Swedish fashion giant, which has struggled to close a widening gap with Inditex-owned rival Zara and higher competition from lower-cost retailers such as Chinese-founded fast fashion giant Shein.

The results mark the latest test for CEO Ervér, who was appointed to the role in January 2024 to accelerate the group's turnaround.

Sales increased by 2% in local currencies to SEK 55.3 billion (£4.3bn), falling slightly short of analyst expectations.

H&M said the decline in profits was primarily driven by external pressures, including challenging macroeconomic conditions, which were compounded by increased markdowns during the quarter.

The retailer also noted that it continued to invest heavily in enhancing its customer offering, which impacted gross margins.

“Our operating profit was affected by the temporary challenges related to gross margin development, as well as the ongoing investments in our customer proposition,” said CEO Daniel Ervér.

“Despite these hurdles, we remain focused on strengthening our product offering and improving our in-store and online shopping experience.”

Despite the weaker-than-expected results, Ervér remained optimistic about the long-term prospects of the business, adding: “We continue to invest in our core business, focusing on driving growth through a more integrated and efficient customer experience across both physical and digital channels. We’re confident that the measures we’re taking will support sustainable and profitable growth in the coming months.”

H&M also provided an update on its store network, revealing that it has opened a number of new stores during the quarter, as well as expanding its digital presence through new marketplace initiatives.

March sales growth was weaker than the 4% increase reported a year ago.

""Our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned - but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,"" CEO Daniel Erver said in a statement.

Increased discounting and marketing investments impacted H&M's profitability in the quarter, the company said, with the operating profit margin falling to 2.2% from 3.9% in the same time a year ago.

Erver, who has led H&M for just over a year, is trying to turn its fortunes around through better marketing, spending on pop stars like Charli XCX to model its collections as he tries to make the brand more desirable and better compete against Zara and Shein.

In his statement, Erver said the hit to profitability from investments in the brand would be smaller in the second quarter, and improvements to H&M's womenswear product assortment were starting to have a positive effect.

Sustainability is a key priority for us, fundamental to how we operate and essential for our long-term success. This report shows the result of the work of thousands of passionate colleagues around the world, united not only by our love for fashion and design, but also by our deep commitment to using our power and scale to push the fashion industry towards a more inclusive and sustainable future,” says Daniel Ervér, CEO H&M Group.

Together with the annual and sustainability report, H&M Group also publishes its sustainability progress report today. The company reported progress in its strategic priority areas in 2024, advancing the decarbonisation of its supply chain and the use of lower impact materials without losing track of its commitment to be a fair and equal company. The sustainability progress report is available from today on H&M Group’s website.

“We remain fully committed to our ambitious sustainability agenda. We are on track to achieve our goal for all our materials to be either recycled or sustainably sourced no later than 2030, and we almost reached our 30 percent goal for recycled materials by 2025 a year ahead of schedule. Our efforts to use less and cleaner energy across our supply chain are also delivering strong results in our decarbonisation journey, aligned with our science-based targets. We are aware of the challenges ahead of us and we remain confident that we are on course to fulfill our sustainability agenda in the years to come,” says Leyla Ertur, Sustainability Director H&M Group.

Some sustainability highlights from 2024 include:

89 percent recycled or sustainably sourced materials. The share of recycled materials alone was 29.5 percent, almost reaching the company’s 30 percent target for 2025 one year ahead.

41 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in scope 11 and 22 and 24 percent reduction in scope 33 (2019 baseline).

54 percent plastic packaging reduction (2018 baseline), surpassing the company’s 25 percent reduction target for 2025 ahead of schedule.

The number of garment suppliers (tier 14 and 25) reporting use of on-site coal boilers decreased to 27 factories, from 46 factories in 2023 and 118 in 2022. H&M Group will include tier 35 in its scope from now, with the goal to completely phase out on-site coal by 2026.

9.5 percent reduction of freshwater consumption in garment suppliers (tier 14 and 25) from 2022 baseline, almost reaching the company’s 10 percent target one year ahead.

26 markets have now access to second-hand options, available in 38 selected H&M Group stores worldwide and through Sellpy that offers curated second-hand fashion through pre-loved initiatives.

H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB Three-month report 2025

First quarter (1 December 2024 – 28 February 2025)

The H&M group’s net sales in the first quarter increased by 3 percent to SEK 55,333 m (53,669). In local currencies net sales increased by 2 percent with around 3 percent fewer stores compared with the previous year.

Gross profit amounted to SEK 27,169 m (27,655). This corresponds to a gross margin of 49.1 percent (51.5). The gross margin for the quarter was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering. The Swedish krona strengthened in the first quarter, with the result that currency remeasurement effects have also negatively affected the gross margin compared with the previous year.

Selling and administrative expenses amounted to SEK 25,938 m (25,564). In local currencies these expenses were on par with the previous year.

Operating profit amounted to SEK 1,203 m (2,077), corresponding to an operating margin of 2.2 percent (3.9). The decrease in operating profit is attributable to the lower gross margin.

The result after tax amounted to SEK 579 m (1,2311).

The stock-in-trade amounted to SEK 41,008 m (37,630), an increase by 9 percent. Currency adjusted the stock-in-trade increased by 11 percent compared with the previous year. Higher purchasing costs reflected in the weaker gross margin in the first quarter explain the majority of the increase in stock-in-trade. In addition, extended transport times associated with the situation in the Red Sea continued to affect inventory. The composition of the stock-in-trade is assessed to be good.

Cash flow from operating activities increased to SEK 4,201 m (3,967). Cash and cash equivalents plus undrawn credit facilities were SEK 34,470 m (38,710).

The H&M group’s sales in the month of March 2025 are expected to increase by 1 percent in local currencies compared with the same month the previous year.

The overall negative effect from external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering is estimated to already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter, while collaboration with strategic suppliers is being deepened and bringing additional positive effects. At present the conditions are in place for these to have a positive overall effect in the second half of the year compared with the previous year, with the customer offering being strengthened at the same time.

The H&M group is included in the Carbon Disclosure Project’s A List for its leadership within transparency and climate impact.

Today the H&M group publishes its annual and sustainability report 2024. Among other things, the report shows that the greenhouse gas emissions in scope 32 reduced by around 24 percent in 2024 compared to the 2019 baseline.

The annual general meeting will be held on 7 May 2025 to resolve, among other things, on the board’s proposed dividend of SEK 6.80 per share, to be paid in two instalments, and on a general authorisation allowing the board to buy back the group’s own B shares in the period up to the 2026 annual general meeting.

“Sales increased by 3 percent in SEK in the first quarter, with well-received women’s collections. Operating profit and profitability were impacted by temporarily challenging development of the gross margin. Our main priorities are a strengthened product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand. Through this we create the conditions for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth”, Daniel Ervér, CEO.

Comments by Daniel Ervér, CEO

Sales in the first quarter increased by 3 percent in SEK and by 2 percent in local currencies. Sales development was good in western, southern and eastern Europe, with positive development in Germany and Poland. Online sales continued to develop well, which shows that customers appreciate our upgraded digital store. We are continuing to optimise the store portfolio by closing select stores. We went into the quarter with nearly 120 fewer stores compared to the same time last year and we had 40 net store closures during the period.

Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering. We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.

Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.

We can see that the improvements we have made, especially in the women’s assortment, are starting to have a positive effect. Here we have simplified the organisation and become faster at adapting to new trends and creating a more relevant assortment. During the year we are implementing similar improvements for all our customer groups.

Through our omni-model we are continuing to integrate the physical and digital sales channels, making it easier for our customers to find what they are looking for. The upgraded digital store was rolled out to more markets in the quarter and has been well received by our customers. Upgrades to our physical stores continues to be given high priority. In addition to rebuilds of key stores in several major cities, we are expanding customer experience upgrades to more stores in more markets during the year.

We have a stable financial position that gives us the flexibility to prioritise what creates the most value for our customers. With macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, it is important that we continue to focus fully on our plan and offer the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability for everyone. We are therefore further strengthening our customer offering through an upgraded product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand. This creates the conditions for long-term profitable and sustainable growth, with the H&M brand and organic growth in focus.

Cognizant highlighted its ambition to achieve top-tier revenue growth among its peers by 2027, while steadily bridging the gap with them in terms of revenue growth rate, Nomura noted. The key read-through for Indian IT is that the sluggishness may persist in the near term and that the expanding of addressable market is an imperative, said Kotak Institutional Equities, adding that competitive intensity for Indian IT sector may rise in the near term.

Nomura India said Cognizant’s revenue growth gap against peers’ average improved steadily from minus 800 basis points (bps) in 2022 to 50 basis points in 2024, and the company aspires to grow above the peer average in 2025-26.

Cognizant sees growth drivers including market share gains, strengthening AI capabilities and leveraging platforms, sustaining large deal momentum, tapping underpenetrated markets in the Americas and selective expansion in the EMEA and leveraging partnership channel.

Kotak said Cognizant's renewed focus on large and mega deals, coupled with a focus on driving productivity in technology through AI and sharing it with clients and consolidating out vendors where possible, can increase the competitive intensity for Indian IT in the near to medium term.

“The unique needs of each banner at this time—transformation at Family Dollar and growth acceleration at Dollar Tree—lead us to the decision to conduct a thorough review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business,” former Dollar Tree Chairman and CEO Rick Dreiling said at the time.
Dollar Tree offset more than 90% of the incremental cost of the 10% tariff on China as of Feb. 4.

The Family Dollar distribution center in Odessa, Texas, will be converted to a Dollar Tree DC.","The journey of figuring out what to do with the Family Dollar brand has finally come to an end as Dollar Tree announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Family Dollar business to Brigade and Macellum for just over $1 billion, the retailer revealed during its fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday.

The agreement was official on Tuesday and net proceeds are estimated to total about $804 million.

The deal is expected to close in about 90 days.

“This is a very exciting day for our company,” Dollar Tree CEO Mike Creedon said during the call. “The sale of Family Dollar is the best way to achieve … our goals. With Dollar Tree as our sole focus … we can return to our roots.”

Dollar Tree initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar brand in mid-2024.

“The unique needs of each banner at this time—transformation at Family Dollar and growth acceleration at Dollar Tree—lead us to the decision to conduct a thorough review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business,” former Dollar Tree Chairman and CEO Rick Dreiling said at the time.

It was a relatively solid fourth quarter for Dollar Tree, as net sales increased 0.7% year over year to $5 billion, and same-store net sales grew by 2%, driven by a 0.7% increase in traffic and a 1.3% rise in average ticket. For the first time since Q4 of 2022, average ticket grew faster than traffic, according to Creedon.

For the first quarter of 2025, the Chesapeake, Va.-based retailer expects net sales to fall in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, based on comparable store net sales growth of 3% to 5%.

“Dollar Tree is seeing middle-income shoppers, who make up about half of our customer base, focusing more on value,” Creedon said. “At the same time, we are seeing stronger demand from higher-income customers who increasingly view Dollar Tree as a cost-effective source for an expanding range of products.”

Tariff talk

Dollar Tree spent a significant amount of time during the earnings call discussing its strategy regarding tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as retaliatory tariffs. Creedon said multiple contingencies are in place to address various tariff scenarios, including negotiating supplier cost concessions, changing product specifications, dropping non-economical items, moving the country of origin, and exercising the flexibility the multi-price format offers.

“We intend to remain flexible and nimble, focusing our efforts on sourcing products via channels that deliver the lowest landed cost in order to maintain value continuity for our customers,” Creedon said.

Dollar Tree offset more than 90% of the incremental cost of the 10% tariff on China as of Feb. 4. The impact of the second round of tariffs levied in March has not been included in the 2025 outlook.

Multi-price means one result: success

The discount retailer’s multi-price format boosted Q4 performance, according to Creedon. The 3.0 stores are either new or converted stores that offer an expanded multi-price assortment throughout the store. The 2.0 stores have a smaller multi-price assortment concentrated in a single aisle called The Valley, and 1.0 stores have 95% of products tagged at $1.25.

Creedon said 3.0 stores performed better than the other formats during the fourth quarter. Dollar Tree operates 2,900 3.0 stores, including about 2,600 store conversions and 300 new stores.

The goal is to have 5,200 3.0 stores by the end of 2025, including 2,000 conversions and 300 new stores.

Luckin Coffee filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy and exited administration in 2022, minus the executive team that had overseen the accounting fraud.
Since then, the coffee chain has surpassed Starbucks to be China’s largest coffee retailer in terms of sales.
About 97% of its locations are in the Chinese market, though it boasts over 6,400 teahouses in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.
Both brands are expanding rapidly, with the U.S. market being the next frontier.","Starbucks has been pushing hard to reverse slowing sales under the direction of newly installed CEO Brian Niccol, as Inc. detailed. Some of those changes include the reintroduction of condiment bars, a massive order of Sharpies as the coffee chain returns to personalizing customer cups, and a leaner, trimmed menu. But as the company attempts to reinvent itself in the process of “getting back to Starbucks,” thematically speaking, it now faces further competition in the form of two Chinese chains entering the U.S. market.

First up: Chinese tea chain Chagee, which Forbes reported plans to open its first U.S. location in Los Angeles sometime this spring. A U.S. IPO on the Nasdaq is apparently also in the works.

Secondly, reports indicate that Chinese beverage chain Luckin Coffee is also eying a New York-based location in terms of entry into the American beverage market. Those same reports suggest that drinks will be priced between $2 and $3, with Luckin Coffee initially targeting cities with larger Chinese student and tourist populations to gain a foothold.

Starbucks Could Find Itself Outpriced, but Both Chagee and Luckin Coffee Face Their Own Challenges

Although Starbucks may struggle to compete with both companies given its somewhat premium existing price structure, both potential competitors face hurdles of some sort in penetrating the U.S. market.

For Luckin Coffee, the problems are more obvious. Forbes noted that the company, founded in 2017, quickly outpaced Starbucks to hold more locations in its Chinese market, then went public on the Nasdaq. Only a few short years later, in 2020, Luckin admitted that it had inflated its sales — a confession that resulted in its removal from the Nasdaq and the agreement to pay a $180 million penalty.

Luckin Coffee filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy and exited administration in 2022, minus the executive team that had overseen the accounting fraud. Since then, the coffee chain has surpassed Starbucks to be China’s largest coffee retailer in terms of sales.

Concerning Chagee, the company’s history is less dramatic — although its nearly exclusive focus on the Chinese market may present difficulties in translating the brand to American shores. About 97% of its locations are in the Chinese market, though it boasts over 6,400 teahouses in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.

Both brands are expanding rapidly, with the U.S. market being the next frontier.

Starbucks Dethroned by McDonald’s as the Latter Becomes World’s Most Valuable Restaurant Brand, Shows Weakness in China

In another bit of bad news for Starbucks, the company recently found itself overtaken by McDonald’s, the latter of which is now the world’s most valuable restaurant brand, per a report from Brand Finance. From 2024 to 2025, McDonald’s saw its brand value rise by 7% to rest at $40.5 billion, while Starbucks witnessed its brand value tumble by 36% to $38.8 billion.

Starbucks’ weak performance in China, four quarters of consecutive declining sales, and drops in metrics such as “reputation” and “recommendation” underscored the report’s findings.

Global comparable store sales dropped 4%, marking the fourth consecutive decline.
On Wednesday, Starbucks’ stock opened higher, partly reversing the weakness experienced in the previous sessions.","Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) has launched an extensive restructuring to streamline operations and optimize customer experience. While navigating a difficult operating environment, the coffee giant is working to revive its brand through initiatives like the mobile order facility and redesigned stores.

The company’s stock has been on a rollercoaster ride for quite some time, often reflecting investors’ concerns about the faltering sales performance. The shares have grown around 7% since entering 2025 slightly above $90. Analysts’ consensus target price suggests that SBUX is poised to cross the $100 mark once again. With the brand’s unwavering popularity and the management’s optimistic recovery strategy, Starbucks appears to be on track for a turnaround. This trajectory is likely to translate into strong shareholder value in the long term. From the investment perspective, the stock looks fairly priced right now.

Revamp

The restructuring program includes simplification of the menu, optimizing mobile ordering, and new store design. As part of the reorganization, the company recently announced plans to lay off around 1,100 corporate employees and not to fill several open positions, marking the largest downsizing in its history. Of late, Starbucks has been facing a demand slowdown in certain regions including China, its biggest market outside the U.S. Economic slowdown in the Asian country and growing competition from local brewers like Luckin Coffee remain a challenge.

From Starbucks’ Q1 2025 earnings call:

“Our work to reintroduce our brand is just beginning, but our core business is already strengthening, demonstrating that when we talk about our business, customers respond. Through the quarter, we saw a shift in our sales mix toward coffee and espresso-based beverages, which over-delivered and compensated for lower-than-expected performance across our holiday promotions. We’ve been focused on simplifying our menu to position partners for success, improve consistency, drive customer satisfaction, and enhance our economics.”

Pricing

While the company has achieved some success in attracting customers through promotional offers, its prices remain among the highest in the coffee space. It is important to have a competitive pricing strategy because several new players have entered the market in recent years, including in the US. According to the company, it is making progress in engaging non-rewards customers — frequent store visitors who are not part of the rewards program — through the revival program.

In the first three months of fiscal 2025, earnings dropped to $780.8 million or $0.69 per share from $1.02 billion or $0.90 per share in the same period of the prior year. Meanwhile, Q1 revenues remained broadly unchanged at $9.40 billion. Global comparable store sales dropped 4%, marking the fourth consecutive decline.

Results Beat

There was a 6% fall in comparable transactions, which was partially offset by a 3% increase in average ticket. At the end of the quarter, the company had a total of 34.6 million active members in the US. Sales and profit surpassed the market’s expectations, after missing in Q4 2024.

Aligning with its growth strategies, Pinterest reported full-year 2024 sales of US$3.65 billion, transitioning from a net loss to a net income of US$1.86 billion. While the firm's stock underperformed both the broader US market and the Interactive Media and Services industry over the last year, these strategic moves and financial results illustrate its ongoing efforts to bolster long-term shareholder value.

Accelerated bookbuild offering for 4% of Ferrari’s outstanding shares

In March 2025, Exor completed the sale of approximately 7 million of the common shares it held in Ferrari by way of an accelerated bookbuild offering to institutional investors for a total proceeds of €3 billion.

The aim of the transaction was to reduce concentration within Exor’s portfolio and allow for a sizeable new acquisition, when such an opportunity presents itself, as Exor continues to pursue its purpose of building great companies. In addition, Exor announced the intention to use a portion of the proceeds to launch a new share buyback program for €1 billion.

Exor remains fully committed as a long-term shareholder of Ferrari and remains its single largest shareholder with approximately 20% of the economic rights and 30% of the voting rights in Ferrari’s share capital.

Launch of Tender Offer to execute a new €1 billion share buyback program

Today Exor announces the launch of a reverse Dutch auction Tender Offer on 27 March 2025 to repurchase Ordinary Shares for an aggregate consideration of up to (and including) €1 billion to Qualifying Shareholders1.

The Tender Offer will allow Exor to acquire shares in a short time frame and undertake an effective and efficient share buyback. For any remainder amount not taken up in the Tender Offer, Exor is planning to execute an on-market share buyback program from time to time on Euronext Amsterdam.

Qualifying Shareholders will be able to either select the price at which they wish to tender their Ordinary Shares in a price range from a 3% discount to a 10% premium over the Reference VWAP determined during the Determination Period, or submit a Strike Price Tender. The price to be paid by Exor will be subject to a price cap of €98.73 and within the limits of the authorization granted by Exor’s AGM held on 28 May 2024.

Exor’s controlling shareholder Giovanni Agnelli B.V. has provided an irrevocable undertaking to participate for an aggregate amount of €570 million, with the objective to reduce its net debt position.

Exor plans to start the cancellation process of the purchased shares after the settlement of the Tender Offer. As of the date of this release, Exor holds 7,226,558 shares in treasury.

More details on the Tender Offer transaction, including definitions of capitalised terms used in this section, will be available in the launch press release and offer memorandum to be published later today on Exor’s website at: www.exor.com/pages/investors-media/shareholders-corner/share-buyback.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Change in financial reporting

Exor changed its reporting from 1 January 2024 as it determined that, at that date, it met the criteria for qualification as an investment entity as defined by IFRS 10. In line with IFRS requirements, the change is prospectively applied from 1 January 2024, with a material impact on the presentation of the Financial Statements, with prior period not restated, in accordance with IFRS 10.

Exor believes that this change aligns its reporting and disclosures with its business and activities, with NAV and GAV now being equal to IFRS measures (Equity and Total Assets, respectively). The terminology in this report which refers to Alternative Performance Measures (APM) is presented under section “Definitions and Alternative Performance Measures”.

Changes in consolidation

In line with IFRS requirements, Exor deconsolidated portfolio companies where it exercises significant influence or control and accounted for them at fair value, with changes recognized in the income statement. Subsidiaries that provide investment-related support services to Exor N.V., and are not investment entity themselves, continue to be consolidated on a line-by-line basis.

Impact on the financial statements

The one-off positive impact of this change on the income statement amounts to €11,776 million, of which:

a positive impact of €12,150 million resulting from the difference between the net carrying amount of investments previously consolidated or accounted for using the equity method and their fair value at the date of the change and

a negative impact of €374 million resulting from the reversal to the income statement of the OCI reserves of the deconsolidated entities and the ones which are no longer equity-accounted.

Comparison with previous period

NAV and its components at 31 December 2024 are compared to 1 January 2024 to facilitate the understanding and the comparability of measures.

For the purpose of the presentation of this press release, profit and cash flow measures for the year ended 31 December 2023 have not been restated and they are presented as previously reported under the shortened consolidation criterion (non-IFRS). While the scope of consolidation for the period ended 31 December 2024 and the period ended 31 December 2023 is the same, the full and direct comparison between dates or across periods may be inappropriate or not meaningful if not carefully considered in this context because the fair value measurement is prospectively applied from 1 January 2024.

Definitions and Alternative Performance Measures (APM)

The management of Exor has identified a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APM) to measure the Company's financial performance and financial position, which form the basis for capital allocation decisions. Management uses these non-IFRS measures to describe its operations, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions. APM are presented to the financial community to facilitate their understanding of the performance of Exor, and are in line with the industry.

To ensure that the APM are correctly interpreted, it is emphasized that these measures are not indicative of future performance. These non-IFRS financial measures have no standardized meaning under EU-IFRS, are unaudited and are unlikely to be consistent and comparable to measures used by other companies. APM are not intended to be substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with EU-IFRS.

The APM have been consistently calculated and presented for all the reporting periods for which financial information is presented in this report. Reconciliation of APM to IFRS measures can be found in section ‘Reconciliation with IFRS Financial Statements’.

Exor applies the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines to present APM, which correspond to financial measures other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework (IFRS).

As the first quarter of 2025 draws to a close, Global Drinks Intel considers which of the publicly-listed beverage alcohol brand owners in its results coverage shone in 2024 – and which ones sank.

Before we look at the year-on-year performances of the 18 listed brand owners in our coverage, let's consider the top-line showings from the 12 months of last year. The top five remain the same as 2023, with Anheuser-Busch InBev's sales totalling more than second-placed Heineken and Diageo in third, combined. The only order changes last year saw Suntory Holdings - home to Suntory Global Spirits - overtaking Moët Hennessy to snare eighth place, while Rémy Cointreau gave way to Viña Concha y Toro, dropping from 15th to 16th. We turn now to the growth rates recorded from the 12-

In court papers filed Tuesday in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Kroger said Albertsons disregarded the companies’ merger agreement and worked secretly with a partner, C&S Wholesalers, to try to force Kroger to divest more stores to C&S.

Kroger also claimed that Albertsons was secretly planning to sue Kroger if the deal didn’t go through long before the merger actually fell apart in December. Kroger said in Tuesday's court filing that it should not be forced to pay Albertsons a $600 million termination fee as well as billions of dollars in legal fees.

In a statement Tuesday, Albertsons said it was Kroger that failed to honor the merger agreement.

“Kroger’s self-interested conduct doomed the merger, and we are now focused on returning value to Albertsons’ shareholders to compensate for those losses,” Albertsons said.

Kroger and Albertsons first proposed the merger in 2022. They argued that combining would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart and Costco.

But the Federal Trade Commission and two states — Washington and Colorado — sued to block the merger last year, saying it would raise prices and lower workers’ wages by eliminating competition. It also said Kroger and Albertsons' plan to divest 579 stores C&S Wholesalers was inadequate to ensure competition, since C&S was ill-equipped to take on so many stores.

In December, judges in Washington and Oregon halted the merger in two rulings issued within hours of each other.

Kroger said even after lower courts ruled, it believed the merger still had a chance of going through. Kroger said it told Albertsons it was planning to re-engage with the FTC after President Donald Trump's election because it thought the FTC under Trump would be less hostile to mergers.

But instead, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger the day after the lower court rulings. Albertsons said Kroger refused to divest more stores, even as it became clear that regulators weren't satisfied with its plans. Albertsons said Kroger also should have sought other buyers beyond C&S to satisfy regulators' concerns.",https://img.foodmanufacturing.com/files/base/indm/multi/image/2025/03/AP25084614661950.67e411d90e28a.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&rect=0%2C0%2C5385%2C3029&w=1200,N,,2025-03-26 13:05:42.060160

Let's start with Dollar Tree. That stock is up today on the news. It's selling its, uh, family dollar business to two private equity firms. Joining us now with more Yahoo finances Brooke de Palma. I remember when there was a bidding war for Family Dollar and now they're getting rid of it.

Everybody wanted it and Dollar Tree actually won that bidding war against Dollar General. They bought it out for $9 billion and now thinking about what it sold for today, $1 billion to two private equity firms. Investors applauding this move by the company wanting to see Dollar Tree to get rid of family dollar for quite some time. As family dollar really struggled to stay relevant in this time when Amazon and Walmart continue to gain share. CEO Michael Creed told investors on a call this morning, quote, ""I strongly believe dollar, uh, family selling family dollar and returning to our roots with an expanded assortment of dollar tree has created material value. 2025 is going to be a transition year as we pivot to operating Dollar Tree as a standalone entity."" Now, keep in mind this will hit earnings for the full year by roughly 30 cents to 35 cents, but many investors calling this the right strategic move saying that Family Dollar has been a consistent weight on top-line performance, margin rates and management time. We now know the dollar tree will aim to focus on new formats, including these multi-tier offerings, some more prices being offered at stores. And so, certainly, many on the street applauding this move.

And tariffs front and center today again, of course. Um, I'm just wondering Brooke, did Dollar Tree have anything to say about that dynamic?

Yeah, discount retailers dollar stores certainly top of mind within these tariff negotiations, these tariff discussions. They did say they were able to take action to offset 90% of incremental costs for the first round of tariffs. Keep in mind that doesn't include the outlook when thinking about the second round of tariffs. There's some of ways that it was able to mitigate those, include changing items, negotiating with suppliers, eliminating some products entirely, and also, they're really doubling down on that multi-price point offerings. So essentially something that's $2, $3, $5 instead of just that $1 strategy. But, of course, now all eyes on April 2nd as those reciprocal tariffs will come into play here. They then said that they'll have to keep that top of mind and once again use those tools to mitigate that impact yet again.

Yeah, we'll see. Thank you, Brooke.

New Zealand: Action on supermarkets welcomed

A government announcement expected this week on the prospects for a new supermarket chain is extremely positive, says Sue Chetwin, chair of the Grocery Action Group (GAG). ""It's great to see the Minister for Groceries Nicola Willis so quick off the mark with her new portfolio"", Ms Chetwin said. ""Kiwis are paying some of the highest prices in the world for groceries and would welcome the sort of competition to the duopoly of Woolworths and Foodstuffs that will bring down prices. Doing that would require Foodstuffs and Woolworths to divest part of their operations to a third, entirely separate player"".

ID23,McDonald’s,2025-03-26 13:11:27+00:00,www.nrn.com,McDonald's McValue platform has yielded mixed results - Nation's Restaurant News,Alicia Kelso,,,,,https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/mcdonald-s-mcvalue-platform-has-yielded-mixed-results,"The McDonald’s McValue platform, launched in early January, intensified an already cutthroat value environment that began in the middle of 2024 when restaurant brands witnessed their traffic numbers declining.
Further, 48% of McValue consumers said the platform is why they chose McDonald’s over a quick-service peer.
Still, most of the McValue customers were already loyal McDonald’s customers before the launch, meaning the platform isn’t generating many new customers.
Ninety-four percent of McValue buyers visited a McDonald’s restaurant prior to the platform launch, while 90% visited a McDonald’s more than three times in the first half of 2024.
According to Placer.ai data, McDonald’s traffic jumped nearly 9% year-over-year during the week after the McValue platform’s launch, Jan. 13.","The McDonald’s McValue platform, launched in early January, intensified an already cutthroat value environment that began in the middle of 2024 when restaurant brands witnessed their traffic numbers declining. Much of that erosion came from low-income consumers, who have continued to pull back on their discretionary spending. This trend has become a major concern at McDonald’s in particular, given that the company over indexes with lower-income consumers.

So, has the McValue strategy worked so far? In some ways, yes. In other ways, meh.

According to a new report from consumer insights company Numerator, the McValue menu is re-engaging low-income, diverse households looking for an affordable meal. Forty-two percent of McValue consumers said they bought the meal because it offered a low-price deal, for instance, while nearly 30% said it provided options at a variety of price points less than $5. That’s a notch in the positive column for the chain.

Further, 48% of McValue consumers said the platform is why they chose McDonald’s over a quick-service peer. Chains they would have visited instead include Burger King (18%), Chick-fil-A (17%), Wendy’s (14%), and Taco Bell (11%).

Still, most of the McValue customers were already loyal McDonald’s customers before the launch, meaning the platform isn’t generating many new customers. Ninety-four percent of McValue buyers visited a McDonald’s restaurant prior to the platform launch, while 90% visited a McDonald’s more than three times in the first half of 2024.

In other words, Numerator indicates that the McValue menu has driven incremental visits to McDonald’s, while the chain’s peers have lost some trips. But most of those customers were lapsed customers rather than new ones.

The good news is Numerator’s research shows that McValue customers are satisfied with the offering — 91% said they will likely buy off the menu again. Despite that satisfaction, many want to see McDonald’s add even more protein and treat options to the platform. Forty-four percent of category buyers want more burger options, while 35% want more chicken sandwich options, 34% want more breakfast sandwich options, 30% want more sweets and treats, and 26% want more beverage options.

The bad news is the total household penetration for McDonald’s value offers peaked at the end of September 2024, prior to the McValue launch, and has steadily declined since, according to Numerator.

On the traffic side, the picture isn’t much rosier. According to Placer.ai data, McDonald’s traffic jumped nearly 9% year-over-year during the week after the McValue platform’s launch, Jan. 13. Since then, however, traffic has been negative year-over-year at the chain, with some weeks down as much as 8% (Feb. 17). Weather was a major factor for the restaurant industry’s slow performance across much of the country during January and February, but Numerator also notes that McDonald’s has pulled media support for its McValue menu, which could also have an impact. The company is expected to report first quarter results in the coming weeks, which will provide a much fuller picture.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltea7aee2fca050a19/blt1c1aa9ea0e9fa739/67e2df38ffbcf7f7e3f80dee/McValue_Burgers.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-03-26 11:04:43.797198

French tyre major Michelin is seeking continuity in passenger vehicle tyre imports into India till production ramps up at its upcoming Chennai-based plant over the next few years, according to CEO Florent Menegaux. The Clermont-Ferrand-based firm, which reported a revenue of 27.2 billion euro last year, is in talks with the Indian government to extend its import licence for passenger vehicle tyres till the time local production matures in the country.

The company is setting up production capacity for passenger vehicle tyres at its Chennai facility at an investment of Rs 564 crore.

Advt

The plant is expected to commence production later this year with gradual portfolio scale up expected to take place over the next few years.

The local manufacturing would help the company, which has 86 tyre production sites across the globe, to scale up operations in India, which remain subdued with the government introducing import restrictions in 2020.

The tyre maker currently sells only premium bigger size tyres in limited quantity especially for performance-oriented models in India.

In 2020, the government imposed curbs on imports of certain new pneumatic tyres used in motor cars, busses, lorries and motorcycles in a move to promote domestic manufacturing.

Tyre companies can now import only a small number of tyres into the country under a limited import licence, which was not the case before 2020.

Menegaux told PTI here that the company is having extensive discussions with the Indian government to extend import licence.

""We have good relationship with the government, and we are having extensive discussions to extend our licence. We have been granted some licence to import but to grow faster we will need the licence, at least till we have our facility for passenger car ready,"" he stated.

The company has rolled out an investment plan to produce passenger vehicle tyres in the country, but it will take few years till the production touches optimum level, Menegaux stated.

Advt

Michelin already has a facility in Chennai for manufacturing a range of radial truck/bus tyres and defence tyres for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as well as for the replacement market in the country.

The company has invested Rs 2,840 crore on the plant which has an installed production capacity of over 30,000 tonnes per annum.

The facility, which is operational since 2014, caters mainly to Indian market and few export markets.

Besides, Michelin also gets two-wheeler tyres manufactured in the country through a partner.

Menegaux noted that the Indian market has plenty of potential for growth while exhorting the need for a level-playing field for all operators.

""In relationships, I believe in an open world, rules of the games are enforced by countries with a level-playing field. Right now, in India, like many other countries, there is a tendency to look at the world from just the country's (own) perspective,"" Menegaux stated.

""I think this is not adequate. We are citizens of the world, and we should cooperate. I think if we could have more attention towards how do we create a level playing field so that competition can be exercised in proper manner,"" he added.

He noted that India has seen tremendous growth in infrastructure development over the last ten years and the tyre maker sees it an important market globally.

""Like what we have seen in China a few years ago, infrastructure is getting better in India. A lot of investment is taking place in roads and vehicles, etc. So the vehicle parc is expanding,"" he noted.

He further said that Michelin has invested across various segments in India like manufacturing, research and IT services.

""Our core expertise in artificial intelligence comes from India. And so for all of that, India is important to us, and we are making investments,"" Menegaux said.

On a question regarding competition from emerging companies especially from China, Menegaux mentioned that the tyre maker likes competition as it helps it to progress.

""Provided there is acceptable rules of the game, competition strengthens us,"" he added.

""We had one competition from Japan long time back. Then there was one from South Korea and we will have competition from China. We will also have one competitor from India. Maybe you will see one coming from Africa. But that's ok. There is space for everyone as the market grows,"" he stated.

Michelin employs close to 1.3 lakh people globally. The company, which produced around 200 million tyres in 2022, has set a goal of achieving 100 per cent sustainable materials in its tyres by 2050.

The Michelin group aims to become a leader in composite solutions, particularly flexible composites like coated fabrics, films, seals, conveyors, belts, hoses, and inflatable structures.

It operates its composites businesses worldwide under the brands of the Fenner group, which it acquired in 2018.

It took another major step in its development in June 2023, when it acquired the Faitplast, Angeloni, and Orca-Pennel&Flippo brands.

Michelin, as part of a NASA project, plans to leverage its expertise in airless tyres and its knowledge of high-tech materials to design a lunar wheel capable of withstanding extreme temperatures (over 100°C and below -240°C) and solar and galactic radiation.

NASA recently announced that the Moon RACER team, of which Michelin is a member, has been awarded the feasibility study for phase 1 of the ARTEMIS project.

The project, entitled ""Lunar Terrain Vehicle Phase 1 Feasibility Study"", aims to design a lunar vehicle capable of operating in extreme conditions on the moon for 10 years.

Menegaux said the the developments carried out as part of the project will enable Michelin to continue innovating in terrestrial applications.

""In relationships, I believe in an open world, rules of the games are enforced by countries with a level-playing field. Right now, in India, like many other countries, there is a tendency to look at the world from just the country's (own) perspective,"" Menegaux stated.

""I think this is not adequate. We are citizens of the world, and we should cooperate. I think if we could have more attention towards how do we create a level playing field so that competition can be exercised in proper manner,"" he added.

He noted that India has seen tremendous growth in infrastructure development over the last ten years and the tyre maker sees it an important market globally.

""Like what we have seen in China a few years ago, infrastructure is getting better in India. A lot of investment is taking place in roads and vehicles, etc. So the vehicle parc is expanding,"" he noted.

He further said that Michelin has invested across various segments in India like manufacturing, research and IT services.

""Our core expertise in artificial intelligence comes from India. And so for all of that, India is important to us, and we are making investments,"" Menegaux said.

On a question regarding competition from emerging companies especially from China, Menegaux mentioned that the tyre maker likes competition as it helps it to progress.

""Provided there is acceptable rules of the game, competition strengthens us,"" he added.

""We had one competition from Japan long time back. Then there was one from South Korea and we will have competition from China. We will also have one competitor from India. Maybe you will see one coming from Africa. But that's ok. There is space for everyone as the market grows,"" he stated.

Michelin employs close to 1.3 lakh people globally. The company, which produced around 200 million tyres in 2022, has set a goal of achieving 100 per cent sustainable materials in its tyres by 2050.

The Michelin group aims to become a leader in composite solutions, particularly flexible composites like coated fabrics, films, seals, conveyors, belts, hoses, and inflatable structures.

It operates its composites businesses worldwide under the brands of the Fenner group, which it acquired in 2018.

It took another major step in its development in June 2023, when it acquired the Faitplast, Angeloni, and Orca-Pennel&Flippo brands.

Michelin, as part of a NASA project, plans to leverage its expertise in airless tyres and its knowledge of high-tech materials to design a lunar wheel capable of withstanding extreme temperatures (over 100°C and below -240°C) and solar and galactic radiation.

NASA recently announced that the Moon RACER team, of which Michelin is a member, has been awarded the feasibility study for phase 1 of the ARTEMIS project.

The project, entitled ""Lunar Terrain Vehicle Phase 1 Feasibility Study"", aims to design a lunar vehicle capable of operating in extreme conditions on the moon for 10 years.

Menegaux said the the developments carried out as part of the project will enable Michelin to continue innovating in terrestrial applications.",https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/wire-updates/pti-preview-theweek.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 08:03:53.326964

Bank of America reaffirmed its Buy recommendation on UPS despite these obstacles, saying long-term faith in the company's capacity to reduce structural expenses as required.","United Parcel Service (UPS, Financials) is projected to report an 8% year-over-year decline in domestic volumes for the first quarter of 2025 due to ongoing tariff concerns and severe winter conditions, according to Bank of America Securities.

Bank of America Securities forecasts an 8% decline in domestic package volumes for United Parcel Service in the first quarter of 2025. The projection takes into account strategic internal changes within the business, weather disturbances, and tariff-related uncertainties as well as pressure from these factors.

The expected drop occurs during a larger UPS delivery strategy reconfiguration. A major client whose slow move to in-house logistics has impacted shipping companies, the firm is projected to lose around half of its Amazon (AMZN, Financials) business by mid-2026. UPS is internalizing 50% of its SurePost volumes at the same time, which affects general volume measurements as well as raises average rates.

Bank of America analyst Ken Hoexter reacted by cutting his first quarter earnings per share projection by 15% to $1.31. Based on updated projections for worse operational performance and reduced margins, the 2025 full-year EPS forecast was also reduced by 6% to $7.40.

Although UPS's January performance exceeded expectations, internal data allegedly indicate February and March volume decline. Bank of America reports the firm is not aggressively restructuring costs right now as it sees the weakness as transient.

Now forecast at $643 million in Q1, international adjusted operating income is down from a prior projection of $733 million. Operating margins are predicted to shrink to 15%, down from 17% a year earlier.

Bank of America reaffirmed its Buy recommendation on UPS despite these obstacles, saying long-term faith in the company's capacity to reduce structural expenses as required. Based on a value of 17.5 times expected 2025 profits, the price objective was cut by 3% to $129.",https://static.gurufocus.com/1526208121872130048.jpeg,N,,2025-03-26 10:02:29.034521

In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, the company said excluding non-recurring gains from lot sales and incentives under the Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) program, core net income grew by 11 percent.

GT Capital’s performance was driven by Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (Metrobank) and Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP), which posted record net incomes of P48.1 billion and P15.9 billion, respectively. Its associate, Metro Pacific Investments Corp. (MPIC), also delivered a record P28 billion profit.

“GT Capital’s core net income grew by 11 percent in 2024, building on the record levels achieved the previous year,” said GT Capital President Carmelo Maria Luza Bautista.

“We remain optimistic that our core businesses will sustain this growth momentum moving forward.”

Metrobank’s net income rose 14 percent year-on-year to P48.1 billion, supported by strong asset expansion and improving asset quality. The bank’s return on equity increased to 13 percent from 12.5 percent in 2023.

TMP reported a 15.3 percent increase in net income to P15.9 billion, driven by a 9 percent rise in retail sales to 218,019 units, representing 46 percent of the auto industry’s total sales in 2024.

Strong commercial vehicle sales, led by the Hilux, Raize, Innova, Avanza, and Hiace models, boosted the company’s market share. Lexus remained the leader in the luxury segment with a 53.5 percent market share.

TMP also recorded a 95 percent year-on-year growth in electrified vehicle sales, with 14,057 units sold, accounting for 58 percent of the industry’s total. In December, the company launched the Next-Generation Tamaraw, a Filipino-assembled light commercial vehicle designed for small businesses and local government units.

GT Capital’s property subsidiary, Federal Land, Inc., reported P12.0 billion in revenues and a net income of P750 million for 2024. The company launched several projects, including Meadowcrest in Laguna and Grand Hyatt Manila Residences South Tower in Bonifacio Global City.

MPIC posted a 21 percent increase in consolidated core net income, reaching P23.6 billion in 2024 from P19.5 billion in 2023.

Stronger performances from its key businesses drove a 16 percent rise in contribution from operations to a record P28.4 billion. Growth was fueled by higher energy sales at Meralco, increased billed volumes at Maynilad Water, and more traffic on toll roads, complemented by higher tariffs.

Another affiliate, AXA Philippines Life and General Insurance Corp., also recorded a 19 percent rise in gross premiums to P30.4 billion in 2024.

CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) reported its fourth-quarter results for the fiscal year 2024, showing a notable increase in total revenues. The company achieved revenues of $97.7 billion, marking a 4.2% rise compared to the same period last year. However, the company’s operating income faced a decline, dropping to $2.37 billion from $3.37 billion in the previous year.

The adjusted operating income also saw a decrease, coming in at $2.73 billion, down from $4.23 billion the previous year. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) reflected this downturn, with a GAAP diluted EPS of $1.30, a decrease from $1.58 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS also fell significantly to $1.19 from $2.12. This decline in earnings was primarily attributed to challenges faced by the Health Care Benefits segment, which experienced increased utilization pressures and negative impacts from Medicare Advantage star ratings.

Despite these challenges, CVS Health’s revenue growth was driven by the Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segments. These areas saw positive momentum due to increased prescription volumes and a favorable pharmacy drug mix, although offset by reimbursement pressures and a decline in front store volume. Overall, the fourth quarter’s results reflect both the strengths and challenges faced by CVS Health in a complex healthcare environment.

CVS Reports Double Beat in Fourth-Quarter FY2024

When comparing CVS Health’s fourth-quarter performance to market expectations, the company exceeded revenue projections and earnings. Analysts had anticipated revenue figures around $96.97 billion, but CVS surpassed this with $97.7 billion. This increase can be attributed to strategic growth in certain business segments, despite facing industry-wide challenges.

In terms of earnings, the company reported a GAAP diluted EPS of $1.30 and an adjusted EPS of $1.19, exceeding the expected EPS of $1.00. The decline in adjusted EPS was significant, dropping from $2.12 in the prior year, underscoring the pressure faced by the company in maintaining profitability amidst rising costs and competitive pressures.

CVS Expects Full Year 2025 GAAP Diluted EPS Between $4.58 to $4.83

CVS Health has provided its full-year guidance for 2025, projecting a GAAP diluted EPS range of $4.58 to $4.83. The adjusted EPS is expected to be between $5.75 and $6.00. The company also anticipates cash flow from operations to be approximately $6.5 billion.

The guidance reflects the company’s strategic focus on leveraging its integrated model to enhance consumer experiences and drive growth in key segments. CEO David Joyner emphasized the company’s commitment to delivering better care while managing costs, which will be crucial in achieving the outlined financial targets. The focus on improving health outcomes and reducing expenses is expected to bolster CVS Health’s position in the market.

However, the guidance also acknowledges the ongoing challenges in the Health Care Benefits segment, particularly concerning Medicare ratings and utilization pressures. Addressing these issues will be vital for CVS Health to meet its financial goals for 2025.

On the other hand, Starbucks' overall value dropped 36% to 38.8 billion, making it the world's second-most valuable restaurant brand.","AN iconic fast food chain has once again reclaimed its position as the world's top-performing restaurant brand.

The chain was surpassed by Starbucks in in 2016.

According to earnings reports, Starbucks faced significant challenges in 2024.

After suffering four consecutive quarters of financial decline, the Washington-based chain is no longer the top-ranked restaurant brand in terms of value.

That title now belongs to McDonald's.

Before Starbucks, McDonald's was the most valuable restaurant chain globally, before Starbucks took the top spot in 2016.

While Starbucks fell off last year, McDonald's achieved a massive 7% increase in value, bringing the company's overall worth up to $40.5 billion.

According to research conducted by brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance, McDonald's growth can be attributed to its Brand Strength Index (BSI).

The chain's BSI rating rose 7.6% to 90.5 out of 100, scoring AAA+.

The rating weighs several factors including familiarity, consideration, and preferred brand, for which McDonald's scored highly in all three categories.

According to Brand Finance, McDonald's is the 42nd most valuable brand in the world.

On the other hand, Starbucks' overall value dropped 36% to 38.8 billion, making it the world's second-most valuable restaurant brand.

Starbucks was the most valuable from 2016 to 2024, but its diminishing reputation and recommendation scores may be the reasons for the company's valuation decline.

Brian Niccol, the former CEO of Chipotle, was appointed as Starbucks' new CEO in August 2024.

Starbucks hoped that a change in leadership could reverse the company's gradual decline.

Niccol's strategy includes revamping its cafe culture by improving its seating and service.

The company also reintroduced ceramic mugs for in-store orders, with the aim of keeping customers in stores longer.

Luckin recently announced that it would be expanding to the US for the first time.

The Company also announced that the AirJoule® system can use low-grade waste heat from industrial processes to improve energy efficiency and produce pure distilled water for less than 160 watt-hours of energy consumption per liter (“Wh/L”). This marks a step change in water harvesting efficiency, allowing humanity to cost-effectively access water stored in the most reliable freshwater aquifer – the Earth’s atmosphere.

Fourth Quarter 2024

AirJoule® Utilizes Low-Grade Waste Heat to Produce Pure Distilled Water

After extensive testing at the Company’s facility in Newark, DE, AirJoule® demonstrated the ability to produce pure distilled water from air with an energy requirement of less than 160 Wh/L of water by utilizing low-grade waste heat (with test conditions of 80°F and 60% relative humidity). Compared to existing technologies, AirJoule® is up to 4x more efficient at separating water from air than refrigerant-based systems (400-700 Wh/L) and up to 8x more efficient than desiccant-based systems (more than 1,300 Wh/L).

Waste heat is the world’s largest untapped energy source. Approximately 70% of the energy produced on the planet is lost as waste heat at power plants, and up to 50% of energy inputs to industrial operations are lost as waste heat. Most of this waste heat is low-grade (under 100°C) and previously has not been economical to recapture for reuse or electricity generation. By tapping into the significant low-grade waste heat available at nearly all industrial operations globally, including data centers, AirJoule® can generate pure distilled water at attractive costs. AirJoule® is unlocking two vast resources to improve energy efficiency and water sustainability – low-grade waste heat and water in the atmosphere.

The Company and the AirJoule JV (defined below) are in advanced discussions with multiple data center operators, project developers, and industrial facilities about potential proof of concept deployments where AirJoule® demonstration units would be installed and field tested to validate their operational capabilities. If successful, these initiatives will lay the foundation for large-scale water generation projects that harness waste heat to produce pure distilled water on-site at competitive costs while also driving greater energy efficiency.

Data centers, which are vital to our increasingly digital world, require substantial amounts of power and water. When deployed to data centers, AirJoule® can transform the vast low-grade waste heat from these facilities, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, into a valuable asset through the production of distilled water for evaporative cooling and for other beneficial purposes.

Executive Commentary

“We are pleased with the significant progress made in 2024,” said Matt Jore, CEO of AirJoule Technologies. “We achieved several key milestones that position us well for the extensive commercial opportunities we see ahead at the intersection of energy efficiency and water security. The significance of AirJoule® separating pure water from air at less than 160 watt-hours per liter cannot be overstated. Once commercialized, this unprecedented level of energetics can enable transformational solutions including waste heat to water, distributed water generation, and more energy-efficient dehumidification and air conditioning systems.”

Mr. Jore continued, “We are incredibly energized to have completed our first year as a publicly traded company. We are excited for what’s to come in 2025 and look forward to updating our stakeholders on our progress throughout the year.”

The conglomerates said its growth momentum was sustained by the record net incomes of operating companies Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (Metrobank) and Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP).
“GT Capital’s core net income grew by 11 percent in 2024, building on the record levels achieved the previous year.
This continuous improvement reflects the group’s strong fundamentals across diversified sectors,” said GT Capital President Carmelo Maria Luza Bautista.
Reported net income rose faster to ₱28 billion from ₱20 billion, owing to additional non-recurring gains from MPIC’s real estate business and a lower interest bill.","GT Capital Holdings, Inc., the investment arm of the Ty family, reported a two percent dip in consolidated net income to ₱28.8 billion for 2024 from the ₱29.3 billion it earned in 2023 due to non-recurring gains in the previous year.

Excluding non-recurring gains from lot sales and incentives under the Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) program, GT Capital’s 2024 core net income increased by 11 percent from 2023.

The conglomerates said its growth momentum was sustained by the record net incomes of operating companies Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (Metrobank) and Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP).

GT Capital’s performance was also supported by its associate Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (Metro Pacific), which achieved a record high net income of ₱28 billion in 2024.

“GT Capital’s core net income grew by 11 percent in 2024, building on the record levels achieved the previous year. This continuous improvement reflects the group’s strong fundamentals across diversified sectors,” said GT Capital President Carmelo Maria Luza Bautista.

He added, “We remain optimistic that our core businesses will sustain this growth momentum moving forward. This year, GT Capital is committed to pushing boundaries further and reaching new milestones.”

Metrobank’s net income rose 14.0 percent year-on-year to a record ₱48.1 billion in 2024, supported by robust asset expansion and improving asset quality. This translated to a 13.0 percent return on equity, higher than the 12.5 percent recorded in the same period last year.

“The hard work that all Metrobankers put in growing our corporate, middle market, retail and wealth segments as well as our investments in technology and human resources and risk management initiatives continue to bear fruit,” said Metrobank President Fabian S. Dee.

He noted that, “This positive momentum and our strong balance sheet set us up very well to continuously meet the growing needs of our clients and to pursue our medium-term strategies.""

TMP’s net income grew 15.3 percent in full-year 2024 to ₱15.9 billion, primarily driven by a nine percent increase in the automotive company’s retail sales volume, which reached a record level of 218,019 units sold by year-end, comprising 46.0 percent of the auto industry’s 473,842 total sales.

“In my first year as president of TMP, I have been able to witness first-hand the strength and potential of the Philippine automotive industry,” TMP President Masando Hashimoto said.

He noted “Our record-breaking numbers reflect the trust and confidence that Filipinos have entrusted in our brand. This 2025, we remain committed to providing quality and reliable vehicles to our customers, ensuring that we continue to offer sustainable mobility solutions, and in turn, supporting the country’s economic progress.”

Federal Land, Inc. reported that earnings fell to ₱750 million from the core net income of ₱2.1 billion in 2023 as revenues dropped to ₱12.0 billion from ₱20.8 billion.

Metro Pacific continued to break new record highs, with consolidated core net income rising 21 percent to ₱23.6 billion in 2024 compared with ₱19.5 billion in 2023.

Albertsons terminated the merger immediately after courts blocked it and sued Kroger, alleging a breach of contract that led to the deal falling apart.

The formal termination ended a two-year effort by the grocery chains to combine that regulators — who moved to stop the deal — said would eliminate competition, cause higher prices and reduce leverage for unionized workers.

In December, Albertsons asked for billions of dollars in damages along with a $600 million termination fee. Kroger had called the claims baseless.

Albertsons engaged in a campaign with divestiture buyer C&S Wholesale Grocers to pursue its own regulatory strategy, Kroger said on Tuesday.

""Albertsons' misconduct shockingly came to light in the middle of the antitrust trials under government cross examination of Susan Morris, Albertsons' recently promoted CEO designate,"" Kroger said.

The supermarket chain said Albertsons was not entitled to the termination fee or other damages due to its ""misconduct.""

""Kroger's weak claims are a deliberate tactic to distract from its own ongoing executive leadership issues; blatant and recurring failures to carry out its contractual obligations under the merger agreement; and avoid paying the damages it owes,"" Albertsons told Reuters in an emailed statement.

In early March, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen resigned after a board investigation found that his personal conduct was ""inconsistent"" with certain company policies.

The same day, Albertsons said its CEO Vivek Sankaran would retire, and insider Morris would assume the top role.

Kroger said the counterclaim aimed to seek damages from Albertsons to recover the investment it had made to obtain regulatory approval for the merger.

The grocer also added in the counterclaim it appeared that Albertsons had shifted its focus toward the current legal battle long before instead of pushing to close the transaction.

However, Albertsons said on Tuesday it was ""committed to the success of the combination from the outset,"" and it was Kroger who did not hold up its end of the bargain.

""We look forward to presenting our case in court,"" Albertsons said.",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3048/304876/30487649.JPG?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2025-03-25 18:04:46.427832

The absence of preliminary financial data in the press release suggests that investors should pay close attention to the call for detailed analysis. The company's robust revenue figures from 2024 highlight its strong market position, but understanding the current quarter's performance will be essential for evaluating its ongoing financial trajectory.

Market Research Analyst Perspective

From a market research standpoint, Levi Strauss & Co's extensive global reach and diverse brand portfolio position it well in the competitive apparel industry. The company's ability to maintain significant revenue levels indicates strong brand loyalty and effective market strategies. However, the lack of detailed information on Q1 2025 performance in the press release suggests that market analysts should monitor the conference call for updates on consumer trends, market challenges, and strategic initiatives that could impact future growth.

AirJoule Technologies cautions you that these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond AirJoule Technologies’ control.","RONAN, Mont., March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AirJoule Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRJ) (“AirJoule Technologies” or the “Company”), the developer of the transformational AirJoule® system for separating pure water from air, today announced its fourth quarter and full year results. The Company also announced that the AirJoule® system can use low-grade waste heat from industrial processes to improve energy efficiency and produce pure distilled water for less than 160 watt-hours of energy consumption per liter (“Wh/L”). This marks a step change in water harvesting efficiency, allowing humanity to cost-effectively access water stored in the most reliable freshwater aquifer – the Earth’s atmosphere.

Fourth Quarter 2024

AirJoule® Utilizes Low-Grade Waste Heat to Produce Pure Distilled Water

After extensive testing at the Company’s facility in Newark, DE, AirJoule® demonstrated the ability to produce pure distilled water from air with an energy requirement of less than 160 Wh/L of water by utilizing low-grade waste heat (with test conditions of 80°F and 60% relative humidity). Compared to existing technologies, AirJoule® is up to 4x more efficient at separating water from air than refrigerant-based systems (400-700 Wh/L) and up to 8x more efficient than desiccant-based systems (more than 1,300 Wh/L).

Waste heat is the world’s largest untapped energy source. Approximately 70% of the energy produced on the planet is lost as waste heat at power plants, and up to 50% of energy inputs to industrial operations are lost as waste heat. Most of this waste heat is low-grade (under 100°C) and previously has not been economical to recapture for reuse or electricity generation. By tapping into the significant low-grade waste heat available at nearly all industrial operations globally, including data centers, AirJoule® can generate pure distilled water at attractive costs. AirJoule® is unlocking two vast resources to improve energy efficiency and water sustainability – low-grade waste heat and water in the atmosphere.

The Company and the AirJoule JV (defined below) are in advanced discussions with multiple data center operators, project developers, and industrial facilities about potential proof of concept deployments where AirJoule® demonstration units would be installed and field tested to validate their operational capabilities. If successful, these initiatives will lay the foundation for large-scale water generation projects that harness waste heat to produce pure distilled water on-site at competitive costs while also driving greater energy efficiency.

Data centers, which are vital to our increasingly digital world, require substantial amounts of power and water. When deployed to data centers, AirJoule® can transform the vast low-grade waste heat from these facilities, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, into a valuable asset through the production of distilled water for evaporative cooling and for other beneficial purposes.

Full Year 2024

Key Milestones

Formed a 50/50 joint venture with GE Vernova to commercialize the AirJoule® technology (“AirJoule JV”); at the end of 2024, the AirJoule JV team included 24 full-time employees who were primarily focused on engineering and product development activities

Entered a binding joint commercialization term sheet with Carrier Global Corporation for AirJoule® applications in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning market

Built out a 35,000 square foot facility in Newark, DE to support sorbent-coating, manufacturing, assembly, and testing operations for AirJoule® units at the AirJoule JV

Opened the Company’s first international office in the United Arab Emirates to spearhead business development and growth initiatives in the Gulf Cooperation Council region

Balance Sheet and Liquidity

Completed a $50 million private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) financing in March 2024, led by investments from GE Vernova, Carrier, and Rice Investment Group, among other third parties

Raised an additional $12 million through a PIPE financing from primarily existing investors in June 2024

Ended the year with $28 million of cash and cash equivalents with sufficient liquidity to support the Company’s operations through expected commercial sales in 2026

Executive Commentary

“We are pleased with the significant progress made in 2024,” said Matt Jore, CEO of AirJoule Technologies. “We achieved several key milestones that position us well for the extensive commercial opportunities we see ahead at the intersection of energy efficiency and water security. The significance of AirJoule® separating pure water from air at less than 160 watt-hours per liter cannot be overstated. Once commercialized, this unprecedented level of energetics can enable transformational solutions including waste heat to water, distributed water generation, and more energy-efficient dehumidification and air conditioning systems.”

Mr. Jore continued, “We are incredibly energized to have completed our first year as a publicly traded company. We are excited for what’s to come in 2025 and look forward to updating our stakeholders on our progress throughout the year.”

Committed Equity Facility

On March 25, 2025, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC (“B. Riley”), providing the Company with the right, but not the obligation, to sell up to $30 million of newly issued shares to B. Riley over a period of 36 months, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The Purchase Agreement gives the Company financial flexibility to opportunistically raise incremental capital in support of future growth and development activities.

In addition, Kuros reached profitability in 2024 reporting an EBITDA of 2.2 million Swiss Francs ($2.5 million) in 2024 versus a loss in 2023 of 5.9 million Swiss Francs ($6.7 million).
This growth was driven by the successful roll-out of our technology in key markets, particularly as demand continues to grow globally.
Kuros also plans to expand its distribution network to the Asia Pacific and South American markets in 2025.
Elting has previously held executive leadership positions at Orthofix Medical, Inc., Trivascular Technologies, and St. Jude Medical.","Swiss-based Kuros Biosciences, supplier of MagnetOs bone graft and NeedleGrip™, reported an exceptional 125% rate of sales growth from 31.7 million Swiss Francs ($36 million) in 2023 to 75.6 million Swiss Francs ($86 million) in 2024.

In addition, Kuros reached profitability in 2024 reporting an EBITDA of 2.2 million Swiss Francs ($2.5 million) in 2024 versus a loss in 2023 of 5.9 million Swiss Francs ($6.7 million).

To be sure, the company noted, “adjusted EBITDA excluding the Fibrin-PTH costs, recurring and one-time share-based compensation, and the relevant social security charges totaled at CHF 9.0 million ($10.2 million), representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9%.”

Kuros Biosciences CEO Chris Fair said of his company’s performance: “We recorded exceptional direct MagnetOs sales growth of 136%. This growth was driven by the successful roll-out of our technology in key markets, particularly as demand continues to grow globally. Overall, this was a transformative year for Kuros, marked by delivering our first positive EBITDA for the Group much earlier than anticipated.”

Fair continued, “In addition, exceeding cash flow breakeven is a key milestone for the company. Strategically, a landmark Level 1 clinical study published in Spine continues to drive customer preference.”

Medtronic Deal

“We also secured a five-year exclusive agreement with Medtronic to accelerate MagnetOs adoption in the U.S. Our expansion into adjacent extremities markets, portfolio innovation in minimally invasive surgery, and broader global distribution capabilities position us for continued explosive growth. With a strong foundation and a clear roadmap, Kuros is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities and drive sustained shareholder value.”

More Details and Outlook

According to the press release, direct MagnetOs sales “increased by 136% to CHF 74.8 million (2023: CHF 31.7 million).” MagnetOs is a bone graft that can grow bone even in soft tissue. It utilizes NeedleGrip™ surface technology which, per its website, “provides traction for our body’s vitally important ‘pro-healing’ immune cells (M2 macrophages).” This “unlocks previously untapped potential to stimulate stem cells—and form new bone throughout the graft.”

Kuros Group reported a positive outlook for future sales, with expected “sales growth of at least 60% in 2025” and anticipated “sales of between USD 220 million and USD 250 million by 2027.”

In 2025, Kuros plans to change its reporting currency from CHF to USD. Kuros also plans to expand its distribution network to the Asia Pacific and South American markets in 2025.

Kuros may also be welcoming a new board member. Kimberley Elting, an experienced medtech executive, has been proposed as a new board member.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with UPS.

Bank of America Securities forecasts an 8% decline in domestic package volumes for United Parcel Service in the first quarter of 2025. The projection takes into account strategic internal changes within the business, weather disturbances, and tariff-related uncertainties as well as pressure from these factors.The expected drop occurs during a larger UPS delivery strategy reconfiguration. A major client whose slow move to in-house logistics has impacted shipping companies, the firm is projected to lose around half of its Amazon (AMZN, Financials) business by mid-2026. UPS is internalizing 50% of its SurePost volumes at the same time, which affects general volume measurements as well as raises average rates.Bank of America analyst Ken Hoexter reacted by cutting his first quarter earnings per share projection by 15% to $1.31. Based on updated projections for worse operational performance and reduced margins, the 2025 full-year EPS forecast was also reduced by 6% to $7.40.Although UPS's January performance exceeded expectations, internal data allegedly indicate February and March volume decline. Bank of America reports the firm is not aggressively restructuring costs right now as it sees the weakness as transient.Now forecast at $643 million in Q1, international adjusted operating income is down from a prior projection of $733 million. Operating margins are predicted to shrink to 15%, down from 17% a year earlier.Bank of America reaffirmed its Buy recommendation on UPS despite these obstacles, saying long-term faith in the company's capacity to reduce structural expenses as required.

It also lowered its annual investment budget to a $20 billion-$22 billion range through to 2028.

The world's biggest liquefied natural gas trader said it wants to grow LNG sales by 4-5% each year in the next five years.

While keeping its oil output stable at 1.4 million barrels per day.

Shell estimates global demand for liquefied natural gas to rise by around 60% by 2040.

That's driven largely by economic growth in Asia, the impact of artificial intelligence and efforts to cut emissions in heavy industries and transportation.

The oil major has a $3.5 billion buyback for the current quarter, making this the 13th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion of share repurchases.

Shell spent around $8 billion by the end of last year on low-carbon solutions set for 2023 to 2025.

It said by the end of the decade it would have up to 10% of its capital employed - which measures the sum of total equity and debt - in lower carbon platforms.

Albertsons filed suit against Kroger after the $24.6 billion merger fell apart in December 2024 over antitrust concerns.
Albertsons says Kroger didn't work hard enough to get federal approval for the merger and owes a $600 million termination fee stipulated in the initial merger agreement, plus billions in damages.
Kroger claims Albertsons convinced C&S to criticize its deal with Kroger, giving federal regulators pause.
""But, within hours of the court decisions blocking the merger, Albertsons terminated the merger agreement and filed a 140-page complaint against Kroger.","Cincinnati-based Kroger Tuesday filed a countersuit against Albertsons, the latest legal fallout from a failed merger between the two grocery giants.

Albertsons filed suit against Kroger after the $24.6 billion merger fell apart in December 2024 over antitrust concerns. Albertsons says Kroger didn't work hard enough to get federal approval for the merger and owes a $600 million termination fee stipulated in the initial merger agreement, plus billions in damages.

Kroger, on Tuesday, pushed back, accusing Albertsons executives of plotting with C&S Wholesale Grocers and secretly pursuing a separate strategy for regulatory approval that undermined Kroger's. C&S was lined up to buy hundreds of stores from Kroger to allay antitrust concerns. Kroger claims Albertsons convinced C&S to criticize its deal with Kroger, giving federal regulators pause.

""Albertsons's misconduct shockingly came to light in the middle of the antitrust trials under government cross examination of Susan Morris, Albertsons's recently promoted CEO designate,"" Kroger said in a news release. ""As a result of its misconduct, Albertsons is not entitled to the $600 million termination fee under the terms of the parties' merger agreement, nor is Albertsons entitled to the other damages it seeks.""

Kroger and Albertsons first agreed to the merger in 2022. The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in eight states and the District of Columbia sued to oppose the deal claiming it would hurt competition and raise prices. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and AGs in three other states filed briefs supporting the merger.

Had the deal gone through, it would have been the largest supermarket merger in U.S. history.

In its filing Tuesday, Kroger claimed Albertsons was preparing to abandon the deal and sue Kroger prematurely.

""Kroger was prepared, in the event of adverse court decisions, to pursue all remaining options to close the merger,"" the company said. ""But, within hours of the court decisions blocking the merger, Albertsons terminated the merger agreement and filed a 140-page complaint against Kroger. These actions ensured that the merger would never close, and further demonstrated that Albertsons had long before shifted its focus towards the litigation that is now pending between the parties, abandoning its contractual obligation to use best efforts to close the transaction.""

Kroger's rebuttal reverses charges Albertsons made against the company in its lawsuit.

In that suit, filed Dec. 11, 2024, Albertsons accused Kroger of failing to take regulators' antitrust concerns seriously, refusing to sell enough of its stores to win regulatory approval and not collaborating with Albertsons on winning approval for the deal.

In its countersuit, Kroger is seeking unspecified damages and to recoup expenses it incurred trying to win regulatory approval for the merger.

NKE has dropped 6.2% since reporting third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on March 20.

Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
Zacks Investment Research","NIKE Inc. NKE has dropped 6.2% since reporting third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on March 20. While earnings per share (EPS) and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, investor concerns stem from year-over-year declines in both metrics. Sales were impacted by weak traffic, which fell in the double digits, and retail performance lagged expectations. Despite macroeconomic challenges, the sports market continues to grow in China.

NKE provided a cautious fiscal fourth-quarter outlook, citing the expected impacts of new tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. Management anticipates the fiscal fourth quarter to reflect the peak effects of its ‘Win Now’ strategy, with revenue and margin pressures beginning to ease. The company faces ongoing external uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions, tariffs, currency fluctuations and evolving tax regulations. Additionally, macroeconomic volatility and its effect on consumer confidence have been concerning.

For fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, NKE expects a revenue decline in the mid-teens, though at the lower end, due to North American shipment timing and foreign exchange headwinds. The gross margin is projected to drop 400-500 bps, indicating the impacts of prior-year restructuring charges. SG&A expenses are forecast to rise in the low to mid-single digits, including last year’s restructuring charges. The company continues to manage costs while investing in ‘Win Now’ initiatives, particularly in demand creation.

NKE’s lackluster third-quarter fiscal 2025 performance compounds ongoing challenges, including weakness in its lifestyle segment and a decline in digital revenues, reflecting shifting consumer preferences. The company is also grappling with lower retail traffic and sell-through rates in Greater China, a key market in its global strategy. These factors have contributed to slower revenue growth and tighter profit margins.

These factors have affected the Beaverton, OR-based company’s share price performance, which has slumped 27.2% in the past year. Shares of the company have underperformed its industry peers, which collectively declined 24.9% in the past year. The NKE stock compared unfavorably with the broader Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 3.7% and 9.3%, respectively, in the same period.

NIKE's performance is notably weaker than its competitors lululemon athletica inc. LULU and Skechers SKX, which have declined 13.3% and 2.8%, respectively, in a year. NKE has also lagged Adidas’ ADDYY 8.5% growth in the same period.

At the current share price of $67.39, NIKE trades close to its 52-week low mark of $65.17, reached on March 21. The stock price reflects a 3.4% premium to the company’s recent 52-week low. Meanwhile, the NKE stock’s price reflects a 31.3% discount from its 52-week high of $98.04. NIKE trades below its 50 and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish sentiment.

NKE’s Estimate Revision Trend

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NKE’s fiscal 2025 EPS moved up 2.4% in the last seven days, while the same for fiscal 2026 EPS edged down 0.9%.

For fiscal 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIKE’s revenues and EPS implies year-over-year declines of 10.4% and 46.6%, respectively. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the consensus mark for revenues and EPS indicates 11.3% and 74.3% year-over-year declines, respectively.

Premium Valuation for NIKE Stock

NKE is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 30.4X, exceeding the industry average of 24.54X and the S&P 500’s average of 20.77X.

Though trading much below its five-year high of 48.27X, the current valuation may be considered expensive, given the significant downside risks if the company's ongoing perils are not resolved for a prolonged period.

Can Investors Be Hopeful About NKE’s Strategies

Despite the ongoing challenges, NIKE is on track with its actions to reposition itself to be more competitive and drive sustainable, profitable long-term growth. The company is intensifying its focus on sports, speeding up the introduction and expansion of products and innovations. NIKE is accelerating product diversification by introducing performance and lifestyle footwear while reducing its reliance on classic franchises.

With innovations like the Pegasus Premium, Vomero 18 and Air Max platforms, alongside a more segmented and differentiated wholesale strategy, NIKE is positioning itself for sustainable growth by catering to evolving consumer preferences and expanding its market reach across key global regions.

The company is leveraging its deep connection to sports by amplifying athlete-driven storytelling and engaging consumers through major sporting events like the Super Bowl and NBA All-Star Weekend. By aligning its brand messaging with cultural moments and investing in impactful marketing, NIKE aims to reinforce its brand distinction, enhance consumer loyalty and drive long-term growth.

NKE is revitalizing its digital and retail strategy by reducing promotions, improving premium brand positioning and refining its go-to-market processes. By strengthening partnerships with wholesale retailers and optimizing its NIKE Direct ecosystem, the company is creating a more seamless and engaging shopping experience, ultimately driving margins and brand loyalty.

How to Play the NIKE Stock?

NKE's strategic initiatives lay the foundation for long-term growth by strengthening its competitive position, expanding its product range and deepening consumer engagement. Through accelerated innovation, diversified offerings and an improved retail and digital strategy, the company is adapting to shifting market trends while maintaining its leadership in sports and lifestyle apparel. Its emphasis on key global markets, athlete-driven storytelling, and premium brand positioning supports a resilient and sustainable growth outlook despite industry challenges.

However, near-term pressures persist as NIKE navigates its product realignment and inventory adjustments. Investors should closely watch the company's efforts to stabilize sales, improve margins, and manage its digital and international transitions. Given its premium valuation and slowing growth, a cautious approach may be warranted while NIKE works through its strategic transformation and broader economic challenges.

After dominating since 2016, Starbucks has lost its crown to McDonald’s, which has reclaimed the top spot, according to a report from consulting firm Brand Finance.

After dominating since 2016, Starbucks has lost its crown to McDonald’s, which has reclaimed the top spot, according to a report from consulting firm Brand Finance. McDonald’s brand value surged by 7% to $40.5 billion from 2024 to 2025, while Starbucks (SBUX) saw a sharp 36% decline, dropping to $38.8 billion.

Recent moves from the respective chains have been crucial to their rise and fall. Brand Finance data shows that Starbucks’ decline is driven by drops in key brand strength metrics in both the U.S. and China, particularly in areas like “reputation” and “recommendation.” This reflects low customer expectations, rising dissatisfaction, and ultimately a decline in sales.

In contrast, McDonald’s has pushed forward with strategic changes to its operations, though not without challenges. Most notably, an E.Coli outbreak late last year forced the chain to launch a $100 million recovery plan.

Since then, the burger giant has been on a marketing blitz. Earlier this month, it reorganized its team into three departments, focusing on winning in beef, chicken, and beverages. New product launches, including the McCrispy and Chicken Big Mac, and recent promotions — like the return of the Shamrock Shake and $5 meal deal — have helped drive customer traffic. A collector’s cup promotion also became a hit, with some selling for up to $100 on eBay.

On the other hand, Starbucks continues to face challenges under the leadership of new CEO Brian Niccol, who is working to make the coffee giant a staple once again. Starbucks recently reported its fourth-consecutive quarter of declining sales, particularly in China, the company’s second-largest market.

Despite this, Starbucks is on the road to a “Big Fix.” As part of Niccol’s efforts to turn things around with a “Back to Starbucks” strategy, the company has pared down its menu by 30%, promising to serve coffee in under four minutes. Starbucks has also removed 13 drinks from its menu, eliminated the extra charges for non-dairy milk alternatives, and is reintroducing TV marketing, condiment bars, and power outlets for paying customers.

Not all the company’s changes have been well received. Starbucks recently reversed its position on its 2018 open-door policy, which previously allowed anyone to sit in stores, following the arrest of two Black men at a Philadelphia location.

In early March, Niccol delivered a stern message to corporate employees, urging them to step up their efforts and take more responsibility for Starbucks’ financial performance after the company laid off 1,100 workers.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/quartz.com/5f802ad10e26f3cfed775ac54f3dc231,N,,2025-03-25 15:07:04.788432

Work with retailers to add shelf-talkers and signage to make it easier to find and prepare meals with plant-based products.","Anaheim, Calif. – The plant-based industry is much like a garden: it once flourished with vibrant growth but has since faced a dry spell, awaiting the right conditions to rebloom. At Natural Products Expo West, key industry stakeholders may have offered the industry the nutrients it needs.

Between 2018 and 2024 the plant-based foods industry grew from $4.5 billion to $8.1 billion in annual sales, supported by the 59% household penetration and 79% repeat rate observed throughout 2024, according to a session, titled “From Plants to Plates: Unpacking Consumer Spending & Sentiment in Plant-Based vs Animal-Based Categories,” which presented recent data created in partnership with the Plant Based Foods Association and Kroger’s data insights firm 84.51.

However, despite the perceived growth, the industry has struggled in recent years, facing headwinds, particularly from key “decreasers”—those who have dialed back their plant-based purchases.

To win back these consumers, decreasers cite lower pricing, better taste and texture, and wider availability of plant-based options on-shelf as key motivators to continue purchasing plant-based categories, explained PBFA head of marketplace Hannah Lopez.

The conversation, which also included 84.51 director of loyalty marketing consulting Maureen Heis and non-dairy creamer brand Nutpods CMO Patrick Coyle, looked at the state of the industry and advised plant-based manufacturers and grocers how to address key industry pain points.

“The plant-based food industry is keenly aware of consumer sentiment and continues to drive innovation throughout the industry,” added Lopez.

Already, measurable success has been achieved to mitigate these growing pains.

On the other end of the spectrum, for example, consumer “increasers” say they’re upping their plant-based consumption because of taste and variety.

The report polled consumers in May 2024 and December 2024, finding that those who increased purchases cited taste as the fast-growing motivator, increasing 13% to 36%, while variety increased by 3% over the same period to 33%.

Plant-Based Growth Indicators

The 2025 outlook for the plant-based sector looks optimistic, with both plant-based evangelists and skeptics increasing consumption across categories.

Across households, household consumption has increased by 34%, while 57% note they are maintaining their purchasing behavior. When asked why, health perception, taste, environmental impact, variety, and animal welfare reasons all grew between May 2024 and December 2024.

As a result, 91% of increasers and 96% of decreasers of plant-based foods claim to be increasing or maintaining consumption, according to the report. This indicates strong wins for the sector.

The key to tapping into this growth? a comprehensive strategy considering mechanization, pricing, and personalized promotions.

Capturing Growth With a Plant-Based Portfolio

Coyle noted that the sentiment data underscores the key to plant-based success—consumers care about the product before the mission.

“There’s a balance between value and values,” he said. “We must balance the heart with the head. In most cases, consumers won’t pay twice as much for a more sustainable product.”

Additionally, he recommended tempering the research with a comprehensive strategy. For example, consumers cite decreasing plant-based consumption because of fewer promotions on these products throughout 2024; however, from a brand perception standpoint, a product line shouldn’t always be on sale.

Instead, he recommends working with retailers to maximize the limited display space in stores. Designated plant-based sections could be a blight on a brand, as it does little to attract new consumers to the area, so facilitating any way to foster special moments with plant-based products can help inspire trial and repeat purchases.

Lopez agreed, adding that business leaders should consider the following:

Provide transparency on nutritional benefits to educate them on the category.

Offer promotions and variety (within reason) to assuage the category’s negative price and availability perceptions.

Work with retailers to add shelf-talkers and signage to make it easier to find and prepare meals with plant-based products.

A tenet of the plant-based 2.0 movement, Coyle added that its brand benefited from eschewing flavor parity with its dairy-based analog. He said that the brand has invested significant R&D into optimizing taste and texture, however, the goal is to make it the best it can be, rather than an imitation of a dairy creamer.

“The reason you use coffee creamer is to make your coffee better. If it doesn’t, the customer won’t buy it,” he said.

Dive Brief:

Apparel, accessories and footwear spending fell 2% in January and February, lagging behind overall spending in the U.S., according to a report from Consumer Edge released Tuesday.

Luxury spending fell 7% during the period, which the report said was on par with 2024’s 8% decline in the sector. Spending at department stores increased 2%.

Within the apparel, accessories and footwear segment, fast fashion and the combined category of consignment and thrift saw the highest growth during the period, with both categories seeing spending increase by 5% compared to the same period last year.

Dive Insight:

Consumer Edge gathered the sales transaction data from more than 40 million active U.S. credit and debit cards, according to a company spokesperson.

The report found that customer spending on sports footwear and athletic apparel fell 6% compared to the same period last year. Strong performances from newer brands including Alo Yoga, Vuori and On Running “failed to compensate for ongoing softness among traditional sportswear brands,” the report said.

Multi-brand luxury platforms fell 22% in the period compared to last year. However, the report found that MyTheresa and Farfetch gained share among wealthier shoppers and proved more resilient than Net-A-Porter and Ssense, per the report.

Single-brand luxury fell 6% compared to last year, which Consumer Edge said was despite positive performance from midlevel brands such as Coach and Ralph Lauren. Customers pulled back their spending at higher-end brands including Chanel and Christian Dior for the second year in a row, which Consumer Edge said could be attributed to a potential protest against price hikes and limited product innovation.

Among high-income shoppers, Louis Vuitton and Cartier increased their share of spending while Gucci saw the worst share losses, per the report.

The report also broke down spending by age group, which a Consumer Edge spokesperson said was based on a subset of its larger data panel.

While all age groups reduced spending on apparel, accessories and footwear, consumers aged 25 to 34 cut back by 6.2% — the most over the last 12 months. Spending among people aged 18 to 24 declined the least, at 1.8%, per the report.

Consumers older than 65 cut their spending by 4.5%. Report authors said this was an important segment of the market, because this group has more disposable income and includes more people reaching retirement age.

Meanwhile, those aged 35 to 44 decreased their spending 4%; people aged 45 to 54 decreased spending 5%; and those aged 55 to 64 decreased spending 3.8%.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Mw2N5xEqAeZolIpC_HSuxr2swTHZHtvg8vf1AHXemT8/g:nowe:0:254/c:2500:1412/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODU1NjY3NTE0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-03-25 13:05:26.214645

MORE: McDonald’s Builds Focused Category Teams to Compete with Chicken and Beverage Specialists While the industry saw double-digit declines in lower-income-consumer traffic in Q4, McDonald’s said it observed its highest share all year.
Survey platform Numerator recently polled 400 verified McValue Menu customers to track their reactions to the deal.
Most McValue Menu customers were already loyal McDonald’s guests prior to the launch of the McValue Menu—94 percent went to McDonald’s in the first half of 2024.
Forty-eight percent of McValue Menu buyers said the McValue Menu made them choose McDonald’s instead of going to a different restaurant.","It remains relatively early in McDonald’s race back to unified value. The chain in January launched its McValue Menu—a platform housing every deal: in-app offers, local food and drink specials, a new Buy One, Add One for $1 lure at breakfast and lunch/dinner, and, naturally, the $5 Meal Deal itself, which arrived late June and has extended through.

Beyond the point this change was, as is often the case for McDonald’s, the largest domino in a wider fast-food value rush, it also marked the first time in nearly six years it boasted a company-wide value position across the U.S. (the last being the $1 $2 $3 menu).

CEO Chris Kempczinski, in McDonald’s Q4 recap, said the brand witnessed an increase in guest counts—a key development given ongoing soft traffic—and the stealing of visit share. Unsurprisingly, guest counts ran ahead of check as well. That latter point is consistent with McDonald’s experience launching new value programs, he said. “And then, as you get that sort of bedded down and you introduce food news and other things on top of that, you get the one, two punch of check plus [guest count] growth. So that’s what we’re expecting in the U.S.,” Kempczinski said.

Essentially, McDonald’s, for a while, lifted its top line on price instead of traffic—like much of the industry. But the equation wobbled as hikes held and it shed business from the lower-income cohort of its guest base.

From 2019 to 2024, McDonald’s appreciated 30 percent same-store sales growth, even with negative customer counts. However, as inflation persisted, there were simply fewer visits to compete for, leading to a “street-fighting mentality,” as CFO Ian Borden explained last April. That kicked off the $5 Meal Deal and, ultimately, the holistic McValue Menu.

McDonald’s simply had to retrench itself among value seekers. Kempczinski’s Q4 commentary suggests it did just that, which is why the company saw check depression with more customers tapping value instead of higher-ticket orders—a point, as noted, he feels will level out once innovation ramps up and the cadence settles.

The brand’s U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4 percent in Q4. Yet it was a difficult stretch to gauge considering October’s slivered onions E. coli outbreak. McDonald’s told investors its domestic business experienced mid-single-digit comps growth, with traffic expansion slightly below, before the incident. The Quarter Pounder hit slid sales to a low point in early November, with trends rebounding into December. Kempczinski said guest count growth reported slightly positive in December and up compared to peers in Q4. He added momentum continued in Q1 2025 and McDonald’s expects to be fully recovered by the start of Q2.

While the industry saw double-digit declines in lower-income-consumer traffic in Q4, McDonald’s said it observed its highest share all year.

The culprit: value, product news, and digital strength (the total number of 90-day active users reached more than 170 million across 60 markets, with systemwide sales to loyalty members totaling roughy $30 billion in 2024).

The $5 Meal Deal was live in Q4 and the Chicken Big Mac rolled out before the McRib returned in December. And, again, Q1 started with McValue. Executives said leadership of value and affordability scores improved thanks to the $5 Meal Deal and BOGO $1 offer. Both increased average transaction numbers since guests added items beyond the promotion.

Checks that included the $5 Meal Deal were north of $10 on average in Q4. The BOGO offer also boosted breakfast sales—historically McDonald’s highest-margin daypart.

Is the value resonating?

Survey platform Numerator recently polled 400 verified McValue Menu customers to track their reactions to the deal. Here were some results:

McValue Menu buyers said their main reasons for purchasing were the menu offered a low-priced deal (42 percent), the menu offered options at a variety of price points (28 percent), and they specifically wanted an item (or items) available on the McValue Menu (22 percent).

Compared to all McDonald’s shoppers, McValue Menu buyers were 30 percent more likely to be Black, 15 percent more likely to be low income, 15 percent more likely to have children, and 14 percent more likely to be Hispanic.

Most McValue Menu customers were already loyal McDonald’s guests prior to the launch of the McValue Menu—94 percent went to McDonald’s in the first half of 2024.

Forty-eight percent of McValue Menu buyers said the McValue Menu made them choose McDonald’s instead of going to a different restaurant. The restaurants that they would have visited instead were Burger King (18 percent), Chick-fil-A (17 percent), Wendy’s (14 percent), and Taco Bell (11 percent).

Forty-four percent of McValue Menu buyers said they were going to go to McDonald’s anyway, and 8 percent said they were not planning to eat fast food at all but the McValue Menu caused them to go to McDonald’s.

Ninety-one percent of McValue Menu buyers said they are likely to buy off the menu again.

The top options that McValue Menu buyers would like to see on the menu are more burger options (44 percent), more chicken sandwich options (35 percent), more breakfast sandwich options (34 percent), Filet-O-Fish (33 percent), and sweets & treats (30 percent).

So what do these stats clarify in a vacuum? It does appear McDonald’s is swaying some value-driven customers from competitors, getting back into the occasion set after ceding ground over the past couple of years. But it’s also potentially sending loyal diners down the ladder. Like Kempczinski said, this could be a transitory reaction as customers tap “what’s new,” which also happens to be the value end of the spectrum.

The brand has some non-discounted launches on deck, like Snack Wraps, future Chicken Big Mac drips as an LTO, and a new chicken strip offering. The company believes it can add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026. Globally, its signature McCrispy Sandwich is sold in over 70 markets and will be available in nearly all by the end of this year. It’s a $1 billion brand across several markets.

“We do have, I think, some very exciting food news, food innovation coming in the U.S., but my U.S. team would kill me if I gave any more details about the when and the exact specifics of how we’re going to plan on doing that but certainly expect that to come online later in the year,” Kempczinski said in Q4.

Snack Wraps are a product that left most U.S. menus in 2016, with some restaurants keeping them on through 2020. Introduced in 2006 and priced at $1.29, it’s likely the Snack Wrap not only gives McDonald’s another marketing piece with strong nostalgic pull, but one that can provide a consistent value entry point, either as an add-on or a menu item with ladder-up potential.

BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, from franchisee checks in February, said the McValue platform, $5 Meal Deal, and app/loyalty discounts were accounting for more than a third of sales—three times the company’s historical mix and the highest Saleh could recall.

Plainly, he felt McDonald’s was over-indexing to value with a discount so much higher than the traditional average of low-teens. Some franchisees, he added, indicated food costs as a percent of sales had not been this high in six or seven years, implying margin pressure. Several franchisees, reportedly, raised prices on the BOGO items before the deal went into effect to protect margins.

The BOGO represented a mid-teens percent of mix, while the $5 Meal Deal was still in the low double-digits, placing the total discount block north of 30 percent, as mentioned, when including existing app/loyalty discounts (mid-single digits).

Although McDonald’s dealt with inflation, investment in value, and the E. coli incident in 2024, U.S. franchisees still achieved cash flows north of $500,000 per unit, the company claimed.

But Coca-Cola’s growth strategy goes beyond new products.
While not responsible for creative messaging, Publicis must ensure the brand’s messages reach the right consumers at the right time.","In adland, account wins and losses dominate the headlines, but the real story is what happens next.

Now, in the next chapter of the age-old soda wars, Publicis has won Coca-Cola’s U.S. media business from incumbent WPP, while PepsiCo is doubling down on its future, acquiring the fast-growing prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion.

Beyond the agency shakeups and corporate restructuring, the bigger question is how these brands are actually performing and what challenges lie ahead. For Coca-Cola, the real test is whether its business strategy is built for long-term growth in an increasingly competitive, health-conscious industry.

To evaluate the soda giant’s position and cut through the noise, Campaign Red analyzed the company’s financial performance, strategic direction and the broader forces shaping its future.

Coca-Cola’s financial tightrope

One of Coca-Cola’s biggest challenges is that consumers aren’t buying significantly more of its products than they did last year.

In North America, unit case volume growth — a key measure of consumer demand — has remained flat. This metric reflects the change in the total number of Coca-Cola beverage cases sold, whether by the company itself or by its bottling partners.

While sparkling flavors and Coca-Cola’s signature brand saw modest growth, sales of water, sports drinks, coffee and tea declined, dragging down overall performance.

The only real momentum came from juice, dairy and plant-based beverages, which saw the strongest gains. Brands in this category include Core Power, fairlife, Minute Maid and Simply.

Yet despite sluggish volume growth, the soda maker’s revenue is climbing.

The reason? Higher prices and shifts in product and packaging mix.

The company’s North American net operating revenue rose 11% in 2024 compared to 2023, but price increases and changes in package and category mix drove nearly all of the gains.

Rather than selling significantly more drinks, Coca-Cola is making more per unit, which has fueled double-digit revenue growth but raises questions about long-term sustainability in a competitive market.

Coca-Cola’s profitability is also under pressure. Operating income in North America declined by 2% year over year, dropping from $4.44 billion in 2023 to $4.34 billion in 2024.

The company’s North American operating margin shrank by 3.1 percentage points, a sign of rising costs, higher expenses and other financial pressures.

Coca-Cola attributed the decline to higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending and higher operating expenses, challenges that even a 1% increase in concentrate sales volume and “favorable pricing initiatives” couldn’t fully offset.

The ‘total beverage company’ approach

With soda consumption under increasing pressure, Coca-Cola has leaned into its “total beverage company” business strategy, expanding beyond traditional soft drinks to diversify its product portfolio.

The company has invested heavily in juices, dairy, plant-based beverages and functional drinks, hoping to meet changing consumer preferences. A key test of this strategy is Simply Pop, Coca-Cola’s latest foray into the fast-growing prebiotic soda space — a category that rival PepsiCo recently tapped into with its $1.95 billion acquisition of Poppi.

However, Simply Pop faces an uphill battle against Poppi, which has already built strong brand awareness and consumer loyalty.

According to a recent survey by consumer insights firm Zappi, nearly half of 1,000 U.S. soda drinkers recognized Poppi as a brand offering prebiotic and probiotic beverages, while only 14% were aware of Simply Pop.

But Coca-Cola’s growth strategy goes beyond new products. The company has also overhauled its marketing approach, shifting away from traditional TV ads and increasing digital ad spend from less than 30% in 2019 to approximately 60% in 2023.

This shift is at the heart of Coca-Cola’s effort to “recruit the next generation of drinkers.” Instead of casting a wide net with TV ads that once reached 80-90% of the population, the company is now using digital segmentation to focus its marketing dollars on those most likely to buy.

Coca-Cola segments consumers into four key groups: “Weekly plus” drinkers, “intenders,” “neutrals” and “rejectors.”

By filtering out those unlikely to convert and zeroing in on “positive intenders,” people who already drink in the category but either prefer a competitor’s product or don’t buy Coca-Cola as often, the brand is sharpening its digital strategy to make every marketing dollar count.

“You don’t need to invest dollars behind [rejectors],” said Manolo Arroyo, Coca-Cola’s global CMO in a presentation during Q3 2023. “That drives a very different dynamic in this whole model.”

Uncertain waters: The challenges ahead

Coca-Cola’s future growth is also deeply intertwined with political and regulatory hurdles.

U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed banning the use of federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funds to “buy soda or processed foods,” calling these products “poison.” If enacted, such a policy could have ripple effects on soda consumption and sales.

The beverage giant, and the soda industry at large, is no stranger to public health debates, but the Kennedy-led “Make America Healthy Again” movement could introduce new obstacles.

The company is also facing the possibility of new taxes on sugary drinks and increasing governmental regulations around ingredients, additives and manufacturing processes. These could impact not only consumer behavior but also Coca-Cola’s profitability.

Additionally, stricter regulations on the advertising, labeling and sale of sweetened beverages could become further threats to Coca-Cola’s ability to connect with consumers.

“If negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image, corporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer,” the company said in its latest annual financial report.

In response to these growing concerns, Coca-Cola has reinforced its commitment to a broader beverage portfolio, emphasizing its low- and no-calorie options, clear nutritional labeling and responsible marketing practices, such as not targeting children under 13 with ads.

The critical challenge remains: Can Coca-Cola sustain long-term growth in a market where health-conscious and functional beverages are gaining priority among consumers, regulators and retailers?

Enter Publicis, Coca-Cola’s newly appointed U.S. media agency. While not responsible for creative messaging, Publicis must ensure the brand’s messages reach the right consumers at the right time. The success of this strategy will determine whether Coca-Cola can maintain its dominance, or whether PepsiCo’s aggressive push into functional beverages will force it to rethink its approach yet again.",https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/150/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/SUC/Coca-Cola-analysis-CUS.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 12:11:02.537872

This figure represents a decrease of 10 percent compared to the 50 million euros in profit recorded the previous year.","Madrid – The jewellers Tous have just reported their financial results at the close of their latest financial year in 2024. This was the first year that the company concluded under the implementation of its new strategic “GEM” plan. This plan has proven to be a real game-changer, given the outstanding performance achieved, surpassing the 500 million euros turnover mark for the first time in its history.

Based on the financial information shared by the management of the Manresa-based firm, Tous closed 2024 with a turnover of 523 million euros. This figure represents an increase of 9.6 percent compared to the 477 million euros in sales invoiced during the previous year. It also leaves the Spanish company growing by 32.4 percent compared to the 395 million euros it achieved in 2019, the last year completed before the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

Regarding its profitability, Tous reported an EBITDA that decreased to 114 million euros (minus 1.72 percent year-over-year), resulting in a net profit that totalled 45 million euros. This figure represents a decrease of 10 percent compared to the 50 million euros in profit recorded the previous year. However, it is still plus 50 percent higher than the 30 million euros in net profit recorded in 2019. Tous attributes this drop in profit to exchange rates.

“In 2024, we successfully met the objectives set for the first year of the ‘GEM’ plan,” said Carlos Soler-Duffo, chief executive officer of Tous. He defended the results in a statement shared by the management team. “Tous is now a stronger brand, with a solid global presence and a unique differential proposition in jewellery.” He added that Tous has “solid levers that have translated into results and on which we will continue working to drive our sustainable growth”.

Organic growth, with new retail formats

Delving into the company’s performance throughout 2024, sales in Tous stores accounted for 76.5 percent of the company’s total turnover, at 400 million euros (plus 8.9 percent). The online channel increased from 23 to 23.5 percent of the company’s total sales in one year, at approximately 122.9 million euros (plus 12 percent).

Regarding these same channels, Tous highlighted that, for the physical channel, sales growth occurred in a year in which its commercial network remained stable. The company focused on updating and renovating its store fleet to boost turnover, with approximately 50 renovations carried out throughout the year. These improvements have served to start developing new store concepts, such as the first points of sale for the new formats dedicated exclusively to its Tous Atelier and Suot Studio lines. As for the online channel, the firm has taken a further step in its commitment to internationalisation, with the launch of its new global website in 2024. This launch complements the network of over 600 physical stores that Tous has in 40 countries.

Regarding its performance by country and region, Tous has limited itself to pointing out that, following the organic growth that has sustained it in 2024, this in turn “has been widespread in all regions, including the most mature markets for Tous”, such as Spain and Mexico. These operations have enabled the brand to strengthen itself on a global scale, one of the main objectives of the “GEM” plan. The eyewear, watch and perfume collections produced through the assignment of licenses have also contributed to this, generating a global business volume of approximately 200 million euros, in terms of sales to the end customer.

The coffee giant has been making moves to rebrand their stores as classic coffeehouses for communities to “sit and stay” — and it’s paying off, according to numbers shared with Axios.

At the end of January, Starbucks implemented a new refill policy where customers ordering in-store have to say if they would like their drink “for here” or “to go.”

Those who order “for here” get their drink served in a ceramic mug, glass or a personal cup. These people are able to get free refills during their visit on hot brewed or iced coffee, or hot or iced tea.

Starbucks revealed to Axios that over the past three weeks, “the number of customers who choose ceramic mugs and glasses to sit and stay in cafes has on average increased by more than 3X in the U.S.”

Customers must have their first drink served in one of these reusable cups in order to receive free refills, and no disposable or plastic vessels can get free refills — which is encouraging some patrons to stay awhile.

New CEO Brian Niccol — who took the helm back in September — said at the company’s annual shareholders meeting last week that he was “pleased at the early reaction to changes we’ve made from both customers and partners.”

These changes come as Starbucks is hoping to increase foot traffic and sales as part of its “Back to Starbucks” initiative, a plan to simplify offerings and return to its roots.

The company is “leaning into our coffee culture,” Tressie Lieberman, Starbucks’ global chief brand officer, told Axios.

“We’re reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse and reintroducing Starbucks to the world,” Lieberman added.

The coffee giant is aiming to expand their reach, investing in ads on TV and streaming that will “evoke the feeling that ‘I want to go to Starbucks.'”

Starbucks has already started to test new designs in select locations, too, bringing back “more comfortable seating and spaces,” further giving stores an old-school vibe where customers can sit for hours relaxing or doing remote work.

New designs include “expanded seating options, power outlets, and abundant food displays” as well as some locations with “more separation between the cafe and mobile order experience,” the company revealed to Axios.

Niccol has been making quite a few changes to the popular coffee chain since he came aboard from Chipotle.

When he started, he noted that one of his priorities to accelerate growth at the company is to simplify the “overly complex” menu so baristas can speed up service with a goal to cut “roughly 30%” of food and drink options from its menu by late 2025. At the beginning of the month, Starbucks removed 13 drinks from its menu.

The company also recently shared that users on the Starbucks app and website will no longer be able to make certain modifications because these changes are included in beverages that already exist on the menu.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/starbucks-shift-entices-customers-sit-101078504.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-03-25 11:04:10.529912

In a statement, Conagra said the facility will close by the end of June this year.

The company behind brands such as Birds Eye and Duncan Hines said the closure is a bid to manage its facilities and overall operations as “effectively and efficiently as possible”.

Conagra added the production of pie filling will be relocated to another facility, although specific details have not been disclosed.

The closure follows Conagra’s shutdown of its Birds Eye frozen vegetables plant in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, in April, which impacted 252 workers.

Alongside these operational changes, Conagra has trimmed its full-year sales forecast due to supply chain disruptions affecting two product categories.

Last month, the company projected organic net sales to decline by approximately 2%, revising its previous guidance of a potential 1.5% decline at worst to flat at best.

Conagra has also lowered its outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $2.35, down from the previous range of $2.45 to $2.50.

The adjusted operating margin forecast has been reduced to approximately 14.4% from 14.8%.

For the three months ending 24 November, net sales dipped 0.4%, reaching $3.2bn.

During the quarter, gross profit remained stable at $847m, while adjusted gross profit fell by 2.3% to $842m “as productivity and higher organic net sales were offset by the negative impacts of cost of goods sold inflation and unfavourable operating leverage”.

Net sales up by 12.9% to CHF 361.3 million; adjusted for currency effects, growth was 13.6%.

EBITDA improved by 13.6% to CHF 57.0 million; EBITDA margin reaches 15.8%.

Dividend of CHF 0.40 per share proposed for the 2024 financial year.

Strategic initiatives for integrated process systems and a higher degree of standardization in the equipment business are on track; pre-approved services to start in 2026.

For 2025, a revenue growth in the mid-teens and an EBITDA margin between 14 and 16% are targeted.

Allschwil, 25 March 2025 – The SKAN Group can report another successful financial year. Market growth continued unabated in 2024. The ongoing trend towards injectable drugs, and thus towards SKAN’s process solutions for the aseptic filling of biopharmaceutical active ingredients, ensured high demand among customers. In the reporting year, there was particularly strong demand for filling lines for antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) – modern oncology drugs that enable more targeted therapies. SKAN received several orders in the double-digit million range for such large and complex lines with the highest quality requirements. Another, albeit less pronounced, driver was equipment for filling GLP-1 drugs for obesity, which accounted for around 15% of the order intake in the reporting year. Last but not least, the logjam of orders that occurred after the coronavirus boom has now been cleared.

Taken together, these factors contributed to a marked increase in incoming orders compared to the previous year. In particular, a significant increase in requests for quotations was noticeable from May onwards, reflected in an acceleration of incoming orders towards the end of 2024. The success rate for quotations remained high, which is attributable to the high quality and leading technology of SKAN systems as well as its process expertise. This enabled SKAN to consolidate its position as number one in the high-end segment of the isolator market.

Strong order intake

Overall, the SKAN Group recorded incoming orders of CHF 359.5 million. This corresponds to an increase of 21.8% compared to the previous year. The order backlog climbed to CHF 318.3 million, which gives us good visibility in the equipment business for the rest of the year. The SKAN Group increased its net sales by 12.9% to CHF 361.3 million; adjusted for currency effects, growth was 13.6%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) grew by 13.6% to CHF 57.0 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 15.8%.

In terms of sales growth, the SKAN Group fell short of the expectation communicated for 2024. This was due to the fact that some projects were postponed to 2025. Although the relevant systems were already at the customers' premises at the end of the year, work on-site was delayed. At the EBITDA margin level, however, the target was exceeded.

Profit for the 2024 financial year amounted to CHF 40.8 million. The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting of SKAN Group AG on 7 May 2025 that a dividend of CHF 0.40 per share be distributed.

Equipment & Solutions with progress in integration and standardization

The Equipment & Solutions segment increased the order intake in the financial year 2024 by 19.6% to CHF 255.0 million. Net sales rose by 14.3% to CHF 270.9 million. The segment thus contributed 75% of the SKAN Group's total sales. The segment's EBITDA rose by 12.9% to CHF 30.3 million, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 11.2%.

In the reporting year, the SKAN Group generated good sales of large-scale systems, including those used for the aseptic filling of the aforementioned ADC or GLP-1 substances. At the same time, the trend towards personalized medications requires smaller production batches, and thus smaller, flexible systems. The integrated systems that the SKAN Group has been developing for some time together with Aseptic Technologies and other long-standing partner companies are designed to meet these requirements. In the reporting year, a large portion of the expenditures for research and development, which corresponded to 8.3% of sales, was invested in the development of such integrated solutions.

The SKAN Group also made good progress with the strategic initiative to increase the degree of standardization of the systems. Measurable successes were seen in a reduction of complexity through the use of standardized components and the associated increase in efficiency.

An extraordinary contribution to the sales of the Equipment & Solutions segment was made last year by the trading business, which fulfilled a major order for 246 biosafety cabinets for a Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer.

Services & Consumables benefits from growing installed base

The Services & Consumables segment recorded an order intake of CHF 104.5 million in the 2024 financial year, 27.6% more than in the previous year. Net sales increased by 9.0% to CHF 90.4 million and EBITDA amounted to CHF 26.6 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 29.5%.

One driver of growth in the service business is the continuous expansion of the installed base of SKAN systems. These require maintenance, periodic requalification as required by regulations, and spare parts. The retrofit business – the renewal of technical equipment and software for older isolators – also developed favorably.

As expected, the subsidiary Aseptic Technologies continued to see growing acceptance of its automated processing solutions for closed vials. New drugs filled in AT-Closed Vials® have been approved for distribution, meaning that eight drugs had been approved by health authorities in 17 regions and launched by the end of 2024. The development pipeline of medications to be filled in a AT-Closed Vial® contains several hundred active ingredients. Accordingly, the sales volume of AT-Closed Vial® and associated consumables, such as filling sets, is expected to increase further in the future.

The Pre-Approved Services project was also driven forward in the reporting year. The response from initial selective customer discussions has been extremely positive. According to the current project status, the inspection by the Swiss regulatory authority is planned for the first quarter of 2026, so that commercial operation can start in the second half of 2026.

Investments in future growth

Most of the investments, totaling CHF 53.8 million, were used to develop pre-approved services in the 2024 financial year. The remaining funds were used to expand infrastructure in Switzerland and Belgium.

Cash flow from operating activities rose significantly, from CHF 8.7 million to CHF 46.7 million, primarily driven by increased profitability, reduced inventory levels, and effective management of trade receivables. Equity at the end of 2024 amounted to CHF 202.6 million, corresponding to an equity ratio of 52.7%.

Sustainability strategy in place and responsibilities defined

In the 2024 financial year, SKAN pushed ahead with its sustainability policy and anchored it even more firmly within the company. A group-wide ESG strategy has been adopted to ensure that sustainability considerations are systematically integrated into business activities. The corresponding responsibilities have also been defined. At the Board of Directors level, Vice President Cornelia Gehrig is responsible for sustainability, while CEO Thomas Huber is responsible for sustainability at the Executive Board level.

In addition to the sustainability report in accordance with the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) standard, which SKAN has been publishing since 2021, the company successfully completed the assessment of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for the first time last year. This assessment provided a comprehensive understanding of the climate-related opportunities and risks that are relevant to the business. In addition, the necessary data collection was established in the reporting year to comply with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which will be required at the European level.

SKAN confirms double-digit growth target for 2025

The SKAN Group is focused on a market that is benefiting from structural growth. The medical applications targeted by the customers' medications will continue to increase. The trend towards injectable drugs will continue, as will the shift from traditional clean rooms to superior isolator technology. Accordingly, customer demand for aseptic filling process solutions and related services and consumables will also continue.

Due to the nature of the project business, there may be delays in the execution of orders. From today's perspective, the Board of Directors and Management therefore expect a subdued sales development in the first half of 2025. The resulting shortfall in sales and earnings should be largely compensated for in the second half of the year, so that sales growth in the mid-teens is expected for the full year. At the EBITDA margin level, a target between 14% and 16% has been set.

In addition to the structural growth drivers and the high order backlog, the strong order intake in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first months of 2025 are particularly encouraging. Furthermore, some customers have reserved production capacities for the coming months. The newly acquired projects will be reflected in sales in the second half of 2025 and then especially in 2026.

ID35,Starbucks,2025-03-25 10:03:32+00:00,Modern Retail,"From Starbucks to indie brands, soaring bean prices are squeezing the coffee industry","Allison Smith, Gabriela Barkho",,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/operations/from-starbucks-to-indie-brands-soaring-bean-prices-are-squeezing-the-coffee-industry/,"As coffee prices soar, small and mid-sized coffee companies are scrambling to adapt.
For instance, Starbucks locks in its coffee prices through futures contracts 12-18 months in advance, according to company filings.
VitaCup, which is sold online and wholesale through major retailers like Walmart, purchased coffee futures, locking in prices at below $3 a pound.
Changing consumer behavior As coffee prices remain elevated, Leslie expects consumers to shift more of their habits home.
All told, coffee companies are bracing for more volatility — and trying to plan ahead, even amid the uncertainty.","It was the second significant cost increase Hart had faced in less than a year. Just a few months earlier, Couple’s Coffee had axed its social media manager, even though Hart knew it would hurt the brand’s visibility, to keep prices stable for customers. Now, with another cost hike on the horizon, there wasn’t much fat left to trim.

“We’re kind of cornered,” she said. “This time, we have no choice but to raise prices.”

What’s more, Hart’s roaster warned of not just higher bean prices, but also widespread strain across the coffee supply chain — including bankruptcies, defaults and the possibility that Trump’s sweeping tariffs would further hit the industry hard.

Prices of arabica beans — a staple of major coffee chains like Starbucks — have surged over the past year, with arabica futures hitting an all-time high above $4.30 per pound in February. Prices for robusta beans, a cheaper variety typically used for instant coffee, have also spiked. It’s all because of droughts in major producing countries like Brazil and Vietnam, which have tightened supply while demand remains strong.

As coffee prices soar, small and mid-sized coffee companies are scrambling to adapt. In addition to supply disruptions in key producers, the specter of tariffs is also adding another layer of uncertainty for coffee companies. For brands already stretched thin, the cost crunch is forcing hard choices: raise prices, eat the losses or scale back operations.

Coffee’s price reckoning

This year is shaping up to be a reckoning for the industry, according to Brandon Fishman, founder of San Diego-based VitaCup, a vitamin-infused coffee brand. That’s because many larger retailers are only now reaching the end of their long-term futures contracts, which had shielded them from the worst of the increases. For instance, Starbucks locks in its coffee prices through futures contracts 12-18 months in advance, according to company filings.

Traditionally, coffee companies invest in the futures market to lock in prices for coffee they will purchase in the future, mitigating the risk of sudden price increases. But supply shortages have persisted, keeping prices high, meaning that coffee companies who hedged their bets in the futures markets are feeling the pinch now, too, and are poised to pass the price off to customers, who are already paying more for coffee than ever. In February 2025, the average price of ground roast coffee climbed to a record high of $7.25 a pound, according to the federal data.

VitaCup, which is sold online and wholesale through major retailers like Walmart, purchased coffee futures, locking in prices at below $3 a pound. But now, those contracts are expiring, and the brand will have to pay around $4 a pound moving forward.

Samuel Klein, green coffee buyer at New York-based Partners Coffee, said that looking back about five years ago, much of the conversation within the coffee industry was actually about prices being unsustainably low. That’s because coffee can often be unprofitable to grow, and yield is dependent on weather patterns or disease. But just in the past year alone, Klein said, the rate of upward trend has been rapid. “Coffee is about twice as expensive now,” he said.

“I don’t think people understand the scale of what’s coming. I’m not talking about 10% price increases. It could be 50% or more, especially on private-label brands at big-box stores,” Fishman said. “Come April or May, a lot of those contracts expire, and that’s when the market will really feel it.”

Indeed, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri told investors in January that rising coffee costs are squeezing profits. The impact is even greater in the company’s packaged goods division, where price volatility is hitting “in a more meaningful way,” she said.

VitaCup increased its prices twice in the last six months, a dollar each time. Fishman expects more hikes to come. “We’re also cutting software, anything we can,” he said.

Tariff pressure

For coffee brands, the uncertainty around tariffs adds another layer of stress.

“What I’m more concerned about is decaf coffee, because the overwhelming majority of it is processed in either Canada or Mexico,” said Partners Coffee’s Klein.

Craig Leslie, founder of The Bean Coffee Company, is also feeling the squeeze on decaf coffee. “Swiss water decaf, in particular, has gotten very expensive,” he said. “We’ve raised prices three times on Amazon and twice on our website.”

For now, 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada have been delayed until April 2. However, brands still don’t have clear insight into exactly what tariffs will take effect on April 2, as Trump has gone back and forth on his trade policies since he took office.

Terminology around importing policy is currently vague, complicating matters further, according to Klein. For instance, it’s not always clear whether coffee should be classified by the country where it was grown or where it was processed, such as beans grown in Brazil but decaffeinated in Mexico.

“Decaf coffee is already expensive to produce and transport,” he said, as it’s often transported across complex supply chains across North America and the European Union.

The family-owned Cafe Aroma, which has been in business since 1961, has recently been buying coffee opportunistically when the market dips or avoiding committing to longer-term futures contracts in case prices come down, the company’s vp Bernadette Gerrity told Modern Retail.

Similarly, Klein’s buying strategy has been focused on meticulous planning and not over-ordering coffee to bring into the U.S. “But obviously the margin for me to make a mistake is a lot smaller than it was a year ago,” he said.

Changing consumer behavior

As coffee prices remain elevated, Leslie expects consumers to shift more of their habits home. “I think people are going to stop spending $4 or $5 at a coffee shop and brew more at home,” he said.

That shift is already playing out on a larger scale. J.M. Smucker, which owns brands like Folgers and Café Bustelo, hiked its prices last summer, and again in October. But instead of seeing a drop in demand, the company saw its net sales in the U.S. coffee side of the business rise 2% in the most recent quarter, driven by higher prices and steady demand.

“Overall, at-home coffee remains a strong and resilient category that provides value to consumers in all economic environments,” Mark Smucker, the company’s CEO, told investors on an earnings call last month.

All told, coffee companies are bracing for more volatility — and trying to plan ahead, even amid the uncertainty.

As Klein put it, “I need to pay closer attention to the market circumstances and have a good understanding of what the next six months or a year could look like.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/glossy_coffee.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 12:11:23.821537

WARNING LETTER

Mr. Santamarta:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Unipharma, LLC, FEI 3011079709, at 10200 NW 67th Street, Tamarac, Florida from April 22 to May 7, 2019.

This warning letter summarizes significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211.

Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).

In addition, your firm manufactures “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” that is an unapproved new drug in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d). Additionally, “CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” is misbranded under section 502(c) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(c). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). These violations are described in more detail below.

We reviewed your May 28, 2019, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence.

During our inspection, our investigator observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.

CGMP Violations

1. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or not the batch has already been distributed (21 CFR 211.192).

You use (b)(4) water to manufacture over-the-counter (OTC) drug products. Several drug products that you manufacture are intended for infant and pediatric use. You released multiple batches of OTC drug products manufactured with (b)(4) water although test results indicated an adverse trend of Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia) in your water system. Objectionable microbiological contamination of water used in manufacturing could lead to contamination of your drug products and pose a hazard to patients.

Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate the persistent adverse trend of objectionable microorganisms identified in your (b)(4) water samples during qualification that you commenced in late 2018, as well as during routine monitoring. Your firm initiated an investigation to address the microorganisms identified during system qualification.

Some of the microorganisms identified by your water sampling are known to contribute to biofilm formation in (b)(4) water systems and can be a source of objectionable contamination of drug products.

While the investigation was ongoing, you approved the performance qualification for your water system on December 1, 2018, which included a corrective action that improved the (b)(4) water sample collection process. (b)(4) water system testing continued to find low levels of B. cepacia at points-of-use and in the pretreatment portion of the (b)(4) water system. The pretreatment portion also had too numerous to count (TNTC) levels of microorganisms on multiple occasions.

At the end of the inspection, you stopped manufacturing your OTC drug products, placed the (b)(4) water system in a quarantine status, and recalled all your distributed drug products in an abundance of caution.

In your response, you started a new investigation, which has identified (b)(4) sanitization issues, sampling method errors, and preventive maintenance deficiencies. You implemented a corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) plan and are taking additional actions including revisions to standard operating procedures before restarting the (b)(4) water system.

Your response is inadequate because you have not comprehensively investigated all potential root causes for your water system control deficiencies. For example, you did not provide an investigation of the pretreatment sample location, PWI, where microbial analysis results were deemed as TNTC. Your investigation also did not include a sufficient assessment of equipment design deficiencies and system weaknesses, including but not limited to point-of-use attachments (such as transfer valves and piping), potential dead-legs, and preventive maintenance frequencies for system components. Your response also failed to address how you will ensure investigations in the future will be thorough, carefully reviewed by management, and the effectiveness of CAPAs determined.

In response to this letter, provide the following:

• A comprehensive, independent assessment of your overall system for investigating deviations, discrepancies, complaints, OOS results, and failures. Provide a detailed CAPA plan to remediate this system. Your action plan should include, but not be limited to, significant improvements in investigation competencies, scope determination, root cause evaluation, CAPA effectiveness, quality assurance oversight, and written procedures. Address how your firm will ensure all phases of investigations are appropriately conducted.

• A comprehensive, independent assessment of your laboratory practices, procedures, methods, equipment, documentation, and analyst competencies. Based on this review, provide a detailed plan to remediate and evaluate the effectiveness of your laboratory system.

• A comprehensive, independent assessment of your water system design, control, and maintenance.

• A thorough remediation plan to operate a suitable water system. Include a robust ongoing control, maintenance, and monitoring program to ensure the remediated system design consistently produces water adhering to (b)(4) Water, USP monograph specifications and appropriate microbial limits. Also include your plan for approving your remediated water system for use in production, and ensuring appropriate quality assurance oversight of both reintroduction of this system as well as oversight of its ongoing state of control

• Validation report for the water system obtained after all identified design issues have been fully corrected and any maintenance repairs have been completed. Include the system validation protocol, the complete test results, and the final validation report.

2. Your firm failed to establish adequate written procedures for production and process control designed to assure that the drug products you manufacture have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess (21 CFR 211.100(a)).

You failed to adequately perform process qualification for each of your OTC drug products. Your qualifications did not include appropriate acceptance criteria for all significant variables. You approved a process qualification report containing a Cpk value (process capability index) of (b)(4) for fill weight during (b)(4) operations.

Your results suggest that your process is not robust. You did not adequately demonstrate that your manufacturing processes are reproducible and controlled to consistently yield drugs of uniform character and quality.

In your response, you stated that Process Performance Qualification for Acetaminophen 160mg/5ml Bulk Solution Protocol, PV-18-0080 was not completed and that you “inadvertently released” acetaminophen 160mg/5ml lot 80061 to the U.S. market. You also stated that you will establish process validation protocols for each product, and will include predetermined critical process parameter specifications in the revised protocols.

Your response is inadequate because you failed to provide detailed process performance qualification protocols and an overall program for assuring ongoing maintenance of a validated process.

See FDA’s guidance document Process Validation: General Principles and Practices for general principles and approaches that FDA considers appropriate elements of process validation at https://www.fda.gov/media/71021/download.

In response to this letter, provide the following:

• A detailed summary of your validation program for ensuring a state of control throughout the product lifecycle, along with associated procedures. Describe your program for process performance qualification, and ongoing monitoring of both intra-batch and inter-batch variation to ensure a continuing state of control.

• A timeline for performing appropriate process performance qualification for each of your marketed drug products.

3. Your firm failed to establish and follow an adequate written testing program designed to assess the stability characteristics of drug products and to use results of stability testing to determine appropriate storage conditions and expiration dates (21 CFR 211.166(a)).

You did not have adequate stability data to demonstrate that the chemical properties of your OTC drug products remain acceptable throughout their labeled two-year expiry period. For example, you had failing assay results for your accelerated stability studies and have not completed long-term stability studies. You lack assurance that each of your drug products can maintain its stability through its expiration period.

In your response, you stated that prior to initial release of commercial OTC drug products, (b)(4) batch will be placed on accelerated stability and be required to have (b)(4) of acceptable data before a two-year expiry can be assigned.

Your response is inadequate because you did not include a stability protocol or test results to demonstrate that your drug products met specifications throughout the labeled expiration period.

In response to this letter, provide a comprehensive, independent assessment and CAPA plan to ensure the adequacy of your stability program. Your remediated program should include, but not be limited to:

• Stability indicating methods.

• Stability studies for each drug product in its marketed container-closure system before distribution is permitted.

• An ongoing program in which representative batches of each product are added each year to the program to determine if shelf-life claims remain valid.

• Detailed definition of the specific attributes to be tested at each station (timepoint).

• All procedures that describe these and other elements of your remediated stability program.

CGMP Consultant Recommended

Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant, qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34, to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements.

Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.

Unapproved New Drug and Misbranding Charges

“Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution”

“Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because it is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, this product is intended for use as a nasal moisturizer1 and nasal decongestant.

Examples of claims observed on the product labeling that establish the intended uses (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the product include, but may not be limited to, the following:

“Nasal decongestant . . . For dry irritated nasal passages . . . Moisturizer . . . Provides natural instant, soothing relief to dry, irritated nasal passages due to cold, allergies, dry air”

OTC drug products intended for use as nasal decongestant drug products, such as “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” are subject to the final rule for Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator, and Antiasthmatic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (cough/cold final rule). See 21 CFR Part 341. However, this product is not labeled or formulated in accordance with this final rule for the reasons explained below.

The product label for “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” does not distinguish active ingredients from inactive ingredients. Therefore, all of the product’s labeled ingredients (water, glycerin, Himalayan salt, and benzalkonium chloride) are deemed to be represented as active ingredients as defined in 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2). However, none of these labeled ingredients are permitted nasal decongestant active ingredients described in the cough/cold final rule. See 21 CFR 341.20.

Thus, as formulated and labeled, “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” does not comply with the final rule described above. Furthermore, we are not aware of sufficient evidence to show “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” as formulated and labeled, is generally recognized as safe and effective. Therefore, this product is a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). As a new drug, “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” is not the subject of an FDA-approved application, and therefore, the current marketing of this product violates section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d).

“CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer”

“CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because it is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, this product is intended for use as a nasal moisturizer.

Examples of claims observed on the product labeling for “CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” that provide evidence of the intended uses (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the product, and include, but may not be limited to, the following:

“Saline Nasal Moisturizer . . . provides natural instant, soothing relief to dry, irritated nasal passages due to colds, allergies”

The labeling for such drugs, like all OTC drugs, must comply with all of the applicable requirements of section 502 of the FD&C Act and all pertinent regulations found in title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR). However, your product does not meet these requirements for the reasons described below.

“CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” is not labeled in accordance with the “Drug Facts” labeling requirements described in 21 CFR 201.66. Specifically, the product label fails to include a Drug Facts panel. Therefore, this product is misbranded under section 502(c) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(c), because the information that is required to appear on the labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.

The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). Therefore, the marketing of “CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” violates this provision of the FD&C Act.

B&Q owner Kingfisher has revealed its yearly profit dropped by more than a third, flagging weaker demand for big purchases and rising costs following government budgets in the UK and France.

The DIY giant, which also owns Screwfix, said it was expecting around a £145 million hit this year from higher wages, taxes and inflation.

Shares in FTSE 100-listed Kingfisher plunged by more than 12% on Tuesday morning following the update.

The business made a statutory pre-tax profit of £307 million for the year to the end of January – 35% lower than the year before.

On an adjusted basis, which strips out what it views as one-off costs, pre-tax profits were down 7% to £528 million.

Sales edged 0.2% higher in the UK and Ireland, compared with the prior year, but were down 1.7% across the group led by a 6.2% decline in France.

So-called “big-ticket” items – referring to costlier things like kitchen and bathroom ranges, or larger home renovations – declined 4.4% year-on-year.

Kingfisher has consistently flagged that many consumers have delayed buying big-ticket items as they tightened their belts amid the higher cost of living.

Sales nonetheless picked up over the final three months of the financial year, which it attributed to new ranges and campaigns at B&Q.

Screwfix sales were stronger in the UK and Ireland, reflecting demand from its trade customers, although slowed towards the end of the year thanks to milder weather affecting demand for electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling products.

Meanwhile, Kingfisher said it was preparing to reduce costs to help offset the impact of higher wages, taxes and inflation.

The higher rate of national insurance in the UK, and equivalent tax in France, was set to add £45 million to the group’s expenses next year – with about £30 million of that coming from the UK.

London-based Kingfisher, which had about 57,600 staff around the world at the end of the financial year, has also forecast that higher wage costs will add about £90 million to bills over the year ahead.

As part of efforts to mitigate these costs, the group is planning to reduce the size of some of its warehouses around the world, including the UK.

It is aiming to cut space by around 12% by the 2027-28 financial year. It did not give details on how many jobs could be affected by these changes.

Furthermore, the firm wants to focus on growing its share of the wider DIY market, which it said will partly be achieved by converting Homebase stores into B&Qs.

Kingfisher bought eight Homebase shops in the UK and Ireland at the beginning of the year after its rival collapsed into administration.

Thierry Garnier, Kingfisher’s chief executive, said: “It is never great to see a competitor disappearing but for us it should deliver a small benefit.

“We need to keep some caution – there is some short-term uncertainty around employment and mortgage rates but overall we feel resilience and some reasons to feel a bit more optimism this year.”

Mr Garnier added: “Looking to the year ahead, the recent government budgets in the UK and France have raised costs for retailers and impacted consumer sentiment in the near term.”

He said this means the company was “focused on what is in our control” like managing costs and growing its share of the DIY market.

“Kingfisher is in its best operational shape for years, and we remain confident about the growth opportunities in our business,” he said.

The group said it was expecting to report an adjusted pre-tax profit of around £480 million to £540 million in the year ahead. Last year, it made £528 million.

As the debate rages on, this controversy brings to light the difficulties many face when trying to break into the tech industry.","A Reddit user recently dropped a bombshell that's causing quite a stir online. The user claimed that they received a confidential internal hiring memo from a recruiter. The document, which surfaced two days ago, is allegedly revealing details about a company's stringent candidate selection process and has sparked concerns over elitism and exclusion in tech hiring.

List of Blacklisted Companies In US Tech Company:

One of the most controversial elements of the memo involves the exclusion of candidates from certain companies. According to the leaked document, the company has a ""blacklist"" of companies like Intel, Cisco, HP, TCS, Tata, Mahindra, Infosys, Capgemini, Dell, Cognizant, and Wipro. The memo states that individuals who have worked at these firms are ""not the right fit"" for their hiring standard.

Restrictions For International Professionals:

The document also mentions nationality-based hiring restrictions, explicitly stating that no visa sponsorships will be offered. This means only U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and Canadians are eligible to apply, effectively shutting out a wide pool of talented international professionals.

Strict Selection Criteria Favoring Elite Universities:

According to the leaked memo, the company has very specific criteria for the ideal candidate. It states that candidates must hold a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science from only top-tier institutions like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Caltech, UIUC, and the University of Waterloo.

The memo goes further to mention that while exceptions could be made for graduates from other schools, only those who achieved a perfect 4.0 GPA would be considered. This immediately raised questions about the fairness and inclusivity of such strict standards.

Additionally, candidates are required to have between four and ten years of software development experience. The memo also specifies that expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks, such as TypeScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, and familiarity with AI/LLMs, is essential.

Viral Reaction and Industry Backlash

The Reddit user who leaked the memo expressed their frustration with the hiring policies, calling them ""pretentious and elitist."" Despite meeting most of the criteria listed in the document themselves, the user found the company's approach troubling, feeling it was exclusionary. The post quickly went viral, with many others sharing their own experiences of being overlooked due to similar hiring practices.

One user commented, ""I work for a big company and have been trying to move into tech for years, but they only hire from certain universities."" This comment struck a chord with many, further fueling the outrage.

Adding to the conversation, an ex-L7 Facebook engineer weighed in, suggesting that this type of selective hiring is not unusual in the tech industry. They explained that top-tier Computer Science schools continue to be the main pipeline for early-career tech jobs.

Is Hiring Memo Fake or Real?

While many users were outraged by the revelations, some remained skeptical about the authenticity of the memo. They accused the Reddit user of fabricating the guidelines. However, Michael Novati, a moderator of the subreddit ""codingbootcamp"" and a former Facebook employee, came to the Reddit user's defense, confirming that the original post had provided additional confidential evidence supporting the document's legitimacy.

Novati said, ""If I had to guess, I'd say it's more likely real than fake,"" although he acknowledged that absolute verification was impossible.

Biased Hiring Practices In Tech Industry?

As the debate rages on, this controversy brings to light the difficulties many face when trying to break into the tech industry. The backlash highlights concerns about biased hiring practices and the increasing exclusivity within the sector, which has long been criticized for favoring elite schools and companies.

While it is impossible to verify the exact details of the leaked memo, the conversation it has sparked is making it clear: the tech industry's hiring practices may need a serious reevaluation to become more inclusive, fair, and transparent for everyone.",https://images.goodreturns.in/img/2025/03/images1-1742891839.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 06:01:07.536609

SPINEWAY

Consolidated 2024 annual results

Annual revenue of €12 million (+14%)

Operating income close to breakeven

Reduction in net loss

The Board of Directors of Spineway, meeting on March 24, 2025 under the chairmanship of Stéphane Le Roux, approved the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The Spineway Group, a specialist in innovative implants for the treatment of severe spine disorders reported annual revenue of €12 million in FY 2024, representing organic growth of 14% (excluding changes in the scope of consolidation) compared with FY 2023. This acceleration benefited from the successful integration of the Distimp and Spine Innovations acquisitions, which have strengthened the Group’s premium ranges and boosted sales in this segment.

Improved results in 2024

The increase in revenue, also driven by the various presentations and surgeon training sessions on ESP2 prostheses, was accompanied by a significant improvement in FY 2024 results.

Good control of purchasing allowed the gross margin to be maintained at 69%. Similarly, the Group’s cost optimization plan, particularly with regard to personnel and operating expenses, paid off in full over the year, with these two items down 14% and 28% respectively compared with FY 2023. Over the period, Spineway continued its regulatory and clinical investments to obtain new export approvals and CE/MDR certifications.

The careful management of operating expenses, combined with the increase in revenue, was reflected in a €3.6 million reduction in the operating loss to €0.9 million in FY 2024, compared with a loss of €4.5 million in FY 2023.

Financial expense was penalized by the recognition of an exceptional financial expense of €1.5 million in the first half due to the compensation mechanism of the Negma financing agreement, and thus amounted to €2.5 million. Over the full year, the Group recorded an exceptional loss of €0.5 million, mainly linked to the reduction in headcount.

As a result, the net loss improved significantly to €3.9 million in FY 2024, compared with a loss of €6.5 million in FY 2023. Adjusted for the exceptional expense related to the Negma agreement, the Group’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was €2.4 million.

Strengthened cash position of €4.5 million as of December 31, 2024

Between the start of the convertible bond (OCA) issue and subscription agreement concluded with Negma3 and December 31, 2024, 4,341 bonds were converted into 1,690,241,419 shares. After the reverse stock split in February 20244 and the reduction of the par value of the shares in December 2024, Spineway’s share capital as of December 31, 2024 was €57,584.57, consisting of 28,792,276 shares with a par value of 0.002 euros each. To date, 90 OCA bonds remain available for subscription prior to the expiration of this agreement, scheduled for May 2025.

At the end of December 2024, Spineway’s cash position was €4.5 million, i.e. a net cash position of €2.7 million (after deduction of financial debt).

Acceleration of strategic investments to drive future growth

This strong financial performance confirms the relevance of Spineway’s strategic focus on premium ranges and the success of the synergies implemented with Distimp and Spine Innovation, which are enabling the company to strengthen its position in the market for medical devices for the spine.

Following delays, the in-house ESP prosthesis production line is now scheduled to come into service in H1 2025. Once operational, in-house production will enable the Group to be more agile and generate higher margins. In addition, Spineway plans to step up its marketing activities and increase its regulatory investments in order to expand its international presence and access new markets.

These regulatory (product approvals, certifications, etc.) and marketing (training, trade shows, etc.) investments are long-term growth drivers. By combining targeted expansion and controlled cost management, Spineway aims to maintain solid organic growth in order to regain sustainable profitability and a sound financial base in the medium term.

Our team's unparalleled reach and unique capabilities have protected the health of 1.4 billion people, conserved water equivalent to the drinking needs of nearly 800 million people, safeguarded a third of the world's processed food production, and supported more than a fifth of the world's power production. And we delivered our best year ever the right way, being named the most admired company in our industry and one of the world's most ethical companies for the 19th consecutive year.

Ecolab's performance was impressive and broad-based:

• Industrial accelerated its performance, generating strong new business wins

DELIVERING FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS

A s we reflect on another outstanding year for Ecolab, the Board of Directors would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the company's 48,000 associates. Under the capable leadership of Christophe and his executive team, Ecolab has consistently met high expectations, delivered positive impacts for our customers, and provided sustained returns for its shareholders.

By the end of the year, the company achieved record sales, adjusted earnings per share, operating income margins and free cash flow. This performance underpinned the Board's confidence as we approved a 14% increase in our quarterly cash dividend - the 33rd consecutive annual dividend increase.

We have made positive changes to the Board, adding new directors with a range of perspectives and expertise to support the company's growth ambitions.

In February 2024, we welcomed Judson Althoﬀ as an independent director and member of the Audit and Finance Committees. With Ecolab building a new global high-tech business and furthering our digital programs, Judson's global executive and technology experience at Microsoft has proven to be a valuable addition.

In February 2025, we welcomed Michel Doukeris, Chief Executive Oﬀicer of AB InBev, as an independent director. Michel's experience leading a major global company and his deep knowledge of complex operations, world-class branding of innovative products and winning in consumer industries will make him a tremendous asset to the Board.

We also look forward to welcoming another independent director in Marion Gross, currently Executive Vice President and Global Chief Supply Chain Oﬀicer at McDonalds. Marion has extensive international business expertise with specialist knowledge of global supply chains and the foodservice industry. Marion plans to retire from her current executive role prior to her election to the Ecolab Board.

Together, these directors will oﬀer a wealth of knowledge and insights that will help guide Ecolab's growth strategy.

In February 2025, Arthur Higgins informed the board that he would not stand for re-election at the annual meeting. Arthur has provided so much to our Board and to Ecolab, consistently oﬀering independent advice based on his knowledge of the healthcare and life sciences sectors. He has been a valued colleague, and we thank him for his many significant contributions to the company.

As Lead Independent Director, I work to serve the best interests of Ecolab's shareholders by ensuring that your independent directors provide critical oversight and are closely involved in the company's major strategic decisions.

On behalf of the Board, I have also worked to represent your interests by actively seeking and responding to feedback from our investors to align Ecolab's strategies with their interests and expectations.

Finally, the Board would like to thank you for your continued confidence in our company. We have the privilege of witnessing firsthand the many reasons why that confidence is well placed. Ecolab has a history of delivering innovation and high performance, even in uncertain times. The company has the right strategy, leadership and structure to build on its record year and deliver continued shareholder returns.

Artificial Intelligence: Driving water demand, delivering water solutions

The AI revolution is driving demand for data center capacity, and with it, the demand for natural resources. Water plays an essential role in data center cooling, transferring heat 23.5 times more eﬀectively than air. This growing sector has created an urgent need for sustainable solutions that disconnect AI's rapid growth from the strain it traditionally places on natural resources.

In 2024, Ecolab collaborated with Digital Realty, a leading global provider of data center co-location and interconnection solutions, to pilot AI-driven solutions that help minimize water use, maintain system performance and protect data center operations from water-related risks.

Our collaborative eﬀorts are helping Digital Realty evaluate water practices across its sites and implement digitally enabled monitoring and measurement tools to help track and manage progress.

Ecolab is proud to innovate AI-powered water solutions with Digital Realty, showcasing how next-generation technology can elevate water stewardship across industries.

It oﬀers high productivity, lower aggregation and reduced processing time, increasing manufacturing eﬀiciencies and a lower cost per gram of the commercial drug product. DurA Cycle™ resin is the latest addition to Ecolab's Purolite Resins toolbox, addressing the complex purification of modern biologic drugs.

HELPING LOTTE CHEMICAL CLEAR THE AIR TO ACHIEVE ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT GOALS

Insights

Annual Savings

Lotte Chemical, based in Seoul, South Korea, is one of the world's largest chemical companies. It manufactures synthetic resins and other chemical products used in materials such as polystyrene, a versatile plastic commonly used in food packaging, appliances, toys and other goods.

Actions

As part of its eﬀorts to create a better, more sustainable future, Lotte Chemical wanted to source more environmentally conscious chemistry solutions. They chose the dual-component PRISM™ antifoulant program developed by Nalco

Water, Ecolab's water and process management business.

Testing and a rigorous technical evaluation demonstrated that the Ecolab solution performed as well as hazardous alternatives, with a significant reduction in nitrogen oxides. As a result, Lotte Chemical implemented the antifoulant program to help protect critical assets and increase the eﬀiciency of its manufacturing process.

Outcomes

In addition to the environmental benefits that resulted from the switch to the Ecolab program, Lotte Chemical avoided a large capital expenditure that would have been required to meet the stronger emission standards being set for alternative chemistries by the Korean Ministry of Environment. Additionally, it enhanced operational eﬀiciency by substantially reducing the need for urea, a raw material used in the chemistry manufacturing process.

Ultimately, the new approach helped Lotte Chemical reduce costs, pursue a more sustainable solution, and enhance plant and operator safety.",https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,N,,2025-03-24 22:59:12.411732

And patience isn't a virtue that many investors possess.","Nike has warned that sales will drop by a double-digit percentage in its current quarter as the sneaker giant contends with new tariffs, sliding consumer confidence, and a slower-than-expected turnaround. In a conference call with analysts, finance chief Matt Friend said Nike expects its sales decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is set to end in May, to be at the “low end” of the “mid-teens range.” It also anticipates its gross margin will fall between 4 and 5 percentage points as it ramps up efforts to liquidate excess inventory and stale styles that are no longer resonating with consumers — a process it expects to continue into fiscal 2026.

Total Retail's Take: Economics headwinds, highlighted by import tariffs (nearly a quarter of Nike's manufacturers and suppliers are located in China) and declining consumer confidence, are taking a toll on Nike's turnaround efforts. The athletic brand's CEO, Elliott Hill, who left Nike in 2020 and returned last year, is focused on several core areas as he looks to turn around the business, including re-establishing relationships with wholesale partners (think Foot Locker, for example), reigniting innovation in its product lines, and wooing back athletes that have fled to new competitors.

U.S. manufacturing slowed this month and business expectations slumped to the second lowest level since October 2022 as companies, citing tariffs and other Trump administration policy shifts, grew increasingly worried that customer demand will falter in coming months, S&P Global said Monday.

The S&P Global flash manufacturing index fell from 52.7 last month to 49.8 in March, a three-month low, S&P Global said. A reading below 50 signals contraction. Another index showed that service industry growth hit a three-month high of 53.5 even as the sector’s expectations for the future slumped for a third consecutive month.

Business confidence has “darkened, souring further from the buoyant mood seen at the start of the year to one of the gloomiest readings seen over the past three years,” S&P Global Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson said in a statement. Executives most frequently cited tariffs and cuts in federal spending, he said.

Dive Insight:

With manufacturing cooling, the economy will likely slow to just 1.5% annualized growth during the first quarter from a 2.3% pace during Q4, S&P Global predicted.

Economists at several private- and public-sector organizations have marked down their 2025 growth forecasts in recent weeks.

Gross domestic product will probably expand 1.5% during the first half of the year, according to Bank of America economists, a markdown from their 2.5% growth forecast.

Business capital expenditure “is suffering from a lack of clarity on tariffs while aggressive tariff implementation, consumer weakness in January and Department of Government Efficiency cuts also detract” from first half 2025 GDP growth, Candace Browning, head of global research at Bank of America, said Friday in a note to clients.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday downgraded its forecast for economic growth in 2025 to 1.7% from 2.1% in December, with policymakers noting that “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased.”

The Atlanta Fed last week forecast that gross domestic product will likely shrink at a 1.8% annual rate during the first quarter. The regional bank on March 7 predicted a 1.6% contraction during Q1.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic on Monday echoed the view of policymakers that the outlook is unusually murky.

“What we've heard, and what I've heard, is that we don't really know where the economy is going to go,” Bostic said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “Business leaders don't know, families don't know and local policymakers don't know either.”

“People are taking on board information as it occurs,” he said, noting an increasing expectation that price pressures will rise in coming months. Bostic predicted that policymakers will not restore inflation to their 2% goal until early 2027.

“I think we're going to see inflation be very bumpy and not move dramatically and in a clear way to the 2% target,” he said.

Inflation in both goods and services prices accelerated in March to the fastest pace in 23 months, hitting a 31-month high in manufacturing and an 18-month high in services, S&P Global said.

“Higher costs were first and foremost attributed to tariffs, though increased staffing costs were also widely reported,” S&P Global said.

Policymakers may need to postpone reductions in borrowing costs beyond current forecasts, Bostic said. He predicted that the central bank will trim the federal funds rate just once this year.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/rY_PPbvJ11spyOy81Xv6E0v-f1HaHAfeEuGITQ62npw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ccm93c2VyUHJldmlld190bXAuanBn.webp,N,,2025-03-24 17:02:26.547754

The company licensed software from Empower Delivery, a company that helps operators obtain more control over their delivery options. Starbucks also hired the firm’s six engineers. Meredith Sandland, who served as Empower Delivery CEO for nearly three years, was announced earlier this year as Starbucks’ new chief coffeehouse design and development officer.

The Empower Delivery team will help the coffee giant achieve its four-minute wait time goal and modernize technology in stores.

“Empower Delivery software is, at its core, a timing and coordination engine that gets the right product to the right person at the right time,” Sandland said in a LinkedIn post. “Starbucks was among the very first restaurant brands to have an app. The app’s incredible success has also made Starbucks among the very first restaurant brands to feel the operational impacts of digital sales. The Empower Delivery team’s efforts will be focused on streamlining the Starbucks omnichannel operations, contributing to improving order to handoff speed in the café and drive-thru, while ensuring app customers get their orders on time.”

The brand’s “Back to Starbucks” plan was formulated by Brian Niccol, who became CEO in September. The strategy is focused on reintroducing Starbucks to the world, delivering the customer experience to win the morning and peak periods, reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse, and ensuring Starbucks is a competitive employer.

On January 27, Starbucks shops nationwide began serving beverages in ceramic mugs for guests who choose to sit inside and offering those same customers a free refill of hot and iced brewed coffee and tea. In addition to those amenities, the chain brought back the condiment bar and started writing messages on cups with Sharpie markers like it once did.

Consumers have responded positively. Over the past three weeks, the number of customers who choose ceramic mugs and glassware to sit and stay in cafes has increased by more than 3X on average in the U.S. The company also changed its code of conduct policy so that guests must place an order to stay in the dining room or use the bathroom.

Starbucks released an advertisement called “Stay Awhile” on March 17 that highlights the new benefit of free refills and dining inside.

Additionally, Starbucks will cut its menu by 30 percent, add 3,000 labor hours, pilot a more efficient staffing model, and bring structure to the mobile ordering process. The brand wants its employees to be happy while serving guests as well. The chain doubled paid parental leave for eligible U.S. workers and committed to promote from within for 90 percent of retail leadership roles in the next three years.

In the longer term, Starbucks is testing store redesigns—including more comfortable seating and spaces—to create a better environment for guests who want to sit, work, and meet. The brand is also considering more power outlets to encourage longer stays, dedicated areas for mobile pickup and new risers and pickup shelves for better distinction between in-store and mobile customers, abundant food displays to entice guests to try new items, and a redesigned espresso bar to add a sense of theater to the ordering experience.

The strategy has come with growing pains. In late February, Starbucks announced it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees and remove several hundred unfilled corporate positions to create more versatile and adaptable decision-making.

Starbucks’ U.S. quick-service share recovered in Q1 following two quarters of declines. And it did so despite reducing the frequency of discount-driven offers—there were 40 percent fewer such transactions in the period, year-over-year. Through the quarter, the brand saw a shift in sales mix toward coffee and espresso-based beverages, which over-delivered and compensated for lower-than-expected performance across holiday promotions.

Same-store sales declined 4 percent (8 percent drop in traffic and 4 percent rise in ticket) in the North America and U.S., yet improved over the course of three months, and non-Starbucks Rewards traffic grew, quarter-over-quarter. Members and spend lifted versus Q4 and year-over-year, and price parity for non-dairy milk customizations brought back lapsed Rewards users.",https://www.qsrmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/starbucksrestaurant.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 17:02:34.706487

Less than four years ago, Nike’s market valuation was more than $280 billion. Now, with its share price at a five-year low of $66.97, it dropped to $99.16 billion.

But analysts and Nike's CEO are urging investors to hold tight and be patient during the decline.

After Nike reported earnings Thursday afternoon, Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser encouraged investors to buy Nike’s dip, and reminded them that “the cleanup now underway was the result of consultant-like strategy by Nike's prior administration,” in a Friday letter.

Poser’s poke at consultants was a reference to Nike’s former CEO John Donahoe, who was only the second outsider to run the company.

Donahoe continued the aggressive direct-to-consumer strategy pushed by his predecessor CEO Mark Parker that slashed its retail partners.

In a report immediately following Nike’s March 20 earnings call, Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets reminded his investors that “turns take time.”

“Nike's working to return to what made it special: outspending competition with compelling storytelling, R&D and partnering with others for distribution (a playbook we've seen them execute before),” wrote Siegel.

“This is clearly not for everyone as turns take time but we expect troughing-then-improvement to kick in over the next several quarters, suggesting opportunity for those with duration.”

That patience is something Nike CEO Elliott Hill is banking on from investors and analysts alike.

On the earnings call, Hill said Nike will achieve growth through reducing orders for classic silhouettes it over-invested in the last several years, like Air Force 1s and Dunks, and move the discounts on its digital platforms to its outlet stores to ensure its digital business is no longer relying on discounted sales.

Digital revenue next quarter will likely take a hit as a result, Hill noted, but added that he hopes it will improve by the second quarter of next year.

""Success for Nike has never been about protecting our turf. We force others to play our game. We drive trends, grow markets and we lead,"" Hill told analysts. ""What we're asking of our teammates right now is to keep up the intensity, to move with focus and urgency, to have passion and take pride in all that we do to win as a team.""

BYD closes out record 2024 with over $100 billion in sales

BYD set all kinds of records in the fourth quarter and the full year in 2024. In a filing on Monday, BYD announced 2024 revenue reached 777.1 billion yuan, or about $107 billion.

Despite undercutting rivals in China’s ongoing EV price war and launching several lower-priced models, BYD’s revenue was up 29% compared to 2023. In comparison, Tesla reported 2024 revenue of $97.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year (YOY)

In the last three months of 2024, BYD’s revenue hit a record 274.85 billion yuan ($38 billion), up 53% from the year prior. Fourth quarter net income reached 15.02 billion yuan ($2.07 billion), up 52% YOY and another record.

BYD’s impressive performance was largely due to a record-breaking 1.5 million new energy vehicle (PHEV and EV) sales in Q4.

Although Tesla held its lead with 1.79 million EVs delivered in 2024 (compared to BYD’s 1.76 million EV sales), BYD slipped past Tesla with 1.778 million EVs produced.

Although BYD’s gross margins slipped from 21.9% in Q3 2024 to 17% in the fourth quarter, auto sales held a 22.3% gross profit margin for the entire year.

Even more growth on the way?

After dominating its home market, China’s largest EV maker is now aggressively expanding overseas to drive growth. BYD is now considering a third manufacturing plant in Europe. This time, it has its eyes on Germany, the heart of Europe’s auto industry and home to Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW.

According to S&P Global Mobility, BYD’s sales are poised to double in 2025 to around 186,000. Over the next four years, that number could reach 400,000 as the company introduces a full lineup.

And that’s just Europe. BYD is already a leading EV brand in overseas markets like Brazil, Mexico, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia.

With new smart tech rolling out and its recently revealed 1000V Super E fast charger, BYD could put up even bigger numbers over the next few years.

Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX, ETR:SRB) is encountering significant challenges as it navigates a complex turnaround, according to analysts at Jefferies.

In a note repeating their ‘Underperform’ rating on the coffee chain, the analysts cited Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol's tone during the March 12 Annual Shareholder Meeting, saying the CEO appeared cautious, reflecting ongoing difficulties in revitalizing the business.

The broker highlighted that foundational changes, including investments in staff and restructuring efforts, are proving costly and may take longer than expected to yield results.

“We believe the difficult reality in a turn of this magnitude is beginning to set in,” the analysts wrote.

The analysts also see coffee price sensitivity as a further potential headwind for Starbucks.

“Although near-term pressure noted as only $0.01 per share in US retail business, these pressures could build and sustain through fiscal 2025 and 2026,” they wrote.

“A sensitivity analysis suggests a 25% increase in coffee bean prices could result in 7% to 8% headwinds to earnings per share (EPS) in fiscal 2025 to 2026.”

Overly optimistic recovery timeline

While supply chain efficiencies and menu adjustments may help offset some costs, the company's Channel Development business remains vulnerable to these pressures, analysts added.

They awarded the stock a $76 price target, implying downside of approximately 22% at the time of writing.

Analysts expressed concern that despite recent share price declines, the stock’s valuation may still be pricing in an overly optimistic recovery timeline.

“While we acknowledge long-term investors own this stock predicated on two to three years or more of expected recovery, we think the road ahead will be bumpier than expected, upside is already overly-embedded in valuation, and further believe the long-term growth algorithm will likely come down closer to global asset-lite peers,” Jefferies wrote.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzAzXC9zaHV0dGVyc3RvY2stMTA3Mjg2Mzc0Ni5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,,2025-03-24 15:02:44.727431

In 2025, a record 15,000 stores are projected to close, doubling last year's number. Inflation and online shopping trends are hurting brick-and-mortar retailers, notably in pharmacies and fashion. Macy's is closing many stores due to financial struggles, while discount retailers thrive. The retail landscape is shifting, demanding adaptation from businesses.

The American high street is vanishing. In 2025, a staggering 15,000 stores are expected to close—nearly double the 7,325 that shut their doors last year, according to Coresight Research. That number eclipses even the record set during the COVID-19 pandemic. While retailers will open 5,800 new locations, it’s a weak counterbalance to the mass exodus of brick-and-mortar businesses.

Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig put it bluntly: “Inflation and a growing preference among consumers to shop online to find the cheapest deals took a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers in 2024. We continue to see a trend of consumers opting for the path of least resistance. Not only do they want the best prices, but they also have no patience for stores that are constantly disorganised, out of stock, and that deliver poor customer service.”

Pharmacy Deserts Are Emerging

Few sectors have been hit as hard as the pharmaceutical industry. CVS Health led the way in closures last year, shutting down 586 stores, with Rite Aid not far behind at 408. Walgreens Boots Alliance eliminated 259 locations. The result? Communities across the country are now facing “pharmacy deserts,” where residents have fewer options for essential prescriptions. Big-box stores with pharmacy departments—such as Walmart and grocery chains—are filling some of the gaps, but not everyone has easy access to them.

The Fall of Fashion Retailers

The apparel industry isn’t faring much better. Clothing, footwear, and accessory stores have accounted for nearly a third of all store closures this year. The bankruptcies of Rue21 and Express saw the shuttering of 543 and 105 stores, respectively. Foot Locker, already struggling, closed 118 locations in 2024 and has eight more planned for this year.

Yet not everyone sees this as a catastrophe. GlobalData’s Neil Saunders believes this is more of a shakeout than a collapse: “This is a healthy thing, and it does not follow that all of retail is in a bad way. At the end of this process, the vast majority of sales will still be made through physical stores. I see this as an adjustment rather than some kind of calamity.”

Live Events

Macy’s: A Legacy in Decline

Few closures have hit as hard as Macy’s. Its Brooklyn Downtown store, a fixture for 160 years, has closed for good. Once known as Abraham & Straus (A&S), the store was a beloved shopping destination before Macy’s acquired it in 1995. The Fulton Street location was famous for its innovative ""live mannequin modeling"" in the 1970s, where high school students posed in designer outfits in the shop windows, drawing crowds that sometimes brought traffic to a halt.

For longtime resident Vince Ross, the store’s closure is deeply personal: “I can't believe this place is going away,” he told BKReader, recalling its A&S days.

Tony Spring, Macy’s chairman and CEO, explained the decision: “Closing any store is never easy, but as part of our Bold New Chapter strategy, we are closing underproductive Macy’s stores to allow us to focus our resources and prioritise investments in our go-forward stores.”

Brooklyn isn’t alone. Macy’s is shutting 150 underperforming locations, slashing its total store count by a third to 350. That’s a far cry from the 1,100 stores it operated in 2008. The company still plans to open 15 new Bloomingdale’s stores and 30 Bluemercury locations, but the department store giant is undeniably shrinking.

To make matters worse, an internal accounting scandal rocked the company last year when an employee concealed $150 million in delivery expenses. The scandal cost Macy’s $79 million in its full-year outlook, adding yet another blow to its struggling finances.

Bargain Hunting in an Inflationary Era

While department stores flounder, discount retailers are thriving. Inflation-weary shoppers are prioritising affordability, and discount chains are benefiting. According to Forbes, online shopping has also surged, now accounting for 29% of retail sales (excluding motor vehicles, fuel, and food service). That’s up from 21% in 2019.

As the middle market crumbles, luxury brands and budget-friendly stores are widening their customer bases. Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, and Target are among the retailers expected to weather the storm.

The Next Five Years: More Closures to Come

Retail’s decline isn’t stopping anytime soon. UBS predicts the US will lose 45,000 stores by 2030, dropping from 958,000 to 913,000 locations. Sectors most at risk include clothing, electronics, books, music, and home furnishings.

Kohl’s has already announced it will close 27 underperforming stores by April. “We always take these decisions very seriously,” said former CEO Tom Kingsbury. “As we continue to build on our long-term growth strategy, it is important that we also take difficult but necessary actions to support the health and future of our business for our customers and our teams.”

Meanwhile, Dollar General is preparing to close nearly 100 locations, and Big Lots is shutting stores following its 2024 bankruptcy. One store in Somerset, Kentucky, recently marked its final day with clearance sales offering up to 95% off.

A Shifting Retail Landscape

Despite all the doom and gloom, retail isn’t disappearing—it’s evolving. Some brands will adapt, others will fade away. But the days of sprawling department stores dominating city centres may be coming to an end.

For consumers, that means fewer in-person shopping experiences, but more digital convenience. For retailers, it’s a stark reminder: evolve or die. The question now is, which businesses will survive this retail reckoning?

In 2025, a record 15,000 stores are projected to close, doubling last year's number. Inflation and online shopping trends are hurting brick-and-mortar retailers, notably in pharmacies and fashion. Macy's is closing many stores due to financial struggles, while discount retailers thrive. The retail landscape is shifting, demanding adaptation from businesses.

The American high street is vanishing. In 2025, a staggering 15,000 stores are expected to close—nearly double the 7,325 that shut their doors last year, according to Coresight Research. That number eclipses even the record set during the COVID-19 pandemic. While retailers will open 5,800 new locations, it’s a weak counterbalance to the mass exodus of brick-and-mortar businesses.

Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig put it bluntly: “Inflation and a growing preference among consumers to shop online to find the cheapest deals took a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers in 2024. We continue to see a trend of consumers opting for the path of least resistance. Not only do they want the best prices, but they also have no patience for stores that are constantly disorganised, out of stock, and that deliver poor customer service.”

Pharmacy Deserts Are Emerging

Few sectors have been hit as hard as the pharmaceutical industry. CVS Health led the way in closures last year, shutting down 586 stores, with Rite Aid not far behind at 408. Walgreens Boots Alliance eliminated 259 locations. The result? Communities across the country are now facing “pharmacy deserts,” where residents have fewer options for essential prescriptions. Big-box stores with pharmacy departments—such as Walmart and grocery chains—are filling some of the gaps, but not everyone has easy access to them.

The Fall of Fashion Retailers

The apparel industry isn’t faring much better. Clothing, footwear, and accessory stores have accounted for nearly a third of all store closures this year. The bankruptcies of Rue21 and Express saw the shuttering of 543 and 105 stores, respectively. Foot Locker, already struggling, closed 118 locations in 2024 and has eight more planned for this year.

Yet not everyone sees this as a catastrophe. GlobalData’s Neil Saunders believes this is more of a shakeout than a collapse: “This is a healthy thing, and it does not follow that all of retail is in a bad way. At the end of this process, the vast majority of sales will still be made through physical stores. I see this as an adjustment rather than some kind of calamity.”

Live Events

Macy’s: A Legacy in Decline

Few closures have hit as hard as Macy’s. Its Brooklyn Downtown store, a fixture for 160 years, has closed for good. Once known as Abraham & Straus (A&S), the store was a beloved shopping destination before Macy’s acquired it in 1995. The Fulton Street location was famous for its innovative ""live mannequin modeling"" in the 1970s, where high school students posed in designer outfits in the shop windows, drawing crowds that sometimes brought traffic to a halt.

For longtime resident Vince Ross, the store’s closure is deeply personal: “I can't believe this place is going away,” he told BKReader, recalling its A&S days.

Tony Spring, Macy’s chairman and CEO, explained the decision: “Closing any store is never easy, but as part of our Bold New Chapter strategy, we are closing underproductive Macy’s stores to allow us to focus our resources and prioritise investments in our go-forward stores.”

Brooklyn isn’t alone. Macy’s is shutting 150 underperforming locations, slashing its total store count by a third to 350. That’s a far cry from the 1,100 stores it operated in 2008. The company still plans to open 15 new Bloomingdale’s stores and 30 Bluemercury locations, but the department store giant is undeniably shrinking.

To make matters worse, an internal accounting scandal rocked the company last year when an employee concealed $150 million in delivery expenses. The scandal cost Macy’s $79 million in its full-year outlook, adding yet another blow to its struggling finances.

Bargain Hunting in an Inflationary Era

While department stores flounder, discount retailers are thriving. Inflation-weary shoppers are prioritising affordability, and discount chains are benefiting. According to Forbes, online shopping has also surged, now accounting for 29% of retail sales (excluding motor vehicles, fuel, and food service). That’s up from 21% in 2019.

As the middle market crumbles, luxury brands and budget-friendly stores are widening their customer bases. Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, and Target are among the retailers expected to weather the storm.

The Next Five Years: More Closures to Come

Retail’s decline isn’t stopping anytime soon. UBS predicts the US will lose 45,000 stores by 2030, dropping from 958,000 to 913,000 locations. Sectors most at risk include clothing, electronics, books, music, and home furnishings.

Kohl’s has already announced it will close 27 underperforming stores by April. “We always take these decisions very seriously,” said former CEO Tom Kingsbury. “As we continue to build on our long-term growth strategy, it is important that we also take difficult but necessary actions to support the health and future of our business for our customers and our teams.”

Meanwhile, Dollar General is preparing to close nearly 100 locations, and Big Lots is shutting stores following its 2024 bankruptcy. One store in Somerset, Kentucky, recently marked its final day with clearance sales offering up to 95% off.

A Shifting Retail Landscape

Despite all the doom and gloom, retail isn’t disappearing—it’s evolving. Some brands will adapt, others will fade away. But the days of sprawling department stores dominating city centres may be coming to an end.

For consumers, that means fewer in-person shopping experiences, but more digital convenience. For retailers, it’s a stark reminder: evolve or die. The question now is, which businesses will survive this retail reckoning?

""China is not only a major country in terms of population and economy but also an innovation hub. With such a huge economic base, China's economy continues to grow steadily. A growth rate of 5 percent means an annual increment equivalent to the economy of some European countries. This steady and sustained growth is impressive,"" he said.

""The best proof of our confidence in China's economy is our continuous investment. Danone is not only investing in research and innovation in China but also expanding our production bases. These investments serve not only the Chinese market but also the global market,"" he added.

When asked about Danone's investment layout in China by 2025, he revealed that Danone has an open research center in Shanghai, where they continuously conduct academic and clinical empirical research. In the future, Danone plans to further expand its research investment in China and establish a brand-new innovation center to serve not only the Chinese market, but also its broader global needs.

De Saint-Affrique also emphasized that China's innovative applications in fields such as artificial intelligence have brought many insights to Danone, and the company is driving the development of the entire industry based on its cutting-edge innovations in China.

In addition, the Danone CEO also stated that they will continue to expand production scale in China, making it an export base for Danone's high-end medical nutrition products.

""The Chinese government has taken a series of positive measures to boost consumption and stabilize foreign investment, which is undoubtedly good news for multinational companies like us. All policy initiatives to boost consumption and expand openness will help promote common prosperity and benefit global development,"" he mentioned.

J&J said the North Carolina plant will employ 5,000 people in construction and create 500 permanent positions.","Dive Brief:

Johnson & Johnson is planning a major U.S. expansion, announcing Friday it will spend $55 billion over the next four years on manufacturing, research and development and technology in its domestic market.

The investments will support three advanced manufacturing facilities and expansion of other sites in its pharmaceutical and medical technology businesses, J&J said. The company officially broke ground Friday on a new 500,000-square-foot biologics manufacturing facility in Wilson, North Carolina.

J&J’s announcement follows splashy releases from Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Amgen emphasizing their investment in U.S.-based manufacturing. The companies are hoping their effort will ease the burden of tariffs as well as persuade the Trump administration to extend tax cuts enacted in his first term and soften the blow of Medicare price cuts.

Dive Insight:

J&J said the U.S. expansion plan will represent a 25% increase in its investment compared to the past four years. In its annual reports, the company said it spent around $4 billion each year between 2021 and 2024 on “additions to property, plant and equipment,” a measure that largely captures the company's capital expenditures.

The Trump administration has pushed corporations to open more facilities in the U.S., emphasizing its “America first” policies that seek to discourage imports and increase manufacturing employment.

Big pharmas say their decision to reshore manufacturing has been enabled by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 — which, in addition to cutting the base corporate rate, also lowered taxes on profits that are earned by overseas subsidiaries and paid back to the U.S. parent.

Rising demand for their products, as well as the risk of tariffs from overseas production, is driving manufacturing expansions. Lilly has struggled to meet the appetite for its GLP-1 product tirzepatide, sold as Ozempic in diabetes and Zepbound in obesity. Sales of the drug tripled between 2023 and 2024. J&J also has fast-growing biologic medicines like Darazalex and Carvykti in cancer and Tremfya in psoriasis, underscoring the need to build production facilities close to their biggest-selling markets.

J&J said the North Carolina plant will employ 5,000 people in construction and create 500 permanent positions. The remaining manufacturing sites will be announced at a later date, as will expansions of R&D facilities and “increased technology investments to help make drug discovery and development faster, support workforce training and enhance our business operations.”

Before these expansions are accounted for, J&J claims its benefit to the U.S. economy exceeds $100 billion a year.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hz6IWgD-gbeF_h7yG-J5gJ73MfPYfD8RZ5qYsbdSwSk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xOTk1NjExNTUwXzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-03-24 17:02:22.881077

The report, based on data from more than 1,300 hospitals, provides a snapshot of hospital revenue, expenses, and margins at the start of the year.

Despite a continued rise in drug and supply costs, inpatient revenue grew at a faster rate than outpatient revenue, signaling a shift in hospital utilization patterns.

""The growth in volumes and inpatient revenue in January may be related in part to seasonal factors from the flu and other respiratory illnesses,"" Erik Swanson, managing director and group leader of data and analytics at Kaufman Hall, told HealthcareFinanceNews.

Cost growth slows, expenses remain high

One of the key findings of the report is that cost growth has slowed compared to previous years, offering some financial relief to hospitals. However, expenses, particularly in labor and pharmaceuticals, remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.

""Hospitals are seeing some relief from extreme cost spikes, but drug and supply chain expenses continue to be a major concern,"" Swanson said. ""Many organizations are joining group purchasing organizations, seeking generic substitutions, or exploring biosimilar drugs to control spending.""

Hospitals are also optimizing their workforce to reduce costs while maintaining quality care.

""Some health systems have developed in-house staffing agencies to meet changes in patient demand without relying on third-party agencies,"" Swanson said.

He added other organizations are focusing on workforce optimization techniques to better align staffing levels with patient demand.

Uncompensated care rises amid Medicaid disenrollments

A growing concern for hospitals is the increase in uncompensated care, which includes bad debt and charity care. The report noted the recent uptick may be linked to Medicaid disenrollments in 2023 and 2024.

""Recent increases in bad debt and charity care may be related in part to Medicaid disenrollments,"" Swanson said. ""Hospitals need to prepare for potential further increases depending on changes in Medicaid policy.""

Hospitals that manage all their departments close to financial performance benchmarks tend to fare better.

""High-performing hospitals tend to manage their departments efficiently, suggesting that focusing on departmental performance and simplifying administrative processes can help mitigate financial risks,"" Swanson explained.

Strategies to improve hospital margins

With hospitals still facing tight margins, shared services allocations are becoming an area of focus.

Managing these costs is challenging for hospitals of all sizes, with wide variations in how systems allocate expenses.

""The total spend for shared services functions is substantial and growing, and hospitals must take a proactive approach to cost control,"" Swanson said.

Hospitals are also working on improving clinical documentation to ensure accurate coding and reimbursement.

""Organizations are investing in clinical documentation improvement programs to make sure they are coding patients appropriately and getting reimbursed correctly,"" Swanson said.

As hospitals move forward, balancing cost containment with the need to expand services will be critical.

While inpatient revenue growth is encouraging, high labor costs, supply expenses, and rising uncompensated care remain key challenges.

""Hospitals must continue to refine their financial strategies,"" Swanson said. ""Managing labor efficiently, leveraging group purchasing, and optimizing shared services will be crucial in maintaining financial stability.""",https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Patientusingtablet.inbed_.JohnFedele_2.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 11:04:44.344167

Analyst Crossfire:

Classic Shoe Inventory Cleanup Timeline (Lorraine Hutchinson – BofA): The company emphasized that NIKE is rightsizing classic franchises (Air Force 1, Dunk, AJ1) rather than eliminating them. By the end of Q4, their contribution to the overall footwear mix will be reduced by 10 percentage points, with further reductions planned for FY26. The cleanup in NIKE Direct will be quicker, while wholesale will take the first half of FY26 (Elliott Hill – CEO, Matthew Friend – CFO).

Wholesale Channel & Order Book Trends, Innovation & Product Pipeline (Lorraine Hutchinson – BofA, Brooke Roach – GS): Wholesale partners are seeing growth in performance categories and new sportswear, almost offsetting declines in classic franchises. NIKE is making strategic investments in digital and wholesale channels, ensuring Air Force 1 inventory stabilizes first. NIKE is balancing long-term innovation through the LeBron James NIKE Sports Research Lab and short-term product refreshes. Recent successes include 24/7 apparel, Vomero 5, P-6000, Shox, and Air Max Muse. The Spring ’26 product review generated excitement among wholesale partners, signaling strong momentum (Matthew Friend – CFO, Elliott Hill – CEO).

Performance vs. Classics Inflection Point, Gross Margin & Inventory Liquidation Impact (Aneesha Sherman – Bernstein): NIKE expects performance categories to offset classic footwear declines by Spring ’26. The key factor will be how quickly the marketplace is cleaned up and repositioned for innovation. Company is resetting digital and physical channels to maximize sell-through and drive future order growth. NIKE anticipates Q4 to be the most impacted by Win Now actions, with revenue and margin headwinds moderating from FY26 onwards. While full-price sales in digital and wholesale will improve, inventory liquidation efforts will continue for several quarters but will be managed through familiar value channels (Elliott Hill – CEO, Matthew Friend – CFO).

Promotions & Inventory Management, SG&A & Demand Creation Strategy (Simeon Siegel – BMO): NIKE is transitioning both digital and physical retail channels to full-price presentations while using value stores for excess inventory clearance. Running products like Peg Premium and Vomero 18 exemplify the strategy of driving premium sell-through while clearing old stock. NIKE is tightly managing overhead while increasing demand creation investment. Recent spending on Super Bowl, NBA All-Star Weekend, and key product launches has been impactful.

Chicago, IL – March 24, 2025 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Nike NKE, FedEx FDX, Lululemon LULU and Paychex PAYX.

Making Sense of Early Q1 Earnings Reports

We are not fully in the Q1 reporting cycle yet, as that will get going when the big banks report their March-quarter results on April 11th. However, we have been seeing some of the early results in recent days, which are mixed at best. These results are from companies reporting for their fiscal quarters ending in February, which we and other data vendors count as part of the official March quarter tally.

Through Friday, March 21st, we have seen February-quarter results from 14 S&P 500 members, including bellwethers like Nike, FedEx and others. We have another five index members on deck to report results this week, including Lululemon, Paychex and others. By the time the big banks come out with their quarterly results about a month from now, we will have such Q1 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members.

The market has been unimpressed with the results we have seen in recent days. Nike investors initially bid the stock up following the better-than-expected quarterly results, but it eventually lost all of those earlier gains and then some as they realized that Nike still had a long and bumpy recovery ahead of it. The market’s initial optimism about the Nike release most likely reflected relief that the numbers weren’t as bad as many appeared to fear.

Nike’s top- and bottom-line beats were reflective of depressed expectations; FedEx didn’t have that advantage and came up short on both counts. What’s more, FedEx guided lower, reflecting the third straight quarter of a downgraded outlook. Both companies are dealing with multi-year company-specific issues that have yet to be fully sorted out, resulting in the stocks being big-time laggards. The challenging macroeconomic and policy backdrop adds to the headwinds.

One would think that Nike’s troubles will have read-through for Lululemon, as the athletic footwear and athleisure apparel categories depend on healthy consumer spending trends and are vulnerable to trade/tariff uncertainties. Lululemon shares haven’t performed much better than Nike shares over the past year, as the chart below of the one-year performance of Lululemon, Nike, and FedEx relative to the S&P 500 index shows. But that’s where the similarities end.

Lululemon shares really lost ground at the time of its year-earlier quarterly release on March 21st, which had ignited worries about the sustainability of the company’s growth momentum.

Lululemon had provided an upgraded outlook for this quarter back in January, which followed raised guidance at its preceding quarterly release on December 5th. A Closer Look at Earnings Expectations for Q1 and Full Year 2025

One would think that Nike’s troubles will have read-through for Lululemon, as the athletic footwear and athleisure apparel categories depend on healthy consumer spending trends and are vulnerable to trade/tariff uncertainties. Lululemon shares haven’t performed much better than Nike shares over the past year, as the chart below of the one-year performance of Lululemon, Nike, and FedEx relative to the S&P 500 index shows. But that’s where the similarities end.

Lululemon shares really lost ground at the time of its year-earlier quarterly release on March 21st, which had ignited worries about the sustainability of the company’s growth momentum.

Lululemon had provided an upgraded outlook for this quarter back in January, which followed raised guidance at its preceding quarterly release on December 5th. You can see the effect of the favorable January preannouncement in the revisions trend for the period, with the current $5.85 per share earnings estimate up from $5.80 two months ago and $5.65 three months back.

Same-store sales are expected to be up +5.16% for the quarter, up from the preceding period’s +4% increase (vs. estimates of +2.37% increase). In the aforementioned year-earlier quarterly release, following which the stock had gotten on a sustained downtrend, Lululemon had come out with comps of +12% vs. estimates of +11.63%, but they had guided towards a lower comp trajectory for the following quarters. The low- to mid-single-digit comp growth in the three quarterly releases after the March 2024 quarterly report followed many quarters of consistent double-digit comp growth, explaining the growth worries that have weighed on the stock.

LULU shares have lost ground this year, reflecting the all-around tariff worries and renewed macroeconomic headwinds, with the stock down -15.6% in the year-to-date period vs. the -4.2% decline for the S&P 500 index. While a stronger comp showing in this quarterly release will help the stock, the key catalyst will be guidance for the year. The expectation is that earnings and revenues for the coming fiscal year will increase by +6.8% and +7.5%, respectively.

Early Q1 Earnings Scorecard

As noted earlier, we have already seen February-quarter results from 14 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 14 index members are up +10.5% from the same period last year on +5.9% revenue gains, with 57.1% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 71.4% beating revenue estimates.

These early companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus estimates, with the EPS beats percentage for this group of companies the lowest in the preceding 20-quarter period. This is disconcerting, but we want to caution against reading too much into these early results, given the sample size.

Q1 Earnings Estimates Under Pressure

The expectation is that Q1 earnings will be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues, which would follow the +13.8% earnings growth on +5.4% revenue gains in the preceding period.

We have been experiencing a relatively elevated magnitude of negative revisions to estimates for the current period (2025 Q1) even before the more recent signs of weakness in data that drove the recent run of soft guidance from a number of companies.

As noted earlier, this is more negative revisions to Q1 estimates since the start of January compared to the comparable periods of the preceding few quarters. Not only is the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates more pronounced relative to the last few quarters, but it is also more widespread.

Since the start of the period in January, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Conglomerates, Autos, Basic Materials, Aerospace, Consumer Discretionary, and others.

The three sectors whose Q1 estimates have moved up since the quarter got underway are Medical, Utilities, and Construction.

The Tech sector, whose estimates have consistently been positive over the past year, is also suffering negative revisions to Q1 estimates. Optimism about the AI investment cycle suffered a psychological blow following China’s DeepSeek announcement. The resulting shift in market sentiment has weighed on the space ever since, causing the underperformance of AI-focused stocks this year.

The sector still remains a key growth driver in Q1 and beyond, with 2025 Q1 earnings for the Tech sector expected to be up +12.4% on +10.1% higher revenues. A lot will be riding on the evolving earnings expectations for the Tech sector, which has been a pillar of growth over the last two years.

The recent underwhelming guidance releases are coming at a time of growing anxiety about the macroeconomic backdrop, with many in the market starting to worry about the U.S. economy’s near-term growth momentum. Uncertainty about the Trump administration’s tariff policies is beginning to show up in business and consumer confidence measures. Some have started to worry if the ongoing public sector job cuts will eventually seep into the private sector as well.

While we acknowledge that near-term risks have increased for the economy, we remain sanguine in our outlook and see the ongoing market weakness as a buying opportunity. The U.S. economy defied skeptics during and after the extraordinary Fed tightening cycle and remains resilient enough to withstand the current bout of tariffs-centric uncertainty.

Importantly, for the first time in a long time, the U.S. economy enjoys the backstop of the Fed with more than enough ‘dry powder’ to jumpstart growth should investors’ worst fears come to fruition.

Depending on where the emerging tariff regime settles, earnings estimates will need to come down in response. But we all need to look past the daily noise around tariffs and remind ourselves that the overall corporate earnings picture has been steadily improving in recent quarters.

We believe that these favorable growth trends will remain in place in the current and coming quarters, with the sectors contributing to the growth momentum expanding beyond the Tech core of the last couple of years.

FedEx Corp. and Nike Inc., two giant companies with broad views into the global economy, served as the latest warning signs that tariff confusion, currency swings, inflation and other macroeconomic forces are making it harder to come to business decisions, plan for the future and communicate financial expectations with investors.

Nike signaled further revenue declines and said Trump’s tariffs on China and Mexico would contribute to a sharp decline in profitability. Nike imports 18% of its Nike-branded footwear from China, which Trump has levied an additional 20% tariffs on. The company also makes products in Mexico and other countries expecting more tariffs in April. FedEx cited higher-than-expected inflation and softening demand in lowering profit guidance for a third consecutive quarter.

Nike sank as much 9.3% on March 21, falling below $100 billion market value for the first time since the pandemic. FedEx’s drop hit nearly 12%. The S&P 500 Index was on its way to another down trading day, with the measure on pace for a fifth straight weekly decline.

It’s “a warning signal,” Citi analysts said of the FedEx report, highlighting “the depth of concern over the economic outlook.”

Weakening Demand

Some analysts covering Nike said the company was on the right track under new CEO Elliott Hill, but that the brewing trade war would make a comeback harder.

Two of the biggest U.S. airlines, American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc., last week slashed their forecasts, stoking worries of a bigger consumer pullback. Major retailers, including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., have also warned of weakening demand.

That’s coincided with economists increasing the chances of a U.S. recession as the U.S. barrels toward an April 2 promise by Trump to impose so-called reciprocal tariffs on countries that export more to the U.S. than they import from it.

Many companies were initially reticent earlier this earnings season to pin cloudy outlooks specifically on Trump’s tariffs, preferring to speak more obliquely about economic uncertainty. But the sentiment has shifted in recent weeks, with more executives specifically calling out the levies.

There were roughly 2,000 mentions of tariffs on earnings calls and other financial disclosures among companies in the S&P 500 in the most recent quarter, up from more than 600 in the previous quarter.

“The update extends the recent streak of cautious commentary that have become commonplace during the month of March,” wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Brian Ossenbeck about FedEx’s guidance cut. “Management had expected a stronger industrial economy in its original guidance, which has clearly not played out as anticipated and merits a weaker outlook.”

It’s not just U.S. companies.

Beneteau SA, a French maker of sailing yachts and powerboats that generates about 20% of its sales in the U.S., said it wouldn’t provide an annual profit forecast because of the uncertainty. chief executive officer Bruno Thivoyon referred to “trade risks” and “talks that may go one way one day and the other way the next day.” Shares in the company dropped 10% following the financial release.

Kevin McCarthy, a portfolio manager for the Neuberger Berman Connected Consumer ETF who holds Nike shares, said the tariff situation is “a moving target.” He said his team is sticking to “quality assets” they think will “weather the storm a little bit better.”

“The currency headwind we can quantify,” he added. But with tariffs, “it’s not something that you can really point to specifically what the impact is because I don’t think they know, and a lot of people that have a much higher pay grade than I have don’t know the answer to that question either.”",https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2023/02/01/FEDEX-PACKAGE-DELIVERY-BLOOMBERG.jpg?height=635&t=1675315138&width=1200,N,,2025-03-24 03:00:22.465609

I'm Marcus. Today we'll be discussing Walgreens. For the conversation, I'm joined by two people, both senior analysts, one of them covers digital health. Based in New Jersey, it's Rajiv Leventhal.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Hey, Marcus. How you doing? Good to be here.

Marcus Johnson:

Hello, sir. Good to see you. And the other covers retail for us, living in the Chicago area, it's Zak Stambor.

Zak Stambor:

Hey, guys.

Marcus Johnson:

Hello. Today's fact. So I did the most walkable cities recently, and Paul Verna started talking about bikes for some reason because he's a nightmare, but then I got curious. I was like, ""Well, what are the most bikeable cities in the world?"" So I found an article from WIRED and they have it in here.

So the research was done, let's see. So there's a lot of ingredients that go into ranking the most bikeable cities in the world. Share of trips taken by bike, reducing car speed limits to make it safer for bikes, car/bicycle bridges, better bike signage, protected cycling lanes, bike parking, et cetera, et cetera.

So it's not just how much do people get on their bike per day, or how many people do that, it's a bunch of things. Number one in the world, any guesses, gents?

Zak Stambor:

Amsterdam?

Marcus Johnson:

Number two, Amsterdam falls to second. I think in terms of the number of trips taken by bike, it might be first. It's hard to get clear data on the number of trips taken across different cities.

But in terms of all of the things that go into it, because two thirds of trips to work or school are by bike, are very bikeable. But in terms of all the other elements, infrastructure, et cetera, it's second. It's close to it though, geographically.

Zak Stambor:

Copenhagen?

Marcus Johnson:

Yes.

Zak Stambor:

Okay, there we go. Yeah.

Marcus Johnson:

Well-played.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Nice job.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. Copenhagen in Denmark, nine out of 10 people own a bike, and there are five times as many bikes as cars on the street, according to the Cycling Embassy of Denmark. Copenhagen, number one, Amsterdam, number two, Utrecht in the Netherlands, number three. Then it goes Antwerp, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Oslo, Paris, Vienna, and Helsinki round out the top 10.

And this is in the world, they just all happen to be in Europe. New York made the top 20 back in 2011, so it's been a while. God knows how, but never again. Yeah, not even close. I think Vancouver, Montreal, 18th in 2019, so that's the highest in terms of North America. Vancouver, right behind that. Well-played, Canada. Anyway, today's real topic, Walgreens identity crisis.

So Walgreens Boots Alliance says it has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm, Sycamore Partners, as the struggling retailer looks to turn itself around after years of losing money, notes the Associated Press. Its shares are down 45% in the last 12 months. Rajiv, you were noting that that makes it the worst performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024.

If you look at the last five years, the stock's down 76%, which might be surprised to learn, because Walgreens stores are everywhere so it seems like they're doing okay. Walgreens started back in 1901 when Charles R. Walgreen, Sr. purchases a Chicago drugstore, where he worked as a pharmacist to start the Walgreens chain.

A Reuters PASS.PA notes, ""Within 25 years, they had 100 stores, and the year after that, 1927, they went public. By 2015, they were valued at $100 billion."" That number now sits closer to just 10, down 90%, over 90% since its peak in 2015. Walgreens net loss in fiscal 2024, was nearly $9 billion. That's a loss of 180% year-on-year increase, so things are not going well.

We're going to figure out why. Rajiv, I'll start with you, blame pie. Make a pie chart of reasons, three max, why Walgreens went from pharmacy behemoth to distressed retailer, as Reuters puts it?

Rajiv Leventhal:

I'm assigning 60% blame to Walgreens failed investments in retail health.

30% blame goes to declining front-of-store sales. And then 10% on assigning to just the pharmacy-only business, so 60%, 30%, 10%.

Marcus Johnson:

Okay.

Rajiv Leventhal:

So I'll start with the 60%, because obviously the biggest one. I feel like the average consumer and maybe even the average listener of this podcast, might not be too familiar with all of the healthcare delivery and primary care type investments and acquisitions Walgreens has made over the last several years.

But it's contributed to its downfall, I think, more than any other single element. So shortly after COVID, Walgreens and other retail pharmacies too, but Walgreens got this impression that they could be a medical care service destination for patients. And I think a big part of that was because they were a go-to location for COVID-related medical services.

A lot of people got tests and vaccinated, COVID vaccines at Walgreens Pharmacy. So people started to become a little bit more comfortable with the idea of, ""Well, if I'm getting a COVID test and a COVID vaccine, maybe I'm good with going to a retail pharmacy location for other non-emergent type medical care.""

So what Walgreens did right after that, was invest about $6 billion into a primary care company called VillageMD. And its plan for VillageMD was to open a bunch of primary care clinics around the country, but co-locate a lot of them either in Walgreens stores or adjacent to Walgreens Pharmacy stores as well. It did not work out.

VillageMD badly struggled to attract patients and recruit doctors to work for them, and the investment just ended up being a disaster. Last year, just to give you some numbers. Last year, Walgreens, which was the majority owner of VillageMD but not the whole owner, they recorded a $6-plus billion loss related to the VillageMD investment.

Walgreens healthcare services segment lost, recorded a $14 billion loss last year, much of that related to VillageMD. And I think it's the biggest reason why Walgreens was forced to sell itself to a private equity firm. Because it invested so much money into the retail, healthcare, medical care concept, that it just could not execute on. So I'm giving that one 60%.

Marcus Johnson:

So is this a referendum on retail clinics? So could you quickly define a retail clinic for our listeners?

Rajiv Leventhal:

I think so, yeah. So since CVS, like many clinics and Walgreens has had similar type of initiatives, they've been around for years.

And the idea is to stick them in the back of a drugstore and just provide really low-acuity type care for patients.

Whether that's someone coming in for a cough or wanting to get a throat culture, something like that. Some of these locations hire nurse practitioners, some hire actually physicians.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. Our numbers are suggesting that retail clinic patients are going in the wrong direction, so they had doubled from 44 million to 84 million, 2017 to 2023.

Obviously, it was the pandemic in there, which Rajiv's been talking about giving people more of an incentive to go get the vaccinations and then, ""Oh, I'm here, I can do other things.""

But since then, they've been on a staircase downwards, falling to $73 million next year, we believe. That would be $10 million less than its peak.

Rajiv Leventhal:

And when you consider all the closures that are expected and will probably ramp up with the sale, I think those numbers are going to go down even more. Because you mentioned that the top markets that Walgreens still does have all these stores everywhere, but they're on track to close about 15% of them.

And I think after this sale goes through, assuming it does, Sycamore Partners, the private equity company, is probably going to close even more and probably accelerate the timeline. What do we know about PE firms?

They want to chop down what's unprofitable, and Walgreens CEO last year said that about 25% of its drugstores in the US are not turning a profit.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. Yeah, they've been closing stores for a while already. 1,000 stores they've closed in recent years. You mentioned that 14% of their stores they're planning to close still, that's about over 1,000.

I think 1,200 of their 8,500 US locations, so it's a lot of closures. When you look at the industry as a whole though, I saw a study from USC and UC Berkeley, they were saying about one-third of US retail pharmacies have closed since 2010.

Independent ones twice as likely to close as chains, but between 2019 and 2021, the number of drugstores declined in 41 of 50 states. So this has been an industry-wide thing that Walgreens obviously is a massive part of.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Definitely. I think that's a good segue into the rest of the blame pie.

Marcus Johnson:

Okay.

Rajiv Leventhal:

So I'm giving 30% to decline in front-of-store sales, and I'm sure Zak is more well-versed in this than I am. So what we do know is that people have started to turn to online channels for their everyday household items, for snacks, for greeting cards.

The things that companies like CVS and Walgreens were used to selling and successfully selling for so long. So people are cost-conscious consumers, they're going to find the best deal and they're going to online merchants like Amazon.

And those declining front-of-store sales, I think, and reduced foot traffic, I think, is certainly affecting all retail pharmacy chains, but Walgreens for sure.

Marcus Johnson:

So Zak, what's going on there? Because there's this age-old line about 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store.

Last year, nearly 80% of Americans lived within five miles of a Walgreens-owned pharmacy. You'd think that would be a good thing for sales.

Zak Stambor:

So Walgreens are very convenient, but at this moment in time when people are feeling super pressed and cost conscious, they're pulling back on discretionary spend.

So they're not going to Walgreens, because you don't go to Walgreens for a deal, you go because it's convenient. So they're just deciding to go online to Amazon or go to Walmart, or go someplace where you can get stuff for cheaper.

Marcus Johnson:

The other part of this as well is people complain about everything being locked up when you go to some of these pharmacies, and I found some research. I was thinking, ""Okay, how big of a deal is that statistically?""

I did some research from Joe Budano, CEO of anti-theft tech company, Indyme. Secured cases can cause sales to drop 15% to 25%, so a very big deal it would seem.

Zak Stambor:

Also, it makes it so it's not convenient. So Walgreens whole value proposition is that it's convenient, that everybody is so close to a Walgreens. I looked on a map and I have six Walgreens stores within three miles of my house, so they're very convenient.

But if the stuff is locked up and I have to wait for somebody to open up the case that I can buy body wash or deodorant or whatever it is, then it isn't convenient. I could just as easily pull out my phone and buy it online.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, yeah. They're looking for convenience and they're also looking for it not to be too expensive. It's obviously a very inflationary-driven climate at the moment.

And you mentioned people going online, people buying from big-box retailers instead. So yeah, the prices as well, I think, have been turning people off somewhat. So Rajiv, sorry, 10% left. What do we have?

Rajiv Leventhal:

Okay. So that's just the pharmacy business, and I'm separating pharmacy from retail pharmacy here, so retail is front-of-store. Pharmacy is just behind the pharmacy counter. 10% for the pharmacy behind the counter, separate from retail front of the store. So for years, pharmacy benefit managers, which are the middlemen in between drug manufacturers and pharmacies.

They negotiate the deals that pharmacies get for when they dispense medication to a patient, and pharmacies get paid when they do that. So they've been lowering the reimbursement rates to pharmacies such as Walgreens, but independent pharmacies even more, but bigger chains too including Walgreens. And that's made it difficult for Walgreens to turn a profit on certain medications.

Some, they've acknowledged this, they're too expensive to stock because they don't get reimbursed enough for dispensing it, so that's been a little bit of a headwind, for sure. But to me, not quite as much as what's going on in the front of the store, and what's going on with their healthcare delivery investments and acquisitions.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, yeah. So there they're getting paid less by pharmacy benefit managers payers every year to dispense the same amount, same prescription.

Zak Stambor:

Yeah. So I have a very similar pie, but I used much bigger buckets.

Marcus Johnson:

Okay.

Zak Stambor:

So 50% is just the business model itself. So the pharmacy benefit managers being a prime example of, I think the lower reimbursement rates is one of the reasons that Walgreens has looked for growth elsewhere via these acquisitions. So that's the big piece, and you've seen their gross margins just go straight down to the right.

COVID was a brief reprieve, but then once we went back to normal, it went straight back down, down and to the right. So the business model is just not working. And it goes back to what you were saying just a few moments ago, where the drugstore or pharmacy business model overall is really under pressure.

I think it's 3,000-plus pharmacies have closed since 2019, which is just a clear indication that the old ways of operating no longer work, so I think that's half. The other half are just store-related challenges, so one big piece of that is they're just overstored. Like I said, I have six stores within three miles of my house.

That's way too many. It just doesn't make any sense. Some of them you can explain, ""This is why this one's here and this is why this one's there."" But by and large, you just have way too many stores to operate.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. Some people might be thinking, ""Oh, well, how much does it matter, because people I'm sure buy a lot of this online anyway?"" Not so much the case.

M3 MI Kantar Media Healthcare Research data, where US adults purchased their prescription medications, this is from last year.

88% said in-store pharmacy, compared to 34% who said online pharmacy. So having a pharmacy nearby is important.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Yeah, it's interesting. You could select obviously multiple answers that don't equal 100, but the fact that 34% have tried an online pharmacy in the last year, whether that's Amazon, whether it's CVS online or Walgreens online, I think is pretty significant.

So that's a large number and I think a growing one in terms of the people who are at least familiar with, and are trying out an online pharmacy for their medications.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, this is a lot different. Please, please.

Zak Stambor:

Oh, I totally agree. I think especially for those medications that are recurring prescriptions, once you go online, you're almost never going to go back.

It's the one-offs where, yeah, you want to go somewhere close where you can just pick it up on your way home or whatnot.

But those recurring prescriptions are obviously shifting online, and I think that's only going to accelerate.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah.

Zak Stambor:

I agree. Just the one caveat is I think there is still a large cohort of people who like to talk to the pharmacist. They walk into the pharmacy, they have a question. And this doesn't, by the way, always have to apply to prescription medications, and we'll get into what the future could look like, but over-the-counter medications too.

You ever walk into a pharmacy and you have some symptoms, but you're not exactly sure what medications to take? You ask the pharmacist, ""Hey, what do you recommend? These are my symptoms."" So a little trickier to conduct some of those conversations through digital channels.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. I feel like more and more people are probably doing that, especially as they become disillusioned with the healthcare system overall, and trying to get an appointment with the primary care physician.

Yeah, I'm sure that's happening even more so now than it ever has done. Zak, you said there are a few in-store challenges?

Zak Stambor:

Oh, yeah. Yeah, so the other piece is just the customer experience. So one is locked up inventory, another is just staffing.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah.

Zak Stambor:

So if there's a long line to talk to the pharmacist, you're not going to be able to talk to the pharmacist, and so there's no value in going to the store.

So if it's a frustrating experience, people are just going to go elsewhere.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, so let's have a look at what's next. We talked about the overall industry struggling, and it's true, CVS Health shares down 43% last year, but they've spiked this year. They're up like 50%, so it's been quite the rebound for them.

But then Rite Aid, they obviously filed for Chapter 11 recently as well, so not a lot of folks in this space doing phenomenally well. What's next for Walgreens, Rajiv, in your opinion? Where do they go from here?

Rajiv Leventhal:

So I think Walgreens Pharmacy business, again, pharmacy only, not pharmacy plus retail, is going to be just fine. People always will need their medications. Now, they might not always need to go into a Walgreens store to fill them, but they will always need their medications.

The prescription drug market is a massive market in the US. CVS and Walgreens are one and two respectively in prescription drug sales. Walgreens generated over $100 billion in prescription drug sales last year. Okay, so there's a lot of money to be made. The model just has to change.

The retail plus pharmacy model as we know it, which relies heavily on customer traffic in the front of the store. That needs to be tweaked or modified, or overall pick the word you want.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah.

Rajiv Leventhal:

But I think that as consumers do turn to online channels, fewer need to go to Walgreens to get their household items and snacks. I think that we're going to see a changing store format, and we actually saw this just last week. CVS said that it's piloting a new concept where they're only going to sell medications, which is prescription medications behind the pharmacy and over-the-counter medications.

And they're not going to sell any snacks. They're not going to sell any of the front-of-store items, and so what this means is much smaller stores. It requires much less real estate to only have medications and health and wellness type products. So I think that could end up being an efficiency driver for retail pharmacies in the future. Walgreens has quietly been testing something similar over the last couple of years.

And they said last year that they're going to expand the number of these smaller format stores that are really designed around medications and healthcare products, instead of the front-of-store items. I just think that's a clear indicator that they know they can't compete in the world of convenience or retail convenience brick and mortar like they used to.

Marcus Johnson:

And these are much smaller stores. These are less than 5,000 square feet, so that's less than half the size of the typical CVS.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Right, right. And whether this model specifically takes off or it's a mix of this and something else, we'll see. Moving a lot of their services online, I think that's got to be a big part of it, improving the online experience for customers.

But I think this is an acknowledgement of what we've been saying a little bit, that medications are the steadier business compared with the front of the store.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. It's 80% of the company's sales last year from the pharmacy department, so that makes a lot of sense.

Small store formats, Zak, is that where Walgreens goes from here or somewhere else?

Zak Stambor:

Well, I think there's going to be a lot of experimentation, so I think that's one path. I could see them experimenting with beauty and those sorts of personal care stuff because that has been a pretty solid area.

I also just think what's ahead is probably this company does not look like this company. It's going to be broken up into pieces. A private equity company is going to do what a private equity company is going to do.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, yeah. There's some talk that they want to go private, obviously helps takes a lot of the pressure off from shareholders and they can focus on what they want to focus on without a bunch of other voices in the room. There are the three parts to it we've been talking about all episode.

You've got the US pharmacy chain, you've got the US healthcare services part. That's the specialty pharmacy business, Shields Health Solutions. And then VillageMD, their primary care provider that they bought then or invested in that Rajiv was talking about, and then home care company, CareCentrix.

And that's the second part of those pieces. And then the third part is their international UK-based health and beauty retailer, Boots, which is huge in the country, the biggest one by far. So they've got those three pieces that they could play with/break up.

Rajiv Leventhal:

I think they're going to hold on to the US pharmacy business. They've made some comments that indicate they've got to rightsize this business segment and figure out, as we've discussed, experiment with a couple of different concepts or formats or tests that some will work, some might not work.

But the retail pharmacy business, I'd be very surprised if they didn't hold onto that. Whereas VillageMD and the healthcare services side, that's a distressed asset that I think is just going to be sold off. As I mentioned, they're losing billions on that. So I think that's where the private equity company will come in and get rid of it.

Marcus Johnson:

But then the knock-on effect from that, Rajiv, which I was reading one of your articles about, patient care could get a lot worse. Jenny Guadamuz, assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health said, ""Our findings suggest that closures of pharmacies may widen health disparities in access to prescription and other essential pharmacy services.

""Such as vaccinations and pharmacists-prescribed regimens, including contraceptives, medications for HIV prevention and treatments for opioid use disorder."" This has to have a knock-on effect into if you got to get rid of a lot of pharmacies, some people have a lot in their area, others don't. So this could have a significant effect on the health of society, no?

Rajiv Leventhal:

Yeah, and that's why I think a big question is where are these closures occurring? But if you look at what CVS did with these, again, only a few for right now, but they're opening a few of these smaller format stores that are focused on medications. They specifically said they're going to focus on areas where there isn't as great pharmacy access.

And specifically in areas where they've done their research and they see that people are actually going to Walmart or online for everyday household items, front-of-store items, but there isn't as much of access to pharmacies. And that's where some of these smaller format, medication-focused stores could open up, and could hopefully prevent the issue that you bring up.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. You'd cited, you were saying there's some studies that have found patient care, patient safety suffers when private equity companies acquire hospitals, nursing homes, medical centers, et cetera, so it's not a good sign.

The deal from Sycamore Partners, the acquisition of Walgreens expected to close in Q4, if everything runs according to plan for them. That's all we've got time for this episode. Thank you so much to my guests for hanging out with me today. Thank you first to Rajiv.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Thanks, Marcus. I had a good time.

Marcus Johnson:

Yes, sir. Thank you to Zak.

Zak Stambor:

Yeah, thanks for having me.

Marcus Johnson:

Yes, indeed. And thank you to the whole editing crew, Victoria, John, Lance, and Danny Stewart runs the team, and Sophie does our social media.

Forbes reported that in 2019, online shopping represented 21% of retail, excluding motor vehicles and motor parts, gasoline stations and food service.
Additionally, apparel, footwear and accessories sector experiences have accounted for a third of the store closures this year.
In 2024, the bankruptcies of Rue21 and Express led to 543 and 105 store closures, respectively.","Things have become more dire for brick-and-mortar retail stores as it was announced that nearly double the number of stores is expected to close this year compared to last year. It was reported by Coresight Research that 15,000 stores are expected to close this year which is nearly double the 7,325 locations that closed in 2024.

It was also stated that the store closures broke the record set in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number is slightly offset by the projection that retailers will open 5,800, which is only slightly less than the 5,970 stores opened in 2024.

“Inflation and a growing preference among consumers to shop online to find the cheapest deals took a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers in 2024,"" Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig said in a statement. ""We continue to see a trend of consumers opting for the path of least resistance. Not only do they want the best prices, but they also have no patience for stores that are constantly disorganized, out of stock, and that deliver poor customer service.""

Forbes reported that inflation-weary customers are attempting to shift their priorities in order to stretch their dollar to the most. The outlet reported that discount stores have seen a rise in openings as the average American seeks to make the most of their money.

Other shoppers have turned to online shopping in order to take more advantage of deals. Forbes reported that in 2019, online shopping represented 21% of retail, excluding motor vehicles and motor parts, gasoline stations and food service.

In 2025, it was reported that the number has gone up to 29%, which is also up from last year's 28%. One area that has seen a substantial decline in physical establishments is the pharmaceutical sector. Last year, CVS Health with 586 closures accounted for the second-largest number of closings.

Rite Aid also reportedly shuttered 408 stores, and Walgreens Boots Alliance closed 259. The vast amount of closures has prompted Coresight Research to issue a warning of “pharmacy deserts” emerging in parts of the country to the benefit of mass merchants and grocery chains with pharmacy departments.

Additionally, apparel, footwear and accessories sector experiences have accounted for a third of the store closures this year. The number of closures is now down from the 1,383 stored that were forced to shutter their doors. In 2024, the bankruptcies of Rue21 and Express led to 543 and 105 store closures, respectively. Footlocker was also forced to shut down 118 stores last year, and it has announced eight more planned closures this year.

While many people have rumbled about a possible retail apocalypse. GlobalData’s Neil Saunders said it’s too soon to officially call it one. ""This is a healthy thing, and it does not follow that all of retail is in a bad way,"" Saunders stated. ""At the end of this process the vast majority of sales will still be made through physical stores.

This hecatomb continued in the spring of 2024 with the closure of the North Face store in Union Square, and will continue in the coming weeks with the closure of the store at 250 Post Street. To make matters worse, there are also rumours of the potential closure of Sak's store, which has already switched to an appointment-only model at its Union Square store and laid off some employees.

Among the reasons for these multiple closures, the proliferation of fentanyl since 2020 and the death of over 800 people in 2023 are thought to be partly responsible for the moribund business in this part of the city. Nordstrom's management cited “a dramatic change in the Downtown market,” as the reason for its closure.

Hard hit by the Covid crisis and the departure of employees from offices to their homes, the office vacancy in San Francisco climbed by 0.3% at the end of 2024 to reach 37.3 percent, setting a new record. According to real estate experts, this recent evolution is linked to the departure of Elon Musk's company, X, which preferred to relocate its headquarters to the Palo Alto and San José area.

As a direct consequence, tourism in San Francisco is not in good health. Whereas the city welcomed 26.21 million visitors in 2019, only 23.01 million were expected in 2024. Fewer visitors and, therefore, fewer consumers. A decline that could nevertheless be halted in 2025, with predictions betting on an upturn to 23.55 million visitors.

This situation is also affecting the hotel industry, which is experiencing one of the most serious crises in its history. In Downtown, the Hyatt Regency Hotel, a 17-storey, -room liner with a neo-futuristic decor, has been given up by owner Highgate at the end of 2024 to Mortgage Trust lender amid $290 million debt. Less dramatic but worrying, the Proper Hotel located at 1100 Market Street has defaulted on a $28 million loan and could be foreclosed or change ownership.

In the last three weeks, the share of U.S. customers who have chosen to remain in the cafes and enjoy their beverages in ceramic mugs and glasses has risen more than threefold, Axios reported Friday (March 21), citing figures shared by the company.

The uptick in what the company calls “sit and stay” visits come as Starbucks has been trying to reverse a drop in foot traffic and dwindling sales. By purchasing a beverage in a mug or glass, customers can get a free refill, which the Axios report says is encouraging some shoppers to hang around.

Tressie Lieberman, the company’s chief brand officer, told the news outlet that Starbucks is “leaning into our coffee culture.”

“We’re reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse and reintroducing Starbucks to the world,” Lieberman added.

She said the company is also investing in marketing with commercials on TV and streaming platforms to “evoke the feeling that ‘I want to go to Starbucks.’”

According to the report, Starbucks told Axios it also plans to bring back “more comfortable seating and spaces to ensure our stores are a place where customers want to sit, work, and meet” and “more separation between the cafe and mobile order experience.”

The report noted that Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol last week told shareholders he was “pleased at the early reaction to changes we’ve made from both customers and partners.”

The company is in the middle of a larger transformation, updating its branding to “Starbucks Coffee Company” and refocusing on its core identity via its “Back to Starbucks” program. That initiative also includes a recent rule change: People who hang out at Starbucks without buying anything will be asked to leave.

As PYMNTS reported in January, the Back to Starbucks is designed to improve the customer experience by prioritizing coffee quality and supporting baristas, while also simplifying the menu and positioning Starbucks as a community gathering space.

“Starbucks has runway … with analysts still seeing strength and opportunity in the brand,” Scott Stuart, CEO of the Turnaround Management Association, told PYMNTS at the time.

“While it’s too early to say on the timing of its turnaround, the challenges it faces are certainly concerning, but not yet alarming to a point of urgency.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starbucks-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 18:59:52.066822

Hewlett-Packard (HP) is doubling down on its India expansion strategy, with a strong focus on local manufacturing and AI-powered innovations. CEO Enrique Lores has emphasized India’s growing importance in HP’s global operations, citing the country as its second-largest talent hub worldwide.

India: A Key Market for HP’s Future Growth

According to Lores, India has already emerged as a major PC market for HP. Citing a report from International Data Corporation (IDC), he highlighted that HP continues to dominate as India’s largest PC manufacturer. The company has been actively investing in the region, particularly under the Make in India initiative.

Local Production Gains Momentum

HP’s local manufacturing efforts have taken a significant leap forward. In collaboration with Dixon Technologies, the company began manufacturing laptops and desktops in India. Now, the next big step is notebook manufacturing, set to launch in April 2025. By ramping up domestic production, HP aims to lower product costs, enhance competitiveness, and offer high-quality, affordable devices to Indian consumers.

Geopolitical Shifts Drive HP’s Strategy

The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China have prompted multinational companies to rethink their supply chains. HP is no exception. With US tariffs on Chinese imports affecting costs, HP is accelerating its India-first approach for manufacturing. Expanding production in India will not only reduce expenses but also grant HP greater access to India’s vast consumer market.

The Rise of AI-Powered PCs in India

HP is also at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) integration in personal computers. The company is developing AI-driven PCs designed to meet the needs of corporates and small businesses. The demand for AI-powered computing solutions is rapidly rising, and HP sees India as a key market for this next-generation technology.

Leveraging Indian Engineering Talent for AI Innovations

India is home to a large pool of software engineers, and HP is set to tap into this expertise. The company has already been working on localized AI models in countries like Spain and Saudi Arabia, and similar efforts are now planned for India. By collaborating with universities and research institutions, HP aims to build India-specific AI models to enhance productivity and user experience.

Summary

I previously rated HPQ as a sell due to high debt and potential reduction in shareholder yield; the stock has since dropped 19%.

I have now upgraded the stock to a hold due to Windows 10 discontinuation, which will result in more PC sales to the commercial sector.

HP still has an overhang of over $1 billion in current debt it must cover before the end of this fiscal year. A revenue boost could ease that pressure.

Both Amazon and Walmart offer influencer programs, which enable well-known internet personalities to curate shoppable digital storefronts.","Although it feels like doom and gloom in the retail industry right now, it's far from it in the right places.

If you know where to look, you can find plenty of deals.

Shoppers are increasingly picky about where they spend their dollars — and how many of them they're willing to part with.

They're far less loyal to any given store or brand. Instead, they largely want to find the best possible deals and put in the least amount of effort in procuring them.

So retailers like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) , both of which offer rock-bottom prices on a bounty of millions of items and offer fast shipping, are poised for more success in the short term.

Walmart and Amazon have winning models

Walmart and Amazon are both highly successful companies because they both have a long reach.

Walmart is the king of brick-and-mortar. With at least one location within 10 miles of 90% of the American population, Walmart is many shoppers' go-to store for everything from groceries to tech.

These many locations have also doubled as fulfillment centers, enabling Walmart to offer rapid delivery to online customers who expect service as fast as Amazon's.

And of course Amazon reigns supreme in the American e-commerce space. Amazon Prime is the gold standard of free and fast shipping, and the retailer continues to ramp up efforts to fulfill same-day deliveries on more items every quarter.

Best Buy takes on Walmart, Amazon

Now, Best Buy is trying to get in on those winning models.

Both Amazon and Walmart offer influencer programs, which enable well-known internet personalities to curate shoppable digital storefronts.

These storefronts can be promoted on social media, for instance, and influencers with large followings can bring big numbers to their storefronts and drive sales for retailers.

Now, Best Buy is offering a similar model.

“Influencers and creators will be able to build their own branded digital storefronts on Best Buy’s website, which we expect to drive increased traffic, engagement, and sales,” Chief Executive Corrie Barry said on the early-March earnings call.

They are famous personalities on the internet and social media whose large followings often convert into sales for platforms and retailers if they agree to partnerships or promotional advertising.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTcwNzYwNDI2OTgyNzQ1NzUx/the-entrance-of-a-best-buy-store-location-with-a-tree-in-front-lead.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 10:59:09.683065

McDonald's sees value as a key driver Kempczinski says McDonald's may have lost its way and ceded an important part of its brand identity to rivals.
""As we have said before, we view good value as including both entry-level items and meal bundles at affordable price points,"" he added.
""This means offering Every Day Affordable Price menus ... in our markets,"" he offered.
""We will pair EDAP platforms with strong meal bundles to provide our customers with entry-level meals at affordable price points,"" he added.","McDonald's' business is very resilient where the economy is concerned.

The chain has a high perceived value based on its relatively low costs compared with other food. McDonald's (MCD) also serves as comfort food.

In times of economic hardship, that makes it an affordable luxury. You might not be able to afford a steakhouse or even a sit-down meal, but most people can scrape together enough money for a Big Mac or a Value Meal.

The chain also did well during the Covid pandemic because it had invested in the technology needed to pivot from an eat-in model to delivery and takeout. McDonald's did not build out that capacity because it expected the pandemic, but its investments served it well.

The fast-food giant's resilience, however, does not mean it's immune to struggles. Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski addressed this matter during McDonald's' third-quarter-earnings call.

""Let's turn now to the update on our performance in Q3. On our last call, we shared that the [quick-service restaurant] sector had meaningfully slowed in many of our markets, with industry traffic declines in several major markets and that consumers, especially those in the low-income category, were choosing to eat at home more often,"" he said. ""This trend continued in the third quarter.""

McDonald's worried about consumer behavior

Kempczinski is not happy with his chain's performance.

""QSR traffic has remained pressured, reflecting industrywide challenges. And while we anticipated a challenging environment in 2024, our performance so far this year has fallen short of our expectations,"" he said.

The CEO made clear that he was unwilling to use market conditions as an excuse for underperformance.

""While the QSR industry has slowed, we recognize that there are still many factors within our control to impact performance, guided by our Accelerating the Arches strategy,"" he added.

""We're encouraged by signs of progress in the third quarter and the more consistent market-share traction we are seeing, especially in the U.S., which included strong, compelling value platforms, which is fundamental to the McDonald's brand promise; menu innovation, which excited our customers with great-tasting food; and strong marketing prowess that drove engagement on higher-margin core items,"" he said.

McDonald's sees value as a key driver

Kempczinski says McDonald's may have lost its way and ceded an important part of its brand identity to rivals.

""We have spoken before about our customers recognizing us as the value leader versus our key competitors, but our value leadership gap has shrunk,"" he said.

""In response, we have moved with urgency in partnership with our franchisees to improve our value offerings in most of our major markets.""

McDonald's has been increasing value offerings worldwide, he said.

""Some examples that launched in the quarter are the 4-euro ($4.38) Happy Meals in France, three for 3 pounds ($3.90) in the U.K.; and in Canada, we're providing value to our customers through price-pointed coffee, starting at just $1 (US$0.70),"" he said.

Kempczinski sees value not as a gimmick but rather part of a broad strategy.

""[To] provide our customers with simple, everyday affordability they can count on, we're employing strategies that are designed to work together to generate sustainable guest-count-led growth and increased market share,"" he said.

""As we have said before, we view good value as including both entry-level items and meal bundles at affordable price points,"" he added.

McDonald's has a name for this strategy.

""This means offering Every Day Affordable Price menus ... in our markets,"" he offered. ""At McDonald's we define EDAP as a platform with an assortment of items all priced at compelling entry-level price points, generally including breakfast, beef, and chicken sandwich options.""

The chain has committed to delivering strong value.

""We will pair EDAP platforms with strong meal bundles to provide our customers with entry-level meals at affordable price points,"" he added.

""Blending EDAP and meal bundles under a branded value platform allows us to invest in and build recognition and affinity with our customers. So when they're thinking about an affordable option for food, we're top of mind.""",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgxOTE0MDY0ODY2MjU2MDAz/mcdonalds_2.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 09:57:59.806175

The retail chain has strengthened its collaboration with Nozzleman Pizza, adding 17 new locations within its stores. This expansion covers six states, including Arizona and Nevada, with plans for growth nationwide.

The alliance not only expands Walmart's food offerings but also aims to attract more customers. Costco has been successful with its popular food area, offering pizzas and hot dogs at low prices. Walmart now wants to replicate that strategy but with a different focus: quality, brand identity, and a stronger social commitment.

Walmart: A Strategy to Differentiate

Nozzleman Pizza is not just another pizzeria. The brand was founded by Jesse Corletto, a former firefighter, and maintains a strong connection with the first responder community. Part of its profits are donated to local fire stations, reinforcing its image of social responsibility.

Additionally, the chain has influential investors like Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi, a former television star, and the foundation of actor Jeremy Renner. This media backing can help Walmart differentiate itself from Costco and other competitors.

The goal is clear: to improve the shopping experience. Integrating food into its stores not only prolongs customers' stay but also encourages spending. Walmart wants its consumers to see its stores as a place where they can shop and, at the same time, enjoy a quality meal.

Advantage Over Its Competition

Costco has managed to build customer loyalty with its affordable food. Its $1.50 pizza and hot dog are almost a company icon. However, there is a barrier: a membership is required to access these benefits.

Walmart wants to break this limitation. Its strategy allows any customer to enjoy a good pizza without paying for a membership. Additionally, Nozzleman Pizza offers a product with its own identity, far from the generic fast food found in other supermarkets.

Walmart, Expansion, and Future

There are no exact dates for the new openings yet, but Walmart has made it clear that it plans to take this idea nationwide. If the project is successful, we may see more partnerships with food brands in the future.

Retail is changing. Supermarkets are no longer just places to buy products but spaces where customers seek convenience and experiences. Walmart is betting on gastronomy as a new way to attract consumers and surpass the competition.

If Nozzleman Pizza manages to win over Walmart's customers, Costco might be forced to improve its food offerings. The battle for the best food in retail is just beginning.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-tienda-exterior-walmart-chico-dinero-feliz_1200_800.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 22:00:22.815748

The maker of Cheerios and Pillsbury saw its shares drop about three percent in early trading following the announcement.

The company joins other packaged food giants—including Conagra Brands, Campbell's, and Kraft Heinz—in warning of a challenging retail environment. Price-conscious shoppers are increasingly opting for store-brand snacks while also cutting back on dining out.

Analysts reacted to the forecast revision with concern. Emarketer analyst Blake Droesch said General Mills is facing an ""uphill battle,"" as economic uncertainty and potential tariffs continue to weigh on consumer spending.

""Even if tariffs don't materialize and consumer confidence improves, those who have turned to private label or other lower-cost alternatives are not certain to return to national brands,"" Droesch added.

General Mills now expects full-year organic sales to decline by 1.5 percent to two percent, a downgrade from its previous projection of flat to 1 percent growth.

The company also stated that its revised outlook does not account for any impact from the Trump administration's latest tariff actions, as their implementation timeline and scope remain unclear.

Adjusted full-year profit is now forecast to decline by seven percent to eight percent, compared to the earlier expectation of a one percent to three percent drop.

To counteract slowing sales, the Minnesota-based company said it is planning cost-cutting measures to save at least US$100 million in fiscal 2026.

For the quarter ended February 23, General Mills reported net sales of $4.84 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations of $4.96 billion, according to LSEG data.

The company attributed the weaker results to retailers' ""unexpected"" inventory reductions in its retail and pet food segment.

NIKE, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.54, expectations were $0.3007.

Operator: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE, Inc. Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Conference Call. For those who want to reference today’s press release, you’ll find it at investors.NIKE.com. Leading today’s call is Paul Trussell, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell.

Paul Trussell: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE Inc’s Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Results. Joining us on today’s call will be NIKE Inc. President and CEO, Elliott Hill; and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE’s reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE’s earnings press release or NIKE’s website, investors.NIKE.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations.

All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral, unless otherwise noted. We will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I’ll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. President and CEO, Elliott Hill.

Elliott Hill: Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start by saying I’m proud of the progress we made against the key actions we committed to 90 days ago. While we met the expectations we set, we’re not satisfied with our overall results. We can and will be better. For the quarter, the big takeaway for me was clear. When we lead with sport, we create impact for NIKE. We told inspiring athletes stories, we brought more energy to sports biggest moments, and we introduced performance product across an integrated marketplace. We delivered something new to the consumer week after week and that’s exactly the kind of sustained pace we need to strengthen our business. Last quarter, I shared my initial observations and where we need to focus.

The last 90 days only reinforced my early assessment of the areas that are most important. Since our last call, I continued to meet with wholesale partners to discuss the distinct role each can play with NIKE. I also had an incredibly inspiring trip to visit factory partners and NIKE teammates in Asia to see how we’re executing in our supply chain with a focus on production for our new innovation. Most importantly, I continue to spend meaningful time with our NIKE teammates. We focused in two areas: strengthening our culture; and committing to our top priorities. In fact, right after my first call with you in December, we met with our teams and shared the five priority actions we outlined on the call, with a sharp focus on five fields of play, three countries, and five cities.

We call these strategic priorities Win Now. We have a clearer picture on our path forward, and despite the global economic uncertainty, I believe our priority actions will continue to drive progress. The first action is to ignite our winning culture. As I mentioned, our teams are building momentum. We’re hustling and being opportunistic. The next action is shaping our brand for distinction. This is about lining up storytelling power of NIKE to celebrate the passion and emotion of sport. In February, I attended the Super Bowl and the NBA All-Star weekend to see firsthand the kind of impact we make when we line up all of our advantages towards one moment. Our third action is to accelerate a complete product portfolio. We’re fully committed to creating a more breadth and depth season after season.

While we added innovation across our five key fields of play this quarter, it’s not enough to offset the continued headwinds of our classic franchises. Elevate and grow the marketplace, the fourth action is a balanced approach where we’re supporting wholesale partners to drive healthy growth and returning NIKE Direct to a premium destination. We’re in the early stages of repositioning NIKE Digital and we’re restoring our sales organization and go-to-market processes. The final action, Win on the Ground, is where we celebrate local athletes, make cultural connections, and support grassroots communities. A big reason for our running product success this quarter was the resources we put into building energy through the ground game. Of all the priority actions, we knew we could move quickest on investing in our brand.

You saw that in several defining moments this quarter. I’ll start with the Super Bowl in New Orleans. It was a course. It starts with our close partnership with the NFL and our high performance uniforms, cleats, and gloves that everyone sees on the field. Our product visibility goes well beyond four quarters. From Jalen Hurts wearing his red and black unbannable Jordan cleats during warm-ups, to Kendrick’s halftime show wearing Deion Sanders’ Retros, and Serena Williams and SZA wearing Chuck Taylors. Our three iconic brands were front and center. We, of course, also debuted So Win, our first Super Bowl ad in 27 years where we celebrated the winning mindset of the top athletes in the world. We also showed up on the ground in New Orleans to support flag football with a sharp focus on girls and a commitment to increasing their participation in the game.

We created pop-up retail spaces across the city with partners like Dix, Sneaker Politics, and Hibbett, and built NIKE and Jordan houses to connect with athletes, influencers, partners, and wholesale retailers. After the win, we followed up with strong, reactive campaigns. The NIKE brand created it’s Good to Be Green for the Eagles win, and for Jaylen’s MVP, the Jordan brand aired its first Super Bowl ad in history, Love Hurts. That is how we create impact and that is NIKE being NIKE. We transitioned from one amazing weekend right into another for the NBA All-Star weekend in the Bay area. Our brands, in one word, dominated. On both sides of the Bay, NIKE, Jordan, and Converse owned performance and the culture of the game, connecting with young athletes and fans through unique experiences.

NIKE celebrated the future of basketball, hosting games with top high school prep stars. At the Alameda Navy Yard, the Jordan Fam Fest celebrated the brand’s biggest moments for its 40th anniversary with thousands of fans. And Converse unveiled the first signature shoe for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Shai 1, designed by Shai himself as the new creative director for Converse basketball. His shoe will launch this fall. All told, NIKE Inc. lit up the marketplace on the ground. Our NIKE San Francisco flagship store had its best commercial day in 10 years. And just down the street, we created energy and buzz with our wholesale partners, Foot Locker and Shoe Palace. One thing it was great to see, for the right product drops, like the NIKE Black Label collection, the Kobe Protro’s, Jordan Red Wands, and Jordan [Forest Cements] (ph), the passion of sneaker culture is alive.

I saw lines down the block all weekend. An important part of our strategy moving forward will be to harness the full power of our portfolio of brands. We made significant progress in elevating the voices and distinct position of our brands at the Super Bowl and All-Star weekend. Shifting to products, we’re beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio. It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over-indexed on. But our approach is simple. Help consumers fall in love with something new from NIKE, and that something is not replacing one icon for another. It’s about building a supporting cast of multiple styles, some that are gaining interaction with men and others with women’s. Segmenting and differentiating our wholesale partners across the integrated marketplace, investing in the presentation of our products at point of sale, digital and physical, and having an intentional ground game in influential cities.

And we will lead with performance, with a disciplined approach that balances product that’s seeding with product that’s scaling. Running with the standout field of play for the quarter, growing mid-single digits, the PEG-41 is continuing to drive healthy volume in all geos. And two innovations that have just begun to seed are the Pegasus Premium and the Vomero 18. The Peg Premium is NIKE bringing something totally unique to the market, a full, visible air zoom unit that, for the first time, we sculpted to the foot so it springs back for better energy return. It’s a great ride and a beautiful looking shoe. Early seed pairs nearly sold out across the North America marketplace, and the Peg Premium will scale through fall 2025. This quarter, we launched the Vomero 18, created for the everyday runner.

We aligned the storytelling of the Vomero 18’s big foam and maximum cushioning across over 1,800 doors in the integrated marketplace, RSG, sporting goods, NIKE Direct, the results have been outstanding. We plan to build on the momentum and double the distribution of a Vomero 18 by mid-April, supported by a large-scale running campaign. You can expect new additions to the franchise to release in our next fiscal year. In running, we’re on the path to meeting our high standards of execution end-to-end. Turning to sportswear, our life’s largest icons, NIKE and Jordan Streetwear, are in different states of transition. With Air Force 1, Donk, and Air Jordan 1, it’s about right sizing, not sun setting. Each franchise will always have a place in our stable of products.

They’re timeless staples with loyal fans. Our best example of healthy diversification in sportswear, footwear right now is our look of running. The Vomero 5 doubled its revenue this quarter. NIKE Shox has grown its revenue by over 10 times in the last three quarters. And while in the seeding stage, recently released shoes like the Air Superfly and the LD1000 are getting a lot of positive interest in the media and on social channels. Air Max, a brand in itself, is a platform that consumers expect us to reinvent. This quarter we brought fresh energy with the new DNA, which is resonating well with consumers in Japan and Korea, and women’s silhouette in the Air Max Muse. Look for another new innovation platform with Air Max in FY 2026. Diversifying our sportswear apparel offense is equally important.

We want to minimize our reliance on fleece and push the edges to build new businesses. And that doesn’t have to fit neatly into the sportswear category either. This quarter’s new 24/7 collection brings performance materials to high-style training apparel. The new impossibly soft and perfect stretch fabrics gave us the opportunity to tell a deep technical apparel story. The first month of sales in 24/7 had exceeded our expectations and were ramping up capacity to meet the demand. We also made some noise with the announcement of a new brand this quarter, NIKESKIMS. Together we identified a consumer need and are creating a new market of style-led product that sculpts and performs. Our first comprehensive collection launches next quarter in North America through both NIKE and SKIMS Direct channels and we will scale globally over multiple seasons.

The apparel space is right for fresh thinking, and I’ve asked our team to keep innovating across the spectrum of performance and style, and to seek out white space in the market to complement our brands and product portfolio. Our responsibility is to grow the overall market, and one of the most powerful ways we do that is through a relentless flow of coveted and innovative product through our powerful brands in both performance and sportswear for men, women, and kids across footwear, apparel, and accessories, and up and down price points. We’re moving with focus and urgency to get back into a rhythm of delivering across all dimensions. The final topic I’d like to discuss in detail is the integrated marketplace, where we create consumer-led experiences across NIKE Direct or our wholesale partners, physical or digital.

In the almost 190 countries in which we do business, we have over 40,000 points of distribution and a digital business with massive reach. Our footprint is an unbeatable competitive advantage. That means that a lot of change is in motion, because we want to be great at all touch points. And I’m playing an active role in this one, leveraging my years of experience and relationships in the marketplace. Here’s what we’re going to prioritize. First, I mentioned, we’re restoring our sales organization and go-to-market processes. Partnering with NIKE must feel like a world-class experience. That means, building growth plans together, creating distinct consumer positions and consumer-right assortments, engaging way earlier in the process and asking for product feedback, delivering our assortments at the right time, right place, and at the right depth.

Educating their teams on new innovations, providing marketing support, and making certain their NIKE presentation is premium so we capitalize on every sale opportunity. In NIKE Direct, Digital will feel the changes more quickly. We’re already reducing the promotional days and discounting at lower rates. In fact, comparing last year’s January and February to this year’s, NIKE Digital in North America went from over 30 promotional days to zero. In our ecosystem, the consumers are already seeing a more elevated content and storytelling with a greater focus on our performance fields of play. Now that I’ve had the opportunity to visit each geography, we’re clear where we will focus to make an immediate impact. Through our Win Now strategic priorities, we’ll start with three key countries, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom, and five key cities, New York, Los Angeles, London, Beijing, and Shanghai.

We’ll invest to make sure each has innovative and coveted products, a loud and proud locally relevant brand voice, a consumer-led and balanced integrated marketplace, and passionate NIKE teammates on the ground. Each country has unique dynamics and is in a different state of development. China specifically is where we’re being the most proactive and cleaning up the marketplace. And we’ll get back to inspiring the Chinese consumer in a more meaningful way. To close, our consumers and partners felt a different pace from NIKE this quarter. We’re off to a solid start. And where we are making progress in our five priority actions, it’s mostly through serving athletes, through the lens of sport and performance. That’s exactly where we want to be.

The bottom line is we are looking for opportunity on all fronts. Now, it’s up to us to be consistent. Some of the bigger shifts I have covered will take multiple seasons of excellent execution. Our teams are moving with focus and urgency and are up to the challenge of writing the next great chapter for NIKE. I’ll pass it to Matt to provide initial thoughts on the building blocks to return to sustainable and profitable growth, and I’ll be back to close out the call.

Matt Friend: Thanks, Elliott, and hello to everyone on the call. The team is moving aggressively to reignite brand momentum through sport and stabilize our business. Our third quarter financial results reflect the headwinds from the Win Now actions we identified for you last quarter. Today I will review our third quarter results and provide context on the progress we have made. Then I will share additional insight for how we expect our Win Now actions to shape our business performance over the near term. This quarter, revenues were down 9% on a reported basis and down 7% on a currency neutral basis. The quarter benefited from strong holiday results in December, including a non-comp benefit from Cyber Monday, followed by double digit declines in January and February.

NIKE Direct was down 10% with NIKE Digital declining 15% and NIKE Stores declining 2%. Wholesale was down 4% largely due to declines in Greater China. Gross margins declined 330 basis points to 41.5% on a reported basis, due to higher markdowns on NIKE Direct, higher wholesale discounts, inventory obsolescence, and product costs and channel mix headwinds. SG&A was down 8% on a reported basis, as increased investments in brand marketing and sports marketing were more than offset by declines in operating overhead. Our effective tax rate was 5.9% compared to 16.5% for the same period last year, primarily due to a onetime tax benefit from US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses. Earnings per share was $0.54. Now let me provide additional insight into our progress against our Win Now actions this quarter.

Let’s begin with our product portfolio. Our performance business grew in the third quarter, led by improving brand and business momentum in training and running, with new product launches, strong sell through of innovation, and a more complete offense across price points in footwear and apparel. This momentum is encouraging since these two sports represent our largest performance businesses. For Q3, this momentum was more than offset by declines in NIKE sportswear and the Jordan brand, led by a double-digit decline in our classic footwear franchises. These franchises again decelerated faster than the overall business, with a more pronounced impact on NIKE Digital. Turning to our marketplace, our teams have taken the initial steps to reposition NIKE Digital as a full-price business.

We remained competitive and promotional in December, finishing with strong holiday results. However, in January and February, we significantly reduced days of promotion in North America and EMEA. This resulted in a several percentage point improvement in demand at full price. With regards to wholesale, since Elliott has returned, we are working as closely with our partners as ever. We are creating confidence through the investments we are making in product engagement, commercial terms, and rebuilding the scale, talent, and capabilities of our sales organization. Within our fall order book in North America, EMEA, and APLA, we see the declines in classic footwear franchises almost being offset by growth in performance dimensions of our portfolio, such as running, training, and basketball, as well as newness in sportswear.

Now let’s talk about the health of our brands. Elliott mobilized our teams this quarter to go bigger and bolder in sports biggest moments. As a result, we supported several new product launches across all three brands. And also delivered outsized brand impact with emotional storytelling in the air and on the ground in key cities. And you felt it. To support this action demand creation expenses grew high single digits versus the prior year. Last, let’s discuss inventory. Inventory declined 2% versus the prior year. But as I said last quarter, inventory remains elevated across all geographies as we implemented our Win Now actions after inventory was purchased and in transit. While we are seeing some increases in customer cancellations, the larger driver of our inventory is the buys for NIKE Direct.

In addition, across the marketplace, we are beginning to see Air Force 1 inventory stabilized with current retail sales, while Air Jordan 1 and Dunk remain elevated with continued actions planned ahead. With that, let me turn to our operating segments. I will focus my commentary on the progress we have made in each of our geographies on our Win Now actions. In North America, Q3 revenue declined 4%. NIKE Direct declined 10%, with NIKE Digital down 12%, and NIKE Stores down 6%. Wholesale increased 3%, due primarily to favorable shipment timing and increased shipments to our value partners in the third quarter. EBIT declined 21% on a reported basis. Throughout the quarter, we delivered bold and inspiring storytelling and key sports moments, as Elliott mentioned, which drove heat and energy for our brand.

Training led performance growth this quarter, and running grew high single digits. In Q3, we hosted dozens of key partners for product engagement and future growth planning, including a summit for partners serving core price points. We have taken initial steps to expand distribution to support our expanded core product offering, which is a meaningful market opportunity for NIKE. In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 6%. NIKE Direct declined 12%, with NIKE Digital down 25%, and NIKE Stores up 9%. Wholesale declined 3%. EBIT declined 35% on a reported basis. In Q3, performance dimensions continue to build momentum, fueled by the Mercurial and Global Football and new product launches in running. We celebrated Zinni Jr’s Best FIFA Men’s Player Award with a short video, Can’t Stop the Dance, featuring the Chrome Mercurial, and we amplified the Peg Premium launch with a unique activation at the London Eye featuring NIKE athletes.

In the marketplace, in addition to taking steps to reposition NIKE Digital, we also started a journey with JD Sports, Sports Direct, and [indiscernible] to elevate our brand physical retail with improved product positioning and visual merchandising. In Greater China, Q3 revenue declined 15%. NIKE Direct declined 11%, with NIKE Digital down 20%, and NIKE Stores down 6%. Wholesale declined 18%. EBIT declined 42% on a reported basis. In Q3, traffic declined double digits, and retail sales underperformed our plan. While the macro environment is challenging, sport is growing in China, and we must accelerate our pace. The market continues to be promotional, especially in consumer moments and in the digital channel. And we are taking aggressive steps to clean up the marketplace, with the priority being the health of our partners.

These steps had a negative impact on our revenue and gross margin this quarter. At the same time, our team is focused on creating brand distinction through sport and serving consumers with new innovation and hyper local product. We saw strong consumer response to the Peg Premium and Vomero 18 in running. And in basketball, we launched the year of the Mamba with strong growth in Kobe Protro. We continue to see locally designed Express Lane product resonate with strong sell-through of our Chinese New Year product. The opportunity in Greater China continues to be significant for NIKE, notwithstanding the highly competitive and fast-moving dynamics in this marketplace. Our brand remains strong, but our actions to energize the marketplace will take some time.

In APLA, Q3 revenue declined 4%. NIKE Direct declined 4%, with NIKE Digital down 8% and NIKE Stores up 1%. Wholesale was down 4%. EBIT declined 27% on a reported basis. While we saw mixed performance across territories in APLA, Japan and Latin America each returned to growth this quarter. In Q3, we created energy on the ground in running communities. We launched the After Dark Tour with incredible response from female runners and executed disruptive race takeovers at the Hakone Ekiden in Japan, the Mumbai Marathon, and the Thailand Marathon. This fueled continued momentum in running with growth across footwear and apparel. Now let’s look forward. Elliott said earlier that we are even more confident that the five Win Now actions are the right moves to create better balance in our business and reignite brand momentum.

So as we begin to have greater clarity and confidence in the steps that we are taking, I will provide some additional thoughts on our path forward over the next several quarters. First, we are accelerating our product portfolio transition. We expect sport performance dimensions to lead our growth with a relentless flow of newness across each field of play. We are focused on increasing the contribution of newness as a percentage of our overall seasonal assortment, including new models, new colors, and new materials. At the same time, we are moving fast to right-size the contribution of our classic footwear franchises. In regards to this transition, we are making progress. In the last quarter of this fiscal year, we expect our classic footwear franchises will be down by more than 10 points as a percent of our total footwear mix.

We intend to drive this mix lower in fiscal 2026 with total units planned down double digits with the most aggressive actions on the Dunk. Second, we are repositioning NIKE Digital within an integrative marketplace. To do this, we are reducing promotional days, reducing markdown rates, and shifting closeout liquidation to our NIKE factory stores. Due to these actions, and as we continue to reduce investment in paid media, we expect digital traffic to be down double digits in fiscal 2026. Gradually, we expect organic traffic to stabilize and grow with new product launches and our increased brand marketing investments. Third, we are cleaning up the marketplace. For NIKE Digital, we are tightening our buys to support a full-price business model.

For NIKE factory stores, we are increasing markdowns to drive velocity of higher volumes of closeout inventory. And for our wholesale partners, we are making investments in sales-related returns, reducing forward supply, and providing higher wholesale discounts to liquidate aged inventory. We expect these actions will continue through the first half of fiscal 2026. Last, when we get back to a steady flow of new product at scale, improve brand engagement, reposition our NIKE Digital business to complement our wholesale partners, and return to a healthy and clean marketplace. We expect our wholesale business to return to growth. Each of our geographies have made varying levels of progress on each of these actions, and as a result are working against different timelines.

But when taken all together, these are the building blocks for NIKE to return sustainable, profitable growth. Now, I’ll turn to our fourth quarter guidance. Our second half plan is in line with what we communicated last quarter, with some shifts occurring between Q3 and Q4. Looking ahead, we believe that the fourth quarter will reflect the largest impact from our Win Now actions and that the headwinds to revenue and gross margin will begin to moderate from there. We are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates, and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.

Our fourth quarter guidance includes our best assessment of these factors based on the data we have available to us today. We expect Q4 revenues to be down in the mid-teens range, albeit at the low end. This includes several points of unfavorable shipment timing in North America, as well as 2 points of negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We expect Q4 gross margins to be down approximately 400 basis points to 500 basis points, including restructuring charges during the same period last year. We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. We expect Q4 SG&A dollars to be up low to mid-single digits, including restructuring charges in the prior year. We will continue to tightly manage expenses, while we increase investment to fuel our win now priorities, most notably demand creation.

We expect other income and expense, including net interest income, to be $45 million to $55 million for Q4. And we expect the tax rate for the full year to be in the mid-teens range. We are focused on what we can control. And for NIKE at this moment, serving athletes with new product innovation and reigniting brand momentum is what matters most. Our collective experience, as well as the early signals we are seeing with consumers, gives us confidence in the path ahead. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Elliott.

Elliott Hill: Thank you, Matt. I’ll close by taking a minute to talk about my teammates at NIKE. Look, it’s been a tough couple of years. We’ve been through a lot of change, but what’s encouraging is that in the 150 days since I’ve been back, we’ve reclaimed our identity. We know who we are. NIKE Inc. is a sports company. We inspire through iconic brands and create innovative products for all athletes. It may seem like an obvious direction, but we needed to say it out loud to reawaken the fire in our teams and I have been unrelenting in that message. One of the things that makes it special to work at NIKE is we invite athletes, coaches, and teams to our business meetings to spend time with our teammates. One conversation that stirred something up in me this quarter was with Coach Ryan Day, coach of the National Champions, the Ohio State Buckeyes.

He had an answer to the question that really connected with how I’m thinking about our team right now and the tone we’re setting. The question to him was, how do you stay on the offense and what’s the key to keeping your program moving forward? His answer was that Ohio State applies pressure constantly in all three phases of the game, no matter who he’s playing. Get vertical down the field on offense. Play suffocating man coverage so no throw is easy, go after punts, and have his best athletes returning kicks. He just painted this picture of a team that is relentlessly pushing and challenging, being aggressive and making it uncomfortable to play against. I love that attitude. And that’s how I think about NIKE when we’re at our best. Success for NIKE has never been about protecting our turf.

We force others to play our game. We drive trends, grow markets we lead. Coach Day made it clear that it takes complete buy-in to be a championship team. That’s exactly what we’re asking of our teammates right now, to keep up the intensity, to move with focus and urgency, to have passion and take pride in all that we do, and to win as a team. With that, I’ll turn it over for questions.

Q&A Session

Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you, good afternoon. Elliot, can you provide a timeline on when you think classic shoe inventories will be clean in the wholesale channel? And then same question for the direct channel as well.

Elliott Hill: Thanks for the question Lorraine. Before I dive too deeply into the specific question, I do want to start really quickly because I think it’s important to set the tone here on the call for these types of questions, that 90 days ago, we declared five actions to return to growth. And what we’ll say 90 days later, I’m even more convinced that these are the right actions to move our brand and business forward. And these Win Now actions really start with our culture, our product portfolio, which is a question that you’re asking here, and I’ll dive into that here in just a second, shaping our brand for distinction, elevating and growing the marketplace, and winning on the ground. And what we did add to our teams after coming off the call was providing them a sharp focus on which sports.

We have five sports, running, basketball, football, training and sportswear, three key countries I outlined for you, and then the five cities. So the teams are really rallying around this Win Now priorities and even calling it the [5535] (ph). So now let me let me jump more specifically into product for you and I will also start a little higher level before I dive into the specific question around the key franchises. We are going to run a balanced and complete portfolio. I want to make sure everybody on the call hears that. We’re going to run that through all three brands, NIKE, Jordan, Converse, across performance and sportswear, men’s, women’s, kids’ footwear, pair of accessories, and up and down price points. And we’re going to be sharper on specific sports.

And I’ve touched on those already, so I won’t dive too deeply on those five sports, but we have set teams up against each of those, sport times gender, and we have small teams, cross-functional teams taking the insights from those sports and those consumers and driving innovative products. So I feel good about where the team’s heading on the performance side of the business. And we’re starting to see some great success and I’m sure we’ll hit on that here in a moment. What I’d say about franchise management to answer your question specifically is that, we have decade long experience of managing franchises. And I will also say this, we have the three, Air Force 1, Dunk, A.J. 1, they are still beloved silhouettes. So it’s not about sun setting these, it’s about right sizing them.

And we asked our teams to accelerate our actions, as Matt spoke to in his prepared remarks of right sizing that inventory so that we can get back to running that complete and balanced portfolio. And so we’re confident that we’re making the right moves from a performance perspective and we’re seeing some wins there, running and training that Matt touched on. And we’re right sizing the three key franchises. And at the same time, starting to plant some newness in the sportswear side of our business with the Vomero 5, P6000, Shox. We touched on some of these Superfly, Air Max Muse, and Air Max 95. So, I feel like the teams are taking all the right actions against those key footwear franchises, right sizing the inventory, and getting back to running a relentless flow of innovative and coveted products.

Matt Friend: Hey Lorraine, I’ll just add that what I said in my prepared remarks was that, we intend to drive — we’ve made really good progress over the past year and as Elliott came in, he challenged the teams to increase the pace at which we reduce the supply of those three franchises in the marketplace. And as a result of that, it had some impact on our Q4 headwinds that we talked about, but it will continue to be a headwind in fiscal year 2026. By the time we execute Q4, we expect that we will have reduced the contribution of those franchises by 10 percentage points as a percent of our overall footwear mix. And we intend to drive that down more in fiscal year 2026. When I think about it through the lens of channels, what I would say to you is that on the NIKE Direct side and the Digital side in particular, we’re already taking action, as Elliott and I both outlined, to reduce the number of promotional days and to reducing the discounts that we see in the marketplace.

The challenge we have in the near term is that, we were buying against a different plan. And so we’ve tightened the buys against NIKE Digital, but we really did that towards the end of summer and heading into fall. That inventory will not end up in the digital channel. We will directly transition it to our factory stores and we will clean it in a value channel like we typically do as we clean up the season. On the wholesale side, we’re making investments and I talked about us needing to use the first half of fiscal year 2026 in order to be able to clean up the marketplace. And what I would tell you there is that, the combination of the actions that we’re taking in digital, plus the actions that we’ve communicated and worked through with our partners, we’re already starting to see fruit.

And what I mean by that is, one, inventory of Air Force 1 is beginning to stabilize with retail sales for Air Force 1. But secondly, when you look at the order book in wholesale for our partners in North America, Maine, and APLA, we’re seeing growth in the performance dimensions of our business plus newness in sportswear almost offset the declines we’re managing in the classic footwear franchises. And that gives us a lot of confidence that our partners are coming behind us and that we are moving down the right path to affect the cleanup.

Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Brooke Roach: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. Elliot, I was hoping to get your latest thoughts on innovation within NIKE. How do you feel about the strength of your innovation team and the pipeline ahead? And how are you thinking about innovating into some of the sportswear franchises as we look into fiscal 2026? Thank you.

Elliott Hill: Yes, thank you, Brooke. Let me first start on innovation. When we think about innovation, we think about it really in two forms. We have long term, let’s call it three to plus five years, and we have a dedicated team against that over at our LeBron James NIKE Sports Research Lab and what I would say a really confident in the team that we have there and not only the team but the work that they are doing long-term creating new innovation for our team. So that’s a little longer term. I spent a lot of time with [John Hoke] (ph) and his team over there and excited about some of the products that are coming through the NIKE Sports Research Lab. Shorter term and more near term, again, I touched on it in my first answer and it’s really coming back to driving newness and freshness against Performance and sportswear, men’s, women’s, kids, footwear, apparel, and accessories, not just footwear.

We’ve got some really interesting innovation coming from apparel. I touched on it briefly in my prepared remarks around 24/7. And it comes out of our training line, but it is also viewed as sportswear. And there’s some innovation there. And I’m really pleased with the sell through on 24/7 and the reorders that are coming on that from an apparel perspective. And then on a footwear perspective, we’ll continue to right size the three franchise that I touched on. We still believe all three of them are meaningful products. And then you’ll see us continue to invest in innovation around sportswear. And I touched on some of those products. The Vomero 5, P6000, Shox. Shox is having a really built into momentum. Air Max 95, etc. And I’ll just close out here, Brooke.

This week we had our Spring 26 product review where we bring all of our Geo partners here to the campus to go through our Spring 26 line. And what I’ll tell you is, we are all excited about the products that are coming for Spring 26. We’re starting to see our Win Now focus on accelerating our product portfolio against these five sports, running, basketball, football, training, and sportswear, paying dividends. I’m really excited about the work I saw there. And while I have you, I’ll just add one other thing that I saw that I was excited about. We are also working on elevating the marketplace and the retail team’s done some phenomenal work around elevating our presentation at both wholesale and physical retail. And so excited about some of that work.

So overall, I’m confident that our innovation pipeline is there. We just now have to flow through it to get back to building the brand and the business.

Operator: And to our next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. Your line is open.

Aneesha Sherman: Thank you so much. Elliot, I just want to follow up on the comment that you just made about the Spring 26 product review. Based on some of the comments earlier from Matt around performance growth almost offsetting classic declines, do you expect that inflection point to be in Spring 26? I know you don’t have the orders yet, but is that when you expect performance growth to more than offset classics in your total wholesale order book to grow? And then, Matt, a follow-up on your comments on gross margins. You talked about wholesale liquidations at H1. I know you’re not giving margin guidance for next year, but are you generally expecting gradual progression of gross margins through the year as some of those liquidations roll off and then you get a stronger order book in the second half? Thank you.

Elliott Hill: Let me — here’s — we’re absolutely gaining confidence in the product pipeline. In the fall, Matt already touched on some of the order book on fall in North America, APLA, and EMEA. So definitely gaining confidence around the order book fall holiday and then like I said this sneak peek into 2026. The key here though is how quickly we can clean up the marketplace. That’s why you see some of the results that we have in Q4 and then resetting both the digital and physical marketplaces to receive this innovation, making certain that we present it in the way that we believe we need to present the product at point of sale, digital, physical, so that we drive the sell through. And so that’s where we have the team’s focus right now.

The brand, I believe we’ve already started to invest in, we did that early. I see product coming now and that excites me and so I feel good about that. Now we’ve got to reset the marketplace and make sure that we get the sell through and it’s that sell through that’s going to continue to drive the order book and get us back to profitable sustainable growth.

Matt Friend: Yes, and I just would add that, last quarter we said that the fourth quarter was going to have the largest, the greatest impact from the Win Now actions that Elliott outlined. And we continue to believe this is true and it’s on our plan. But what we can also tell you is that we now expect Q4 to reflect the largest impact from these Win Now actions. And that the headwinds to revenue and margin we expect to moderate from there. And so, how I think you translate that, Aneesha, as you start to look forward is, we’ve tried to lay out each of these actions and the implications that they have as we start to think about heading into 2026. And we expect that these headwinds will continue in 2026. And as Elliott referenced, while we’re going to have positive things beginning vis-a-vis greater full price selling in digital, and we’re going to have a clean and full price order book with our wholesale partners, we are going to continue to be liquidating inventory.

And we expect that that’s going to take us several quarters to work through. But the reason why we’re confident in it is because we know we’ll be liquidating it through the channels where we’re used to liquidating that inventory. So we will continue to be transparent as we’ve got greater visibility as we get into fiscal 2026. But we’re still in the early days of executing against these partnerships. And I’m sorry, we’re still in the early days of executing against these priorities. And we remain committed to providing guidance and financial updates every 90 days.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO. Your line is open.

Simeon Siegel: Thanks. Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Elliott, I’m curious, how are you going to balance the promotional, just like as you think about the presentation and bringing out promotions at the same time that it’s clear we can hear your excitement around the new product and your amplifying storytelling, just from a consumer’s perspective, how do you tell them this exciting story while still clearing the product? So how are you going to protect that and maybe segment that? And then Matt, it seems operating overhead versus demand creation trajectory flipped in recent years. So as you’re re-embracing wholesale, as you’re re-embracing elevating, any thoughts as to just the right level, long-term of overhead versus demand creation as the rate of sale. Thanks, guys.

Elliott Hill: Yes. Simeon, I think I’d be fairly brief here. Matt touched on some of the headwinds to the P&L, and one of them is us taking products — we’re returning products from our wholesale partners. So we’re bringing the product that’s not selling out of the market and then we will liquidate that to our value stores, NIKE value stores, to make room for the new innovation. And so — and it’s already starting — and by the way, we’re doing the same thing not only in a physical space, but we’re also doing it — excuse me, we’re doing it in a digital space as well. We touched on how we’ve already moved NIKE Direct, Digital to a full price presentation, really elevating the assortment, the presentation, the user experience.

And so, we’re moving the — both digital and physical owned and partnered retail floor sets to full price as quickly as possible. And then we’ll use the value channels to move through the excess inventory. I think the last — I’ll just kind of finish here, the best example of that is how we’re going to reset running. We’ve had some great examples of Peg Premium this quarter, Vomero 18 this quarter, both new innovations with great storytelling, great presentation. And we’ve had wonderful sell-throughs on those. And then you’ll see that Simeon continue to flow into fall and holiday of Q1, Q2 of 2026 with a full range of product in running across three different silos of running, Vomero, PEG, Structure, three different price points, trail running, and then of course our racing flats.

And that was one of the floor sets that I saw over at the Spring 26, And again, it looks amazing. So we’re trying to get our marketplace to full price as quickly as possible and feel like the teams are moving with a sense of urgency.

Matt Friend: Yes. And on the SG&A side, I’ve said for a couple quarters that we continue to manage our expenses and what I meant by that specifically was overhead tightly. While we accelerate investment in demand creation and so our demand creation being up high single digits, 8% this quarter, is truly a reflection of Elliott coming in and challenging the team to elevate our storytelling with impact. And it’s the easiest lever for us to pull. And the team mobilized around the Super Bowl and the All-Star weekend and the product launches for Peg and Vomero, but also the way that they executed on the ground those activities in the cities in which we were focused. As we look forward, I think we’re going to continue to manage expenses tightly.

I think that part of what you’re seeing this quarter in the double digit decline in operating overhead is some of the variable expense from Direct coming down, flowing through the P&L. You’re also seeing the great work our teams have done from a productivity perspective in managing against some of the productivity goals that we had set several quarters ago. If you look at our operating overhead growth, excluding the restructuring impact in the prior year, it was down 3%. And we’re focused on ensuring that we invest behind our sales organizations, our key city teams on the one end and on the other end making sure that we’ve got the right resources and product and in innovation. And so we’ll continue to do that and we’ll continue to try to do it while we manage expenses tightly as we look forward to returning to growth.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Alex Straton: Thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to focus on wholesale here. And maybe for Elliott, as you’ve kind of returned to that channel and gotten back in the mix, I’m just curious, your biggest learnings there, any surprises of the upside or downside versus how you’ve historically operated there with all your knowledge? And maybe then for Matt, you just mentioned wholesale discounts as a headwind, which should continue. Are historical wholesale margins still in view? Are those structurally lower? Just curious for your latest thoughts there. Thanks a lot.

Elliott Hill: Yes, thank you, Alex. It’s maybe a surprise. We were probably working probably two siloed, direct versus wholesale. And again, I think to really drive the potential of our brand and our revenue and to meet consumers’ needs, it’s got to be integrated. It’s got to be an aligned approach to both direct and wholesale, digital and physical. It all has to work together in a consistent ecosystem. And so, I’m really driving hard [indiscernible] integrated consumer-led marketplace, let the consumer decide where they want to choose to shop. May 2 moves, Craig Williams and I, we’ve put in place two new leaders, one in NIKE Direct, Shannon Glass, and then the other one in sales, Erica Bullard, both long-term industry veterans and NIKE veterans.

In fact, we put them sitting next to up on our floor together. They have offices right outside of one another and they walk hand-in-hand and making certain like literally almost physically. So I told them those two have got to walk together everywhere they go and make certain that we stay aligned. And I think they’re doing a tremendous job of really making certain that we have an integrated approach to the overall marketplace. So I’d say that’s probably number one. Number two, we just got out of a rhythm of working closely with our wholesale partners. That was a bit of a surprise, and we are quickly getting back to — we’ve got cross-functional teams, we’re having key account planning meetings now with our wholesale partners. We’re working through unaligned growth plans.

We’re working on consumer right assortments in the right depth. We’re working now to elevate the presentation of our brand. And you know all too well when we have beautiful, innovative product and we elevate the presentation, it really helps sell through the product and marketing support. So again, I’m confident in the progress we’re making. It’s going to take time to build back all of the teams around the world. And that’s why we have the three key countries where we’re trying to focus, United States, China, and the UK, so that our teams know where we’re going to focus our investments and resources. So all in all, the wholesale partners, they want and need us to get back to be a NIKE.

Matt Friend: And from a margin perspective, what I would say is that, over the past several years, Alex, the profit pool in wholesale has been relatively volatile. There’s been a lot of things that have happened with supply chain disruption, ocean freight rates moving, the supply demand imbalances. And as a result of that, we’ve all navigated through many things in order to be able to manage the profitability of the channel. I think one of the things that we did a couple of years ago as we were seeing a significant demand versus supply imbalance, meaning an incredible amount of demand and less supply, is we actually lowered our wholesale discount rates in order to offset other headwinds that we were dealing with from a freight and transportation perspective.

And so we are investing in commercial terms, but we’re putting them back to historical levels. And so — and we believe that by doing that, we’ll be competitive. It will enable us and our partners to have mutually profitable businesses and also have the capacity that we need in order to be able to invest in the presentation of our brand at retail, which is ultimately what wins at the end of the day.

Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Randy Konick with Jeffries. Your line is open.

Randal Konik: Yes, thanks a lot and good evening. I guess Elliott, maybe give us some perspective. I think you spoke about a lot of things you’re doing with urgency in China, but maybe give us a progress report on where you see the different geos from all these strategies you’re undertaking. Give us some perspective where you’re furthest along — we’re furthest along. That’d be very helpful. Thanks.

Elliott Hill: Yeah. I think the key here, Randy, is as we think about our overall portfolio, is that we have 190 countries that all roll up to four different geographies. And we’re working closely with the leaders of each of the geos and countries to implement the Win Now strategy. Because again, the strategy works no matter if you’re in the United States or in Japan. It all goes back to putting the consumer at the center, right products, storytelling, marketplace. And so, Matt in his prepared remarks touched on APLA, EMEA, and North America being where they are in almost — in terms of futures in performance and looks of sportswear offsetting. And so, we’re, I think, making progress in each of those three geos. In terms of China, here’s what I’d say about China.

We remain committed to China. We see the long-term opportunity there. There’s 1.3 billion consumers, and it’s our opportunity. And what we’ve always done there is to invite and inspire those 1.3 billion consumers into sport, fitness, and the lifestyle of sport. And our team is doing a good job there. We’ve also made some significant investments in China, whether it’s around some of the big teams like the national basketball team, the track and field team, and the football team. So we’ve made big investments there. We’ve got now a product creation arm that we call Geo Express Lane in China. So overall, I think we’ve made the right investments. What I will say, I spent some time over there in December. I hadn’t been over there in a while. The competition is a bit more aggressive than I had — when I remembered it four and a half years ago.

And so we’ve just got to accelerate our pace. Good news is, we’re starting still as the number one brand there. We’re working closely with Angela and her team to implement these Win Now strategies. We’re cleaning up the promotional marketplace just like we’re doing everywhere to make room for new innovation. We’re getting back to elevating NIKE Direct and Digital, and then working closely with our two big partners to make certain that we’re investing in consumer-led concepts with a focus on performance, running, training, basketball, Jordan, ACG, put the right assortments, depth, presentation, all the things that I’ve talked a lot about. But in the end, I believe we’re taking all the right actions and we’re confident in the long-term opportunity in China.

Matt Friend: And when you look at the financial performance for China in the quarter, what I tried to highlight was the amount of actions that we took in the quarter between marketplace returns, rebates, and also some investments that we’re making to liquidate inventory. And given that it’s a mono-brand market, as Elliott mentioned, it’s going to take us time to execute the Win Now in China. So we went aggressive because the faster we can clean up the marketplace and create the capacity and the space to present the new product stories, the new product assortments that we’re excited about that are coming, the quicker we’re going to create energy with consumers, that’s when we should see traffic start to improve and we should start to build more momentum in that marketplace. So as we look at that, we just expect it’s going to take us some time to be able to execute this.",https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20141443/NKE-insidermonkey-1695233681388.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 03:58:55.193636

Shares for Nike fell on the day, as investors brought the stock price down 5.4 percent.","Nike is still struggling.

The iconic shoe company just reported a shocking sales collapse that has fans worried about the store's future.

It's a bleak update in a saga that has seen arguably America's most legendary athletic fashion brand struggle to put popular products on its shelves.

'To me it seems that the only thing Nike has going for them is brand image to justify outrageous prices,' one customer recently complained on Reddit.

'$200 for a sneaker? Yeah right.'

Nike's sales dropped 9 percent, a staggering $1.16 billion fall in the value of shoes, tracksuits, and t-shirts.

Executives said the slowdown was likely because Chinese consumers are cutting back on spending. There are several reasons for Nike's struggles.

For years, conservatives have criticized Nike for its partnerships with political activists and athletes, such as Colin Kaepernick, who protested during the national anthem, viewing it as a shift toward 'woke' culture.

The company's stance on social issues and commitment to diversity and inclusion have led some to accuse it of prioritizing activism over traditional American values.

In particular, conservatives spoke out against the company's all-female Super Bowl ad.

Caitlin Clark, the dominant WNBA player, was a central figure in the ad campaign.

And now, Nike is also facing stiff competition from rising competitors in the US.

Hoka, Brooks, and Saucony are all gaining sales in the athletic sneaker industry after spending millions of dollars on branding deals with running clubs and community events.

These brands are more nimble, often offering trendy designs at lower price points and delivering a more eco-conscious message.

Nike, by contrast, has struggled with inventory numbers in its stores.

The company rarely offers major discounts on its top-end shoes, including its iconic Air Jordans brand.

Sales fell the most in China, one of its largest markets., where they fell 17 percent.

Before the sales dip, Nike was already in the middle of a revolutionary change, headed by new CEO, Elliott Hill.

Hill, who took over the top spot in the company in late 2024, has warned that the company needs to endure a rocky period before righting the ship.

During the earnings call, Hill said he expects sales to continue to dip in the next quarter.

He also explicitly said that tariff policies from the Trump White House will hurt Nike's bottom line.

But more recently, Americans have taken to cutting back on alcohol.

Part of that shift may relate to a broad pullback in spending.

Consumers are being more mindful of where their dollars are going given a years-long stretch of rampant inflation. And with interest rates unlikely to come down anytime soon, Americans are limiting what they buy to avoid needless debt.

There are also growing health concerns about alcohol consumption. Earlier this year, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a warning about the long-term risks of drinking.

A 2024 Gallup poll found that more Americans are acknowledging the negative effects of alcohol. Many are now turning to beverages with a lower alcoholic content as a middle-ground solution.

Pre-made cocktails are grabbing consumers' attention

At a time when consumers may be avoiding bars and their overpriced menus, a growing number are turning to pre-made cocktails for the convenience as well as the novelty.

Many pre-made cocktails are, by nature, lower in alcohol -- though not necessarily in calories. But for consumers who are trying to be more mindful about the former than the latter, they're an easy solution and alternative to happy hour.

A growing number of beverage companies are jumping on the pre-made cocktail bandwagon. SunnyD Vodka Seltzer debuted in 2023, and more recently, Kraft Heinz introduced Crystal Light Vodka Refreshers.

Coca-Cola has never been a company to sit on the sidelines when a new trend in beverages emerges. Now, it's rolling out a new concoction that fans might swoon over.

Coca-Cola goes all-in on canned cocktails

Cola-Cola hasn't been shy about getting into the alcohol game. It already has a partnership with Brown-Forman that produces Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola, as well as a partnership with Constellation Brands on Fresca Mixed. And its Minute Maid spiked line features flavors like Strawberry Daiquiri.

Now, Coca-Cola is bringing a new vodka cocktail into the mix. Dubbed Minute Maid spiked, it's a mix of vodka and lemonade (both classic and pink).

Coca-Cola's new drinks, which will be released through the company's Red Tree Beverages subsidiary, have 5% alcohol by volume. They also don't contain carbonation.

In recent years, beverage brands have enjoyed success by focusing on the quality of their spirits in pre-made drinks. Surfside, the maker of non-carbonated vodka-infused tea and lemonade, was the second-best-selling canned cocktail made with spirits in 2024.

As Americans take a more cautious approach to spending, focusing on spirit quality is a smart move for beverage-makers, as is veering away from carbonated beverages. Coca-Cola’s new offerings may prove to be a smoother, more sophisticated version of the pre-packaged cocktails today’s Gen Xers drank when they were younger (Zima, we’re talking to you).

More Food + Dining:

Starbucks announces bittersweet change you will soon see in stores

Costco confirms major change to its food court menu

McDonald’s menu change sparks sharp criticism from customers

Still, Coca-Cola may want to tread lightly at a time when Americans are rethinking their relationship with alcohol.

The company already has a number of pre-made cocktails in its lineup. And at a time when consumers may be looking to cut back on booze as well as calories, it may not want to put too many eggs into this particular basket.

A 2025 NC Solutions survey found that 49% of Americans plan to drink less alcohol in 2025. So what Coca-Cola may want to do following its latest move is expand into the mocktail space.

It’s clear that consumers are still willing to spend money on fun beverages, and they’re eager to stock their own fridges rather than pay a premium to drink outside the home. As beverage companies dive headfirst into the world of pre-packaged cocktails, they should keep a pulse on the growing mocktail trend.

Nike’s stock price dropped 7% after projecting a double-digit revenue decline due to shipment delays, exchange rate issues, and looming tariffs. Concerns about a potential universal tariff on April 2 are adding to Nike’s woes. Despite the challenges, CEO Elliot Hill remains optimistic, focusing on digital growth, product innovation, and athlete engagement. While consumer spending increased by 6% in 2025, uncertainty surrounding tariffs continues to create tension for Nike’s future. The upcoming April 2 decision could significantly impact Nike’s financial outlook.

Nike’s stock price nosedived 7% after the company projected a double-digit revenue decline due to challenging market conditions, supply chain disruptions, and looming tariffs. CFO Matthew Friend outlined these concerns during an earnings call, highlighting the impact of shipment timing issues in North America and a 2% negative hit from foreign exchange rates. Adding to this pressure, tariff threats from the Trump administration are raising fears of further losses.

Why did Nike’s stock plunge so sharply?

Nike’s shares dropped significantly after predicting a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue for the next quarter. Several factors are contributing to this decline:

Shipment delays in North America affecting timely deliveries.

Foreign exchange headwinds accounting for a 2% revenue loss.

Tariff concerns linked to key trading partners, particularly China and Mexico.

Are tariffs from Trump administration hurting Nike’s bottom line?

Yes, Nike has already factored tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods into its projections, but there’s a much larger storm brewing. A potential universal tariff expected on April 2 could escalate costs even further, putting additional strain on the company’s supply chain and pricing strategies.

What’s Nike’s ‘Win Now’ strategy to bounce back?

Amidst the challenges, Nike’s new CEO Elliot Hill remains confident about the company’s future. He is doubling down on a ‘Win Now’ strategy that focuses on:

Revitalizing the brand through cutting-edge product launches.

Boosting digital engagement by strengthening its e-commerce presence.

Connecting with young athletes to enhance grassroots loyalty.

Is consumer spending helping or hurting Nike’s prospects?

Surprisingly, consumer spending remains strong, offering a glimmer of hope for Nike. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, reported a 6% increase in consumer spending during the first few months of 2025 compared to the previous year. This robust spending pattern suggests that Nike could still capitalize on consumer resilience despite mounting uncertainties.

Live Events

Are other companies facing similar tariff headwinds?

Nike is not alone in its tariff woes. Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture, pointed out in the company’s Q2 2025 earnings call that tariffs and trade uncertainties are global concerns affecting various industries. Many corporations are preparing for potential disruptions that may arise after the April 2 tariff announcement.

Can Nike weather the storm of trade policy changes?

As Nike navigates through a turbulent economic landscape, its focus on innovation and digital growth may serve as a buffer against further financial hits. However, the April 2 tariff decision remains a looming threat that could reshape Nike’s financial future dramatically.

FAQs:

Why did Nike’s stock price drop by 7%?

Nike’s shares fell due to revenue decline, shipment delays, and looming tariff concerns.

How is Nike responding to tariff challenges?

Nike is focusing on digital expansion, innovation, and grassroots engagement.

But he said his company is open to making more acquisitions along the lines of the Softchoice deal.
“We are a big partner with Nvidia on the infrastructure side, helping with data center and AI purpose-built data center buildouts,” he said.","‘We found the build-out of Softchoice in the SMB space and the midmarket and commercial space, both in Canada and in the US, to be very attractive, because that's a big market that we haven't necessarily gone after, and we don't necessarily have the, I would say, muscle memory. We haven't built out the go-to-market around that space. So instead of trying to invent that ourselves, we thought Softchoice could be a very good acquisition to accelerate that,’ says WWT CEO Jim Kavanaugh.

This week’s Nvidia GTC 2025 conference brought together hundreds of companies looking to grab a piece of the AI action spearheaded by Nvidia by means of its industry-leading GPU and DPU technology.

Among the exhibitors at the conference in San Jose, Calif., was St. Louis-based solution provider World Wide Technology (WWT), which just recently closed its $1.25 billion acquisition of Softchoice, a Toronto-based software and cloud-focused IT solution provider.

Kavanaugh said that 99.9 percent of WWT’s growth over the last 35 years has been organic, and that his company continues to see enormous opportunity for organic growth. But he said his company is open to making more acquisitions along the lines of the Softchoice deal.

“Those acquisitions, from our perspective, could be ones that complement and synergize what we do today, and it could be technology-based acquisitions focused on AI, cloud or cyber,” Kavanaugh said.

“Or it could be a combination of technology-based synergies along with geographic capabilities that would help accelerate our capability to expand domestically and in North America and globally. So we put together an acquisition team about a year and a half ago and started building a pipeline of different companies that we were potentially interested in.”

The first acquisition from that pipeline was Softchoice, which Kavanaugh said had the synergies and complementary capabilities WWT was looking for.

“We found the build-out of Softchoice in the SMB space and the midmarket and commercial space, both in Canada and in the US, to be very attractive, because that’s a big market that we haven’t necessarily gone after, and we don’t necessarily have the, I would say, muscle memory,” he said. “We haven’t built out the go-to-market around that space. So instead of trying to invent that ourselves, we thought Softchoice could be a very good acquisition to accelerate that.”

WWT also found Softchoice’s focus on the cloud and cybersecurity to be very complementary to what it was doing, Kavanaugh said.

“And we liked their focus on AI, specifically around Microsoft, them being a big Microsoft partner in the SMB space,” he said. “I would say 90-plus percent of their focus has been in the SMB space. All of those things were very attractive to World Wide, and we felt very complementary to what we're doing. And we also felt very, very good about their CEO and their leadership team. We really liked them. We liked their mindset and the culture of the organization.”

Softchoice CEO Andrew Caprara (right, in photo), told CRN that, while Softchoice was a very profitable independent company, its growth was attracting a lot of attention in the industry. The temptation to become part of a larger company like WWT was also fueled by the consideration that the company had to make a move to meet its responsibility to its shareholders.

“As we started going through the process, it just became really clear that the combination of Softchoice with World Wide would really stand out in the marketplace,” Caprara said. “When you think about some of the combinations in our space in the past, it’s usually more like-for-like M&A. It’s a hardware-focused company buying another one, or somebody buying something at a low multiple. This is really one of the first times where you’re seeing one of the premier Microsoft and software solution providers joining forces with one of the premier infrastructure and AI and cybersecurity solution providers.”

The acquisition felt like a good fit from a solution and a people perspective, Caprara said.

“It felt like now is the time to take advantage of the opportunity, because, as you know, there’s a lot of change for our customers right now and they’re really looking for somebody that can help them with an end-to-end solution. And I think we can do that now like no one else can.”

WWT At Nvidia GTC 2025

When asked what WWT was doing at Nvidia GTC 2025, Kavanaugh said his company has built multiple AI use cases based on its 10-year relationship with Nvidia and found that having a presence at the conference was a great way to show them off to clients and potential clients.

These include use cases around WWT’s unique ability to design, engineer and build out AI purpose-built data centers around Nvidia technology and the other components that go into the architectural build, he said.

“And then we have also use cases that we have built for our customers, and some of them for ourselves internally, like an AI-generated RFP [request for proposal] assistant that we have designed and built internally and have deployed for customers,” he said. “And there are some things around computer vision that we’re doing, some digital twins that we showed.”

WWT has been working with Nvidia on the data science, natural language processing and machine learning side, Kavanaugh said. The emergence of GenAI and ChatGPT and related technologies put WWT in a great position with Nvidia given its established data science group along with software development and infrastructure expertise.

“We are a big partner with Nvidia on the infrastructure side, helping with data center and AI purpose-built data center buildouts,” he said. “We’re working with them domestically, in Europe and in the Middle East on that. And we’re working with them also on the inference, the outcome side. With our management consulting software development group, we’re working with them and our customers to help build out different capabilities, whether it’s a digital twin or some type of computer vision capabilities around AI use cases.”",https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2025/media_1c4baf2e305e58f419006e454467c9bb38c20c9f6.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-03-22 11:03:23.845859

The company recently reported a 9% year-over-year revenue decline in its Q3 2025 earnings, with total revenues falling to $11.3 billion. While earnings per share of 54 cents beat analyst expectations, the underlying trends point to deeper concerns for the brand’s long-term trajectory.

The declines were broad-based: North American revenue dropped 4%, while Greater China saw a dramatic 17% fall. Even Nike’s previously strong direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment took a hit, with Nike Direct revenues down 12% and Nike Digital falling 15%. Net income also declined sharply—down 32% year-over-year to $0.8 billion—and gross margins dropped 330 basis points to 41.5%. Investors responded swiftly, with Nike’s stock tumbling nearly 8% following the earnings call and subsequent downward revisions of future guidance.

The company attributed the results to a challenging retail environment and slower consumer demand in key markets. But the picture is becoming increasingly clear: Nike’s traditional playbook is being disrupted.

Rising Competition from Emerging Brands

As Nike battles to maintain its footing, new-generation brands are rapidly gaining traction with consumers seeking innovation, authenticity, and purpose-driven products.

On Running, the Swiss-based brand formally known as On Holding AG, is a clear standout. In its latest full-year earnings, On reported net sales of CHF 1.8 billion (approx. USD $2.1 billion), a 55% increase in constant currency terms. The company also posted a gross profit margin of 59.6%, a strong contrast to Nike’s margin contraction, and reported net income of CHF 79.6 million.

On’s success is tied to a mix of high-performance product design, minimalist branding, and carefully curated celebrity partnerships—including tennis icon Roger Federer and actress Zendaya. The brand’s appeal cuts across performance runners, lifestyle wearers, and younger demographics, offering an image of modern athleticism with a premium feel. As a result, On is rapidly eating into market share once dominated by Nike.

The Rise of Sustainable Disruptors

Nike is also facing pressure from emerging, sustainability-focused brands like Tarkine, an Australian company gaining traction with eco-conscious runners. Tarkine uses recycled materials, certified processes, and ethical labor—appealing to consumers seeking purpose-driven products.

While not yet matching Nike’s scale, brands like Tarkine reflect a broader shift toward companies built around sustainability from day one, not as a marketing add-on.

Market Signals

The broader market is responding to these shifts. Investors and analysts alike are beginning to question whether Nike can continue to rely on its historical brand power and marketing spend to maintain leadership. With legacy infrastructure and slower agility, Nike faces a growing gap in product innovation and consumer connection compared to its leaner, more adaptive competitors.

Looking Ahead

While Nike remains a powerful player, the latest financial results and market reactions suggest a changing of the guard may be underway in segments of the athletic footwear market. The rise of performance-lifestyle hybrids like On and sustainability-first brands like Tarkine indicates that consumers are rewarding differentiation over tradition.

Nike’s next steps will be closely watched. It can no longer afford to assume loyalty will carry it through disruption. The landscape is evolving—and fast.",https://runnerstribe.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gen-Nike-2_008.jpg,N,,2025-03-22 19:00:19.394102

Nike's turnaround effort is hitting snags as the company tries to clear out old inventory while feeling the effects of a growing trade war.

The sportswear maker signaled further declines in revenue and profitability due to an ongoing merchandise reset that the company says is necessary to renew growth. Nike also expects gross margin to decline sharply in the current quarter from a year earlier, in part due to US tariffs on products from China and Mexico.

Chief executive officer Elliott Hill, a longtime Nike executive who came out of retirement to take the top role in October, is looking to guide the company back to growth after a difficult year of falling sales and corporate layoffs. He's reshaping Nike by refocusing on sports and mending relationships with its retail partners.

Advt

Nike is in the midst of clearing out stale merchandise through heavy discounting as demand fades for some of its biggest sneaker franchises, including Air Force 1s and Dunks. Inventory fell 2 per cent in the period but Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said those levels remain ""elevated across all categories.""

The company is trying to turn things around against a backdrop of weak consumer spending and fallout from President Donald Trump's escalating trade war. China also remained a weak spot, with sales missing analyst expectations amid a prolonged consumer slump in the market. But performance in North America and the region that includes Europe, Africa and the Middle East came in better than expected.

In the company's call with analysts, Friend said ""geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations"" are among factors creating uncertainty.

In fiscal 2024, China produced 18 per cent of Nike-branded footwear, according to company reports. A company website shows Nike has 117 manufacturing locations in China and eight in Mexico.

Friend added that Nike will see a double-digit drop in digital traffic in the company's next fiscal year as the company transitions to a new mix of products.

Revenue fell 9 per cent to $11.3 billion for the company's fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28, better than the 11 per cent drop that Wall Street predicted.

The performance shows that ""a turnaround is beginning to unfold,"" said Poonam Goyal, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""But the company still has a lot of work to do to reduce inventories.""

In December, Hill outlined a plan to invigorate Nike by reorganizing around departments that focus on sports such as running, basketball and soccer. The company is also reallocating marketing funds from clicky digital ads to more anthemic sports campaigns. It spent 8 per cent more on marketing in the latest quarter.

""It's been a tough couple of years,"" Hill said during the call. ""But what's encouraging is that in the 150 days since I've been back, we've reclaimed our identity.""

Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said the results showed Nike is having ""a good start to a two-year journey.""

On the company’s third quarter earnings call on Thursday night, Hill told analysts about its “Win Now” strategy Nike execs developed back in December.
According to the CEO, who joined the company in October, these new priorities are centered around five fields of play, three countries and five cities.

On the company’s third quarter earnings call on Thursday night, Hill told analysts about its “Win Now” strategy Nike execs developed back in December. According to the CEO, who joined the company in October, these new priorities are centered around five fields of play, three countries and five cities.

Hill noted that the fields of play that Nike is focused on in this strategy include running, basketball, football, training and sportswear. The CEO added that he is “confident” that the company is “making the right moves” as he’s already seeing improvements in both the running and training business segments. Ultimately, though, it’s about running a “balanced and complete” portfolio, Hill said.

“We’re going to run that through all three brands – Nike, Jordan and Converse – across performance in sportswear, men’s, women’s, kids, footwear, apparel, accessories and up and down price points,” Hill said. “And we’re going to be sharp on specific sports.”

This is where the new product comes into play. As discussed for months now, Nike has been working to clean up its distribution of the oversaturated Air Force 1, Jordan 1 and Dunk models.

Now, the CEO is touting some newness in the sportswear side of the business with Vomero 5, P-6000, Shox, SuperFly, Air Max Muse and Air Max 95. “I feel like the teams are taking all the right actions against those key footwear franchises, rightsizing the inventory and getting back to running a relentless flow of innovative and coveted products,” Hill said.

As for where this is all happening, Nike’s three key countries in play under the “Win Now” strategy include the United States, China and the United Kingdom; and the five key cities are New York, Los Angeles, London, Beijing and Shanghai.

“We’ll invest to make sure each [location] has innovative and coveted product, a loud and proud locally relevant brand voice, a consumer-led and balanced integrated marketplace and passionate Nike teammates on the ground,” Hill noted. “Each country has unique dynamics and is in different states of development. China, specifically, is where we’re being the most proactive and cleaning up the marketplace and we’ll get back to inspiring the Chinese consumer in a more meaningful way.”

Going forward, Hill said that Nike is aiming to prioritize restoring its sales organization and go-to-market processes. “Partnering with Nike must feel like a world-class experience,” the CEO said. “That means building growth plans together, creating distinct consumer positions and consumer right assortments, while also engaging way earlier in the process and asking for product feedback, delivering our assortments at the right time, right place and at the right depth. [We will also be] educating their teams on new innovations, providing marketing support and making certain their Nike presentation is premium, so we capitalize on every sale opportunity.”

In Nike Direct, digital will feel the changes more quickly, Hill said. This is already in the works as Nike is reducing the promotional days and discounting at lower rates. In fact, comparing last year’s January and February to this year’s, Nike Digital in North America went from over 30 promotional days to zero, the exec noted.

Hill added that consumers and partners “felt a different pace” for Nike this quarter. “We’re off to a solid start and where we are making progress in our five priority actions, it’s mostly through serving athletes through the lens of sport and performance,” the CEO said. “That’s exactly where we want to be. The bottom line is we are looking for opportunity on all fronts. Now it’s up to us to be consistent.”",https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nike-air-max-muse.jpg?w=650,N,,2025-03-22 11:03:35.024026

Similar to J&J, Eli Lilly cited tax cut legislation passed in 2017 as factors in its U.S. investments.","Johnson & Johnson plans to boost its U.S.-based research and development, technology and manufacturing investments to more than $55 billion over the next four years.

In a March 21 press release unveiling the initiative, the New Brunswick-headquartered health care giant said the sum represents a 25% increase compared with the previous four years. The company estimated the U.S. economic impact will total more than $100 billion a year. J&J also noted it will build upon “already elevated U.S. investment levels resulting from the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.”

The announcement came the same day that J&J broke ground on a $2 billion, state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing site in Wilson, N.C. The new outpost aims to expand the company’s capacity to produce next-generation medicines for cancer, immune-mediated and neurological diseases.

Once fully operational, the 500,000-square-foot location will directly employ over 500 specialized employees and contractors, including process technicians, laboratory analysts, engineers and microbiologists. J&J also estimates the Wilson facility will generate a $3 billion impact across North Carolina during its first 10 years of operation.

Along with creating an estimated 5,000 jobs during construction, the site will bring new community partnerships to the area, including continued collaboration with the Smithsonian Science Education Center and Wilson County Schools, to bring additional STEM programming to local schools.

Johnson & Johnson will also support the implementation of the BioWork certificate program in all Wilson County high schools, in collaboration with the North Carolina Biotechnology Center and Wilson Community College. Through BioWork, students in Wilson will have an accelerated pathway to gain skills necessary to begin a career at Johnson & Johnson and other life sciences manufacturers across the state, the company said.

Other investments

With nearly two dozen facilities across the country, J&J has the biggest footprint in the U.S. when it comes to pharmaceutical manufacturing.

By 2029, the company expects to develop three new advanced manufacturing facilities and expand several existing sites across its innovative medicine and medtech businesses. However, J&J did not disclose specific details about the expansion plans or the location of its other planned facilities in its statement.

The company will also deploy technology upgrades “to help make drug discovery and development faster, support workforce training and enhance our business operations,” it said.

Additionally, “significant” resources will go toward investing in “extensive R&D infrastructure aimed at developing lifesaving and life-changing treatments in areas such as oncology, neuroscience, immunology, cardiovascular disease, and robotic surgery.”

Commenting on the campaign, J&J CEO and Chairman Joaquin Duato said it “accelerates our nearly 140-year legacy as an American innovation engine tackling the world’s toughest health care challenges.”

Reuters noted that the Trump administration’s threat of a 25% tariff on pharmaceutical imports has prompted other pharmaceutical companies, like Eli Lilly, to begin expanding domestic manufacturing operations.

The transportation and logistics giant has now lost 12.48% of its value since the beginning of the year.

The sharp decline followed the company’s announcement that it had lowered its revenue and profit forecasts for fiscal 2025, citing weaker-than-expected shipping demand and persistent economic uncertainty, reports Business Insider.

The news also weighed on the broader shipping sector, with shares of United Parcel Service (UPS) slipping 1.92% in premarket trading on Thursday. Investors remain wary of slowing business activity and weaker consumer spending, which have begun to take a toll on the transportation and logistics industry.

FedEx Revises 2025 Financial Outlook

During its earnings call, FedEx executives pointed to inflationary pressures and a sluggish U.S. industrial economy as major challenges. ""Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy, which is constraining demand for our business-to-business services,"" said John Dietrich, FedEx's executive vice president and chief financial officer.

The company now expects fiscal 2025 revenue to be slightly lower than last year, reflecting the impact of slowing demand. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are now projected to range between $18 and $18.60, down from the previous estimate of $19 to $20.

Additionally, FedEx lowered its capital expenditure outlook to $4.9 billion, signaling a more cautious approach to spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.

Broader Economic Concerns

FedEx’s revised forecast highlights growing concerns over the health of the U.S. economy. Recent economic data points to softer consumer spending, as indicated by this week’s weaker-than-expected retail sales report. Consumers appear to be cutting back on purchases amid trade war uncertainties and fears of an economic downturn.

The Federal Reserve also acknowledged these concerns this week, choosing to keep interest rates steady on Wednesday as policymakers monitor inflation and economic conditions. With FedEx seen as a bellwether for global trade, its profit warning may signal further economic turbulence ahead.

Below, Hypebeast has rounded up the top fashion stories of the week so you can stay up to date on trends in the industry.

Loewe Confirms Jonathan Anderson Is Stepping Down as Creative Director

Rumors of Jonathan Anderson‘s departure from Loewe have colored discussions around the brand for months, but now the move is confirmed. In a rather quiet exit, Loewe opted out of the Paris Fashion Week runway schedule to host a curated exhibition reprising some of Anderson’s iconic pieces like the Puzzle bag. At the time, the designer also posted a highlight-style reel reminiscing on his 12 years at Loewe, prompting further speculation of his coming departure. It wasn’t until a week later on March 17 that the brand made the news official.

As for the next creative lead for Loewe, speculation has arisen that Proenza Schouler designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez may take the helm, after having stepped down from their New York-label. However, as of the time of writing an official successor to Anderson has not been confirmed by Loewe. Whoever is appointed will have big shoes to fill — Anderson is largely credited for the historic Spanish fashion house’s rejuvenation, elevating the brand with his contemporary cache and affinity for surrealism.

Nike Expected to Post Worst Revenue Drop Since 2020 Pandemic

Nike expects the worst revenue fall since the COVID-19 pandemic that rocked the industry in 2020. According to a report from Business of Fashion (BoF), falling foot traffic, app downloads, and inventory crises are heavily impacting the brand’s performance. BoF cites data from LSEG, sharing that Nike is poised to report an 11.5% revenue decline, making it the company’s sharpest decline since the 38% drop reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Key data points that indicate Nike’s declining performance include an 11% drop in foot traffic at Nike stores (Raymond James) and a 35% drop in Nike app downloads (Sensor Tower).

Nike’s consistent struggle to get back on its feet after the pandemic prompted the recent C-Suite shake-up aimed at rehabilitating the brand. The appointment of Nike veteran Elliot Hill as CEO late last year sparked a more optimistic outlook following former CEO John Donahue’s departure. With Hill’s initiatives, including the announcement of the NikeSKIMS line, a joint venture with Kim Kardashian‘s shapewear brand aimed at offering solution-oriented activewear for women, and early 2025 sneaker drops like the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus Plus and the Vomero 18, time will tell if Nike’s reinvigorated initiatives will show on its bottom line.

Bernard Arnault Wants To Run LVMH Until He Is 85

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault has proposed a second resolution to increase the age limit of his company’s CEO seat. The 76-year-old executive, who is is currently the fifth richest man in the world, aims to hold onto his position for another he is 85. In 2022, shareholders already voted in favor of a resolution that extended the age limit from 75 to 80.

Recently, sons Alexandre Arnault and Frédéric Arnault joined the board of directors with siblings Antoine and Delphine Arnault (Head of communication, image and environment at LVMH and chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, on the board, respectively). Alexandre has been promoted to deputy CEO of Moët Hennessy, LVMH’s wines and spirits division while Frédéric got onboarded to Loro Piana as CEO. Lastly, the youngest sibling, Jean Arnault, is the director of watches at Louis Vuitton. Whether or not Bernard will stay at the helm of LVMH until he is 85 will be determined at the AGM next month.

Exclusive Jacquemus Pajamas Come With Air France’s New First-Class Amenities

A first-of-its-kind pajama collaboration with French designer Jacquemus has been unveiled in Air France’s updated La Première first-class cabin experience. Passengers flying on Air France’s La Première in Spring 2025 will receive the complementary Jacquemus-designed loungewear to wear in-flight and at home. The cotton sets are also offered in both red and blue variants, representing the classic French palette. Air France’s equestrian La Première emblem is embroidered on the breast, while dual Jacquemus and Air France tags are showcased inside the neck.

The partners have produced four different sizes and two different necklines, giving passengers the option to choose the most comfortable option. For a playful touch, the pajamas come with a red poplin bag adorned with the maison’s signature “round-square” buttons. The pajamas accompany the full revamp of the La Première cabin experience in a forthcoming selection of Boeing 777-300ERs, featuring 4 suites of 3.5 square meters.

UNIQLO’s Tate Modern Pop-up Will Celebrate the London Gallery’s 25th Anniversary

UNIQLO has been announced as an official partner for the renowned Tate Modern gallery’s 25th-anniversary celebrations to administer special programs and hold a season-long pop-up.

Some analysts also worry that Nike's big discounts on classic sneakers might harm the brand

Nike Inc.'s stock fell sharply Friday, putting it on track for a five-year low, as Wall Street grappled with the sneaker giant's warning that higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico will eat into its profit margins in the coming quarter.

Moreover, some analysts worried that Nike's (NKE) efforts to run big discounts on its classic lifestyle sneakers - like Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s and Dunks - could tarnish its image as it tries to clear the way for newer products and compete with the likes of On and Hoka.

While many companies are taking more of a wait-and-see approach to tariff costs, Nike said it expects gross margins to drop by 400 to 500 basis points in its fourth quarter, due partly to trade-policy factors. Wall Street analysts had expected a gross margin decline of about 360 basis points.

""We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico,"" the company said. Nike said it expects headwinds to revenue and gross margin to moderate afterward.

Nike's stock fell about 5.5% on Friday on the heels of the company's quarterly results, putting it on track for its lowest close since March 23, 2020, assuming the losses hold.

J.P. Morgan analyst Matthew Boss, who has a neutral rating on the stock, lowered Nike's price target to $64 from $73 and said the company faces headwinds in greater China, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

""We see an elongated timeline for Nike to re-accelerate revenue growth in the midst of a franchise product lifecycle transition with the global macro backdrop (notably headwinds in Greater China & EMEA) further complicating the path forward,"" Boss said.

Raymond James analyst Rick Patel reiterated a market-perform rating on Nike and said it ""remains a company in transition with low visibility on when or how much revenue, margins, and earnings will rebound.""

Higher costs of living over the past few years have kept consumers focused on paying for the basics, which has weighed on demand for things like sneakers. Elliott Hill, Nike's new chief executive, has said he wants to refocus the company on athletes' needs and revive shoppers' enthusiasm for new products, after a period in which Nike rolled out too many lifestyle sneakers, which are less geared toward sports.

The company is also revamping its own physical and online stores to be a destination for higher-priced shoes and other gear. And it plans to sell off many of its older lifestyle sneakers, which it wants to rely on less for sales.

Patel said that in the months ahead, many of those older sneakers would likely be cleared at a steep discount through liquidations and sales at off-price stores and elsewhere. But he said those markdowns might clash with Nike's higher-end ambitions.

""While we agree that [Nike] needs to lean more aggressively into innovation, we also worry [that] the significant discounting for classics could damage the brand,"" he said.

""Consumers seeing classics on sale for a multi-quarter period could think twice about transacting at full-price for other products (i.e., why not wait for Nike's discount?),"" he added.

BofA analysts were more upbeat. They reiterated a buy rating for Nike and said that the company's order books are beginning to draw optimism from retailers, and that its performance and innovation efforts are starting to yield green shoots.

""Retail partners are seeing pockets of improved sell-through and have confidence in the upcoming product pipeline,"" the analysts said.

For the third quarter, Nike reported a decline in gross margins of 300 basis points, to 41.5%, due to channel-mix headwinds, higher wholesale discounts, markdowns on Nike Direct, inventory obsolescence and product costs, the company said.

Including Friday's moves, Nike's stock is down 10.3% in 2025, while the S&P 500 SPX has fallen 4.5%.

Nike is facing challenges in its turnaround effort as it deals with old inventory, the impact of a trade war, and declining consumer spending. The company is striving for growth by refocusing on sports, improving retail relationships, and adjusting marketing strategies.

Nike's turnaround effort is hitting snags as the company tries to clear out old inventory while feeling the effects of a growing trade war.

The sportswear maker signaled further declines in revenue and profitability due to an ongoing merchandise reset that the company says is necessary to renew growth. Nike also expects gross margin to decline sharply in the current quarter from a year earlier, in part due to US tariffs on products from China and Mexico.

Chief executive officer Elliott Hill, a longtime Nike executive who came out of retirement to take the top role in October, is looking to guide the company back to growth after a difficult year of falling sales and corporate layoffs. He's reshaping Nike by refocusing on sports and mending relationships with its retail partners.

Nike is in the midst of clearing out stale merchandise through heavy discounting as demand fades for some of its biggest sneaker franchises, including Air Force 1s and Dunks. Inventory fell 2% in the period but Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said those levels remain ""elevated across all categories.""

The company is trying to turn things around against a backdrop of weak consumer spending and fallout from President Donald Trump's escalating trade war. China also remained a weak spot, with sales missing analyst expectations amid a prolonged consumer slump in the market. But performance in North America and the region that includes Europe, Africa and the Middle East came in better than expected.

Live Events

In the company's call with analysts, Friend said ""geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations"" are among factors creating uncertainty.

In fiscal 2024, China produced 18% of Nike-branded footwear, according to company reports. A company website shows Nike has 117 manufacturing locations in China and eight in Mexico.

Friend added that Nike will see a double-digit drop in digital traffic in the company's next fiscal year as the company transitions to a new mix of products.

Revenue fell 9% to $11.3 billion for the company's fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28, better than the 11% drop that Wall Street predicted.

The performance shows that ""a turnaround is beginning to unfold,"" said Poonam Goyal, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""But the company still has a lot of work to do to reduce inventories.""

In December, Hill outlined a plan to invigorate Nike by reorganizing around departments that focus on sports such as running, basketball and soccer. The company is also reallocating marketing funds from clicky digital ads to more anthemic sports campaigns. It spent 8% more on marketing in the latest quarter.

""It's been a tough couple of years,"" Hill said during the call. ""But what's encouraging is that in the 150 days since I've been back, we've reclaimed our identity.""

Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said the results showed Nike is having ""a good start to a two-year journey.""

With its “Win Now” strategy firmly in place, Nike’s turnaround efforts are in full swing — and its sales are suffering in the meantime. Revenue in the third quarter fell 9% year over year to $11.3 billion, with Nike’s DTC business down 12% and wholesale declining 7%, according to a company press release.

In Nike’s direct business, most of the sales declines came from digital, which fell 15% in the quarter. Stores, by contrast, were down just 2%. The retailer continues to reduce the number of promotions on its website and rebuild its relationship with wholesalers to improve both channels long term.

CEO Elliott Hill, who took on the role almost six months ago, said the retailer is also making progress on diversifying its product assortment, which was overindexed with classics like the Air Force 1, Air Jordan and Dunk.

Dive Insight:

Nike is hoping its short-term pain will lead to long-term gains, with Hill noting many of its turnaround efforts will require “multiple seasons of excellent execution.” One of those is the rightsizing of some of its biggest franchises.

Nike has accelerated its work to reduce the supply of Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1 and Dunk styles, and CFO Matt Friend said by Q4, those franchises will be down by 10 percentage points as a percent of its footwear mix. However, Hill was quick to clarify that the retailer is not sunsetting those styles, describing them as “beloved silhouettes” with strong fandoms. Rather, the retailer is “building a supporting cast” of styles to complement those.

That surprised some analysts, with BMO Capital Markets’ Simeon Siegel writing in emailed comments that many believed its Dunk franchise would be reduced to zero.

“We see this as a critical counterpoint,” Siegel said. “Yes, Dunks, AF1s and AJ1s are overstretched, but they are important and will have a recurring place in the business.”

Even as Nike focuses on revamping its footwear offerings, Hill has his eyes on the brand’s apparel assortment as well. The executive has instructed employees to look for more opportunities to innovate in apparel, a dictate that comes shortly after the retailer announced a sculpting and performance brand in partnership with Kim Kardashian’s Skims.

Hill acknowledged missteps in Nike’s relationship with wholesale partners, calling it “a bit of a surprise” that Nike was no longer working closely with them. The brand has since then moved swiftly to establish teams focused on key partners and is actively discussing growth plans and product presentation with wholesalers, Hill said.

“Partnering with Nike must feel like a world-class experience,” Hill said. In his view, that also includes consulting wholesale partners on product feedback.

With so much to work through, the retailer is prioritizing the U.S., the U.K. and China in the first stages of its turnaround. And it may be a while before results show. Needham analyst Tom Nikic noted that the retailer’s Q4 guidance was worse than expected, with revenues planned to be down in the mid-teens, and that headwinds are likely to remain through the first half of the retailer’s next fiscal year.

“While the ‘Win Now’ plan to turn around [Nike]'s flagging business appears sound, the deep-seated issues mean it will take longer to recover than expected,” Nikic said in emailed comments. “We continue to have confidence in CEO Elliott Hill, but it will take time for the bull thesis to play out.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aV6OIjq5VpEY6TabWdDzibDWFrCe7M9y5vT7euSPlh0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05ODUxNzY5Mi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-03-22 02:00:38.637587

As a result, Starbucks has increased its marketing in 2025 to strengthen its connection with both new and loyal customers. Looking ahead, the company plans to add more comfortable seating and better-designed spaces in order to make stores more appealing for people to relax, work, or meet up with others.

On the investor side, Deutsche Bank said that its recent survey showed more people plan to visit Starbucks over the next few months compared to a year ago. While the company’s turnaround is still in the early stages, the analyst noted that Starbucks is slightly more affordable than independent coffee shops for popular items like cold brew and drip coffee, even if it’s more expensive than Dunkin’ Donuts. It is also worth noting that so far in 2025, Starbucks stock is up 6.3%, which has outperformed much of the retail sector.

Is Starbucks a Buy or Sell?

Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on SBUX stock based on 17 Buys, six Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average SBUX price target of $111.64 per share implies 15% upside potential.

What We Thought of Nike’s Earnings

Although Nike NKE reported large declines in sales and earnings in its fiscal third quarter, the results were better than expected, and new CEO Elliott Hill outlined a solid plan to get the firm back on track. His “win now” plan includes actions to grow through wholesale partnerships, use e-commerce as a premium channel, increase product innovation, and strengthen ties to sports.

The strategy is being implemented in all of Nike’s key regions. It will require some significant inventory cleanup and is unlikely to pay immediate dividends in a tough global sportswear market, but we already anticipated this in our model. Thus, we do not expect to make any material change to our $112 fair value estimate and think there is an opportunity for patient investors. After an initial spike after the earnings report, Nike’s shares fell 5% during March 20 postmarket trading, likely due to its dim near-term outlook.

Nike’s sales decline of 9% in the quarter was slightly better than our estimate for an 11% fall. Nike brand sales in North America (45% of the total) slid 4%, but Greater China sales (16% of the total) missed our 9% decline projection by plummeting 17%. Nike has had sales declines in the latter region in three of the last four years, but is aggressively liquidating inventory and implementing its other win now plans to improve customer traffic in its thousands of franchised Chinese stores. We project a return to double-digit percentage sales growth in Greater China in fiscal 2027.

Despite its current challenges, Nike continues to manage its costs well and outperform on profitability. Its 7% operating margin in the quarter was poor by its usual standards, but beat our estimate by 260 basis points, nonetheless.

On Thursday, the company reported a 9% sales decline during the all-crucial holiday season quarter,— including a 17% slump in quarterly sales in China — and forecast a steeper-than-expected drop in fourth-quarter revenue.

Nike said sales will be down in the “mid-teens range” for the quarter that ends in May in an earnings call. Wall Street had expected sales to be down by 11.4%.

Hill — who took on the role in October to help the company regain lost market share — has laid out what he called a “Win Now” strategy, which includes boosting on-the-ground presence in five key cities such as Shanghai and Beijing.

“The plan is there, (but) they are just not seeing results yet,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at investment banking firm Freedom Capital Markets.

Nike stock fell as much as 9% after Friday’s opening bell — hitting its lowest level since the pandemic. Shares were down 5% in midday trading.

The Beaverton, Ore.-based company has lost 5% of its value so far this year — following a 30% plunge in 2024.

“Nike is working to return to what made it special,” wrote BMO analyst Simeon Seigel in a research note. “This is clearly not for everyone as turns take time.”

The company’s year-long struggle to reverse sliding revenues and reignite growth are deepening this year, with Nike honchos blaming weak consumer demand, a turnaround that hasn’t turned the corner yet and the impact of a 20% tariff on goods from China that went into effect at the start of March.

Nearly one quarter of Nike’s merchandise is produced in China.

“We are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence,” chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday.

Over the past several years, the company slashed the number of retailers selling its sneakers, including discounter DSW, and apparel, betting that it could sell more products in its own stores and online. It’s also facing stiff competition from newcomers, Hoka and On.

The company is bringing back some of those traditional retailers.

“Nike took it too far and underestimated the importance of third-party retailers,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients in June.

Hill has fast-tracked certain sneaker launches such as Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 that helped the company post a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue and profit.

Financial Condition/Capital Resources

During the three months ended January 31, 2025, the Company recorded a net loss of $669,216 and, as of January 31, 2025, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $50,021,874 and working capital of $2,198,641. The Company is maintaining its Woxna Graphite Mine on a ""production-ready” basis to minimize costs and is conducting ongoing research and development to produce higher value specialty products. The Company is also evaluating a potential restart of production at the Woxna Graphite Mine. The Company anticipates that it has sufficient funding to meet anticipated levels of corporate administration and overheads for the ensuing twelve months however, it will need additional capital to provide working capital and recommence operations at the Woxna Graphite Mine, to fund future development of the Norra Karr Property or to complete exploration activities in Romania. There is no assurance such additional capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. In the longer term the recoverability of the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets is dependent upon the Company’s ability to preserve its interest in the underlying mineral property interests, the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, the achievement of profitable operations and the ability of the Company to obtain financing to support its ongoing exploration programs and mining operations.

Outlook

In today’s world, one message rings clear for critical raw materials—security of supply is paramount. With rising geopolitical tensions and the increasing weaponization of trade through tariffs and export restrictions, the urgency to establish short, regional supply chains has never been greater.

Woxna stands at the forefront of this shift, positioned for a potential production restart—a move that aligns with possible forward integration opportunities. Importantly, the Company believes this restart could be financed with Green Transition funding.

Momentum for Swedish graphite is also growing. In October, Talga Group secured a €70 million EU Innovation Fund grant for its Luleå Anode Refinery, a key component of its Vittangi Anode Project. Adding further support, Sweden’s Minister for Energy, Business, and Industry, Ebba Busch, has in recent months underscored the importance of domestic graphite, stating:

""We have large graphite deposits in Sweden that could account for much of what we [Sweden] and Europe need for our cars and batteries.""

Woxna has been maintained in production-ready status for years, and now, the Company is growing in confidence that its strategic investment in care and maintenance could be about to pay off. The future is looking brighter.

Considering Norra Kärr, before the end of March, the Company expects a decision by the EU on Strategic Project status; a designation that would set a clear 27-month permitting timeline and facilitate access to finance. Given today’s geopolitical landscape—including the U.S. President’s push to secure critical raw materials like rare earth elements—it is hard to envision a scenario where Norra Kärr is not recognized as vital to Europe’s supply security. With or without Strategic Project status, Norra Kärr will remain the most advanced HREE project in Europe and a significant part of the solution for the EU’s supply overdependence on China.

Meanwhile, the Company is advancing a Rapid Development Plan to meet Europe’s urgent demand for HREEs. Fast-tracking development is no longer an option—it’s a necessity.

By separating extraction from downstream processing, operations at Norra Kärr have been streamlined. The project now functions much like a quarry, with on-site extraction and physical processing producing two high-value products: a HREE magnetic concentrate and nepheline syenite, an industrial mineral previously explored at Norra Kärr by Boliden in the 1970s.

The Company remains committed to accelerating progress, engaging key stakeholders, and exploring all avenues to bring Norra Kärr into production as swiftly as possible.

To accelerate the programme at Bihor Sud, since the start of the year, the Company has hired four new geologists, and in February, a new drill contractor started drilling in gallery G2. The Contractor has been given an initial 1,500 m programme, with the Company’s geological team mapping G2 and taking channel samples for assay to provide the necessary data to validate each drillhole location.

Woxna Graphite Mine

Security of Supply

The drive for secure and stable supply chains is shaping the European natural graphite market, bringing existing production assets like Woxna into focus. Woxna is free to serve both the anode and industrial markets and could be positioned as a key regional supplier.

On 9 February, the IEA published a commentary ‘Growing geopolitical tensions underscore the need for stronger action on critical minerals security’. In the coverage, the IEA commented that ‘Today's markets may be relatively well supplied, but security of supply is far from guaranteed. Trade restrictions affecting critical minerals have proliferated, notably in the form of export controls applied by China’ and in the case of natural graphite ‘Reliance on a small number of suppliers increases vulnerability to shocks and disruptions, even in a well-supplied market’.

Rising Demand

On January 30, 2025, Benchmark Minerals Intelligence published research highlighting the 140% projected growth in natural graphite demand by 2030, requiring an additional 1.7 million tonnes. Their calculations suggest that at least 31 new mines must come online worldwide. However, while anode, cathode, and cell capacity can be developed in less than five years, establishing a new raw material supply chain can take up to 25 years, underscoring the need for immediate action.

Policy Momentum in the European Union

Last year marked a turning point for European raw materials policy, with the EU taking decisive steps to secure domestic supply chains. On March 18, 2024, the European Council adopted the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), a key initiative aimed at developing and supporting critical raw materials projects across the region. This policy shift strengthens the case for utilizing existing, permitted graphite resources within Europe.

Woxna’s Strategic Positioning

Woxna is among the few fully built and permitted natural graphite mines in the region. With its established infrastructure, resources, and strategic location, Woxna is well-positioned to play a significant role in regional natural graphite production.

Pathway to Production Restart

In recent months, interest in restarting Woxna’s production has grown. An in-house study conducted in early 2022 evaluated processing plant upgrades to produce high-quality flake graphite concentrate for the market. This study will be updated in the second quarter. The Company believes the updated business plan could support discussions around project financing, customer pre-payments, and potential Swedish or European public funding.

Opportunities for Forward Integration

Beyond production, the Company sees potential for moving downstream and collaborating with off takers to add value through further processing. Such agreements would provide offtakes with a secure and stable graphite supply, reinforcing their ability to meet end-user demands.

Anode Project 2021 – A Future Option

While the Anode Project 2021 remains a viable long-term opportunity, it is not currently being pursued. The Company’s primary focus remains on a sustainable restart of Woxna’s production and securing the mine’s role in the European natural graphite supply chain.

Norra Kärr Heavy Rare Earth Element (""HREE”) Project

A decision on the Company’s application for Strategic Project status under the Critical Raw Materials Act (""CRMA”) is expected before the end of March. Pre-feasibility study (""PFS”) work for the upstream and downstream will commence in the second quarter. The Company expects a decision on its application for a new Exploitation Concession (""Bearbetningskoncession”) 25-year mining lease later in the year.

Testwork is being carried out on nepheline syenite and aegirine to determine their mineralogy, chemical composition, and leachate chemistry. The results will support further assessment of the market opportunities for nepheline syenite, and possibly aegirine, and the potential environmental impact of any waste materials.

Company has started discussions with nepheline syenite market participants to identify attractive market segments, volumes and pricing. In the Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in 2021 (""PEA 2021”), three nepheline syenite markets were selected, those requiring the least amount of additional processing and product qualification, with pricing ranging from US$12-65 per tonne. These assumptions were conservative, and the Company is now investigating higher value markets such as functional filler products with comparable prices at the time of US$100-500 per tonne. In the PEA2021, nepheline syenite contributed 11% of the total revenues when using conservative prices. There is the potential for significant upside in pricing and revenue contribution to the overall project economics.

As part of the PFS, the Company will evaluate the business case for a Rapid Development Plan (""RDP”), whereby Norra Kärr can be in production in the shortest possible timeframe to be supplying REE concentrates to the market in advance of the completion of the downstream processing facility and selling nepheline syenite. This will generate cashflow and mean earlier delivery of REE concentrates onto the European market. Capacity for processing REE concentrates in the region is being developed and this gives the Company options for the downstream.

Bihor Sud Nickel-Cobalt Exploration Project

To accelerate the programme at Bihor Sud, since the start of the year, the Company has hired four new geologists and, in February, a new drill contractor started drilling in gallery G2. The Contractor has been given an initial 1,500 m programme, with the Company’s geological team mapping G2 and taking channel samples for assay to provide the necessary data to validate each drillhole location.

Bihor Sud remains a very exciting brownfield exploration project. It’s a historic mining area with tens of kilometers of underground galleries, or tunnels, developed in the licence area. Between the 1960-90s the responsible division of the Romanian State only targeted what was then called ‘strategic metals’, principally uranium, and explored for nothing else.

The Company’s objective at Bihor Sud, is to define a large-scale, mineable mineral resource. Initially, we are following-up on the work done in gallery G7 last year, and the extensive Cobalt-Nickel-Gold mineralized zone that was identified, and in the new year started to drill in gallery G2 which has shown its potential for extensive Zinc-Lead-Copper-Silver mineralization. We are encouraged by the findings to date, which highlight the strong potential for discovering a significant polymetallic deposit.

Financial Information

The report for three months ending April 30, 2025, is expected to be published on or about June 20, 2025.

In order to combat the spread of COVID-19 governments worldwide have enacted emergency measures including travel bans, legally enforced or self-imposed quarantine periods, social distancing and business and organization closures. These measures have caused material disruptions to businesses, governments and other organizations resulting in an economic slowdown and increased volatility in national and global equity and commodity markets. The Company has implemented safety and physical distancing procedures, including working from home where possible and ceased all travel, as recommended by the various governments.

The company is working to bring back the café atmosphere by encouraging customers to stay longer in its stores.

One big shift has been a rise in customers choosing to sit and enjoy their drinks using ceramic mugs or glasses (up over 300% in recent weeks), according to data shared with Axios. The company is working to bring back the café atmosphere by encouraging customers to stay longer in its stores.

Niccol’s strategy also includes simplifying the menu, speeding up checkout times, reintroducing condiment bars, and offering free refills for customers who dine in. As a result, Starbucks has increased its marketing in 2025 to strengthen its connection with both new and loyal customers. Looking ahead, the company plans to add more comfortable seating and better-designed spaces in order to make stores more appealing for people to relax, work, or meet up with others.

On the investor side, Deutsche Bank said that its recent survey showed more people plan to visit Starbucks over the next few months compared to a year ago. While the company’s turnaround is still in the early stages, the analyst noted that Starbucks is slightly more affordable than independent coffee shops for popular items like cold brew and drip coffee, even if it’s more expensive than Dunkin’ Donuts. It is also worth noting that so far in 2025, Starbucks stock is up 6.3%, which has outperformed much of the retail sector.

Is Starbucks a Buy or Sell?

Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on SBUX stock based on 17 Buys, six Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average SBUX price target of $111.64 per share implies 15% upside potential.

At the company's recent annual meeting, CEO Brian Niccol shared that initial feedback to the Back to Starbucks changes has been positive.

On the analyst side, Deutsche Bank reported that interest in returning to Starbucks has grown. A proprietary survey showed stronger purchase intent among respondents for the next three to six months compared with early 2024.

Still, analyst Lauren Silberman noted that while progress is evident, the turnaround is just beginning, and broader economic pressures remain. Interestingly, Starbucks' prices for cold brew and drip coffee are lower on average than those at independent cafes, though they still exceed prices at Dunkin'.

One visible shift: more customers are choosing to stay in-store. Starbucks told Axios that the number of U.S. patrons opting for ceramic mugs or glasses has jumped over 300% in recent weeks.

Niccol's strategy includes simplifying the menu, speeding up checkout, reintroducing condiment bars, and offering free refills to customers who linger. The company has also increased marketing efforts this year, targeting deeper engagement with new and returning customers. Future store enhancements will include more inviting seating areas designed for comfort, work, and conversation.
