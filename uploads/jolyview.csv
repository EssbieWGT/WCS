CVS confirmed to FOX Business that it will open at least a dozen smaller format locations in select communities across the country over the next year.
However, the company said it is still opening up traditional CVS Pharmacy locations, which contain a full front store and pharmacy.
In addition to the new small-format pharmacies, the company is planning to open nearly 30 CVS Pharmacy locations, including those inside Target stores, this year.
Leventhal believes the CVS new store formats could help the company become less reliant on front-of-store customer traffic.","CVS Pharmacy is expanding its footprint. But a major focus is on smaller store formats exclusively offering pharmacy services.

The shift to small-format stores comes as the industry works to rightsize and reduce costs in response to ongoing challenges, including intense competition and shifting consumer preferences.

CVS confirmed to FOX Business that it will open at least a dozen smaller format locations in select communities across the country over the next year.

The new pharmacies, which will average less than 5,000 square feet, will feature a full-service pharmacy with limited over-the-counter products available for purchase and will be designed to meet the communitys specific pharmacy needs.

WALGREENS TO GO PRIVATE IN $10B DEAL

""By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, were continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patient and ensure the right geographic coverage,"" a CVS spokesperson told FOX Business.

However, the company said it is still opening up traditional CVS Pharmacy locations, which contain a full front store and pharmacy. In addition to the new small-format pharmacies, the company is planning to open nearly 30 CVS Pharmacy locations, including those inside Target stores, this year.

Emarketer senior analyst Rajiv Leventhal told FOX Business that the retail plus pharmacy business model has been difficult for companies like CVS and Walgreens to successfully operate as people increasingly turn to online channels for household items.

The growing number of closures at CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens in recent years highlights how the industry is attempting to right-size itself after rapidly expanding its footprint. CVS has shuttered hundreds of stores and laid off staff in order to re-prioritize its investments and adhere to the changing customer needs. Between 2022 and 2024, it closed 900 stores, and opened 100 new locations. It plans to close an additional 270 in 2025.

WHY NEIGHBORHOOD PHARMACIES ARE CLOSING

In 2023, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy and launched a store optimization plan, closing 154 locations. Then, in 2024, Walgreens announced plans to close at least 1,200 stores over the next three years in an effort to reduce costs and turn around its operations. Walgreens has not commented on whether this timeline will change now that the company is going private. Last week, Walgreens, once a $100 billion business, agreed to sell to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal valued at 10% of that, about $10 billion.

Leventhal expects this move to accelerate, and potentially increase, the number of store closures. He predicts that major companies like Walgreens and CVS will continue closing many of their stores while focusing more on pharmacy services in the locations they keep open.

""Consumers are prioritizing price, speed, and convenience above all. Drugstores locking up items to prevent theft further frustrates shoppers and causes many to abandon in-store purchases,"" Leventhal said. However, he underscored that CVS and Walgreens recent retail pharmacy struggles are much more about the front of the store than behind the pharmacy counter.

""Patients will always need their medications, and CVS and Walgreens rank first and second in US pharmacy size as measured by total prescription revenues,"" Leventhal added.

Leventhal believes the CVS new store formats could help the company become less reliant on front-of-store customer traffic. He also suggests this model could empower pharmacists to play a larger role in patients healthcare decisions.

""Doubling down on the steadier businessprescription and over-the-counter medicationsis a savvy play,"" he said.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/03/1280/720/cvs-pharmacy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,05:26.6

After nearly eight and a half decades of being America's favorite fast-food chain, McDonald's has been struggling with a slowdown in sales. This is partly due to growing competition, price increases caused by inflation, and changes in its DEI practices, which have caused persistent backlash and boycotts.

Nonetheless, McDonald's refuses to let all these setbacks hinder its decades-old business or allow its rivals to dethrone it from its highly coveted position.

McDonald's develops a multi-year strategy to accelerate growth

Since announcing its first Accelerating the Arches growth strategy in 2020, which focused on McDonald's (MCD) purpose, mission, values, growth pillars, and foundation of running its restaurants, it has seen immense improvements in its business.

According to the company, McDonald's has grown its digital footprint to over 175 million 90-day active users across 60 markets, generating around $30 billion in systemwide sales to loyalty members in 2024. The fast food chain has also expanded its restaurants faster and introduced global menu innovations worldwide.

However, with the ever-evolving market and consumer trends, maintaining the same growth strategy for multiple years seemed to no longer do it for McDonald's.

Quick-service restaurants have begun specializing in a single product as their main selling point to accelerate growth in record time. They focus on what they do best to dominate that specific market.

Some of McDonald's biggest rivals successfully executing this strategy include Chick-fil-A, which focuses on chicken-based menu items; Dutch Bros, which focuses on beverages; and In-N-Out Burger, which focuses on its burgers.

McDonald's introduces the launch of new specialized teams to compete with its biggest rivals

Unlike many of its rivals, McDonald's refuses to let increased competition dominate the market. Instead of blaming others, it has taken action to fight back against its fast-growing rivals.

On Mar. 11, McDonald's introduced the new Restaurant Experience Team, which brings together operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to execute new innovative ideas and optimize efficiency.

In 2024, J&J generated significantly more sales than any company in the life sciences industry at $88.8 billion, which was a 4.3% increase year over year.
In 2023, J&J realized a 6.5% increase in revenue.
The graph shows that $100 invested in J&J back in 2019 would have been worth about $115 in 2024.","In his third year as the CEO of Johnson & Johnson, Joaquin Duato received an overall compensation package worth $24.3 million. It was a 14% decrease from his $28.4 million figure in 2023, when he was the worlds highest-paid Big Pharma chief executive.

The reduction is due largely to calculations surrounding changes in the CEO's pension value from year to year. While his estimated pension value grew by $6.2 million in 2023, the increase was $2.7 million in 2024, according (PDF) to a regulatory filing.

Duato, 62, also saw decreases in his bonusfrom $4.4 million in 2023 to $4 million last yearand in his equity awards, which fell from $16 million to $15.7 million from year to year.

J&J also reported that it spent $145,381 on Duatos use of personal aircraft and $102,779 on home security services last year.

Still, the company has continued to struggle in resolving its talc litigationwhich is now in its third bankruptcy effort. In its proxy, J&J said that it recorded an accounting charge of $5.1 billion related to talc matters in 2024.

J&J added that it determined it was in the best interest of the company and shareholders to exclude the $5.1 billion talc settlement charge from its executive compensation considerations.

""The underlying events and decisions that resulted in the talc-related litigation charges occurred before company executives assumed their current roles,"" the company explained. ""Company executives have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the litigation on behalf of the company and shareholders.""

In addition, a graph charting shareholder returns for peer group companies shows J&Js returns declining over the past two years while returns for J&Js peer group companies have increased.

The graph shows that $100 invested in J&J back in 2019 would have been worth about $115 in 2024. But for an index of other large-cap pharma companies, the number was $155.

Duato took the helm at J&J at the start of 2022, succeeding Alex Gorsky, who guided the company for a decade. During his tenure, Gorsky twice collected more than $29 million in annual compensation. In his final year (2021), Gorsky was the highest-paid Big Pharma exec at $26.7 million.

Among other J&J execs, chief financial officer Joseph Wolk saw his compensation decline from $13.9 million to $12.6 million from 2023 to 2024.

McDonald's takes years to introduce new burgers, its CEO says, and he wants to change that.

The chain's chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, said he wants to speed up the process of introducing new burgers and improving existing signature burgers. He made these comments in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on Tuesday.

Kempczinski says he's switching things up in leadership and operations to make the company move faster. Part of that involves changing the job scopes of his leadership team to roll out new technology and products to its restaurants faster.

Jill McDonald, who heads the company's international division, has been tapped to be the chain's first chief restaurant experience officer starting May 1. McDonald is a retail veteran, having held top roles at Marks and Spencer and Costa Coffee.

She'll lead the team responsible for the company's innovation, supply chains, and operations.

""I wanted one person who's actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the restaurant general manager,"" Kempczinski said to the Journal.

He did not elaborate on how else he would speed up the burger development process. Representatives for McDonald's did not respond to a query from Business Insider on the topic, sent outside regular business hours.

In the interview, Kempczinski also hinted at a more extensive drinks menu. He said he would get executives to focus exclusively on beverage development.

He said this would help the company find a way to keep customers in store and buying their drinks rather than going to competitors.

""We just need to make sure that our menu offering doesn't give somebody a reason why they come to us for their food and they maybe go to the place next door to go get the beverage,"" Kempczinski said.

Kempczinski's comments come as the chain posted stagnant financial results in 2024. The chain's global comparable sales declined 0.1% in 2024. It reported a full-year revenue of $25.92 billion.

When markets closed on Tuesday, McDonald's stock traded at $306.8. It has risen about 4% in the past year.

The fast food industry is facing a wave of cost-conscious consumers in the US who are put off by rising fast food product prices. Some are opting to eat at home.

McDonald's, for its part, has doubled down on cheap meals to attract frugal customers. In a February earnings call, Kempczinski said its $5 meal deals in the US were working.",https://i.insider.com/67d0f30ab8b41a9673fa5a68?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,09:01.4

In 2022, Kraft Heinz embarked on a significant expansion project at its manufacturing facility in Garland, Texas, USA.
In 2022, Kraft Heinz also expanded its global operations by acquiring an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH.
In 2024, Kraft Heinz reported progress in its transformation journey, emphasising innovation in flavour, snacking and easy meals.
Additionally, Kraft Heinz expanded the use of its condiments beyond traditional pairings, targeting foods like burritos and tacos.","COVID-19 profoundly impacted global manufacturing, disrupting supply chains, changing the landscape of consumer demand and prompting operational shifts to comply with social distancing guidelines.

We saw the US auto industry experience a notable downturn, with car sales as of yet not returning to 2019 levels.

In Germany, almost 250,000 manufacturing jobs were lost as industries invested heavily in automation.

For Kraft Heinz, the pandemic presented opportunities and challenges.

It mandated social distancing guidelines and pursued key protocols to reduce the spread of the disease, whilst working to strategically adapt to dramatic changes in demand.

With the shift to a 'stay at home' economy and the rise of consumer panic buying in preparation for lockdowns, the manufacturer experienced an unprecedented surge in demand for products like Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Heinz Ketchup, Maxwell House Coffee and Oscar Mayer hot dogs.

To meet this demand, Kraft Heinz adapted and enhanced its resiliency.

All US factories operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week to produce the aforementioned products- an unprecedented level of operation, far greater than typical seasonal demand.

This was possible due to Kraft Heinz's workforce, who showed up ensure a steady food supply during the crisis- employee attendance rates at the manufacturer's factories were among the best in recent years.

The result was that factories like Kraft Heinz's Iowa plant, responsible for producing Oscar Mayer cold cuts, achieved record outputs during the pandemic.

Kraft Heinz has since built on this growth by enhancing its production capabilities and modernising its manufacturing and distribution centres.

This expansion, growing since 2020, is also a reflection of Kraft Heinz's strategic adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies like automation and AI.

Here are just a few examples of how Kraft Heinz has successfully grown since the pandemic.

In 2021 Manufacturing Digital reported on Kraft Heinz's 140 million ( US$189m) investment in its Kitt Green plant near Wigan, UK, Europe's largest food manufacturing facility.

Last year this factory - in a project pursued in collaboration with Carlton Power - became a green hydrogen project, enabling Kraft Heinz to fuel over 50% of the site using hydrogen.

This project is anticipated to finish in 2026.

Kraft Heinz's 2021 investment was the company's most substantial investment in an existing manufacturing site outside the United States in over two decades.

The Kitt Green facility produces approximately 1.3 billion cans of food annually, including iconic products like Heinz Beanz, soups and pasta, with 94% consumed within the UK.

The investment aimed to modernise the site's manufacturing capabilities over four years, focusing on three key areas:

Repatriating sauce production: Bringing the manufacturing of Heinz sauces such as ketchup, mayonnaise and salad cream back to the UK to enhance European capacity.

Upgrading machinery: Implementing state-of-the-art equipment to improve efficiency and product quality.

Enhancing sustainability: Aligning with environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) commitments by reducing the use of non-renewable resources and lowering the facility's carbon footprint.

This modernisation was expected to created 50 new full-time positions and provide upskilling opportunities for existing staff.

The initiative underscored Kraft Heinz's confidence in the UK's post-Brexit economy and its commitment to supporting local manufacturing, inspiring further expansion abroad.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz embarked on a significant expansion project at its manufacturing facility in Garland, Texas, USA.

This initiative involved a capital investment of US$143m, aimed at modernising and upgrading the plant's production capabilities. #

The expansion plans included the addition of two to three new production lines and the modernisation of existing ones.

This development was projected to create approximately 200 new jobs, increasing the facility's workforce to around 1,500 employees.

The project was scheduled to span three years, commencing in 2022 and concluding in 2026.

Kraft Heinz also began a 70 million (US$82.6m) expansion of its manufacturing site in Alfaro, La Rioja, Spain in 2021.

This investment increased the factory's capacity by 50%, enhancing its position as one of the company's most efficient facilities in Europe.

The expansion included the addition of a state-of-the-art processing plant and was expected to generate 39 new permanent jobs in the region.

The Alfaro plant produces a range of Heinz sauces for both local and European markets and processes approximately 25,000 tonnes of locally grown tomatoes annually for the company's Orlando brand.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz also expanded its global operations by acquiring an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH.

Established in 2014, Just Spices is a direct-to-consumer company offering over 170 products, including spice blends, salad dressings and organic options.

Approximately 70% of its sales are online, with the remainder through retailers in Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland.

This acquisition aligned with Kraft Heinz's strategy to enhance its direct-to-consumer capabilities and strengthen its presence in the taste elevation market, enabling the company to greater diversify.

In July 2023, Kraft Heinz announced a substantial investment exceeding US$400m to construct a 775,000 square-foot automated distribution centre in DeKalb, Illinois.

This facility was designed to enhance supply chain efficiencies and expedite product distribution to retail and foodservice customers across North America.

Equipped with state-of-the-art automation technology and national railway access, the centre handles more than 60% of the company's foodservice business and approximately 30% of all dry goods.

The project created more than 150 jobs in the region and aligns with Kraft Heinz's environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) goals by implementing sustainable technologies to minimise environmental impact.

In May 2024, Kraft Heinz Canada and Highbury Canco extended their partnership agreement for another four years, ensuring continued production at the Leamington, Ontario facility until the end of 2027.

This extension marked the third consecutive renewal of their collaboration, underscoring the importance of the Leamington plant in Kraft Heinz's operations.

The 2.1-million-square-foot facility employs over 600 Canadians and produces popular products such as Heinz beans, Heinz tomato juice and Classico pasta sauce.

The estimated retail value of products to be produced at this facility over the next four years exceeds US$1bn.

In 2024, Kraft Heinz reported progress in its transformation journey, emphasising innovation in flavour, snacking and easy meals.

The manufacturer introduced new ketchup flavours, including a spicy variant in the US and a pickle-infused option for a tangy taste.

Additionally, Kraft Heinz expanded the use of its condiments beyond traditional pairings, targeting foods like burritos and tacos.

In the easy meals segment, the company launched Heinz Curry Beanz, which generated 60% incrementality and attracted new customers to the category.

Convenience was further enhanced with Heinz Beans snap-pots for microwave use and frozen Kraft Mac & Cheese options.

These initiatives aimed to meet modern consumer demands and strengthen Kraft Heinz's market position.

In addition to producing a range of Heinz sauces for local and European consumption, the Alfaro plant processes around 25,000 tons of locally grown tomatoes each year for the companys market-leading Orlando brand.

Spain is a key production centre for Heinz in Europe and boosting capability in the region brings the company closer to its ambition to lead the future of food.

This journey not only highlights Kraft Heinz's successful manufacturing strategy of continual expansion and diversification, but also how critical their response was during the pandemic.

SocGen CEO pledges cost cuts to boost efficiency

Socit Gnrale chief executive Slawomir Krupa has pledged to slash costs at the French bank, declaring that nothing is sacred as he seeks to improve efficiency and reduce its high cost base.

In an interview with the Financial Times published on Tuesday, Krupa described SocGen as having lower levels of efficiency than its peers and an overspend problem that needed to be addressed.

At the end of 2024, the banks cost-to-income ratio stood at 69 per cent, one of the highest among major European lenders, though it had fallen by five percentage points compared with the previous year. SocGen has previously said it was targeting a cost-to-income ratio of below 60 per cent by 2026.

As part of his restructuring plans launched in September 2023, Krupa has overseen job cuts and the disposal of non-core businesses in an effort to strengthen capital reserves. He said that IT spending could be further reduced and that decreasing the banks dependence on external consultants could further lower its cost base.

Krupa told the FT that the bank had incurred colossal restructuring costs, amounting to 613mn last year, but noted these were disappearing progressively.

His initial strategy was met with scepticism from investors, but confidence has since improved, with SocGens share price climbing over 70 per cent in the past year.

Net-Zero Banking Alliance members to vote on abandoning 1.5C pledge

The Net-Zero Banking Alliance is set to ask its members, which include HSBC and Barclays, to vote on whether to abandon a commitment to align their $54tn in assets with the Paris agreements goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C.

The vote, reported by the Financial Times on Tuesday, comes as the NZBA seeks to retain members following a wave of exits by major US banks.

Since the election of Donald Trump as US president, 14 leading US banks, including Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan, have withdrawn from the group, arguing they cannot decarbonise their lending and investment portfolios at a pace faster than the broader economy.

The NZBA is now contending with similar warnings from Europe. The FT previously reported that a coalition of leading European banks has threatened to exit unless the group relaxes its rules.

Under the revised proposal, members would pledge to align their activities with the less stringent target of keeping global warming well below 2C while making efforts to limit it to 1.5C.

US recession risk now at 40%, warns JPMorgan economist

JPMorgans chief economist, Bruce Kasman, warned on Wednesday that the risk of a US recession has risen to 40 per cent from 30 per cent at the start of the year, citing political uncertainty and trade policies as potential threats to the countrys appeal as an investment destination.

Where we stand now is with a heightened concern about the US economy, Kasman said in comments reported by Reuters.

JPMorgan currently projects US GDP growth of 2 per cent in 2025. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have both lowered their US growth forecasts to 1.7 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively.

Kasman warned that if President Donald Trumps proposed reciprocal tariffs, set to take effect in April, are fully implemented, the risk of a US recession could rise to 50 per cent or higher.

If we would continue down this road of what would be more disruptive, business-unfriendly policies, I think the risks on that recession front would go up, he said.

ICBC launches $11bn tech fund to boost Chinas private sector

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China announced on Wednesday that it has launched an Rmb80bn ($11bn) technology and innovation fund to support the countrys private economy.

The fund will focus on hard technology sectors such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing, rather than soft technology like internet services, according to a statement from the state-owned bank.

ICBC chair Liao Lin said the bank would thoroughly implement directives from central leadership by turning supportive policies into concrete actions for private enterprises.

He said that the fund is designed as patient capital, prioritising long-term investment over short-term gains.

The announcement follows Chinas annual parliamentary meeting last week, where policymakers set their key priorities for 2025.

This month, Wellvana paid an undisclosed sum to buy CVS Health's Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO operations in a transaction that also made the Aetna parent company a minority shareholder in Wellvana.

Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program, providers form groups of ACOs and take on risk for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. These partnerships often contract with companies such Wellvana, which can pocket savings they help generate.

Wellvana already works with providers assuming risk under the fee-for-service Medicare ACO Realizing Equity, Access and Community Health, or ACO REACH, model and contracts with Medicare Advantage insurers such as Humana and Centene.

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Why did you make the Medicare Shared Savings Program deal?

We've been going very deep in supporting practices and providing a lot of tech-enabled services. That could be scheduling, value-based care, education and medical management for patients, whereas CVS built scale and has a lighter-touch model. These models make a great marriage and give providers flexibility. Not all providers are going to want the same type of service or the same level of service.

Scale also brings predictability. Predictability enables us to invest more in our provider relationships. It allows us to invest in medical management, invest in documentation, and invest in services and education.

The combined company has about $12.5 billion in medical spending under management and we have approximately 1 million patient lives associated with that medical spend. We have 500 accountable care organization clients. Those clients are a combination of large hospitals, primary care providers or independent physician practices. We now have 300-plus team members and brought about 150 CVS employees into the company through the acquisition.

Are you eyeing additional acquisitions?

We certainly want to continue to partner with additional health systems, primary care and independent providers, and also Medicare Advantage payers. As we look at our network, there is a significant opportunity to expand within our existing provider partners into Medicare Advantage.

What is your outlook for Medicare Advantage under President Donald Trump?

We're bullish long-term. If you look at the growth within the program over the past decade, it's hard to deny the value proposition that patients are seeing in the program. We expect it to continue to grow.

Patients need to have optionality. We're pretty diversified between traditional Medicare programs, like ACO REACH or Medicare Shared Savings Program, and the Medicare Advantage side. That diversification is important. We want our business to look like the panel of our providers.

Regardless of the administration, we do think the Medicare Advantage industry has good tailwinds.

ACO REACH is scheduled to sunset in 2026. How do you feel about its future?

We're optimistic about the program. Medicare set a goal for 100% of patients to be tied to value by 2030. ACO REACH is a key part of that. It's up to 2.5 million lives in the program. It's a pretty significant scale in a pretty short period.

Whether the ACO REACH program becomes permanent, or whether there are higher levels of risk incorporated into the Medicare Shared Savings Program, we feel optimistic that higher levels of risk in traditional Medicare will continue to happen.

Do you assume risk for pharmacy and supplemental benefit costs in your contracts with Medicare Advantage insurers?

We do not take risk on Part D prescription drug benefits today. We're not taking pharmaceutical risk unless it's hitting under Part B for provider-infused drugs, which is only a small percentage of pharmaceutical costs. We do assume risk today on supplemental benefits. It's something that we will continue to evaluate and see if that makes sense for us.

We used to take risk in pharmacy. But with the changes in the Inflation Reduction Act and the uncertainty associated with that in terms of the cost, that is something that we moved away from.",https://s3-prod.modernhealthcare.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/Kyle-Wailes-Wellvana-0325.png,N,,06:16.0

The company faces challenges in the extremities market, with a focus on building clinical evidence before aggressively pursuing revenue growth.

There is a delay in expected milestone payments from the Checkmate asset, pushing potential pre-commercial milestones to 2031-2032.

Kuros Biosciences Ltd (CSBTF) is investing heavily in infrastructure and extremities, which may eat into EBITDA margins in the short term.

A: Chris Fair, CEO, explained that the growth is driven by the strategic agreement with Medtronic, which has opened over 100 opportunities. The timeline from opportunity to impact is typically four to six months. International expansion and methodical growth in the extremities market are also key factors. The partnership with Medtronic will help accelerate growth in the extremities market by providing quicker access to surgeons.

Q: How is the partnership with Medtronic progressing, and what impact does it have on revenue?

A: Chris Fair stated that Medtronic is a tremendous partner, drawn to Kuros by their clinical evidence. The partnership is in early stages, with opportunities being presented regularly. While specific revenue contributions from Medtronic are not disclosed, the goal is to grow together, leveraging Medtronic's market share to benefit both parties.

Q: What is the strategy for penetrating the foot and ankle market, and how quickly can Kuros achieve significant market share?

A: Chris Fair mentioned that Kuros can grow the extremities business faster than the spine business due to existing hospital registrations. The focus is on building clinical evidence and establishing relationships with key opinion leaders. The second phase, involving greater market penetration, is expected in the second half of the year.

Q: What are the expectations for profitability in 2025, and how will it develop?

A: Daniel Geiger, CFO, indicated that Kuros is in a growth phase, investing in infrastructure and the extremities market. The aim is to at least match the 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9%, with potential gradual improvements. Key factors include maintaining a 90% gross margin and optimizing sales and marketing expenses.

Q: Why is Kuros switching its reporting currency from CHF to USD?

A: Daniel Geiger explained that USD is the primary currency for internal budgeting and performance measurement, as most revenues are generated in USD. The switch also aligns with the expanded institutional investor base and facilitates communication with international investors. There are no current plans for a US listing.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000WYP.png?5,N,,06:51.5

Privia Health Q4 2024 Earnings Call: Key Takeaways & Outlook for 2025

How does Privia Health make money?

Privias model is pretty interesting. It works across all payors and all payment models (fee for service, MSSP, capitation). In 2024 you can see Privia shied away from full risk (capitation) given MA headwinds and unfavorable environment.

Privia management echoed as much on their 4th quarter earnings call: Privia is after delivering the most value to its primary stakeholders: physicians (and by extension, patients)  and Privia wants to maximize its ability to provide value to those physicians, similar to most other firms in the enablement/MSO space.

So, Privia can benefit both from (1) a high utilization environment through FFS revenue and (2) markets or conditions where its appropriate to take risk and expand that book of business.

We continue to expect headwinds in Medicare Advantage over the next few years, given pressures from elevated utilization trends, phase-in of V28 through 2026 and changes in star scores among other factors. However, the diversification of previous value-based care contracts gives us confidence in our ability to build scale and profitability across the business despite challenges in any one particular programUltimately, our goal is consistent and sustainable earnings growth for all medical groups and shareholders year after year.  Parth Mehrotra

In 2024, Privia Health closed out the year on a strong note, exceeding the high end of all guidance metrics and setting the stage for continued growth in 2025. Privia signed above the high end of its implemented providers (a key economic signal for Privias overall business) range  4,789 in total.

Privias current footprint includes 14 states and 1,200 care locations:

2. Revenue Growth and Payer Mix: Diversification Mitigates Medicare Advantage Pressures

Capitated revenue book showed a 2% positive contribution margin, though the Privia team still wants to be pretty conservative around committing fully to downside risk as mentioned. Value-based care diversification across commercial and government contracts provided resilience against sector-wide headwinds. Privia also noted its not expecting any sort of bump in growth from its shared savings book of business in 2025 based on ongoing pressures in MA.

This quote on propensity for Privia to take risk is one Parth Mehrotra reiterates often, and its a great way to look at value-based care as a whole and every stakeholder having skin in the game  over and over, Privia mentions their preference for shared risk being the right approach to value-based care:

you have to distinguish between the willingness to take risk and the ability to take risk. Weve always had the ability to take risk. We do so at the highest level in MSSP as you know. We do capitation in MA with a small book. I dont think providers wake up every day saying we want to do full risk. I think theres a lot of noise in the space by entities that jumped into full risk. And I think its a misconception that to perform well in value-based care, to perform well in MA, you necessarily need to take full risk. Weve always said we prefer models where the payer has skin in the game, an entity like Privia thats enabling has skin in the game and the doctors have skin in the game or the medical groups and the risk entities have skin in the game. And we share it upside and down, and I think that keeps everybody honest.

5. 2025 Outlook and Guidance: Hitting the Singles and Doubles, Compounding the Biz

Privia continues down the path of solid year over year growth in a capital efficient model. Management expects to reach 5,200+ providers in 2025, around a 10% increase during the year.

In 2025, Privia will continue to hit on core execution, which is pure and simple as the following:

first, provider growth to increase density and scale in existing and new markets; second, attribution growth and performance in value-based arrangements; and third, operational improvements and efficiencies that impact the bottom line.  David Mountcastle

Privias operating model in mature markets is also proving out, as the firm expects margin expansion and significant (19%) adjusted EBITDA growth stemming from operating leverage in its most mature markets. Its also significant from the perspective that Privia seems to be focusing on building out existing density in current markets, and seemingly no short term plans to enter new markets according to commentary around whats included in its guidance.

I should note Privia has a decent amount of cash on the balance sheet and I wouldnt be surprised to see it put to use. Management was coy around M&A but we already saw another big deal happen between CVS and Wellvana this week (more on this in the near future) so blood is in the water.

Weve said previously, were looking at medical groups, risk entities, MSO entities. Given our model, I think we can be very flexible.

Another interesting point from the analyst Q&A centered around ACO REACH, whether the program receives an extension, and how that might affect Privias ability to recruit more provider groups if theres any fallout there. Privia noted it prefers to say in MSSP, thinks its a better model, and that any potential convergence happening between the two would validate that position.

Final Thoughts: A Resilient Growth Story

Privia Health demonstrated another year of strong execution, marked by provider growth, financial discipline, and strategic diversification. While Medicare Advantage remains a challenge across the industry, Privias balanced mix of commercial and government contracts provides a uniquely flexible model in the market, which is why Privia has been relatively successful compared to its other VBC peers post-IPO. Theyre also going to continue to shy away from capitation and will be careful with taking on full risk. Ive said it before and Ill say it again: Privia is disciplined with its approach to growth and is focused on compounding the business by hitting singles and doubles.",https://hospitalogy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/Privia-2024-Waterfall.png,N,,04:40.0

Guzman Y Gomez was also on the up, reporting a 5% increase in customer purchase frequency and an almost 6% increase in spend per customer.
Despite a slight drop in average basket size for Crust and Grilld, the gains per customer outweighed the loss in individual transaction size.

By contrast, brands such as Grilld, Guzman Y Gomez (GyG), and Crust Pizza reported notable increases in customer frequency and average spend.

The new figures from Fonto found customers visited the golden arches 5% less frequently and spent 5.4% less compared to the same period in the previous year.

It was a different tale for Grilld, which saw a 14.9% increase in the frequency of purchase, with the average spend per customer rising by 10.6% compared to December 2023. Crust Pizza also reported a 10.5% increase in purchase frequency and a 7.3% rise in spend per customer, despite holding a smaller market share of 3%.

Guzman Y Gomez was also on the up, reporting a 5% increase in customer purchase frequency and an almost 6% increase in spend per customer. The brand's market share rose from 3.0% to 4.2%. GyG announced a 27% increase in revenue, attributing the growth to new store locations meeting increased demand.

Despite a slight drop in average basket size for Crust and Grilld, the gains per customer outweighed the loss in individual transaction size. GyG and Crust have plans to expand further, with GyG planning to open 30 new stores and Crust planning 12 new locations in 2025. Grilld opened 16 new locations in 2024 but has not announced specific store plans for 2025.

Fonto's Moments in QSR data, which tracks market share and competitive advantages within the QSR category, highlights these trends. More than 85,000 Australians share their daily financial transaction data with Fonto, which is used to understand buyer behaviour over time. Fonto also surveys fast food customers shortly after purchases to gain insights into consumer behaviour.

Ben Dixon, CEO of Fonto, commented on the shifting dynamics in the fast-food sector: ""We are seeing customers embracing alternatives, especially ones that promote fresher ingredients, even in the fast food space. Where Dominos has recently faced challenges in product quality, Crust continues to bring customers back, spending more. Where consumers are looking for fresher, higher quality burger alternative, Grilld is taking share and loyalty away from the larger chains. GyGs overall brand promise as healthier fast food is also clearly working, with their sales and profit up across the board.""",http://www.mi-3.com.au/sites/default/files/2025-03/6276d168-9ed2-4626-bd56-7eeeaae4c2ad.jpeg,N,,05:17.8

This compares to year-ago revenues of $71.99 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

What's Next for Allbirds, Inc.

While Allbirds, Inc. Has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Allbirds, Inc. Favorable.

So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$3.05 on $37.07 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$11.26 on $180.58 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Levi Strauss' revenues are expected to be $1.54 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter.

Cardinal Health median worker pay and CEO pay ratio

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires publicly traded companies like Cardinal Health to calculate the gap between CEO compensation and pay for its median employee.

Cardinal Health reported the pay of its median worker at $56,119, down 19% from the $69,024 figure the company reported in each of the previous three years.

That means that Hollars compensation was 457 times greater than what Cardinal Healths median employee received, the company said, up from 269 the year before.

As in recent years, Cardinal Health said that median worker was a full-time employee in the U.S., but did not provide a job title.

The fast food giant is reorganizing its operations to speed up product launches, focusing on winning in three key areas: beef, chicken, and beverages.

We could be moving faster, CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a LinkedIn (MSFT) post. He added that this involves working in a more horizontal way.

Kempczinski explained that the new structure will help McDonalds implement big ideas across essential functions like operations, supply chain, and restaurant design. By breaking down traditional silos and creating specialized departments, McDonalds hopes to respond faster to market trends and customer demands.

Part of this shift includes the appointment of a new Restaurant Experience Officer. Jill McDonald, currently in charge of the companys international division in Europe, Canada, and Australia, will take on the inaugural role. Kempczinski emphasized the need for a single touchpoint for all of these tech-driven efforts.

Perhaps most strategically, the team will establish three global category leads for beef, chicken and beverages. This approach challenges category leaders like Yum! Brands-owned (YUM) KFC, which dominates the chicken market.

With consumer confidence dipping and fast food prices pushing customers away, McDonalds new strategy could be the bump it needs to regain its competitive edge. Kempczinski, who previously worked at Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Pepsi Co. (PEP), believes adopting a consumer-packaged goods mindset will help McDonalds pick up the pace.

However, this wont be an easy task. McDonalds case still faces challenges, including recovering from an E. coli outbreak in Oct. 2024 that hurt foot traffic.

Several restaurant chains, such as Dominos and Papa Johns, have lowered their financial forecasts, citing cautious spending due to inflation and geopolitical uncertainty  largely tied to President Donald Trumps looming tariffs.

As McDonalds works to regain market share, its latest moves could inspire other chains to follow suit. Recent wins, like the return of the Shamrock Shake and Egg McMuffin deal, have been well-received by budget-conscious consumers.

This allows us to have an even bigger impact on our customers, he said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/quartz.com/e408d64674e8cad7aa0101323622e6f2,N,,06:25.7

For the first quarter of 2025, the company reported $1.68 billion in revenue at a 25.1% operating margin (2).

The companys revenue was spread across the world with 40% coming from the Americas, 27% from Europe, and 33% from the Asia-Pacific region. The companys finances were also divided between its various divisions. The Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group (LDG), which provides a wide portfolio of technology platforms and solutions to serve Agilent customers' value chain, such as therapeutic production and the development of critical cancer diagnostics, reported $647 million in revenue, a 4% increase in reported growth (2,3). This exceeded expectations on high-single digit (HSD) growth performance in liquid chromatography (LC) and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LCMS), likely due to positive reception to the companys newly released LC platform.

Applied Markets Group (AMG), which primarily focuses on the food, environmental, and advanced materials markets, among others, accrued $338 million in revenue; while this is a 4% decrease in reported growth, the company claims this division [delivered] better than expected revenue versus a very challenging Q124 comparison, impacted by the timing of Lunar New Year, and strong future growth remains expected (2,3). Finally, the Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) brought in $696 million in revenue with a 1% increase in reported growth, bearing solid mid-single digit growth in providing services and HSD growth in contract revenue.

Padraig McDonnell, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Agilent, said the company exceeded expectations for core revenue growth and earnings per second (EPS) (1). The company has been working on multiple strategies for growth, including strategic price setting, improving digital ecosystem, and identifying procurement opportunities.

We have made meaningful improvements to our website, upgrading the user experience on our e-commerce platform by making it easier to find and purchase the products our customers need, helping topline growth. In Q1, our progress continued with digital orders growing high single digits, McDonnell said. Our procurement teams have challenged our historical approach and are identifying significant cost-savings opportunities in many of Agilents functions.

Regionally, performance in the Americas grew 3%, Europe 2%, and Asia outside of China grew 2%, all of which were slightly ahead of expectations. While revenue in China declined 4%. Gross margin was 54.7% in the quarter, with operating margins of 25.1%. Altogether, Q1 EPS were $1.31, ahead of expectations and up 2% from Q1 2024. In addition to the discussions on their financial bearings for Q1 2025, Agilent also released documents revealing their financial information from this quarter (5).

The company will be guiding to revenue of $1.611.65 billion, approximately an increase of 2.5 to 5.0 percent growth on a core basis and an increase of 2.4 to 4.9% growth on a reported basis (1). Second-quarter non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) EPS are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing a growth range of 2.54.9% (5).

McDonnell also highlighted the companys recognition as a member of the Global Lighthouse Networks. The World Economic Forum named the companies factories in Shanghai, China, and Penang, Malaysia, as part of the networks (6). This recognizes the companys work in scaling artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing, robotics, big-data analytics, and industrial internet of things (IIoT). According to the initial press release, Agilent remains the sole analytical and clinical laboratory technology company worldwide to be recognized by the Forum.

In less than nine months, weve made incredible changes that are improving our customers productivity in an era when the pace of science is faster than ever the outcome were enabling is faster decision-making so that we can accelerate innovation and create differentiated growth, McDonnell said. What we are doing at Agilent is turning a good company into a great one. We are committed to continuous improvement and adapting to changing market dynamics.

Going private seems to be a trend among popular pharmaceutical retail chains.

Recently, it was revealed that Walgreens (WBA) , one of CVS's biggest rivals, has agreed to be acquired by Sycamore Partners for around $10 billion. This deal would take the pharmaceutical chain off the public market and make it private amid ongoing struggles similar to Rite Aid.

CVS falls victim to the pharmacy decline

For decades, CVS (CVS) was the go-to convenience store where customers could buy over-the-counter medicine, obtain prescriptions, purchase food staples and snacks, get cosmetics and skincare essentials, and even find last-minute gifts and souvenirs, all in one location.

However, like its rivals, CVS has also fallen victim to the trend of dwindling traditional pharmacies. It has been facing some tough times over the last few years, with front-store sales declining, shoplifting rising, and multiple opioid lawsuits.

In 2021, CVS announced it would close approximately 800 stores over the next three years, with an additional 270 locations this year due to changing consumer behaviors.

Not only have multiple closures been executed, but thousands of the drugstore chain's employees have been laid off. Last year, CVS announced plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs to reduce costs by $2 billion and increase technology investments.

CVS announces the opening of a dozen smaller locations nationwide

After closing thousands of locations, CVS announced it will open 12 new smaller-format stores across the U.S. over the next year. These locations will focus solely on pharmaceutical products such as medicine and first aid care to better meet the community's specific needs.

This new concept will eliminate CVS's front-store business, as the company has struggled with that sector over the last few quarters.

According to CVS's full-year fiscal 2024 earnings report, comparable front-store sales decreased by 2.1% compared to the same period last year, and total front-store revenues were down by 4.2%.

The new locations will also be smaller, averaging less than 5,000 square feet, less than half the size of a regular CVS store. Smaller-format stores have become incredibly popular in retail because they provide higher profits for less investment.

""I wanted one person who's actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the general restaurant manager,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski told the Journal in an interview announcing the move.

McDonald will also supervise global supply-chain operations, helping to ensure that restaurants have the right equipment and processes for handling new menu items, Kempczinski told the Journal. Charlie Newberger, who currently works on the companys CosMcs offshoot, will lead development of beverages and desserts.

Kempczinski hopes the reorganization will help make restaurants run more efficiently while also speeding up efforts to develop new food offerings. The moves come as McDonald's seeks to regain momentum after an E. coli outbreak undercut sales and as economic uncertainty stalls growth.

The retailer has been making some significant changes recently as it desperately tries to improve sales performance.

It's cited losses for over 11 fiscal quarters in a row, with its stock value decreasing by more than 50 percent.

Newly-appointed CEO Ashley Buchanan has been making several moves to right the ship.

One of those efforts includes an amendment to Kohl's Cash and coupons, a highly popular aspect of the shopping experience that it offers.

Customers frequently use the coupons and Kohl's Cash to get deals on merchandise, but have encountered a lot of exclusions and restrictions on products to get the discounts.

The most exclusions Kohl's has ever had on coupons was the highest it's ever been last year, according to what Buchanan explained to investors in a recent earnings call.

EXCLUDE NO MORE

Buchanan promised to eliminate most of the exclusions moving forward, as it was turning away valued shoppers.

""Over the years, our list of excluded brands on our coupon has grown too large with the percent of sales that are excluded from coupons reaching an all-time high in 2024,"" he said.

""This has created confusion and frustration with our loyalist customers.""

""We are in the process of reversing some of these exclusions to simplify the experience and allow our customers to shop with our promotional coupons more consistently,"" Buchanan added.

The CEO also said there would be ""more clarity in our price and value messages,"" and that it would be amplified to ""resonate"" with customers.

""Our goal is to offer quality products at great prices across our entire portfolio, so our customers can more clearly see the value they're getting with their purchase.""

FAILED APPROACH

A shift toward Kohl's roots began in January after attempts from former CEO Tom Kingsbury over the past year didn't get the results Kohl's was looking for.

Kingsbury wanted to attract a younger consumer base with Babies R Us and Sephora locations located within stores.

Some experts like Jean-Pierre Dub, a research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research, noted that the ambitious goal left behind longtime Kohl's customers.

""Kingsbury disconnected from their core customer and failed to connect with the younger generation that he was presumably going after,"" Dub told Fox affiliate WFFT recently.

Dub added that Kohl's ""hardcore"" shoppers likely felt ""betrayed.""

EXPERT'S WARNING

Michelle Greenwald, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, also told the outlet that Kohl's would need to make attractive offers to customers in 2025 to keep them from going elsewhere.

It seems that Buchanan's strategy is in line with this.

""Once customers leave, they find other alternatives that they're happy with,"" Greenwald warned.

""It's not like they're necessarily going to come back.""

""A lot of it, they're going to just lose forever,"" she added.

Kohl's is also still closing at least 27 ""underperforming"" locations in 15 states.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/ch-kohls-policy-disruption-off-platform.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,06:32.1

The company on Tuesday announced a cross-functional Restaurant Experience Team to move faster in bringing vision and ideas to execution. Jill McDonald, currently president of International Operated Markets, will serve as chief restaurant experience officer, effective May 1.

As part of this move, McDonalds also set up dedicated category teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverage/desserts. Charlie Newburger, VP of marketing strategy and new business ventures, will head the beverage/desserts team. Leaders of the beef and chicken groups will be announced at a later date, the company said.

The thinking behind this is, so many of our categories, were competing against specialists, McDonalds CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a video. Were competing against somebody, like a KFC, for example, who is single-mindedly devoted to winning in chicken. So this category team now allows to actually have that same level of focus on, do we have what we need, the winning strategies to win in chicken, to win in beverages, to win in beef?

McDonalds has spent the past several years highlighting its chicken opportunity. The brand will bring back Snack Wraps later this year and launch a new chicken strip offering. It also plans to bring back the Chicken Big Mac as an LTO. McDonalds believes it can add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026. Globally, its signature McCrispy sandwicha $1 billion brandis sold in over 70 markets and will be available in nearly all markets by the end of this year. During an investor call in July 2024, Kempczinski said chicken sales were on par with beef sales. He noted the burger chain has a significant opportunity for growth in chicken and that its category is twice the size of beef globally and growing at a faster rate.

Additionally, McDonalds believes in the crafted beverage craze so much that it opened the drink-forward CosMcs to test iterations and judge customer demand. After debuting in Bolingbrook, Illinois, in December 2023, the prototype added six locations in Texas. The plan is to close three larger second-generation restaurants and open two smaller digital-focused formats in the Lone Star State later in 2025. The menu features a variety of energy drinks, refreshing, non-caffeinated beverages, signature brews, and classic brews. The food menu has two sandwiches and multiple snacking options, like hash brown bites and mini doughnuts.

The McDonalds Restaurant Experience Team will feature voices from supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs. The chain will also use the team to serve as the coordinator for in-restaurant technologies and help GMs determine how to efficiently use them to improve unit economics.

The Restaurant Experience Team is a direct descendant of the Customer Experience Team formed in 2021, which was tasked with interconnecting marketing, menu, and digital.

Its just going to make us even better. Its going to allow us to have an even bigger impact for our customers, an even bigger impact for our restaurant crew, for our franchisees, Kempczinski said. So Im excited about it because it just means all the ideas and the vision that were coming up with, were going to see it in the restaurants even faster.",https://www.qsrmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mcdonalds.jpg,N,,04:34.8

For 2025, the company expects a net decrease in sales for the year between 5% to 7% compared to last year.

To save money, the Kohl's board reduced the level of dividend paid to shareholders. In previous quarters, the company regularly paid 50 cents a share to shareholders, but this quarter the company is paying 12.5 cents per share.

New Kohl's CEO Ashley Buchanan, made his first public remarks to analysts and investors. Buchanan said there's opportunity for the company to return to growth but there are some areas to improve.

""A lot of the issues really were self-inflicted over many years of decisions, Buchanan said. We have a very loyal customer. When I toured stores, I heard how much they love Kohls. And what I realized was were kind of making it harder for them to love us.

Buchanan said changes will take time before the benefits could be realized.

Rough start to 2025

Kohl's started 2025 with cutting 27 stores across 15 states and then followed it up with eliminating roughly 10% of its positions at its headquarters in Menomonee Falls.

The sales decrease continues the company's slide for roughly two years.

In that time, Kohl's has made a number of moves such as adding Babies 'R' Us, expanding women's dresses, moving juniors department near the front, expand gifting, and bringing back jewelry.

And yet no formula has boosted the company's financial results.

Buchanan is the third CEO to lead the company in four years.

Before him was Tom Kingsbury, who led the company from 2023 to mid-January. Before Kingsbury was Michelle Gass, who led the company from 2018 until she left in 2022 to be CEO of Levi Strauss and Co.

In the last 12 months Kohl's stock price has fallen 55%. On Tuesday the stock opened at $12.06 and has fallen roughly 25% to $8.90 during mid-day trading.

The layoffs do not affect baristas or in-store teams and comes as part of a restructuring the CEO previously announced in January, according to ABC News.

Media Inquiries David Bishop, Partner, Brick Meets Click 847-722-2732, david.bishop@brickmeetsclick.com","Barrington, Ill.  March 11, 2025  The U.S. Online Grocery segment jumped 31% versus last year, ending February 2025 with $10.3 billion in monthly sales, and more than 80 million households placed one or more eGrocery orders during the month, a record high, according to the Brick Meets Click Grocery Shopper Survey fielded January 30-31, 2025, and sponsored by Mercatus.

February marked the seventh straight period where monthly sales exceeded $9.5 billion and the ninth consecutive period with positive year-over-year sales growth, starting shortly after deeply discounted offers on annual membership and subscriptions began being promoted.

We are a little more than a half year into eGrocerys current growth curve, fueled by aggressive offers to lock in customers for at least 12 months, said David Bishop, partner at Brick Meets Click.

So far, the response from U.S. households reveals a sizable amount of latent demand that has been unlocked by offering discounts designed to help customers save more money on online grocery orders.

Delivery continued to post extremely strong results for February 2025, growing more than 45% versus a year ago and registering $4.5 billion in sales. A surge in monthly active users (MAUs) was the predominant growth factor, driven mainly by the rapid expansion of users in the 60+ age group and a YOY rebound in penetration with 18 to 29-year-olds.

Strong gains in order frequency and average order values (AOVs) also contributed to this robust performance, enabling Delivery to finish the month with nearly 44% of eGrocerys total sales.

Pickup reported very strong gains for February 2025, climbing 19% versus last year, to approximately $4.1 billion in sales. Pickups MAU base and order frequency rate both grew YOY, but the primary driver of sales growth was a higher AOV; however, Pickups AOV, MAU base, and order frequency all increased at slightly slower paces than Deliverys.

Despite the monthly sales gain, Pickups share of total eGrocery sales fell 400 bps versus last year, closing February 2025 with just over 39%.

Ship-to-Home sales jumped nearly 29% versus the prior year as this method posted almost $1.8 billion in sales. Like Delivery, Ship-to-Homes YOY gains were driven by a surge in MAUs, which may have been fueled partly by the current in-store environment where various categories are merchandised behind locked plexiglass doors to prevent theft.

While Ship-to-Home order frequency and AOV also climbed versus last year, the gains were more muted than those for Delivery. Overall, Ship-to-Home essentially maintained its 17% share position, ceding just 30 bps of share compared to a year ago.

Building on the strong results for each receiving segment, Supermarket and Mass retailers also had a positive February. Both posted year-over-year gains across the three core drivers of top-line sales: MAUs, order frequency, and AOV.

In addition, the Grocery (which includes Supermarkets and Hard Discounters) and Mass formats reported improvements in repeat intent rates related to Delivery and Pickup services with Grocery closing most of its gap with Mass.

In fact, the likelihood of reusing the same Grocery or Mass service again within the next month finished just 7% below the pre-COVID rate in February, setting a new post-COVID high that surpasses the record set in January 2025.

Regional grocers are converting first-time shoppers into more loyal customers as evidenced by the rising repeat intent rates, but so is Walmart said Mark Fairhurst, Chief Growth Marketing Officer, Mercatus.

While deep discounts have driven a lot of trial, making a good first impression is essential to longer-term success. That means providing a more seamless shopping experience by pairing relevant personalized offers, order fulfilment, and sought-after loyalty rewards to encourage customers to shop online again.

Given eGrocerys explosive sales growth of 31% compared to overall grocery spending, which rose less than 5% versus February 2024, onlines share of total grocery spending finished at almost 18%, jumping 370 bps versus last year.

About this consumer research

The Brick Meets Click Grocery Shopping Survey is an ongoing independent research initiative created and conducted by the team at Brick Meets Click and sponsored by Mercatus.

Brick Meets Click conducted the most recent survey on February 28-29, 2025, with 1,698 adults, 18 years and older, who participated in the households grocery shopping, and a similar survey in February 2024 (n=1,755). Results are adjusted based on internet usage among U.S. adults to account for the non-response bias associated with online surveys. Responses are geographically representative of the U.S. and weighted by age to reflect the national population of adults, 18 years and older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The three receiving methods for online grocery orders are defined as follows:

Delivery includes orders received from a first- or third-party provider like Instacart, Shipt or the retailers own employees.

Pickup includes orders that are received by customers either inside or outside a store or at a designated location/locker.

Ship-to-Home includes orders that are received via common or contract carriers like FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc.

McDonalds latest organizational change goes directly after more specialized fast-food competitors, particularly those in the chicken and beverage categories.

The fast-food giant on Tuesday announced the creation of a new Restaurant Experience Team, an evolution from the companys customer experience team it created three years ago. The team includes people from operations, supply chain, restaurant design, franchising, delivery and technology.

But it also creates three new global teams focusing on three primary menu categories: beef, chicken and beverages and desserts.

The idea behind those teams is for the company to be more competitive with the growing number of specialist concepts with which McDonalds competes. Were competing against somebody like a KFC, which is single-mindedly devoted to winning in chicken, CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a video announcing the change. So this category team now allows us to have that same level of focus.

McDonalds has long been known for its burgers, of course. But the chain is going after two key markets right now, chicken and beverages. The company is working on several chicken items, including chicken tenders and Snack Wraps. And it plans to bring back the Chicken Big Mac as a limited-time offer.

It has also pushed into beverages with its CosMcs concept, though those menu items could potentially be folded into McDonalds restaurants.

Both of those markets are increasingly competitive. Numerous chicken-focused brandsincluding what is arguably McDonalds top competitor, Chick-fil-Aare growing rapidly and taking share in the restaurant market. Beverages, meanwhile, are also growing, thanks to the incursion of drive-thru-focused chains like Dutch Bros and 7 Brew.

That said, its not just specialists pushing into these areas. Taco Bell, the countrys fourth-largest chain, itself last week said it plans to push more into chicken and beveragesnotably with its Live Mas Caf in-restaurant beverage concept.

But Kempczinski also said that the team can help coordinate various ideas, initiatives and technologies to support restaurant general managers. I look at this as being able to take technology now and think about how we actually use all of this to improve our unit economics, he said.

He also said that the team is about speeding McDonalds decision-making. Technology and innovation are being added to the chains restaurants every day, and the company believes the new team will be able to take this innovation to the restaurants more quickly.

It just felt to me, we could be moving faster, Kempczinski said. And being able to move faster meant that we needed to be working in a more horizontal way and moving faster on the implementation.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-03/background/McDonald%27s%20company%201.jpg?VersionId=grO.9pELJmHwElSglfkxG5BYkegoH7dO,N,,06:28.9

Meanwhile, Adis Dimension Footwear, Nikes long-time manufacturing partner in Indonesia, laid off 1500 employees last year in cost-cutting efforts at its factory in Balaraja District.
Desyanti said that while operational expenses and weak demand drove last years layoffs, the company has no plans for additional cuts.
Septo Kalnadi, head of the Banten Manpower and Transmigration Agency, explained that these layoffs reflect a broader industry slowdown rather than wage concerns.","Indonesias footwear industry is under pressure as two major factories in Tangerang  Victory Chingluh and Adis Dimension Footwear  have cut a combined 3500 jobs due to declining international orders from global brands, including Nike and Adidas.

Victory Chingluh, a subsidiary of Taiwans Ching Luh Group, has been downsizing since January, laying off 2000 workers at its facility in Cikupa District.

The company, which manufactures for brands such as Adidas, FootJoy, Mizuno, Nike, and Reebok, also operates factories in China and Vietnam.

According to Tangerang Regency Manpower Department official Desyanti, the company attributed the decision to soaring operational costs and plummeting market demand.

Nikes evolving retail strategy may be a contributing factor. In 2023, the company announced plans to cut up to US$2 billion in costs over three years to fuel future growth, accelerate innovation at scale, and drive long-term profitability. Part of this strategy includes streamlining product assortment, increasing automation, and restructuring its organisation.

Meanwhile, Adis Dimension Footwear, Nikes long-time manufacturing partner in Indonesia, laid off 1500 employees last year in cost-cutting efforts at its factory in Balaraja District.

Desyanti said that while operational expenses and weak demand drove last years layoffs, the company has no plans for additional cuts.

Septo Kalnadi, head of the Banten Manpower and Transmigration Agency, explained that these layoffs reflect a broader industry slowdown rather than wage concerns.

There will be more layoffs next year, said Kalnadi. Every day, there was always some company asking for permission for layoffs.

Last year, Tangerang businesses collectively laid off 12,000 workers.

The Indonesian government has responded with a $1.3 billion credit program to support struggling industries such as footwear, textiles, furniture, and food manufacturing. Companies employing at least 50 workers will be eligible for financial assistance.",https://insideretail.asia/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Indonesias-footwear-industry-hit-by-job-cuts-as-demand-slows-1.png,N,,06:45.9

Full transcript - Barclays 27th Annual Global Healthcare Conference:

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Hi, good morning and welcome to the twenty seventh Annual Barclays Global Healthcare Conference. My name is Andrew Mok. Im the Facilities and Managed Care Analyst here at Barclays. And Im pleased to be joined on stage with Mark Kaye, CFO of Elevance and Nathan Rich, VP of Investor Relations. Welcome to the conference.

Lets start with Medicare enrollment. The latest CMS data shows your total Medicare membership is tracking 35,000 or about 1.5% above the high end of your Medicare Advantage guidance, which you reiterated through an eight ks late afternoon yesterday. Can you help us square the February data with your reiterated guidance, Mark?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thank you very much for the question, Andrew. And I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you this morning and to Barclays for hosting. I look very much look forward to our conversation. Let me start by emphasizing that our outlook for 2025 Medicare Advantage membership remains unchanged from our fourth quarter earnings call. In the eight ks that we released yesterday, we reaffirmed our MA membership expectations, which includes high single digit growth in individual MA and then planned double digit growth in the group MA stemming from an expansion of existing customer relationships in 2025.

To a specific question, while the CMS February CMS enrollment files accurately reflect our membership, there are a few important factors that we want investors to consider and which inform our full year outlook. First, effective March 1, we will not retain a cohort of our D SNP membership related to a known footprint change in one of our Medicaid states. I do want to be clear that this outcome was expected and factored into our full year membership financial guidance. Also consistent with our fourth quarter earnings call messaging, we expect minimal membership growth over the balance of the year as we maintain our marketing adjustments taken during AEP to optimize our member mix and improve retention. And so taken together, the expected footprint change and lower in year growth provide confidence in our full year guide of 2,200,000 to 2,250,000 Medicare Advantage members.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Okay. So were 35,000 above right now. Youre saying theres a contract change coming. So that should reduce you about 30,000 or so, and theres no expected growth for the balance of the year.

So should we be thinking about the upper end or the high end of the range at this point?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: I think I would be comfortable just to say the range of 2.2 to 2.25. Thanks, Andrew.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. So given some of the growth in the retail membership this year, how does year one new member profitability compare to continuing membership? And what are you expecting for this years new member cohort specifically?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Generally, first year Medicare Advantage members tend to operate at a slightly negative margin, though this can vary by product and benefit type. And thats why we were pleased to realize strong growth in our HMO products this year, which have more coordinated care and predictable cost patterns than PPO plans. In addition, the high levels of retention that we saw for 2025 is another important factor in our outlook, as we are better able to improve access to affordable care for members that remain with us.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. And then from a margin perspective, I think youre expecting fairly stable margins year over year. There seems to be a few moving pieces with the pricing benefit design, membership growth, core utilization and even the STARS headwind. Can you share with us where Medicare margins landed at the end of twenty twenty four? And maybe walk us through the puts and takes to bridge to stable Medicare margins for 2025?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Im happy to spend some time to walk through the drivers here. So to start, our Medicare margins in 2024 were in line with our expectations. And as weve previously stated, we were below our long term target range. Coming into last year, we created a stable foundation through targeted geographic exits and proactive benefit design changes. And these actions, in addition to disciplined cost management, help offset some of the funding challenges, elevated cost trends, as well as pressure from the year two midnight rule.

For 2025, our guidance anticipates costs are going to remain elevated, but manageable, Strong retention, disciplined cost management and improved recognition of member acuity following elevated utilization trends in recent years support our outlook for margin stability. Additionally, as I mentioned just a moment ago, we were pleased with our composition of membership from both a product and a geographic standpoint. And finally, while it remains early in the year, we feel good about our positioning in Medicare having seen a couple of months of results.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Understood. And then maybe your comments around 2025 EPS cadence and seasonality imply a steeper ramp to 4Q MLR, which you attributed to both business mix and changes from the IRA. I think PDP and MAPD members in total maybe account for 10% to 15% of total risk membership. Can you help us better understand the expected Part D MLR cadence baked into guidance and how the proportionally small membership base is driving such a strong change in MLR seasonality?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thanks, Andrew. Let me first take a minute to address our expectations on earnings seasonality. As we stated on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect over 60% of adjusted EPS to occur in the first half of the year with more than 50% of that to be realized in the first quarter. So with that in mind, as I look at where FactSet consensus stands today, analyst EPS estimates in the first quarter look to be about $1 light compared to our expectations. And this is simply a function of seasonality.

It does not change our earnings expectations for the full year. There are several factors contributing to this more pronounced seasonality. To start, we expect the first quarter MLR to benefit from a favorable calendar with the number of workdays lower than last year. And this is the effect of pulling forward earnings into the first quarter. Second is the impact of the Part D benefit design changes related to the IRA, which will have a meaningful impact on the earnings cadence in Medicare.

And this is going to result in seasonality for Part D being more like our medical benefits business than in past year past years. And then finally, a shift in member mix, namely lower Medicaid membership, higher ACA growth, theyre going to drive more pronounced earnings seasonality again in the first quarter of this year.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Weve also seen a severe flu season this year. Do you have any sense of whether that would meaningfully impact 1Q MLR at this point?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes. We began the year anticipating an influenza and other influenza like illness season in line with the pre COVID trends, which is somewhat higher than what we experienced during the pandemic era. Incidence rates for these illnesses have actually been running a little bit above even those prudent expectations, which has generated a modest increase in costs so far. Importantly, the acuity of the activity weve seen has been consistent with our expectations. And so while theres still a couple of weeks left in the quarter, theres always the possibility for a late season respiratory virus activity.

We believe our pricing continues to provide adequate prudence to address the elevated costs weve seen so far, and that allows us to be comfortable with the guidance that weve given so far.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. So taken all in, reiterating guidance, Q1 EPS consensus is about a dollar light and that reflects the impact of flu as well. Perfect. Understood. So shifting to Medicaid, can you share how composite Medicaid rates developed for oneone renewals and comment maybe how theyre tracking for the upcoming renewal cycle around fourone and sevenone?

Yes, of course. So, January,

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: expectations and reflect early progress towards bringing rates back to a level that will prospectively cover cost trend. We also have early insight into April rates, which is similarly in line with our expectations, though April is a smaller cohort for us. On July renewals, which cover about a third of our membership base, its still purely to comment. Well get a better picture in the coming months as draft rates are shared. And overall, I would say that the rates we secured thus far have been broadly consistent with our initial expectations, though there is still important work ahead.

We remain in constructive ongoing discussions with our state partners to further align prospective rates with elevated cost trends as we continue to that we continue to observe in our Medicaid portfolio.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. And it feels like most of the margin recovery in Medicaid does come from better state rates, which is somewhat passive. Can you help us understand maybe some of the actionable items you can take to items that are in your control to drive better cost outcomes and management?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: We are certainly advocating for rates that fully reflect todays cost environment, while also driving operational efficiencies that deliver better health outcomes for our members and more value for our state partners. We feel well positioned to consistently rank in the top tier of cost management and quality performance within the markets that we serve. One of the ways that were actually innovating in this area is through the rollout of the digital solutions that enhance the member experience and improve outcomes. And just to give you one example here, today were using technology to identify members with care gaps and chronic risk factors. Our care management teams then perform proactive outreach to provide early intervention and to guide the member in accessing the care they need.

And in addition, our targeted digital interactions actually helped save members over one point five million hours in 2024 through higher quality provider search functionality and a streamlined call center experience.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. Lets move on to commercial. Several of your peers in the stop loss business called out pressure throughout the back half of the year and even more so in the fourth quarter, but stop loss didnt seem to be a source of fourth quarter pressure for Elevance. Can you take a step back and give us some more color around what you saw with respect to commercial and stop loss trends and your experience there and why you might have had some differentiated trends?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thanks for the question. Your observation is spot on. We did not experience the same stop loss pressure seen by others in the fourth quarter and were pleased with our overall stop loss performance in 2024. There are several key differences worth noting. First, we primarily sell a bundled stop loss coverage as an ancillary product for self insured groups seeking additional protection against overall claim costs.

Second, only a very small portion of our portfolio is dedicated to specific claims liability coverage for fully insured clients, and thats an area that others have highlighted as a source of pressure. And then finally, its worth just keeping in mind that our total stop loss portfolio is relatively small percentage of our total premiums. And so Ill simply close by saying, taken a thoughtful and strategic approach to our stop loss business. We have a leadership team with a deep expertise and experience in this area and its something we feel quite comfortable with.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. And then pricing aside, specialty pharmacy has been an area of accelerating trend across the broader healthcare industry. What are you seeing with respect to this trend and which book of business

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: And these trends are most And these trends are most pronounced in categories like oncology, autoimmune, dermatologic, placing really upward pressure on overall costs. If I look forward to 2025, weve modeled specialty pharmacy or specialty trends to remain elevated. And in particular, weve been prudent in assessing how Part D benefit design changes might incentivize different member and provider behavior. And for example, lower cost sharing could drive higher utilization. Weve also been monitoring the pipeline of new products and expanded indications.

And importantly, weve baked these dynamics into our pricing and guidance for 2025. When it comes to approaching specialty pharmacy pricing, we focus on the whole person care rather than just merely unit cost. And through our CalonRx asset, we integrate medical and pharmacy data and utilize predictive analytics to enable more comprehensive management of by expanding value based arrangements, improving care coordination among providers, we aim to deliver total or aim to deliver the lowest net total cost, while still ensuring sort of timely high quality care for our members. And really all of that helps us address todays cost pressures without losing sight of the clinical outcomes that our members need.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Right. And just given the number of specialty drugs that have increased and the label expansions that weve seen, is it more difficult to kind of predict the utilization today than maybe it was five years ago?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: I think I would say were managing specialty trend pressure through disciplined pricing and analytics approach. What also helps us here is the integrated pharmacy management, the active support of or active development of new and innovative solutions. And that really allows us to remain confident in the way that we price some of those new solutions and products that come to market.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. And then taking a step back, youve done a nice job improving commercial margins over the last few years. Whats the trajectory of commercial margins from here? And where do you see the opportunities to expand margins further?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes, were very pleased with the trajectory of our commercial margin recovery over the last two years. Looking ahead to 2025, we do expect to realize continued improvement, albeit at a more modest pace compared to 2023 and 2024 as repricing initiatives we have executed are materially complete. Long term, we expect earnings growth from our commercial business to be driven by increased membership bolstered by the geographic expansion of our individual ACA products and improved group retention. We also expect earnings growth to come from increased penetration of our integrated medical and pharmacy offering and our innovative affordability and digital solutions such as our suite of patient advocacy products. And finally, Id say, we remain committed to a prudent approach to pricing that delivers consistent performance and supports membership growth thats all embedded in our long term earnings growth algorithm.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. And theres been a lot of headlines around DOGEs efforts to reduce the federal workforce. You have a large federal employee benefits program that represents about 1,600,000 members or $15,000,000,000 in revenue. How are you thinking about the potential changes to that business? And is there anything explicitly considered for 2025?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thats a great question. At this stage, any outcome from Doges efforts to reduce the federal workforce remain highly uncertain, just given the various legal and regulatory hurdles that are still unfolding. In our latest outlook, we factored in a slight dip in federal employee program membership, but we dont foresee a material earnings impact since our contract with the federal government is structured on a cost plus basis. Additionally, the geographies where we offer coverage to federal employees significantly overlap with our other lines of business. So we are well positioned to provide affordable coverage to members affected by these potential changes.

And then last comment Id maybe make here, Andrew, its important to note that we serve both active employees and retirees within our federal employee business and would not expect the retiree population to be impacted by these actions.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. Youre also seeing solid growth in the individual ACA market this year despite some new program integrity measures. Can you share what your experience has been so far with respect to February effectuated enrollment, how that came in and how you expect intra year attrition to play out? Yes.

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: And then of course, let me start by saying that weve been really pleased with our growth in the individual ACA market over the past several years. Were encouraged by the results of the open enrollment period for 2025. But to your question, through February member effectuation rates, which represent the proportion of members who have paid their premium have tracked a little bit lighter than we initially expected. And this is likely reflective of the higher percentage of passive renewals this year, as we have seen members, especially those who have enrolled with us during or following redetermination from Medicaid, reevaluate their coverage during this grace period. This dynamic impacts a small portion of our membership base.

Weve adjusted our membership outlook appropriately and that is reflected in the eight ks last night. So I would say overall, we still feel pretty good about this underlying business. We have appropriately balanced the growth in this market with prudent pricing expectations for 2025.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: When you say a little bit lighter, is that a reflection of just kind of the member premiums paid or do you think thats more driven by some of the newer measures around failure to reconcile, things of that nature that are driving effectuated enrollment lower?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: There are likely several interacting and complicating attributes that drive this. The net result of that is that were seeing slightly lighter effectuation rates than what we expected. We definitely attribute this to those members who have enrolled with us following the redetermination from Medicaid and there are obviously several factors driving that.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Do you have full visibility into the failure to reconcile at this point?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: We have enough visibility for us internally to look through some dynamics. That would be a great Q1 earnings call question.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. Sticking with the ACA, wed love to hear how youre thinking about the potential membership attrition and the impact to the risk pool if Congress allows enhanced subsidies to expire at the end of the year?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes. We continue to closely monitor developments in Washington and we remain fully committed to the ACA marketplace. Its not only an attractive and complementary business for us, but also represents significant long term growth opportunities. This is a particularly relevant as we expand our WellPoint branded plans beyond our 14 blue states. And thats a key step towards fulfilling our member commitment or our commitment to being a lifetime trusted health partner at every stage of our members journey.

With that in mind, the availability of enhanced subsidies has driven increased enrollment over the past few years and extension of those enhanced subsidies would limit potential disruption to individuals and families seeking a continuation of affordable healthcare coverage. Congressional members on both sides of the aisle have expressed support for extending the ACA subsidies and policymakers have a range of options, including full extension, partial or modified extension or even phasing out of the enhanced subsidies. Regarding the risk pool, if the enhanced subsidies do expire, we would expect a reduction in enrollment that would naturally shift the pools overall risk profile. And well account for that in our 2026 pricing, drawing upon our broad ACA pricing experience. And then last comment Ill make here, the ACA risk adjustment program also does provide meaningful stability by transferring funds to carriers and managing higher risk populations.

And so this should help mitigate some of the hypothetical disruption that could occur from any changes in the market.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Are you preparing two sets of pricing at this point, one with the subsidies, one without the subsidies?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: We are definitely thinking through several pricing options, which I imagine will include more than one submission.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Maybe lets move on to Carillon. You recently closed on the acquisition of CareBridge late last year, which represents a significant expansion into the home. Can you walk us through the strategic rationale for this deal and any expected contributions to earnings over the next few years?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes, absolutely. So in the fourth quarter, we successfully closed on the acquisition of CareBridge. And for those who dont know, CareBridge is a rapidly growing value based care company that specializes in managing a home and community based services, HCBS, for both the Medicaid and dual eligible population. Key Bridges innovative model aligns to Keylons whole health approach, which strengthens our ability to serve chronic and complex members, and thats going to help us further scale our home business within Keylon. Specifically, we see CareBridge serving a scalable or serving as a scalable platform to broaden our home based rich and this includes extending services beyond the HCBS population to high risk Medicaid and dual eligible members, while also expanding into geographies to better support Elavant Health home and community based beneficiaries.

So in short, you can think about the acquisition of Cambridge as enabling us to expand post acute care delivered in the home, build at home elements into specialty care management products already offered by Keyalon services like oncology and then drive improved health plan performance through enhanced member outcomes and reduce costs for LTSS and the D SIP members. So, summarize, we view the acquisition as being strongly aligned with our strategic objectives. It opens up significant white space for growth through the introduction of new capabilities and expansion into key Medicaid and dual eligible markets.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Would you like to get even bigger in the home? And is there a strategic preference for Medicaid first or Medicare first home providers?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Being in the home is one of the four key pillars that we think of within that Keyalon services being among sort of advanced primary care, specialty care, behavioral health and then the home based care is an important avenue for us for continued growth and it integrates very well, allowing us to scale some of the services that we already offer. So clearly a very important acquisition for us.

Came to Dethrone Zara and Is Now Closing Its Stores H&M had established itself as a rival to Inditex, but the latest financial data from the Swedish firm make it clear that the situation has changed.
This plunge in earnings forced H&M to review its market strategies and close several of its stores.
The closure of H&M stores is not an isolated case but part of a broader landscape.
Since 2020, more than 18,000 fashion stores have closed in Spain, a trend that reflects the shift of consumers toward digital commerce.","The fashion industry has experienced times of constant change in recent decades. Brands that once dominated the market now face new challenges due to shifts in consumer preferences. This time, it's H&M that has made a drastic shift in its strategy, and its situation in Spain reflects the difficulties of the textile sector.

The fast fashion sector is witnessing significant transformations. H&M, one of the major competitors of Inditex, has begun to close stores massively in our country, a decision that surprises many. This measure is part of a series of adjustments following a drop in its financial results, marking the beginning of a new era for the brand in Spain.

Came to Dethrone Zara and Is Now Closing Its Stores

H&M had established itself as a rival to Inditex, but the latest financial data from the Swedish firm make it clear that the situation has changed. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a significant loss of about 258 million euros, which represented a 30% drop in its profits. This plunge in earnings forced H&M to review its market strategies and close several of its stores.

In Spain, the impact has been considerable, as it accounts for 17% of the brand's global closures, highlighting the magnitude of the crisis. Cities like Elche, Orihuela, and Torrevieja have witnessed the closure of stores that, in many cases, affected dozens of employees. These closures are not new for the brand, as in 2021 it was also forced to close major establishments in Madrid, such as those on Gran Va and Conde Pealver.

Factors That Have Led to H&M's Decline

The crisis it faces is due to a combination of factors that have affected the entire industry; the change in consumption habits is one of the main issues. The pandemic accelerated the shift to e-commerce, a transition that many brands, including H&M, did not manage with the same agility as their competitors.

Additionally, the increase in production costs and inflation have severely hit the brand's finances. This has combined with competition from new players like Shein and Temu, which have challenged traditional brands with extremely low prices and online business models.

Although H&M has attempted to improve its offerings through new technologies, such as smart fitting rooms and self-checkout kiosks, the competition in the sector is fierce. E-commerce and second-hand fashion continue to gain ground, forcing major brands to rethink their business model.

The closure of H&M stores is not an isolated case but part of a broader landscape. Since 2020, more than 18,000 fashion stores have closed in Spain, a trend that reflects the shift of consumers toward digital commerce. Although spending on fashion increased by 4.89% in 2023, the rise of online shopping and the increase in sustainable alternatives have made physical stores lose relevance.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-stradivarius-zara-cierre-tiendas_1200_800.jpg,N,,07:29.1

The company, known for its colourful plastic building bricks, said it is increasing investment in online play including building its own development team. It has tripled its number of software engineers since 2022 and launched a successful tie-up with the online game Fortnite.

Niels Christiansen, the chief executive of the Danish toymaker, said the group was trying to create more hybrid digital and physical experiences as nine- to 12-year-olds were spending more time online.

They tend to grow up a bit earlier and orient themselves towards social media, he said.

Christiansen said the trend was also behind Legos tie-ups last year with the sports-related brands Formula One and Nike, which are expected to release the first products this year and hinted there would be more similar tie-ups on the way. It is so important for us that we are present with exciting experiences and exactly this type of topics and passion points, he said.

We are seeing a shift and are trying to be right on it and even leading that shift so we stay super relevant.

Christiansen said the new investment in digital was a multi-year journey and he could not give details of the games now in development. The company has already launched some Lego-branded games using external partners as well as the recent tie-up with Fortnite.

Lego said sales rose by 13% to 74.3bn Danish kroner (8.4bn), even as the wider toy market slid back by 1%. The groups Technic and City sets, as well as Harry Potter- and Star Wars-themed games, sold well. Operating profits rose by 10% to 18.7bn kroner despite increased investment in new factories, including in the US and Vietnam.

Christiansen said there were no plans to bring forward the opening of a new factory in Virginia despite the threat of US tariffs on goods being imported from Mexico, where the majority of Legos kits for North America are made.

He said the company had experienced a lot of volatility in recent years including the effects of the pandemic and increased energy costs. It was unclear if US import tariffs would turn out to be long term or temporary measures so the companys tactic was dont panic, he added.

I dont lie awake at night because of tariffs for Mexico. I would lie awake if I didnt feel we are sustaining relevance of the product and brand, he said.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db2bc299da8ed99aada8c2eb2d34b77b750912d7/244_0_3596_2160/master/3596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=343b903874c9f063a7751579a5b9a699,N,,04:49.3

The closure of the plant is expected to have a significant impact on the local community, with many businesses relying on the plant for steel supplies.
Verster said the Vereeniging and Newcastle mills, which indirectly support more than 100,000 jobs, supply between 350,000 tons and 400,000 tons of steel products that cant currently be manufactured by any other companies in South Africa.
Verster expressed his disappointment at the outcome, stating that the decision would have a significant negative impact on the economy, jobs, and the local community.
Newcastle businessman Marius Pretorius said there is uncertainty about where to go from here.","In a devastating blow to the local economy, ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) has announced its decision to fully idle its long-steel plants in Newcastle, resulting in the loss of approximately 3,500 direct jobs.

The company had initially planned to implement the wind-down of its longs-business in late January but postponed the decision to accommodate outstanding orders and sustain talks with the South African Government. However, these rescue talks have failed, and AMSA has confirmed that it will begin shutting down its blast furnaces in the first week of March, with steel production expected to cease by early April.

In a statement, AMSA expressed its disappointment at the outcome, stating that despite engaging with stakeholders and government bodies, no viable options were found to avoid the wind-down. Regrettably, despite our best efforts, the parties involved have not been able to find timely solutions required to defer the wind down of the longs business, read the statement.

The closure of the plant is expected to have a significant impact on the local community, with many businesses relying on the plant for steel supplies. AMSAs chief executive officer, Kobus Verster, highlighted the concerns that led to the decision, including the scrap Price Preference System and export tax on scrap, port and rail efficiency, the lapsing of provisional safeguards on Hot Rolled Coil, their application for a negotiated pricing agreement with Eskom not being supported, and a looming electricity tariff hike set to go into effect on 1 April.

Verster said the Vereeniging and Newcastle mills, which indirectly support more than 100,000 jobs, supply between 350,000 tons and 400,000 tons of steel products that cant currently be manufactured by any other companies in South Africa.

Verster expressed his disappointment at the outcome, stating that the decision would have a significant negative impact on the economy, jobs, and the local community. AMSA is deeply disappointed that our efforts over the last year have not translated into a sustainable solution, resulting in a significant negative impact on the economy, the loss of approximately 3,500 direct and indirect jobs, and a detrimental impact on the local community in Newcastle.

Pietermaritzburg and Midlans Chamber of Business CEO Melanie Veness echoed these sentiments, stating that the closure would have a huge negative impact on workers and communities. This is big, from a job perspective but also a sustainability of companies point of view.

With more than 2,000 of the expected job cuts coming from Newcastle alone, many in the community are concerned about the future. Newcastle businessman Marius Pretorius said there is uncertainty about where to go from here.

Were going to need all forms of generation- renewables, gas, and nuclear. NextEra, which dabbles in everything from transmission to upstream oil and gas pipelines, contracted about 12 gigawatts (GW) of renewables last year.
The uniquely diverse energy conglomerate also operates the largest gas-fired generation facility in the United States and is the seventh-largest nuclear operator in the world.
Over the last five years, the United States has installed about 175 GW of renewables, 13 GW of gas, and 3 GW of nuclear, Ketchum shared.
NextEras CEO expects the United States first new reactor will fire up sometime in 2031 or 2032, and the first small modular designs to appear in 2035 or later.","(Houston, TX)  Driven by data center development and mass electrification across industries, the current pace of electric demand growth in the United States is unlike anything NextEra Energy president and chief executive officer John Ketchum has ever seen.

Were expecting a six-fold increase in power demand over the next 20 years compared to what we saw over the prior 20, he revealed to a packed room of energy and finance experts at CERAWeek by S&P Global in Houston, Texas, Monday morning.

To meet that demand, Ketchum insists renewable generation needs to be part of the equation, contrasting significantly from sentiments U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright expressed earlier in the day.

We firmly believe in order to do it, were going to have to be able to come up with all-of-the-above energy solutions, Ketchum quipped. Theres not a one-size-fits-all solution. Were going to need all forms of generation- renewables, gas, and nuclear.

NextEra, which dabbles in everything from transmission to upstream oil and gas pipelines, contracted about 12 gigawatts (GW) of renewables last year. The uniquely diverse energy conglomerate also operates the largest gas-fired generation facility in the United States and is the seventh-largest nuclear operator in the world.

We get to see it all, and we understand how important this is to our customers, Ketchum offered.

The demand is here right now, he added. We have to have the generation available to meet that demand. Otherwise, were going to have a huge power affordability crisis in this country, with utility bills going through the roof.

Skyrocketing bills, Ketchum worries, might trigger utility commissions to intervene and demand specific types and timing of generation. That scenario wouldnt be much fun for anyone, inspiring nearly two dozen Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives to send a letter today asking the Senate not to interfere with the Inflation Reduction Acts (IRAs) clean energy tax credits and threatening to oppose the current budget bill if their request is not met. Its authors and NextEras CEO agree that the tax credits and transferability provisions are essential to managing new electric load cost-effectively.

Ketchum, who also serves as chairman of NextEra Energys subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, told CERAWeek attendees that he sees an incredible growth opportunity to put America first under the Trump administration. His companys capital investment plans speak to that sentiment, exceeding $120 billion over the next four years, easily making NextEra one of the top infrastructure investors in the United States.

We are fully behind with this administration, Ketchum confirmed. We just need to make sure we (meet demand growth) in a smart way that keeps the bill low, because if we have affordability issues, its going to be really tough to meet all that demand that we see coming.

Timing is Everything

Keeping electricity prices manageable will depend on the strategic deployment of new generation sources to meet demand. Over the last five years, the United States has installed about 175 GW of renewables, 13 GW of gas, and 3 GW of nuclear, Ketchum shared. NextEra is happy to build any and everything, but the companys CEO notes theres a timing difference concerning when varying generation solutions can be brought to market and associated cost discrepancies.

He would know, as no entity has built more gas-fired generation in the U.S. over the last two decades than NextEra has. The companys last completed facility, a commercial plant in Fort Lauderdale, was brought online in 2022 at the cost of $785 per kilowatt (kW).

If we wanted to build that same gas-fired combined cycle unit today? $2400 per kW, estimated Ketchum at CERAWeek. He assessed the cost of gas fire generation to have more than tripled over the last few years, crediting supply constraints (amidst increased demand) and significant qualified labor shortages.

To get your hands on a gas turbine and to actually get it built across the market, youre really looking at 2030, or later, Ketchum confessed.

Plus, lots of the trained workforce that knew how to build gas-fired facilities is gone, having either retired or moved onto other things. Ketchum notes the limited labor available is spread thin, too, building out data centers, constructing LNG terminals, tinkering at chemical companies, and more.

We have a real shortage of labor supply in this country, Ketchum reiterated.

The bridge to new nuclear looks to be even longer than the wait time for a gas turbine. NextEras CEO expects the United States first new reactor will fire up sometime in 2031 or 2032, and the first small modular designs to appear in 2035 or later.

That leaves wind, solar, and batteries, renewable energy workhorses whose contributions have been explicitly minimized by the current administration, including by former fossil fuel executive Wright.

Renewables are ready to go right now because theyve been up and running, Ketchum told the room.

Dont get my comments wrong, he implored. We are going to need it all.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gerke-Workspace-2040-x-1360-px-15-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,07:34.4

The jobs have been cut gradually since 2023, when the company had a workforce of 11,000 in the Netherlands, the paper said.
We have not seen any investment in the Netherlands, only cuts and the disposal of units, said spokesman Patrick Meerts.
Philips 2024 annual report shows that the workforce in the Netherlands has gone down by 2,336 over the past two years.
Philips had a workforce of 220,000 25 years ago, of whom 40,000 were in the Netherlands.","An ongoing reorganisation at medical technology company Philips has led to the loss of 2,600 jobs in the Netherlands, 700 more than expected, the Financieele Dagblad reported on Tuesday. The unions expect even more jobs to go, given the reorganisation is set to continue until the end of this year.

The jobs have been cut gradually since 2023, when the company had a workforce of 11,000 in the Netherlands, the paper said. Philips had previously stated it would reduce its Dutch workforce by 1,900.

Unions say they fear further job losses, particularly given that the company announced last month it aims to cut spending by a further $500 million. The company has now posted a loss for three consecutive years.

The FNV trade union said it fears the company is in the process of withdrawing from the Netherlands altogether. We have not seen any investment in the Netherlands, only cuts and the disposal of units, said spokesman Patrick Meerts. We are concerned.

Philips said in a reaction that the Netherlands will remain the companys beating heart. However, it said, the relatively large number of job losses in the Netherlands is due to a new, more decentralised way of working.

We are giving more responsibility to the business units, the spokesman said. Most business units, the FD reported, are based abroad.

Philips 2024 annual report shows that the workforce in the Netherlands has gone down by 2,336 over the past two years. That total includes some 400 jobs in Drachten after the company shifted some production to Indonesia and China. Other jobs have been cut at its central research lab, formally Natlab.

The Spring-based tech giant will reduce its workforce by roughly 5 percent by a combination of layoffs and normal turnover over the next 18 months.

The workforce reduction program, approved by HPEs board on Thursday according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, aims to address operational challenges and inventory issues that have affected the companys performance.

We could have executed better, admitted CEO Antonio Neri during the conference call with analysts. Neri specifically highlighted problems within HPEs server unit, pointing to a rapid shift in market demand toward the newest graphics processing units (GPUs), which has left the company burdened with excessive inventory of older models.

HPE Announces Global Layoffs, Impacting Houston Workforce

The layoffs will impact HPEs global workforce of more than 60,000 employees, though it is unclear how many of them will be lost in the Houston region, where the company has approximately 2,000 employees.

HPE has offices in both Spring, where it has its headquarters at the City Place campus and Houston, based on its 2024 annual report.

HPE moved its corporate offices from San Jose, California, to Spring in 2020, opening up a huge footprint in the city. The reorganization is one of dramatic transformation for one of the largest employers in the area.

The company estimates to achieve approximately $350 million in cost savings in the reductions and similar savings in the future to the end of fiscal year 2027. The reduction plan will be phased in and will be fully effective by the fiscal year 2026.

Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers, during the earnings call, indicated that she has some apprehensions about additional threats to the company, namely mentioning the potential of new tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports in the next year.

The cuts are set to take place at a time when Neri is one of Houstons better-compensated executives. His 2023 total compensation package was more than $20 million, ranking him ninth among regional executives, the Houston Chronicle reported.

HPE Restructures, Cuts Jobs

HPE also became an independent company in 2015 when the former Hewlett-Packard was divided into two. Although the personal computer and printer business was acquired by HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise concentrated on enterprise technology solutions and products like servers, data storage infrastructure, networking equipment, IT infrastructure management software, and consulting.

The restructuring is a continued reorganization within the tech sector as businesses cope with shifting market conditions, supply chain challenges, and economic headwinds.

For HPE, the layoffs are an attempt to rationalize operations and boost profitability amidst these sector-wide challenges.

Local business leaders are monitoring for possible impacts on the Spring and Houston economies because HPE has become a significant corporate presence after relocating its headquarters to Texas.

There has been no statement from community leaders regarding the announcement or potential relief for impacted employees.

Throughout this 18-month implementation phase, HPE must contend with the dual challenge of rightsizing its workforce while preserving operational capacity and marketplace competitiveness in the fast-changing enterprise technology environment.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-15-at-3.05.39-PM-125x125.png,N,,04:44.8

The chain plans to open approximately a dozen stores this year, but they will be about half the size of a typical CVS location. The stores will be pharmacies only, leaving behind the aisles of snacks, drinks, and miscellaneous goods typical of a full-size CVS.

By shrinking its stores, CVS is hoping it will be able to continue to expand at a time when it and many other American businesses are facing financial difficulty. The company has already closed more than 1,000 stores since 2021, and laid off thousands of workers.

Drugstores like CVS have to compete with smaller convenience stores like 7-Eleven or shops attached to gas stations as well as big online retailers like Amazon, where household goods can also be bought.

CVS faces less competition  for now  with the pharmacy side of its business. Without a convenience store attached, CVS can cut back on many of its workers who would otherwise be stocking shelves or watching for shoplifters, a problem thats also driven the company to abandon its food aisles.

The smaller-format stores are reportedly ""designed to meet the community's specific pharmacy needs,"" a CVS spokesperson told CNN.

By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, were continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patients and ensure the right geographic coverage, they said.

Nell Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, told CNN that the move would make it cheaper for CVS to operate its stores, but cautioned that online prescription fillers were becoming more popular and that CVS will soon have more competitors nipping at its customer base.

The move likely won't be popular with consumers. A 2023 Acosta Group study found that U.S. consumers use the convenience stores attached to drugstores to shop for everyday items as much as they use the pharmacy services.

It also found that consumers typically prefer a quick run to a drugstore when they need to grab an item. A reported 64 percent of respondents said they preferred shopping for their pharmacy and medical needs at a drugstore over going to a mass retailer, a grocery store, or using an online service. Nearly 60 percent said drugstores, of the four, provided the easiest and most convenient shopping experience.",https://static.the-independent.com/2024/02/05/21/Puerto_Rico-CVS_Sale_90929.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,04:28.6

Martha Stewart and other celebs star in JC Penney's recent ads.

One of Americas oldest retailers is heading into another new chapter, with JC Penney merging with SPARC Group, a company known for scooping up struggling retail brands. The new portfolio is coming together in Catalyst Brands, a $9 billion organization, with Marc Rosen, head of JC Penney, stepping in as CEO.

Marisa Thalberg, who had been CMO at Penney on a consulting basis, has been named chief customer and marketing officer of Catalyst Brands.

Michelle Wlazlo, formerly JCPenney's chief merchandising and supply chain officer, has been promoted to brand CEO of JCPenney.

Founded in 1902, Penney has been struggling for years and filed for bankruptcy in 2020, an early casualty of COVID-19. It emerged from bankruptcy with the help of Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management  the nation's largest mall owners  buying the ailing retailer for $1.75 billion.

The combined Catalyst Brands organization is a joint venture formed in an all-equity transaction between JCPenney and SPARC Group, with shareholders that include Simon Property Group, Brookfield Corporation, Authentic Brands Group and Shein.

The deal involves additional moving pieces: Catalyst Brands has sold the U.S. operations of Reebok and is exploring a sale for Forever 21.

Before joining JC Penney in 2021, Rosen had been president of Levi Strauss Americas and had key roles at Walmart.

Wlazlo will report to Rosen, as will Natalie Levy, brand CEO of Aropostale, Lucky Brand and Nautica. Ken Ohashi continues leading Brooks Brothers and adds responsibility for Eddie Bauer.

The word catalyst reflects our drive to accelerate innovation and energy and amplify the impact of this powerhouse portfolio, Rosen says in the announcement. Together, we bring scale, expertise and broad appeal to customers across America.

While Penneys has made plenty of progress in its recent comeback, department stores continue to lose share, as consumers prefer online and specialty options. In recent years, Kohls, JC Penneys closest rival, has also seen sales wither.

Placer.ai, which tracks store traffic, says that visits to JC Penney have been improving overall. Visits during the fourth quarter fell 3%, a marked improvement from the first quarter decline of 9.2%.

The outlook comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has repeatedly exhorted the industry to ""Drill, baby, drill,"" to maximize oil and gas production and reduce consumer energy costs.
Still, oil prices have fallen this year and many producers remain focused on capital discipline over uninhibited drilling.
""There's a dislocation between the rig count and production, just driven by the efficiencies of more modern rigs, as well as then the production efficiencies,"" he said.
Large producers have not yet indicated any changes to their capital spending plans despite easing oil prices, Simonelli said.","U.S. oil and gas producers are unlikely to increase spending this year and output increases will primarily come from improved efficiencies rather than new drilling, Baker Hughes <BKR.O> Chief Executive Lorenzo Simonelli said on Monday.

Still, oil prices have fallen this year and many producers remain focused on capital discipline over uninhibited drilling.

Capital spending by oil and gas companies will be limited by the wave of consolidation that swept the industry in recent years, Simonelli said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek conference by S&P Global in Houston.

""There's a dislocation between the rig count and production, just driven by the efficiencies of more modern rigs, as well as then the production efficiencies,"" he said.

U.S. crude oil futures have eased to less than $67 a barrel in recent weeks, raising fears that the producers might pull back on drilling. Some companies, including Chevron and rival SLB, have announced plans to restructure and lay off staff.

Baker Hughes does not expect to restructure or reduce its workforce currently, Simonelli said.

Large producers have not yet indicated any changes to their capital spending plans despite easing oil prices, Simonelli said. Smaller producers will react quicker to price inflections, he added.

The estimated loss from the wildfires in January, which killed more than two dozen people and destroyed or damaged more than 16,000 structures, follows an announcement by Germany's Munich Re that it faced about 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in claims from the fires.

Hannover Re, another German reinsurer, forecast claims of 700 million euros while French insurer AXA estimated a pre-tax impact of about 100 million euros.

""We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to those affected by the California fires earlier this year. Although we are still assessing the full impact, we do not expect this to be a capital event,"" Burkhard Keese, Lloyd's chief financial officer, said in a statement.

Lloyd's said the estimated losses were not included in its results for 2024, which it released on Monday in a set of preliminary numbers before its final full-year results are published on March 20.

Keese described 2024 as an ""excellent underwriting year"" for Lloyd's as gross written premiums rose 6.5% on a year-on-year basis to 55.5 billion pounds, thanks primarily to growth in its property and reinsurance divisions.

However, underwriting profit dropped to 5.3 billion pounds, 10% lower than the 5.9 billion pounds it reported for 2023.

Lloyd's said its combined ratio rose to 86.9%, up from 84% in the previous year. The combined ratio is an industry measure, with a reading below 100% meaning earnings from premiums are higher than the amount paid out in claims.

Lloyd's is a commercial insurance and reinsurance market, with more than 50 member companies.

Speetzen's compensation was a little more than Polaris (NYSE: PII) paid him the previous year, according to a filing from Friday. The top executive of the Medina-based maker of snowmobiles and ATVs received most of his pay package in the form of stock and option awards, the filing said. Speetzen's base salary of $1.2 million in 2024 was about the same as it was the year before.

The annual total compensation for a median Polaris employee in 2024 was a little less than $46,000, up from $43,000 the year before. That translates to a CEO-to-employee pay ratio of about 197:1. Polaris said it employed more than 16,000 people on a full-time, part-time or temporary basis in its filing.

2024 was a bumpy year for Polaris. Sales shrank in all three of the company's chief segments (on-road, off-road and marine) as the manufacturer slashed production output to avoid leaving dealers with unwanted inventory. Sales overall fell 20% to $7.17 billion in 2024.

High interest rates, inflation and lower demand from from dealers and consumers contributed to a slower 2024 than originally expected.

2024 presented significant challenges across the powersports industry, leading to a prolonged down cycle, Speetzen told analysts on Polaris' earnings call in January

Polaris is expecting sales to decline another 1% to 4% in 2025, which would put full-year revenue between $6.89 billion and $7.1 billion.

Proposed tariffs have caused another question for Polaris. The company announced earlier this month that it may implement a surcharge on some goods sold in the U.S. if the Trump administration's announce tariffs on Mexican imports continue. Two days after the tariffs initially went into effect, President Donald Trump delayed them for a month, but it's not clear whether the White House will make further changes.

This decision has been heavily deliberated since January, and the Starbucks website says that the changes will continue gradually throughout 2025. This modification is estimated to bring a 30% menu reduction by the end of the fiscal year. The reasoning behind the drastic change is to eliminate duplicate drinks, pursue simplicity and remove items that customers do not commonly purchase.

According to Restaurant Business, the reduction in workers at Starbucks headquarters in Seattle, Washington, was also accompanied by the elimination of hundreds of open positions at the corporate level. The article said that Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol indicated the decisions were made to remove layers and duplication, as well as to create smaller, more nimble teams.

The list of drinks being cut from the menu includes the Caramel Ribbon Crunch Crme Frappuccino, Iced Matcha Lemonade and Honey Almond Milk Flat White, among 10 others.

For clothing companies such as H&M, fast fashion isn't anything new.
As a direct competitor of Zara, H&M has strived for years to become the leader of the fast-fashion industry.
In recent years, several fast-fashion companies have popped up in order to give H&M and Zara a run for their money.
Although fast fashion has been around for decades, we have now begun to see the harmful effects that it has on our planet.","There is certainly nothing wrong with wanting to stay up to date with current fashion trends and the latest styles. However, there is an environmental issue when they rely on the practice of fast fashion.

What's happening?

For clothing companies such as H&M, fast fashion isn't anything new. The desire to constantly evolve and develop rapidly changing clothing collections has been around since the 1980s. Spanish company Zara was among the original pioneers of the fast-fashion movement, paving the way for many other companies to follow suit.

As a direct competitor of Zara, H&M has strived for years to become the leader of the fast-fashion industry. In a recent interview with Reuters, H&M CEO Daniel Erver unveiled the company's bold new strategy in order to compete with Zara and its parent company, Inditex.

""Just competing on lowest price will not cut it for us; we need to step up and raise the bar,"" Erver said, noting a need to produce higher quality clothes that are trendy more quickly. In recent years, several fast-fashion companies have popped up in order to give H&M and Zara a run for their money. In many cases, these companies are able to sell merchandise at a more drastic discount.

However, while the company outlined plans to expand and make clothes ""more trendy"" while speeding up the production process, H&M did not reveal the logistics behind the amount of resources and labor that would be required to make that happen.

Why is the rise of fast fashion important?

Although fast fashion has been around for decades, we have now begun to see the harmful effects that it has on our planet. The UN Environment Programme estimates that fashion production contributes to up to 8% of all pollution on this planet.

Additionally, textile waste is another impactful consequence of the fast-fashion movement. With the fast-moving nature of fast fashion, massive quantities of unsold and out-of-date clothing are often found in our landfills. As a core principle of fast fashion, having the ability to discard an article of clothing when a new style or collection comes out contributes to excessive waste.

As more companies adjust their focus on the fast-fashion industry, the high rate of pollution and textile waste may continue to climb in the next few years. Polluting gases being released from human activity have directly influenced the increasing global temperature.

What's being done about the increasing popularity of fast fashion?

There are plenty of easy-to-do options that you can choose in order to minimize the impact of the fast-fashion industry. Here is a guide to help spot greenwashing and learn of companies that practice ethical business practices. It's also important to support brands and companies that produce eco-friendly products and invest in high-quality clothing over fast fashion, which will ultimately save you money in the long run.

You can also skip the fast-fashion trend and turn to shopping at thrift shops for your next wardrobe change. Not only can you help cut down on textile waste, but you can save some cash as well.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fast-fashionimage-recEb8vCFBQXLiHuj-1.jpg,N,,07:35.6

Couche-Tard last year offered US$47 billion to acquire Seven & I, owner of 7-Eleven, the worlds largest convenience store chain.
In the shareholder letter, Seven & I raised the specter of Krogers failed US$24.6 billion bid to acquire rival supermarket chain Albertsons.
Couche-Tard operates about 7,100 stores in the U.S. and 2,100 stores in Canada under the Circle K name and other brands.
This would provide some insight into the prospects of success along terms that had a reasonable likelihood of satisfying U.S. antitrust regulators and court challenge, Seven & I said.","The parent company of 7-Eleven said Alimentation Couche-Tard agreed to consider divesting about 2,000 Circle K stores in the United States to address potential antitrust concerns that could torpedo a merger of the companies.

Seven & I Holdings said in a letter sent to shareholders Monday that it wont agree to a sale to Couche-Tard unless the Canadian company takes steps related to potential antitrust issues. Couche-Tard last year offered US$47 billion to acquire Seven & I, owner of 7-Eleven, the worlds largest convenience store chain. Seven & I formed a special committee from its board of directors to consider the offer.

In the shareholder letter, Seven & I raised the specter of Krogers failed US$24.6 billion bid to acquire rival supermarket chain Albertsons. A federal judge in December blocked what would have been the largest supermarket merger in U.S. history, citing antitrust concerns.

The cautionary tale of the Albertsons-Kroger transaction clearly demonstrates the risks of consumer-facing retailers looking to divest thousands of stores without a buyer that is market-tested and well positioned to preserve the competitive landscape, Tokyo-based Seven & I said in the letter.

We will not blindly enter a transaction with no clear path to closing that could leave our company in a value destructive limbo for multiple years, Seven & I said.

Seven & I had 13,145 convenience store locations under 7-Eleven, Speedway and other brands in the U.S. and Canada as of September 2024, according to the company's investor presentation from last week. Couche-Tard operates about 7,100 stores in the U.S. and 2,100 stores in Canada under the Circle K name and other brands.

Seven & I proposed three options for Couche-Tard to consider. One would be to divest all its stores in the U.S., including Circle K and other brands, in a clean sweep, taking U.S. antitrust risk off the table, Seven & I said in the shareholder letter.

The second option would be for Couche-Tard to sign a definitive agreement to sell its stores as a condition precedent to the signing of a definitive merger agreement with Seven & I.

In the third option, Couche-Tard and Seven & I could immediately map out the viability of a divestiture process without waiting for a definitive agreement to sell stores. The option would include defining operational, management and financial characteristics of the group of stores to be sold and identifying potential buyers.""

This would provide some insight into the prospects of success along terms that had a reasonable likelihood of satisfying U.S. antitrust regulators and court challenge, Seven & I said.

Couche-Tard has agreed to consider the third option, and the companies financial advisers have begun talks to discuss the matter, Seven & I said. Seven & I did not identify the financial advisers. Couche-Tard, based in Laval, Quebec, did not respond to CoStar News' request for comment.

Last week, Seven & I took another step to address potential concerns about the Couche-Tard bid when it named former Walmart executive Stephen Dacus as CEO, the first American to hold the position. Dacus will spearhead an effort to spin off Seven & Is convenience store business through an initial public offering. Dacus will replace Ryuichi Isaka, who is stepping down in May.

Seven & I also said last week that it agreed to sell its superstore operations and other non-7-Eleven businesses to Bain Capital for US$5.4 billion.

Since receiving the unsolicited bid from Couche-Tard last year, Seven & I explored a potential buyout from the companys founding Ito family but failed to secure necessary financing.

Seven & I also acknowledged in the Monday shareholder letter that institutional shareholder Artisan Partners opposes its plan to name Dacus CEO and wants Seven & I to seriously consider Couche-Tards bid.

We are disappointed that Artisan has prejudged our commitment to pursuing all paths to unlock shareholder value without knowing all the facts, Seven & I said.

According to the latest data from Statista, Mixue Bingcheng has over 45,000 locations worldwide, while McDonald's lags behind with 41,800.

Mixue Bingcheng: The Company That Started from a Small Business

Founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao, Mixue Bingcheng began as an ice cream and cold drinks business, with the idea of offering its products at extremely low prices. Although its presence is mainly limited to China, the chain has also managed to expand to other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

Its affordable pricing strategy, with products like ice cream and tea for less than a dollar, has been key to its rapid expansion. Despite not having a presence in Europe or the United States, Mixue Bingcheng has managed to position itself as the fast-food company with the most locations in the world. Its business model, based on the franchise system, has allowed for unprecedented growth.

The Secret of Its Success

99% of Mixue Bingcheng's establishments are operated by franchisees. This has allowed the chain to expand rapidly without having to bear all the direct costs of each new location. Additionally, the main source of income for Mixue Bingcheng comes from the sale of products, equipment, and packaging to its franchisees.

Despite being the chain with the most restaurants in the world, the company still doesn't surpass other major beverage brands like Starbucks or Tim Hortons in terms of revenue. However, its growth has been remarkable. In the first nine months of 2024, Mixue Bingcheng reported a 42% increase in net profits, reaching 460M euros.

The Challenge for McDonald's and Its Decline in Sales

McDonald's has gone from having a net profit of 2.04 billion dollars in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 2.02 billion in the same period of 2024. Additionally, the chain has faced problems after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) linked an E. coli outbreak to its Quarter Pounder burgers.

Meanwhile, Mixue Bingcheng continues its global expansion. Without having a significant presence in markets like Europe or the United States, it seems to have a promising future thanks to its business model and affordable prices.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-exterior-burger-king-mcdonalds-mixue-bingcheng-desenfocado_1200_800.jpg,N,,04:48.8

CVS Health is choosing not to add many retail products to these locations due to falling sales in that sector. However, some products relevant to its pharmacy operations, such as over-the-counter drugs, will still be available at the mini stores.

CVS Healths decision to focus on its pharmacy operations makes sense as they account for 80% of its sales. Considering the high value of real estate space, it makes sense to maintain a strong pharmacy presence while limiting retail operations. Especially as CVS is going through a period of struggle that has it shuttering many of its stores.

What This Means for CVS Stock

CVS Health focusing more on pharmacy than retail sales could be a boon to the companys stock. Current economic conditions have hampered pharmacy chains with rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) recently announcing a deal to go private after years of struggles.

Todays stock movement has CVS shares up 0.56%. That builds on its 50.46% increase year-to-date and helps erase its 8.16% decrease over the last year. Walgreens going private has been a strong catalyst for CVS stock this year as it will remove one of its rivals from public trading.

Turning to Wall Street, the analysts consensus rating for CVS Health is Strong Buy based on 17 Buy and three Hold ratings over the last three months.

Growth has slowed especially sharply in financial services and consumer-facing industries. However, at least some of the upturn in the goods producing sector reflected the front-running of tariffs, hinting that the revival may prove short-lived. Much will depend on the degree to which business confidence can prove resilient in the face of growing geopolitical and economic uncertainty.

Slower services growth offsets manufacturing improvement

S&P Global Market Intelligence's PMI surveys indicated that the gap in performance between the global services and manufacturing sectors narrowed in February. While manufacturing growth hit the fastest for eight months, services growth waned to a 14-month low. Both rates of expansion were nonetheless only modest. The resulting composite PMI - a GDP-weighted average of the two sectors - fell to its lowest since December 2023, indicating weakened global output growth for a second successive month, as the deteriorating service sector performance overshadowed the upturn in the goods-producing sector.

Healthcare leads upturn as consumer-facing companies and financial services report slowdowns

Looking in more detail, by broad industry the fastest growth was recorded for healthcare, followed by financial services, albeit the latter now down to a 14-month low.

Growth rates meanwhile also slowed for consumer goods and services after solid starts to the year. Companies reported concerns over the pace of consumer spending in the months ahead, as well as concerns over inflation and interest rates, with many forecasters anticipating higher rates of both - notably in the US - than previously anticipated.

The worst performing broad sector, however, was industrials, where output failed to grow for the first time in 14 months, while basic materials also broadly stalled.

In more detail, the fastest growing sector was pharmaceuticals & biotech, with 'other' (non-banking) financials and insurance also faring especially well. Conversely, metals & mining firms led the global contraction for a third straight month, followed by autos & parts manufacturing, which saw output fall for an eighth straight month.

Transportation notably reported a first fall in activity for 14 months. Timber & paper products also fell into decline, as did beverages. However, with five sectors moving out of expansion - notably including machinery & equipment making and construction materials - the total number of sectors in contraction eased from eight to six between January and February.

Tariff impact

A key surprise in the sector data was therefore the improvement in some of these manufacturing sectors, which at face value, appeared at odds with the growing concern over impact of trade protectionism. New orders for machinery and equipment, for example, rose in February for the first time since last June. Orders for construction materials likewise rose for a second month and at the fastest rate for two years.

These two sectors of particular interest as they act as bellwethers of business investment spending, either on kit or premises. This seems odd, given that the survey also showed business confidence sliding in February to one of the lowest seen over the past two years amid increasingly elevated levels of uncertainty. Such an environment is not usually conducive to rising investment spending.

There was instead evidence from the anecdotal information collected on the PMI questionnaires that these manufacturing improvements were often linked to the front-loading of production and sales ahead of tariffs. If so, this upturn could prove short lived. Since these data were collected, the US has announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, upped tariffs from mainland China by 10% (taking these to 20%), and raised the prospect of more tariffs to come, notably on the EU. China and Canada have already responded with various measures against US goods and services.

With February's PMI data having been collected at a time when the US had postponed the implementation of additional tariffs, March's PMI data will therefore come under particular scrutiny to gauge the extent to which these newly applied protectionist measures may be dampening business activity and sentiment.

In September, it reached an agreement to buy General Mills Inc.s US yogurt business, which includes the popular Yoplait brand, a deal the company expects to receive regulatory approval for later this year.

In California, Lactalis has announced a $55 million expansion of a production facility that makes Prsident Feta cheese. The group is also growing the Chicago office it acquired with the Kraft deal  it now has 240 employees in the Windy City, up from just 90 in 2021, and recently rented an additional 13,000 square feet of space in the trendy neighborhood of the West Loop.

Lactalis last month opened a dedicated 200,000-square foot distribution center in Belvidere, Illinois. Owned and operated by Midwest Refrigerated Services, the center will receive products from 10 Lactalis production sites in the US and several co-manufacturing facilities, as well as imports from Europe.

Cheese Reserves

While some companies rushed to stockpile European butter in the US ahead of tariffs, Lactalis said its Prsident product requires regular importing to ensure freshness. Thats key to its appeal to American consumers.

When it comes to Parmigiano Reggiano cheese from Italy, Lactalis is well prepared. The company built a stockpile in the US, in part because of strong availability at its Italian unit. Concerns about port strikes in the US last year also meant Lactalis brought more of the product in. All of that will leave the company well-positioned when tariffs come into force.

Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, a type of Parmesan, is easier to store because it has a longer shelf life. Italian exports of Parmesan and Grana Padano cheese to the US surged 10% from January to November 2024, according to Italian dairy industry market analysis group CLAL.

Lactalis, which also owns brands like Stonyfield Organic and Siggis yogurt and Black Diamond cheese in the US, is also worried about the impact tariffs could have on American farmers. On Friday, Trump proposed a tariff on Canadian dairy that could come soon.

Benchmark Class III milk futures fell almost 16% this year after gaining 29% in 2024.

The US is a big dairy exporter, Clement said. We are facing a big drop in the milk price because there is a big threat that the milk will stay in the US.",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/President_butter_tariffs.jpg,N,,04:45.6

What This Means for CVS Stock CVS Health focusing more on pharmacy than retail sales could be a boon to the companys stock.","CVS Health (CVS) is ditching retail sales to focus on pharmacy operations at 12 new locations opening in 2025. These new CVS stores will offer an incredibly limited amount of retail products to consumers while still running a full pharmacy. To achieve this, the company is focused on opening stores roughly half the size of its typical locations.

CVS Health is choosing not to add many retail products to these locations due to falling sales in that sector. However, some products relevant to its pharmacy operations, such as over-the-counter drugs, will still be available at the mini stores.

CVS Healths decision to focus on its pharmacy operations makes sense as they account for 80% of its sales. Considering the high value of real estate space, it makes sense to maintain a strong pharmacy presence while limiting retail operations. Especially as CVS is going through a period of struggle that has it shuttering many of its stores.

What This Means for CVS Stock

CVS Health focusing more on pharmacy than retail sales could be a boon to the companys stock. Current economic conditions have hampered pharmacy chains with rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) recently announcing a deal to go private after years of struggles.

Todays stock movement has CVS shares up 0.56%. That builds on its 50.46% increase year-to-date and helps erase its 8.16% decrease over the last year. Walgreens going private has been a strong catalyst for CVS stock this year as it will remove one of its rivals from public trading.

Is CVS Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Turning to Wall Street, the analysts consensus rating for CVS Health is Strong Buy based on 17 Buy and three Hold ratings over the last three months. With that comes an average price target of $71.83, a high of $81, and a low of $51. This represents a potential 7.71% upside for CVS stock.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cvstock-750x406.jpg,N,,08:54.0

The CEO of the software giant confirmed the job cuts during the company's first-quarter earnings call on Friday. The workforce reduction program was approved by the board Thursday, according to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company has locations in Spring, where its City Place headquarters campus is located, and Houston, according to its 2024 annual report. In 2020, the company moved its headquarters from San Jose, California to Spring. Hewlett Packard employs more than 60,000 people around the world.

It is not known how many employees in the Houston area would be affected by the job cuts.

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise expects to save around $350 million in costs relating to the cuts, followed by savings of around the same amount by fiscal year 2027. The plan calls for the cuts to take effect through fiscal year 2026.

The CEO is reportedly one of Houston's most highly paid executives, according to the Houston Chronicle. In 2023, his total compensation package was reported at more than $20 million, placing him ninth in the region.

The company's CFO, Marie Myers, said on the conference that the impact of the new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada is also of concern for the upcoming year.

The announcement was made in a Form 6-K report, which is incorporated by reference into Genmabs registration statements.

HexaBody-CD38, a proprietary Genmab technology, was under evaluation by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, for potential therapeutic applications. The decision not to proceed with the program comes directly from Janssen, although specific reasons behind the decision were not disclosed in the filing.

Genmabs Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Anthony Pagano, signed the report dated today, affirming the companys compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Form 6-K report is a routine disclosure that publicly traded foreign companies must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), providing updates on material corporate events.

The 6-K filing also indicates that Genmab, which specializes in the field of pharmaceutical preparations, will continue to file annual reports under Form 20-F, adhering to the regulatory standards set forth by the SEC.

Investors and stakeholders of Genmab A/S, which trades under the ticker symbol (NASDAQ: ), may be attentive to the implications of this development on the companys product pipeline and strategic partnerships. According to InvestingPro analysis, the company appears undervalued based on its Fair Value calculations, with four analysts recently revising their earnings estimates upward for the upcoming period. As the company has multiple ongoing projects and collaborations, the discontinuation of the HexaBody-CD38 program represents a single aspect of its broader research and development efforts, which have generated impressive revenue growth of 30.7% over the last twelve months.

The report is available for public review and serves as an official document that ensures transparency in the operations of foreign companies listed on U.S. exchanges. It is important to note that all the information in this article is based on the statements made in the press release and the SEC filing by Genmab A/S.

In other recent news, Genmab announced that Johnson & Johnson will not proceed with a worldwide license for HexaBody-CD38, despite Genmabs ongoing evaluation of the drugs clinical data. This decision follows a clinical proof-of-concept study that showed a 55% overall response rate for HexaBody-CD38, which was slightly higher than the 52% for DARZALEX FASPRO. Genmabs CEO emphasized the potential of their HexaBody platform and highlighted the strength of their other late-stage assets. Separately, Genmab reported recent managerial share transactions and filed the details with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that ensures transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.

Additionally, Genmab granted restricted stock units and warrants to its management and employees, aligning their interests with shareholders. The company also increased its share capital following the exercise of employee warrants, a common practice to motivate staff by providing them an ownership stake. Genmab has scheduled its annual general meeting, as disclosed in a recent filing, with further details to be announced. These developments reflect Genmabs ongoing efforts in corporate governance and employee incentives.

Fernandez laid out a bold vision for the company, highlighting brand building, strategic marketing, and an innovative approach to commerce that targets the evolving desires of consumers, particularly in premium and luxury segments.

Fernandez emphasized the importance of transforming Unilever into a ""world-class company in terms of brand creation and in market execution."" He acknowledged the solid foundation laid by his predecessor but asserted that his track record is a better fit for leading Unilever through the next phase of transformation.

On Brand Building and Strategic Marketing

Central to Fernandez's strategy is the ambition to build a ""marketing and sales machine"" within Unilever, with a decisive pivot towards ""premiumization"". ""I am really committed to big serious revolution in our superior functionality, aesthetics, sensorials of our brands,"" he explained.

This shift aims to create what Fernandez describes as ""desire at scale,"" a concept he has championed from his tenure in the beauty industry.

The CEO also spoke leveraging influencers and social-first advertising to enhance brand equity and consumer engagement. ""Creating marketing activity systems in which others can speak for your brand is very, very important,"" Fernandez noted.

He plans to employ influencers extensively, aiming to have a presence that resonates deeply with local markets across the globe.

His approach includes a significant increase in digital content creation and influencer partnerships. ""There are 19,000 zip codes in India. There are 5,764 municipalities in Brazil. I want one influencer in each of them,"" he emphasized.

This strategy is part of a broader move to increase brand and marketing investments, which have risen from 13% to over 15% of sales in recent years.

Quick Commerce and Luxury Markets

Fernandez also addressed the rise of quick commerce, particularly in emerging markets like India, where he foresees this channel expanding significantly. ""We expect quick commerce to be 10-15% [of sales] in the next three, four years,"" he predicted.

This approach is tailored to meet the demands of discerning luxury consumers who value convenience and exclusivity.

Moreover, Fernandez sees significant opportunities in emerging markets such as India and the US, which he identifies as future geographical anchors for Unilever. ""In the long run, as I mentioned, make US and India a key, two key anchors of our portfolio. Make our brands, make our best brand travel fast,"" he explained.

He stressed the importance of adapting to rapid changes in consumer preferences and channel dynamics, especially in markets like China and Indonesia.

Although Best Buys Q4 performance beat analyst and company expectations, the first quarter and fiscal year are uncertain as tariffs are likely to drive up prices for consumer electronics, CEO Corie Barry said during a Tuesday earnings call.
Dive Insight: On March 3, President Donald Trump ordered 20% tariffs on products from China.
She said the company closed 12 traditional big-box format stores in the U.S. and opened two new stores.
This year, Barry said the company plans to close five to 10 stores and open a few smaller format stores.","Dive Brief:

Best Buys fourth-quarter revenue fell 4.7% year over year to $13.9 billion, while comparable sales rose 0.5%, the company reported Tuesday. Domestic revenue fell 5% to $12.7 billion.

The company saw operating income decline 61.3% from the year-ago period to $217 million and net income fall about 75% to $117 million.

Although Best Buys Q4 performance beat analyst and company expectations, the first quarter and fiscal year are uncertain as tariffs are likely to drive up prices for consumer electronics, CEO Corie Barry said during a Tuesday earnings call.

Dive Insight:

On March 3, President Donald Trump ordered 20% tariffs on products from China. The next day, 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico took effect, although the duties have since been delayed until April 2 for imports covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical, and complex, Barry said according to a call transcript. China and Mexico remain the No. 1 and No. 2 sources for products we sell, respectively. While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.

Best Buy issued guidance for the upcoming fiscal year that forecasts revenue ranging from $41.4 billion to $42.2 billion and comparable sales ranging from flat to 2%. But the company said its latest fiscal outlook doesnt reflect the effects of recently enacted tariffs because theres still uncertainty about the details and the response it will draw from U.S. consumers and international trading partners.

However, Barry said based on the companys analysis, if the 10% tariffs on products from China that began last month remained in effect for the rest of this year, comp sales would be negatively impacted.

Barry said the company is continuing to refine its physical footprint. She said the company closed 12 traditional big-box format stores in the U.S. and opened two new stores. This year, Barry said the company plans to close five to 10 stores and open a few smaller format stores.

The company plans to continue its rollout of dedicated spaces to showcase new tech. Barry also said that the companys three-tiered membership and loyalty program currently has nearly 8 million paid members  up from 7 million last year  and about 100 million overall across all tiers.

Still, Best Buy faces rising competition from other big-box stores like Walmart or Lowes encroaching on its territory, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in emailed comments. While Best Buy is on the right track by working to make its stores destination spaces, Saunders said the retailer should better communicate the value of its digital shopping offering.

Looking ahead, he said the companys guidance for Q1, which anticipates negative comps with growth possible for the following quarters suggests that Best Buys decline may be bottoming out. As a brand, Best Buy is well regarded, Saunders said. It is also trusted. So, in our view, there is a very solid base from which to build.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/b3dHsu5FExLVDADZnReQW7KE4Ow672ufUNQtiC_4zpM/g:nowe:84:244/c:1178:665/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMjQzNC5qcGVn.webp,N,,08:47.8

The companyone of the global leaders in property and liability insurance for businessescame close to that target. In 2024, AXAs revenue from written premiums totaled R$1.9 billion, nearly 12% higher than the previous year.

Our plan now is to move from a still small position to a stronger one in a country with a solid population base and strong fundamentals, AXA CEO Thomas Buberl said in an interview with Valor.

During his visit to Brazil in February, Mr. Buberl outlined three key pillars for the companys local expansion: increasing its market share in the corporate segment, developing products that support the green transitionin which Brazil plays a very important roleand promoting social inclusion by offering insurance solutions for consumers who have yet to access this type of protection.

For now, AXA does not plan to enter the health insurance segment, one of its key global businesses. When asked about the possibility of expanding into this area in Brazil, Mr. Buberl said he does not yet have a definitive answer.

We are probably one of the strongest health insurers internationally, so we always explore opportunities to bring that expertise to other countries. However, in Brazil, the health insurance market is very consolidated. If we were to enter this segment, we would need to find a way to differentiate ourselves from already established companies, which likely would not be easy.

Beyond market expansion and insurance penetration in Brazil, AXA is closely monitoring the impact of climate change on the country. According to Mr. Buberl, the level of risk associated with climate events in Brazil is likely higher today, given recent disasters such as the April 2024 floods in Rio Grande do Sul.

The catastrophe in southern Brazil was one of the most significant events for the local insurance industry, comparable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which lasted over two years. Total insurance claims related to the floods reached R$6.08 billion, according to data from CNseg, the countrys insurance industry federation. For comparison, the pandemic resulted in R$7 billion in claims across the market.

With climate events becoming more frequent worldwide, addressing these risks means investing in damage prevention as well, Mr. Buberl said. Consider two hurricanes in the United StatesKatrina (2005) and Irma (2017). Both followed similar paths, but costs declined significantly over those 12 years because prevention measures improved.

Regarding the wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year, he noted that concrete buildings survived, while wooden structures burned completely. Its heartbreaking to see people suffer, especially knowing that some of these losses could have been prevented, he said.

Mr. Buberl emphasized that one of insurers key roles is ensuring cities remain insurable, which is only possible with preventive measures. If we help our clients prevent the next disaster, we create a positive impact.

In 2024, AXAs global revenue, including written premiums and other income, grew 8% to 110 billion. Net profit rose 11% to 7.9 billion.

New York (CNN)  CVS is looking to grow itself by shrinking.

Declaring itself the worlds largest advertising group (by net revenue), Publicis Groupe kicked off Adlands earnings season today -- reporting fourth-quarter organic net revenue growth of 6.3%. For full-year 2024 organic growth (which excludes M&A and currency impact) was 5.8%.

Full-year net revenue totaled 13.97 billion euros ($14.4 billion) -- up 6.6% -- and Q4 net revenue was nearly 3.9 billion euros ($4 billion), up 8.9%.

The Groupes operating profit margin for the full year was just over 18%.

Company shares were up about 2% on the Paris exchange Tuesday morning after it released its earnings report.

As for 2025, the company indicated that it was confident that it would achieve full-year organic growth of between 4% and 5%.

The low end of the projection (4%) would be achieved in current market conditions. At the top end, the Groupe said it could deliver 5% if the macroeconomic environment improves, which would result in less cuts in traditional advertising and a resumption of client spend on digital business transformation projects.

In Q1 2025, the Groupe expects to deliver organic growth within the full year range.

Arthur Sadoun, chairman and CEO of Publicis Groupe stated: Thanks to a very strong Q4, Publicis became the largest advertising company in the world in 2024. We are ending the year in the number one position across the board, growing three times faster than our holding company peers, and five times faster than the IT consultancies.""

We delivered industry-high financial ratios while stepping up the pace of our investments in AI and talent. Once again, we topped the charts in new business rankings. But even more importantly, we are accelerating on our status as a Category of One thanks to our unmatched 1st-party data capabilities, our connected media ecosystem, our creative firepower, and our 25,000 engineers, brought together through the Power of One. This makes us confident in significantly outperforming the industry in 2025 for the 6th year in a row.

The claim to being the top holding company will not be official until the other major firms report their results.

Omnicom reports later today, and WPP is expected to report later in the month.

But even Publicis has acknowledged that if the Omnicom-IPG merger goes through later this year, that entity will become the worlds largest ad group, albeit with plenty of growth opportunity for Publicis.

In North America, organic growth was 5.1% for the full year. The U.S.-- the Groupes largest region, and where its model is the most advanced -- posted 4.9% growth.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/02/04/publogo_E8dpuyX.png,N,,04:42.6

Key Points

- Starbucks is the largest coffee chain in the world, boasting over 40,500 stores globally, both company-operated and licensed, where coffee and food are sold.

- Over the past year, Starbucks has been in a mini-crisis with declining same-store sales, caused by less foot traffic and aggressive expansion, ignoring the core customer satisfaction

- With the appointment of Brian Niccol as a CEO, the company plans to revitalize the operations with more advertising, simple menu options, store renovations and further digitalization

- There are certain challenges and risks, but Starbucks has the capability to limit the effects

- At the current price, the company is not exactly cheap, but the path to improvement in operations is clear, which will bring some upside potential

Company Overview

TradingKey - Starbucks Corporation is the leading roaster and retailer of specialty coffee globally. In addition to fresh, freshly brewed coffees, Starbucks offerings include many complimentary food items and a selection of premium teas and other beverages, sold mainly through the companys retail stores.

Source: SEC Filings, TradingKey

Starbucks currently has a network of over 40,000 stores  both company operated and licensed:

Company-Owned Stores: Starbucks' company-owned segment represents most of the company's revenue and includes all its stores worldwide. These are owned and managed directly by Starbucks. The company handles all aspects of operations, including staffing, inventory and store management. Revenue from company-operated stores is recognized when the sale occurs. This includes sales of beverages, food and other products directly to customers in the stores.

Licensed Stores: These are owned and operated by independent licensees. Starbucks provides the branding, products and operational guidelines, but the day-to-day management is handled by the licensee. The revenue here is generated through royalties, initial non-refundable fees and sales of products and equipment to the licensees.

A small amount of Starbucks-branded products such as packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and other retail locations.

Source: SEC Filings, TradingKey

Within Starbucks stores, beverages are the main product, with over 60% of the total revenue. Food is the second highest revenue source with nearly 20% and the rest is from selling beverage-related ingredients, server ware and ready-to-drink beverages.

Source: SEC Filings, TradingKey

Despite its global outreach, Starbucks revenue is significantly concentrated in the US market, which represents 75% of the top line. China, another important market, represents less than 10%.

Source: SEC Filings, TradingKey

In the US, Starbucks market share has been between 64%-66% in terms of revenue and around 54%-55% in terms of stores. The higher revenue market share compared to the store market share implies that Starbucks is positioning itself as a rather high-end brand.

Recent challenges

Despite stable store growth in recent years, Starbucks' revenue has sharply decelerated to zero or slightly negative growth. This implies sales per store have taken a significant hit, likely due to lower traffic and eroded brand value.

Source: SEC Filings, TradingKey

There are a few reasons behind this sluggish performance:

Customer Experience Issues: Starbucks struggled with maintaining a consistent customer experience, which affected customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Increased Competition: In the U.S., Starbucks competes with players like Dunkin' Donuts and McCaf. In China, intensified competition from local brands like Luckin Coffee has impacted its market share and sales.

Rapid Expansion: Compared to other food chains, Starbucks' store growth has been relatively faster. Often, overly rapid expansion leads to quality control issues and brand value dilution.

High Expectations from the New CEO

In September 2024, Brian Niccol joined Starbucks as CEO, a move seen as quite significant. Niccol was previously the CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill. During his six-year tenure at the Mexican fast-food chain, he doubled the revenue and increased the profit sevenfold, with Chipotle's share price rising eightfold during that period.

Starbucks shares rose 25% on the day of the announcement, reflecting the high expectations investors have for Niccol. He introduced the ""Back to Starbucks"" plan, which focuses on simplifying operations, reducing menu complexity and improving efficiency and overall employee satisfaction.

Workforce Changes: As part of the restructuring, Starbucks laid off 1,100 workers and closed several unfilled positions to streamline operations and save on G&A expenses.

Less discounts but more TV promotions: Promotions have significantly reduced and the savings have been re-invested in national promotions/TV ads that are seen to have a higher return over time.

Menu simplification: The company discussed a 30% reduction in menu size for both beverage and food in order to cut the lower sales/higher waste items that add unnecessary complexity to the system. This will improve the speed and consistency with variety and customization at scale.

Investment in stores: This includes a well-stocked lobby and a grab-and-go section, as well as equipment such as seating and lighting. The expected capex for 2025 is around $2.8-3.0 billion, just a slight increase from 2024. If the majority of the capex is a maintenance capex, the assumed budget per store will be in the range of $100,000, a sufficient amount for this kind of renovation work.

Digital Innovation: Emphasizing on enhancing Starbucks' digital capabilities, including expanding mobile ordering and delivery service.

Risks and Mitigants

Coffee Prices Concern: The current spot price of coffee is at an all-time high of $400, well above the 10-year average of $150. Starbucks has coverage in place for the coming years, but in the past 5-6 years, the company has moved away from fully hedging the raw material price to avoid the collateral needed for such contracts.

Currently, green coffee represents 10-15% of the cost of goods sold, which is 3-4% of revenue. This means that a realized 100% increase in landed coffee prices could be offset by a 3-4% increase in menu pricing.

Source: Trading Economics

Competition: In recent years we have seen an increase in competition but somehow, the market share of Starbucks has remained rather stable, despite all the strategic missteps. With the number of new improvements, there is a high chance of seeing market share gains in the coming quarters.

Source: JP Morgan

Consumption Headwinds: An increasing number of companies have recently reported a slowdown in consumption, which could imminently affect Starbucks. However, there are several reasons to believe the negative impact may not be as severe:1) Even though Starbucks is a premium brand, the ticket size is relatively small compared to bigger-ticket items like clothing, cars and real estate. This implies that consumers may not immediately forgo buying coffee; 2 Starbucks' target customers are people with relatively higher education and earning power. This social group is likely to be less severely affected during economic downturns. 3) Starbucks has a robust loyalty program that helps retain customers long-term.

Outlook and Valuation

We expect the store count growth to decelerate from mid-single to low single digits, as management focuses on improving existing stores. Revenue per store will start to see positive growth in 2026, implying a high-single-digit increase in total revenue from 2026 onwards.

In terms of profitability, Starbucks has lower margins than other large chains, primarily because it operates a significant number of directly operated stores, unlike its peers that mostly use a franchising model. Starbucks' margin for 2024 dipped to 15%, but we expect a recovery in 2026 and 2027.

Source: Bloomberg Intelligence

With this number in mind, the expected earnings per share for 2026 is around $4.00. Currently, the company is traded at 26x 2026 PE ratio, which is within the historical average for the stock.",,N,,08:10.9

However, one thing is clear: the U.S. grocery industry is at a pivotal moment, and the next moves from Kroger and Albertsons will be closely watched.","The recent leadership shake-ups at Kroger and Albertsons have raised questions about whether these departures are mere coincidences or part of a larger strategic move. Both companies, which have been embroiled in legal disputes following the halted merger attempt, announced new CEOs within days of each other.

Rodney McMullen, Krogers long-standing chairman and CEO, resigned following an internal investigation into his personal conduct. While the company insists that his departure is unrelated to financial performance or operations, it comes at a critical time when Kroger is facing labor disputes and challenges in its acquisition of Albertsons. His replacement, Ronald Sargent, has served on Krogers board for nearly two decades and brings a background from Staples, where he oversaw retail operations and corporate strategy.

Meanwhile, Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran announced his retirement, making way for Susan Morris, a veteran of the company with deep roots in its operations. Her appointment signals continuity, but her leadership will be crucial as Albertsons navigates its legal fight with Kroger.

The timing of these leadership changesjust months after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) blocked the mergersuggests more than coincidence. Some industry analysts speculate that both companies are repositioning themselves for another attempt at consolidation, potentially adjusting their leadership to gain regulatory approval or redefine their strategies in the face of increasing competition from Walmart and Amazon. Others believe the leadership changes reflect deeper internal challenges, from labor disputes to operational inefficiencies, that require fresh perspectives at the helm.

Whether this marks the beginning of a renewed merger push or merely a parallel shift in leadership remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: the U.S. grocery industry is at a pivotal moment, and the next moves from Kroger and Albertsons will be closely watched.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-cropped-isn_corporation_logo-1-32x32.webp,N,,04:25.8

Non-GAAP operating profit growth is expected between negative 10% and 0%.
In its first quarter fiscal 2025 results, HPE reported revenue of $7.9bn, marking a 16% increase from the previous year.
The operating profit margin for servers stood at 8.1%, compared to 11.4% in the prior year period.
The operating profit margin for Hybrid Cloud improved significantly to 7%, up from 4% in the previous year.","Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has announced a decision to cut its workforce by approximately 2,500 roles following weaker-than-expected results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. CEO Antonio Neri communicated that around 3,000 employees might leave the organisation, with an additional 500 expected to exit through natural attrition, as reported by Bloomberg.

The announcement comes in the wake of a significant 19% decline in HPEs stock value during extended trading sessions. This downturn occurred after the company presented a more cautious outlook during its earnings call. We took actions in the quarter to streamline costs, which helped us offset other impacts to profitability, said Myers. We continue to align our strategy and execution with long-term growth trends that will fuel our performance.

HPE is implementing a cost-cutting initiative aimed at reducing structural operating costs while focusing on profitable growth. This plan will be executed through fiscal year 2026 and aims to achieve gross savings of around $350m by fiscal year 2027 via workforce reductions. To realise these savings, the edge-to-cloud company anticipates incurring cash charges of $350m over two years, with roughly $250m expected in fiscal year 2025, and the remaining $100m in fiscal year 2026.

Despite a surge in demand driven by AI technologies, high expenses associated with AI components have led to lower profit margins for HPE than anticipated. Additionally, HPE faced surplus inventory following Nvidias switch to Blackwell GPUs, leading to significant discounts on older servers.

Looking ahead, HPE projects fiscal 2025 revenue growth between 7% and 11%, while forecasting GAAP operating profit growth ranging from negative 24% to negative 9%. Non-GAAP operating profit growth is expected between negative 10% and 0%. The company also estimates GAAP diluted net earnings per share (EPS) between $1.15 and $1.35, with non-GAAP diluted net EPS projected between $1.7 and $1.9. For fiscal year 2025, HPE anticipates generating approximately $1bn in free cash flow.

The challenges are not limited to HPE, as its parent company, HP, has also undergone workforce reductions, recently cutting around 2,000 positions.

In its first quarter fiscal 2025 results, HPE reported revenue of $7.9bn, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. The operating profit margin for servers stood at 8.1%, compared to 11.4% in the prior year period. There was a notable increase in the companys server revenue, which reached $4.3bn. This figure represents a 29% rise from the same period last year.

Regulatory challenges with Juniper Networks acquisition

HPEs Intelligent Edge segment experienced a downturn, with revenue declining to $1.1bn, marking a 5% decrease compared to the previous year. The operating profit margin for this segment was 27.4%, down from 29.4% a year earlier. Conversely, Hybrid Cloud revenue saw growth, increasing to $1.4bn, which is a 10% rise from the prior-year period in actual dollars and an 11% increase when accounting for currency variations. The operating profit margin for Hybrid Cloud improved significantly to 7%, up from 4% in the previous year.

Meanwhile, HPE continues to encounter regulatory obstacles concerning its planned acquisition of Juniper Networks for $14bn. Although the European Union has approved the deal, antitrust authorities in both the UK and US have cited competition concerns. In late January, the US Department of Justice filed a legal challenge seeking to block the merger, arguing it would concentrate market power significantly. In response, HPE and Juniper intend to dispute these claims in court, with proceedings set to begin on 9 July 2025. The companies maintain that the merger would enhance competition and strengthen the US networking infrastructure by offering more innovation and choices for customers.",https://www.techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/03/shutterstock_1472085176.webp,N,,03:39.7

CVS this year will rollout smaller format locations in at least a dozen locations, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend. This comes as CVS main rival Walgreens Boots Alliance works on a financial turnaround, closes hundreds of stores and prepares for private ownership after Walgreens last week announced a $10 billion sale to Sycamore Partners.

We plan to open a dozen or more smaller format CVS Pharmacy locations in select communities nationally over the next year, CVS confirmed Sunday in a statement. The new pharmacies will be introduced in select neighborhoods to help bridge gaps in care and make it easier for patients to access medications, immunizations, and other pharmacist-provided health care services.

New and smaller formats are not new for either CVS or Walgreens, which was opening small stores in 2019.

But the push for new sizes and formats has taken on more urgency because both companies have large amounts of debt and face escalating pressure from flat or falling sales of general merchandise in the front of their stores.

Meanwhile, both companies own or lease real estate and dont need as much space in their stores as more Americans shop online and traditional drugstores like CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens face more pressure from the likes of Amazon as well as developments in technology and prescription distribution that give patients less need to physically come into a store.

CVS has already been reformatting stores they have closed to include a traditional pharmacy as well as a senior center that includes medical care providers, social workers and community activities operated by Oak Street Health, which CVS paid $10 billion for two years ago.

CVS says the smaller drugstore format is in keeping with a customized approach to its footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve and to better support patient and ensure the right geographic coverage.

CVS closed 900 stores between 2022 and 2024 and plans to close another 270 this year. Meanwhile, Walgreens is in the process of closing 1,200 of its 8,500 stores in the U.S. over three years. And just last year, Rite Aid emerged from federal bankruptcy protection as a more regional drugstore chain operating in 16 states after shedding more than 500 stores during the bankruptcy proceedings.

Still, CVS said closing stores doesnt mean exiting markets and 85% Americans still live within 10 miles of its retail pharmacies. The company has also been opening pharmacies including 100 stores between 2022 and 2024 and has plans to open nearly 30 CVS Pharmacy locations, including those inside Target stores, in 2025, in addition to the new small-format pharmacies, the company said.

We plan to open a dozen or more smaller format CVS Pharmacy locations in select communities nationally over the next year, CVS said in its statement. The new pharmacies will be introduced in select neighborhoods to help bridge gaps in care and make it easier for patients to access medications, immunizations, and other pharmacist-provided health care services. Each location will average less than 5,000 square feet, will feature a full-service pharmacy with limited over-the-counter products available for purchase and will be designed to meet the communitys specific pharmacy needs.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67ce48e7a5d45c2e8028f2f0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,02:14.7

2025 RTIH INNOVATION AWARDS Supply chain technology will be a key focus area at the 2025 RTIH Innovation Awards.","Starbucks is saddled with Stone Age supply chain technology, according to Brittain Ladd, a consultant and former Amazon executive.

In a LinkedIn post, he said that he had spent the last week communicating, off the record, with current and former executives, directors and managers from Starbucks, specifically, the individuals responsible for the supply chain part of the business.

He commented: ""I approached the discussions with a preconceived notion: Starbucks former CEOs; Howard Schultz, Kevin Johnson, and Laxman Narasimhan, all failed to invest the necessary capital to design and equip Starbucks with the optimal supply chain.

Based on the discussions, I was right. I place the blame for the Stone Age supply chain primarily at the feet of Schultz. Johnson had minimal understanding of the importance of supply chain technology, and Narasimhan was out of his depth the minute he became CEO.""

Over the years, former Chief Supply Chain Officers, VPs and SVPs, had clearly outlined the gaps in Starbucks supply chain related to technology and the sub optimised logistics network, Ladd observed. ""On multiple occasions, funding was promised to close the gaps only to be withdrawn. This forced the supply chain organisation to have to keep Starbucks mediocre supply chain operating without the right software tools, logistics facilities, and budget.""

Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol is making the right moves, Ladd believes. However, he has to do more than proclaim that it takes too long to get products to the stores, and that the stores run out of inventory too frequently. In short, he must invest in the supply chain

Starbucks should replace its antiquated supply chain software with best-in-class tech with a focus on DeepSeek AI, Manus, and Solvoyo. The company is using software from o9 Solutions. ""Why are Starbucks locations still running out of products so frequently? Is it the platform or is Starbucks not using the platform correctly? Its inexcusable that it cant keep products stocked in their stores,"" Ladd said.

He added: ""I strongly suggest that Brian Niccol meet with Leo Laranjieria of MIT, to discuss the supply chain that Starbucks must have to meet customer demand and eliminate stores running out of inventory. Dr. Laranjeira should be hired as an advisor reporting directly to Niccol.""

""The fastest way to grow and increase revenue is by selling more food (real food. Not the garbage theyre currently selling). Niccol should contact Marc Lore of Wonder and discuss a partnership. Regardless of the food being sold, it has to be in-stock when customers place an order.""

Ladd concluded: ""I applaud what Niccol is doing. However, without a significant investment in technology, network optimisation, and better inventory optimisation, the supply chain will remain broken. The purpose of a supply chain is to do one thing - enable growth. Dont make the same mistakes that the other CEOs made, Brian. Invest in the supply chain.""

Supply chain technology will be a key focus area at the 2025 RTIH Innovation Awards.

The awards. which will open for entries in March, celebrate global tech innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world.

He added: Congratulations to all of our finalists. Many submissions did not make it through to the final stage, and getting to this point is no mean feat. Checkout-free stores, automated supply chains, immersive experiences, on-demand delivery, next generation loyalty offerings, inclusive retail, green technology. Weve got all the cool stuff covered this evening.

A decades-old McDonald's menu has been unearthed, revealing long-lost items that many believe should make a swift comeback. The vintage McDonald's menu was found on the wall of a branch back in 1993 and captured by a Daily Mirror photographer.

The image was rediscovered in the Mirrorpix photographic archives. In Liverpool, the first McDonald's restaurant in the city opened its doors on Lord Street in November 1985.

To put things into perspective, in 1993 when the photo of the menu was taken, the Premier League had just started and Jurassic Park was out in cinemas. The first high-speed train made its journey through the Channel Tunnel which wouldn't open to the public until the following year, and Jodie Comer was born. Now, let's talk about the prices on the menu.

Of course, inflation and the ongoing cost of living crisis has played a significant role but it's still quite something to see a Big Mac on the menu for 1.79 while a Quarter Pounder with cheese was a mere 1.81.

There's no doubt a 1990s McDonald's milkshake seemed to take more effort to suck up through a straw - but back then you could buy a large triple thick milkshake for just 1.14 but if you wanted to take it away, it was only 97p.

Previously McDonald's offered three sizes of french fries: large for 1.05, medium at 84p, and regular costing only 57p. But what's stands out from the 1993 menu are the items that have since disappeared from the McDonald's menu.

Take, for instance, the English strawberry trifle, which was described as ""A fresh cream trifle with rich strawberry fruit jelly and sponge on a layer of dairy cream custard with rosettes of fresh cream."" The exact year McDonald's removed the trifle from their offerings is uncertain, but one online commenter recalled enjoying a 'surprisingly tasty' one at an airport back in 1993.

Another gem from the past that fans would love to see make a comeback is the McDonald's Big Breakfast. This meal included a buttered English muffin, hash brown, sausage patty, and scrambled eggs, all for a mere 1.29.

The 1993 menu described the Big Breakfast as: ""Two eggs scrambled in butter served with a pure pork sausage patty together with a toasted buttered English muffin and a delicious portion of deep fried has brown potatoes.""",https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article24001129.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LG_MEN_23996421_McDonalds_menu_1993_blur.jpg,N,,00:36.7

The Congress govt claims to have provided job opportunities to 42,000 youth in its two-year tenure.
Even the state govt used to utilise this amount for the payment of salaries and pensions.","Shimla: As Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu is set to present the Congress govt's third budget on March 17 as finance minister, his competence will be judged better from resource mobilisation measures to steer the hill state out of the mounting debt.

With politics of freebies over the decades, limited revenue resources, increasing dependence on the central govt for financial needs, and shrinking flexibility to come up with policies to address the state's unique needs in the federal system, the cash-strapped state's debt has continued to surge from Rs 47,906 crore in 2018 to Rs 86,589 crore in the 2024 fiscal year. It is projected to touch Rs 1 lakh crore in 2025-26 fiscal. Himachal Pradesh's per capita debt now stands at Rs 1.17 lakh, the highest in the country after Arunachal Pradesh, another hill state in the north-east.

Sukhu-led govt's claims of adopting ""fiscal prudence"" measures notwithstanding, the ""Sukh Ki Sarkar"" has been unable to disburse the social security pension for the last five months to various categories, including the elderly, widows, and specially abled. The state govt, which claims to be moving ahead with the motto of ""vyavastha parivartan"" (institutional change) to make the state self-reliant by 2027, caught national headlines when 2.42 lakh govt employees waited until Sept 5 and 1.89 lakh retirees until Sept 10 last year for their Aug salary and pension, respectively. The fiscal situation continues to be grim as nearly 8,500 pensioners of the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) waited for their Jan pension until the third week of Feb this year. Various pensioners' associations continue to protest against the state govt, demanding the release of their pending arrears of the last pay commission, 11% dearness relief, and reimbursement of medical bills. At the same time, the Centre has been blaming the Himachal govt for not timely providing its share in various schemes, resulting in delays in development projects.

Major Challenges

Though, like many other states, BJP as well as Congress govts in Himachal have also been indulging in understating fiscal deficits, exploiting loopholes in the accounting system by delaying payments, they have faced major hurdles in mopping up revenue figures fudged in the budget document. Therefore, it is to be seen whether chief minister Sukhu intends to make corrections this time in the balance sheet and also reduce the total outlay of the budget for the next fiscal year.

Another significant challenge for Himachal continues to be the substantial proportion of contingent liabilities, including natural calamities, and fiscal imprudence during such events resulting in a growing debt-to-gross state domestic product (GSDP) ratio. One such example is the state govt's special relief package of Rs 4,500 crore to affected families of the monsoon disaster in 2023. The state still awaits Rs 9,042 crore from the Centre as per the post-disaster need assessment (PDNA).

Also, 14 different kinds of subsidies are being provided to the people in Himachal since the previous BJP govt was in power. The state govt has to bear the burden of around Rs 2,200 crore on account of power subsidy to beneficiaries in the financial year 2024-25. Further, out of the Rs 58,444 crore budget for the current fiscal year 2024-25, the state govt would spend Rs 33,463 crore on its committed liabilities  including salaries, pensions, and loan interest  and this comes to 79% of the state's estimated revenue receipts. The state govt disburses Rs 1,200 crore as monthly salary to its 2.42 lakh employees and Rs 800 crore as a pension to 1.89 lakh retirees every month. Therefore, the state is left with much less amount for its capital expenditure and development activities. With the increase in life expectancy, the number of pensioners is bound to increase, putting an additional burden on the state exchequer.

Moreover, blaming the previous BJP govt for the fiscal mess is not going to help the incumbent Congress govt since the Sukhu govt has entered its third year. Now the electorates want solutions and fulfilment of pre-poll promises, including Rs 1,500 per month to women and one lakh jobs per year to youth, which needs provision in the budget. The Congress govt claims to have provided job opportunities to 42,000 youth in its two-year tenure.

Dependency on Market Borrowing

The Congress govt has taken Rs 30,080 crore as loan in the past over two years, up to March this year, and out of this, Rs 18,054 crore (60%) has been spent on servicing loans and interest of the previous borrowings. As the Congress govt implemented its poll promise of restoring the old pension scheme (OPS) to 1.36 lakh govt employees, the central govt reduced its borrowing limit by Rs 1,600 crore, and around Rs 9,000 crore under the new pension scheme (NPS) is still held up with the Centre. To add to the hill state's woes, the post-devolution revenue deficit grant (RDG) by the central govt has been continuously decreasing from Rs 10,300 crore in 2021-22, and the state is projected to receive Rs 3,257 crore in the 2025-26 fiscal year. Even the state govt used to utilise this amount for the payment of salaries and pensions.

The fast food chain that surpassed McDonald's is based in Asia and known for its soft-serve ice cream cones costing 15 cents and beverages between 30 cents to $1.20.

Of the chain's 45,000's locations, not one of them is in the United States and 90% of them are in China.

Other locations include Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia.

The company was founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao and started out selling shaved ice along with cold beverages.

Let people around the world eat well and drink well for just two American dollars, Hongchao told Chinese state media about how he runs his business.

More than 99% of the Mixue Bingcheng stores are franchised leaving most of its revenue to come from selling food equipment, materials and packaging to its franchises.

The move aims to provide 'better experiences for its customers and workers', citing issues such as broken machines and incorrect orders. McDonald's Chief Technology Officer Brian Rice has been insistent on the benefits of the new AI-powered tools, highlighting the stressful work environment, and the volume of orders for customers.

""Our restaurants, frankly, can be very stressful. We have customers at the counter, we have customers at our drive-through, couriers coming in for delivery, delivery at curbside. That's a lot to deal with for our crew,"" Rice said in an interview. ""Technology solutions will alleviate the stress.""

One of the defining characteristics of McDonalds is efficiency - and the brand has been experimenting with new technology and workflows since its inception. By 2023, the company opened its first automated restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, and last year, they began testing for AI-powered drive-throughs. While McDonald's frames these innovations as ways to improve efficiency and customer experience, they are a business. With a slow Q1 and an aggressive goal to grow its customer base from 175 million to 250 million by 2027, there's no doubt that these overhauls will fundamentally change the role of human workers in its restaurants.

Which highlights a broader issue - not just for McDonald's 2 million employees, but the fast-food industry as a whole. The World Economic Forum estimates AI and automation could displace up to 92 million jobs globally by 2030, with retail and food service among the most affected. Robotics and intelligence systems have also been introduced for major brands, including Taco Bell, Chick-fil-A and Wendy's.

While it will take time before we see the effects on staffing, one thing is clear-innovation won't come without a cost.",https://static.tweaktown.com/news/1/0/103774_20250309135912_mcdonalds-claims-43-000-restaurant-ai-overhaul-is-to-alleviate-stress-for-employees_full.png,N,,54:39.1

Liverpool have learned exactly how much they generated from their partnership with Nike during the 2023/24 season following UEFAs latest European Club Finance and Investment Landscape study.

The figures, published this week, confirm that the Merseyside club brought in a substantial 122.8 million from their collaboration with the American sportswear giant. This sum places Liverpool joint-fourth among European clubs for kit and merchandising revenue, alongside Manchester United.

Only Real Madrid (164.8m), Bayern Munich (143.8m), and Barcelona (143.8m) outperformed Liverpool in this regard.

This represents a 9.7 million increase on their 2022/23 figures, when the club earned 113.1 million from their Nike arrangement, according to UEFAs previous reports.

Nike Deal Nears End as Adidas Return Expected

Liverpools current agreement with Nike, which began in 2020, is widely expected to conclude on 30 June 2025. Multiple reports indicate that German manufacturer Adidas is poised to take over from 1 July 2025, marking a return to a brand that previously supplied the clubs kits from 1985 to 1996 and 2006 to 2012.

The anticipated Adidas partnership is reportedly a five-year agreement running until 2030, though neither the club nor the brand have publicly confirmed the terms.

Why Liverpools Nike Deal Was Unique

When Liverpool initially signed with Nike, the base fee of 30 million per season raised eyebrows, as it was lower than the 45 million per year previously received from New Balance. However, the structure of the contract was vastly different.

Rather than relying on a fixed annual sum, Liverpools deal with Nike was built around royalty-based earnings, ensuring the club profited significantly from global kit and merchandise sales. This model has allowed the club to see exponential revenue growth, culminating in the latest figures that place them among Europes top earners in this space.

Rising Costs Offset Liverpools Kit Revenue Growth

Despite the strong commercial performance, Liverpool recorded a 57 million pre-tax loss in 2023/24. The increase in earnings from Nike and other commercial ventures was not enough to counterbalance rising costs across the clubs operations.

These financial pressures stem primarily from higher wages for players and staff, as well as escalating operational expenses, which have led to an overall financial shortfall despite revenue growth.

As Liverpool prepare for what appears to be a new chapter with Adidas, the clubs ability to optimise future earnings while managing rising expenditures will be key to maintaining long-term financial stabilily",https://photobooth-api.onefootball.com/api/screenshot/%2Fv2%2Fphotobooth%2Fcms%2Fen%2F40808115%3Fdate=2025-03-09,N,,04:04.4

This represents a 9.7 million increase on their 2022/23 figures, when the club earned 113.1 million from their Nike arrangement, according to UEFAs previous reports.

Nike Deal Nears End as Adidas Return Expected

Liverpools current agreement with Nike, which began in 2020, is widely expected to conclude on 30 June 2025. Multiple reports indicate that German manufacturer Adidas is poised to take over from 1 July 2025, marking a return to a brand that previously supplied the clubs kits from 1985 to 1996 and 2006 to 2012.

The anticipated Adidas partnership is reportedly a five-year agreement running until 2030, though neither the club nor the brand have publicly confirmed the terms.

Why Liverpools Nike Deal Was Unique

When Liverpool initially signed with Nike, the base fee of 30 million per season raised eyebrows, as it was lower than the 45 million per year previously received from New Balance. However, the structure of the contract was vastly different.

Rather than relying on a fixed annual sum, Liverpools deal with Nike was built around royalty-based earnings, ensuring the club profited significantly from global kit and merchandise sales. This model has allowed the club to see exponential revenue growth, culminating in the latest figures that place them among Europes top earners in this space.

Rising Costs Offset Liverpools Kit Revenue Growth

Despite the strong commercial performance, Liverpool recorded a 57 million pre-tax loss in 2023/24. The increase in earnings from Nike and other commercial ventures was not enough to counterbalance rising costs across the clubs operations.

These financial pressures stem primarily from higher wages for players and staff, as well as escalating operational expenses, which have led to an overall financial shortfall despite revenue growth.

As Liverpool prepare for what appears to be a new chapter with Adidas, the clubs ability to optimise future earnings while managing rising expenditures will be key to maintaining long-term financial stabilily",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/P8AMtfarCnZ.E5mScOsG5g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MzM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/anfield_index_166/7e21b3caf1098e45e2f5ecfba19ee974,N,,04:09.8

According to Wendy's earnings report for the full year of 2024, global restaurant sales grew 3.1% compared to last year, with its U.S. market increasing by 2.2% and its International market up 9%.

Prioritizing restaurant expansion in its international markets isn't a new idea for Wendy's. In 2023, the fast food chain built more locations abroad than in the last few years and reduced the number of restaurants domestically.

In 2024, Wendy's ended with 5,933 restaurants across the U.S., a 1.6% decline from the year prior. Internationally, it ended with 1,307 restaurants, representing an 8% unit increase.

""The Wendy's brand has tremendous strength, and we will unlock its full potential, scaling our system to match the power of our brand,"" said Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner during the company's Investor Day.

Wendy's plans to increase sales by targeting specific demographics

Providing high-quality food and better offerings is one of Wendy's main strategies to achieve its global sales goal. The fast food chain wants to target this point by focusing on three main demographics: families, the Hispanic community, and Gen Zers.

Wendy's (WEN) aims to capture these main audiences by collaborating with various brands and fostering innovation by launching new menu items.

During its Investor Day, Wendy's revealed that it had already been working on a partnership with Takis, which will come out later this year. It also confirmed that new Frosty flavors are in the making, with innovative additions such as mix-ins and swirls. These new Frosty additions are very similar to those of the McDonald's (MCD) McFlurry, one of Wendy's strongest rivals.

""I'm excited about our upcoming innovation and collaborations that will build on our high-quality menu with fresh ingredients as we continue to elevate our customer focus, putting the customer at the center of everything we do. Our relentless pursuit of excellence in our food and our restaurants will position Wendy's for long-term success as we win across our global markets,"" said Tanner.

Wendy's wants to open more restaurants abroad to grow internationally

Although Wendy's is a well-known restaurant in the U.S., its brand is not as recognizable in the international markets as its rivals. Therefore, fast food chain wants to expand its brand awareness by opening 70% of the projected 1,000 new restaurants aboard, propelling international growth.

Two years ago, Wendy's released a new restaurant design that featured new technology like ordering kiosks and AI-powered drive-thru boards. It also reduced the size of its usual restaurants to less than a quarter acre, lowering the required energy to run those units by 10%.

By the end of 2024, the fast food chain built nearly 300 restaurants with the new design, which made operations more efficient and increased profitability. The changes made to Wendy's new restaurant design will allow it to build more restaurants for less money, making doubling its units a more reachable goal.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.49 EPS, expectations were $0.4969.

Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of the conference. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for todays call, Paul Glaser, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Good afternoon. I am Paul Glaser, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

Paul Glaser: I would like to welcome you to our fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPEs President and Chief Executive Officer, and Marie Myers, HPEs Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call concludes. We have posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying the release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage. Elements of the financial information referenced on this call are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our business as we see them today. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements.

We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPEs quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2025. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Please refer to HPEs filings with the SEC for a discussion of these risks. For financial information, we have expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying todays earnings release on our website for details.

Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency. Finally, Antonio and Marie will reference our earnings presentation in their prepared comments. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.

Antonio Neri: Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I share my comments on our Q1 performance, I would like to start by addressing the recent decision of the Department of Justice to file a lawsuit seeking to block a proposed acquisition of Jourdan Networks. The DOJs analysis of the market is fundamentally flawed. We strongly believe this transaction will positively change the dynamics in the networking market by enhancing competition. HPE and Juniper remain fully committed to the transaction, which we expect will deliver at least $450 million in gross annual run rate synergies to shareholders within three years of the deal closing. The court has set a trial date of July 9th. We believe we have a compelling case and expect to be able to close the transaction before the end of fiscal 2025.

Q&A Session

As you know, the US administration enacted tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, with increased tariffs on imports from China, beginning March 4th. In anticipation of this decision, we have been evaluating numerous scenarios and mitigation strategies since December to assess the potential net impact. We intend to leverage our global supply chain to mitigate aspects of the expected impact with pricing adjustments also expected. Pending further announcement from the US administration, our outlook for the balance of the year reflects our best estimate of the net impact from this tariff policy. Marie will provide more details shortly. Turning to our Q1 performance, we delivered against our commitments for the quarter, including achieving strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth.

However, we could have executed better. While our Q1 operating profit outlook anticipated increased pressure on our server operating margins, three factors impacted our profitability more than expected. Near the end of the quarter, we saw that our traditional server pricing did not adequately account for the evaluation of our inventory, which resulted in incremental server margin pressure. Higher discounts due to aggressive pricing competition in the market compounded this issue. And finally, our server margins were further pressured by the higher than normal AI inventory caused by the rapid transition of demand to next-generation GPUs and related components. We have already implemented aggressive actions to address these issues and are already seeing the positive effects of doing so.

However, we do expect to see continued pressure over the next one to two quarters before we realize the full benefit of these measures, including an expected higher AI revenue conversion. Looking ahead, we see additional opportunities to take incremental corporate cost actions to further strengthen our financial profile. We plan to reduce our employee base by 5% over the next twelve to eighteen months through the reduction of approximately 2,500 positions and expected attrition. Doing so will better align our cost structure to our business mix and long-term strategy. These are not easy decisions to make, as they directly affect the lives of our team members. We will treat all those transitions with the highest level of care and compassion. I will touch on a few highlights from the quarter, and Marie will go through each segment in greater financial detail.

At the company level, we delivered revenue and diluted net earnings per share consistent with our outlook. Q1 revenue growth of 17%, a near record, was in line with our mid-teens growth expectations. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year top-line growth, driven by our server business, which grew revenue 30% year-over-year and hybrid cloud. Non-GAAP operating profit dollars in the quarter were flat year-over-year. That resulted in non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of 49 cents, consistent with our Q1 outlook range. We are pleased by the performance of Intelligent Edge, which recorded 2% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, the third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for the segment. With the market continuing its positive path to recovery, we delivered double-digit year-over-year orders growth across all key geographies and key products, including campus switching.

During the quarter, HP Aruba networking attracted new large enterprise customers, underscoring the confidence our customers have in our strategy, portfolio, and roadmap. Hybrid cloud grew 11% year-over-year, although down sequentially following an exceptional Q4. The growth shows our storage and greener cloud product strategies are working. Demand for our Aletra storage NP was up triple digits year-over-year and now represents greater than 50% of our IP block product orders. GreenLake remains a key differentiator enabling HP to capture new enterprise hybrid cloud and AI workloads and data. We finished Q1 with more than 41,000 enterprises using HP GreenLake Cloud, and AIR surpassed $2 billion for the first time, up 46% year-over-year. In AI, we continue to see strong demand from model builders and service providers.

We booked $1.6 billion in new AI system orders in the quarter, bringing our cumulative AI system orders to $8.3 billion. The Blackwell GPU generation of products represented approximately 70% of our new order intake in Q1. We exited the quarter with $3.1 billion in AI systems backlog, up 29% quarter-over-quarter. Our pipeline remains multiples of our backlog. On the revenue front, we delivered $900 million in AI systems revenue in Q1. As we have said before, the AI systems business tends to be lumpy, as large deals take time to convert. We expect significantly higher AI revenue conversion in the second half of 2025, driven by the transition to Blackwell GPUs. We are proud to have achieved a new milestone three weeks ago when we announced the shipment of our first NVIDIA GV200 systems.

In the enterprise AI market, we saw an accelerated adoption of a variety of AI models, including agentic AI approaches in specific market verticals and workflows. In Q1, our enterprise AI orders increased 40% year-over-year, driven by higher conversion from the proof of concept phase. An example is KDDI, who, in partnership with HPE, designed and implemented a platform which will be used both internally and externally to develop, train, and tune Japanese generative AI models for domain-specific use cases. Our enterprise AI pipeline continued to grow with customers continuing to validate their use cases on our private cloud AI solution, powered by GreenLake Cloud. We see broad and increased interest from sovereign customers globally. Sovereign customers are deploying both AI systems for the development of sovereign generative AI large language models and supercomputing systems for simulation and modeling using AI.

Recently, the Leibniz Supercomputer Center at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities selected HP to build their new supercomputer called Blue Lion. It features HP innovations, including our industry-first 100% fanless direct liquid cooling infrastructure, with our slingshot networking fabric. Lastly, HP and Accenture are collaborating on a new agent AI solution for procurement, powered by Accenture AI Refinery, with our private cloud AI offering. This new solution will be deployed across HPEs category and sourcing strategies, spend management, strategic relationship analysis, and contract obligation management. Shifting to the innovation front, I am proud of our new and differentiated products and services we continue to bring to market to fuel the success of our customers and the growth of our business.

For example, in Intelligent Edge, we announced new vertical solutions for retailers to accelerate security-first AI-driven networks. These solutions provide intelligent edge processing for IoT data in real-time, improving security, operational efficiencies, and customer experiences for retailers. In hybrid cloud, last November, we introduced a new KVM-based HPE VM essential software offering. Hybrid cloud orchestration and on-premises infrastructure virtualizations are tremendous growth opportunities for HPE. Our new VM essentials enable customers to deploy a more cost-effective virtualization solution than VMware, with full hybrid cloud orchestration. Since its launch, we have had hundreds of customers in trials demonstrating strong market interest and excitement.

We are in the process of integrating our VM essentials into our private cloud offerings. We also continue to offer it as a standalone software on HPE and multi-vendor infrastructure. In storage, we are very pleased with our triple-digit year-over-year orders growth in our Aletra MP portfolio. This validates our strategy to provide customers with a disaggregated data infrastructure subscription-based hybrid cloud-native services. Aletra MP now offers block and fast object supporting a variety of data workloads, including AI. This reduces customers need for multiple purchases and management. And finally, in our server business, two weeks ago, we launched a new ProLiant Gen 12 server platform with our next generation of Hilo quantum-resistant security enclave and direct liquid cooling support.

This latest generation offers the most sustainable and secure cost per computing core performance. One Gen 12 server can replace up to 26 Gen 9 servers and up to 14 Gen 10 servers. This reduces power consumption by at least 65%. In closing, in Q1, we saw continued strong demand across the portfolio, driven by our new impressive innovations and customers continued enthusiasm for our offerings. However, we could have executed better, particularly in our server segment. HPE has a proven execution track record, and we are committed to doing what is needed. We have already taken steps to improve our execution performance, and we expect our efforts will contribute to improvements in the back half of fiscal year 2025. We have made great strides at HPE in accelerating our strategy and aligning our product portfolio to market inflection points and customer needs.

We will continue to make bold moves to enhance our portfolio and attract new customers in ways that accelerate value for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Marie, who will provide more details on the quarter.

Marie Myers: Thank you, Antonio, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we saw increased demand for service, storage, and networking products. Our revenue grew 17% compared to last year, marking the fourth straight quarter of accelerated revenue growth. We met our outlook, achieving double-digit growth in server and hybrid cloud. Intelligent Edge also performed better than we expected and is set to grow further in this quarter. We reported non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of 49 cents, aligning with our outlook, showing strong profitability in hybrid cloud and Intelligent Edge. However, we faced some challenges in the service segment, which we are addressing. Heres a closer look at the details of the quarter.

Our first quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year, but down 7% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting typical seasonality and lower AI systems revenue. Annual recurring revenue was $2.1 billion, up 46% year-over-year, driven by AI and Intelligent Edge. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.4%, down 680 basis points year-over-year and 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was impacted by a higher mix of server revenue and lower contribution from Intelligent Edge. And we faced challenges in server that pressured margin, both year-over-year and sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 9.9%, down 160 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially, primarily due to headwinds in gross margin.

Operating margin partially benefited from a 9% decrease in non-GAAP operating expenses, reflecting lower variable compensation and continued cost discipline. In my first year as CFO, we implemented cost-saving measures by targeting discretionary spending, reducing non-GAAP operating expenses from 24% in fiscal 2023 to 22% of revenue in fiscal 2024. In Q1, these actions lowered operating expenses to a record low of 19% of revenue. This year, we aim to target more structural cost savings. Free cash flow was negative $877 million, in line with normal seasonal patterns. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was 44 cents, above guidance of 31 cents to 36 cents due to a gain recognized on the sale of a communications technology group or CTG, and lower than expected Juniper-related costs.

Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of 49 cents was within our guided range of 47 cents to 52 cents. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $57 million in net costs primarily related to stock-based compensation expense, H3C divestiture-related severance costs, acquisition, disposition, and other charges, and amortization of intangible assets, primarily offset by the gain recognized on the sale of CTG. Now lets break down the segment results. Server revenue was $4.3 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Revenue fell sequentially primarily due to the timing of AI systems deals. In traditional compute, our Gen 11 value proposition resonated with customers, contributing to year-over-year AUP growth. Gen 11 accounts for the majority of our traditional compute sales, and we expect to begin shipping the new Gen 12 portfolio later this year.

In AI systems, we signed $1.6 billion in net orders and added enterprise and sovereign customers. Although most demand is still from model builders, we recognized roughly $900 million of revenue, up from about $400 million last year, but down sequentially as expected due to chip availability and customer readiness. We expect these factors will continue to affect our AI systems business. Server operating margin was well below expectations at 8.1%. While our guidance of 10 to 11 assumed impact from the GPU transition and competitive pricing, market pressures were greater than expected, and execution issues further impacted operating margin. We have made improvements and taken additional steps to reduce costs, expecting server operating margin to be around 10% by Q4.

Let me provide further details. In traditional compute, we faced challenges in pricing strategies and discounting. We now have a more rigorous discount framework with increased deal mix scrutiny. These changes will take time to impact our P&L as we work through our backlog. In addition, we expect pricing adjustments may negatively impact top-line growth in the near term. In AI, our margins were affected by the transition to new GPUs and managing older GPU inventory. We believe this is an industry-wide challenge that will improve as supply and demand align. We have implemented actions to reduce inventory. Now onto Intelligent Edge, which exceeded our expectations and is ready for growth in Q2. Revenue was $1.1 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter, ahead of guidance of flattish growth.

Revenue was down 4% year-over-year as we move past post-pandemic related backlog. We saw double-digit year-over-year growth in Sassy and data center switching with notable order growth for wireless LAN and campus switching. Despite some pressure from weaker federal spending, we grew orders double digits year-over-year in all major regions. We expect the business to return to year-over-year growth in Q2 given order trends and normalized channel inventory. Operating margin was 27.4%, down 200 basis points year-over-year, but up 300 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to higher revenue and cost controls. Moving to hybrid cloud, we saw broad-based strength growing revenue 11% year-over-year to $1.4 billion in line with our guidance. Sequentially, the business declined 12%.

Our HPE Electra MP platform is ramping nicely, adding over 150 new logos this quarter. HPE Electro MPs higher deferred revenue will benefit the long-term P&L but impacts near-term growth and margin. The transition to Electra MP pulls through more owned IP, which benefits profit. HPE private cloud AI continues to attract customers with fast deployment and competitive ROI. We continue to grow our pipeline with opportunities spanning regions and sectors. During the quarter, we received orders for small, medium, and large configurations, with use cases varying from inferencing and fine-tuning to manufacturing and life sciences. Hybrid cloud operating margin was 7%, up 300 basis points year-over-year primarily due to cost controls but down 80 basis points sequentially.

Lastly, financial services. Our financial services business generated $873 million of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Financing volumes decreased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion after a record high last quarter. Our Q1 loss ratio was 0.6%, and return on equity totaled 16.4%. Operating margin was solid at 9.4%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Moving to cash flow and capital allocation. Reflecting normal seasonality, we consumed $390 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, and free cash flow was an outflow of $877 million. Inventory totaled $8.6 billion at the end of the period, up $767 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily to support AI systems orders signed during the quarter.

We are focused on reducing inventory levels to normal ranges. Q1 cash conversion cycle was positive five days, up 17 days from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in the days of inventories to support purchases for AI systems, partially offset by an increase in days payable due to the timing of vendor payments. We returned $171 million through dividends and $52 million via share repurchases to common shareholders, respectively. Overall, the quarter was within our guidance. But given the performance in server, we took immediate actions to limit hiring, travel, and discretionary expenses. We also decided to take further actions in the form of workforce reductions and attrition management to better align our cost structure with the current business needs.

This tough decision will help streamline our organization, improve productivity, and speed up decision-making. We will support affected team members with resources and assistance during this transition. We expect to achieve at least $350 million in gross savings by fiscal 2027, with about 20% of the savings achieved by the end of this year. The timing of reductions will vary by geography. Total cash charges will be around $350 million through fiscal 2026. These savings are in addition to the synergies we will realize after closing the Juniper acquisition. Before I get into the details of our guidance, let me first provide some context. Recent tariff announcements have created uncertainty for our industry, primarily affecting our server business.

We are working on plans to mitigate this impact through supply chain measures and pricing actions. Through these efforts, we expect to mitigate to a significant degree the impact on the second half of the year and to a lesser extent the impact on Q2 as it takes time to implement mitigations. The guidance we are providing today reflects our best estimate of the impacts of the March 4th tariffs and our mitigation plans. Also, because we now expect to close Juniper by the end of this fiscal year, we will provide full-year standalone guidance. For fiscal 2025, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 11% with revenue weighted towards the second half. We estimate currency impacts of around 150 basis points. By segment, we expect Intelligent Edge will grow sequentially through the year equating to year-over-year growth in the mid-single digits.

For hybrid cloud, revenue is expected to grow in the high single digits. For server, we anticipate revenue will slow to low double-digit growth with AI systems revenue ramping meaningfully in the back half. In addition, we expect to see more pronounced service seasonality in Q3 given the expected timing of AI. Our outlook assumes non-GAAP gross margin will be below 30% for the full year, with quarterly rates impacted by the timing of AI systems deals. We expect full-year non-GAAP operating margin of around 9% at the midpoint, but we expect to exit the year approaching normal ranges. By segment, we expect hybrid cloud operating margin in the mid to high single digits and Intelligent Edge to remain in the mid-20% range. Server is expected to improve in the back half, exiting the year with operating margin around 10%.

We expect OINE will be a net expense of approximately $15 million. We are guiding GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.15 and $1.35, and a non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.70 and $1.90, weighted to the second half. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook assumes Q4 will account for a higher percentage of our annual non-GAAP net earnings compared to recent periods. We expect free cash flow will be approximately $1 billion, including operating profit of roughly $3 billion at the midpoint, negative working capital, and the restructuring charges related to the cost savings we announced today. For Q2, we expect revenue will be between $7.2 billion and $7.6 billion. This range includes a return to year-over-year growth in Intelligent Edge with operating margin in the mid-20% range.

For hybrid cloud, we expect revenue will be down slightly sequentially with operating margin in the mid-single digits reflecting seasonality. For server, we forecast a sequential decline in the mid to high single digits, including a modest decline in AI systems revenue. Q2 will be the trough for server operating margin, in the mid-single digits due to both the timing of tariff implementation and the corrective actions we are taking in the business. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between 8 cents and 14 cents, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between 28 cents and 34 cents. Lower earnings combined with investments in our AI business will be a headwind to Q2 free cash flow resulting in abnormal seasonality. As such, we expect Q2 will be our weakest cash generation quarter during 2025.

In summary, we are confident in our measures to improve our server business. In 2025, we will focus on rightsizing our cost structure while leveraging AI technologies to enhance our processes, aiming to make HPE more agile and positioned for the long term. We remain a leader in innovation, encouraged by the strong demand for products like HPE, Electro MP, and private cloud AI. The networking market is recovering, and our business is performing well. We look forward to closing the Juniper acquisition later this year. With that, Ill open the floor for questions.

Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.

Marie Myers: Great. Thanks. Appreciate the question. Marie, it sounds like you anticipated some of the

Meta Marshall: raising pressure kind of on the GPU market when you gave the original 10 to 11% fifty basis point shortfall. You know, how much of that was CPU versus kind of pricing inventory additional pricing and inventory on GPU. Thank you. Yeah. Hi, Meta. And thanks for your question. I think you were referring to Q1, so Im going to answer you in terms of the Q1 actuals. So as you know in our original guide, we actually had 10 to 11% per server, and that did actually include some of the pressures that Antonio mentioned in his prepared remarks in terms of the AI GPU transitions. However, the magnitude of that impact was greater than we expected. And what I would say was unanticipated was the pricing challenges that we experienced in traditional compute. That was not in our Q1 guide. So, hopefully, that gives you some context there, Meta.

Operator: Your next question. Thank you. And your next question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just just kind of building on, you know, Metas question there.

Antonio Neri: server revenue and and and thinking about the monetization of the backlog as we as we move forward, Im curious of how you know, how thats changed or how your views have kinda structurally changed over the course of the last three months and whether or not the gross margin pressure you might be seeing, is there any kind of inventory charges or write downs that are more transitory in the model and just any context on how margin profile looks thinking about the hopper going to the Blackwell product cycle would be helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Aaron. This is Antonio. So when I think about the AI market again and the AI market, high margin in that context, I see three segments. Right? So you talk about the service provider, builders.

They lead with time to market with the latest technologies. And thats why in Q1, we saw a quite significant amount of Blackwell. In fact, I think I said 70% of the mix of the $1.6 billion was Blackwell. When you go to the other two segments, the sovereign and the enterprise AI, thats not the case. They go with a combination of prior technologies and maybe new technologies in the software, an enterprise market, definitely, its n minus one or even minus two. For that matter. And so thats why that inventory in the AI that was higher than normal is because now it will take a little bit longer for us to basically transition that inventory as we go through the other two segment consumption while the service providers and the model builders will shift much more quickly into the, the latest technologies.

And that working capital, because in the end, its all working capital. Pressure is not so much the margin pressure of what you sold when, is what compounded the issue in Q1. And it will take, like we said, one or two quarters to that backlog. The $3.1 billion into revenue plus new orders are coming in, and then return the traditional server business to the, what I would call, more normal operating margins because that was mostly impacted by the the, what I call the, higher discounted and that one time thing, we would call it the value of our inventory itself.

Marie Myers: K. Thank you, Aaron.

Aaron Rakers: Next question, please.

Operator: And your next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thanks for the question. Your guidance implies over $2 billion year on year growth in revenue. But at the midpoint, almost a $150 million year on year decline in operating profit dollars. So can you just help us think through how much of operating profit dollar headwind you are baking in explicitly from your from your tariff assumptions and if you could bridge that

Marie Myers: you Similarly, for free cash flow on a year on year basis where youre youre going from north of $2 billion to $1 billion. How much of that is is tariffs versus competitive pricing versus inventory, thatd be helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Hey, Wamsi. Good afternoon. And maybe Ill take the second part of your question first in terms of cash itself. So for the full year guide, as you know, we, in my prepared remarks, are I mentioned at least a billion. The way to think about cash flow is you you take out net earnings at the midpoint of one eighty. The biggest driver is really work capital and then also the announcement that we made around the cost efficiency program. So theyre the two biggest drivers that sort of influence cash flow from a year on year basis.

And then, obviously, the tariff impact flows straight into the the earnings at the midpoint. In terms of tariffs, Wamsi, how to answer that? What weve got in the guide is actually seven cents for the year, and that gets you to the midpoint of the one eighty on the guide. I would add, though, the way to think about tariffs is were working you know, weve worked obviously on mitigation effects, but it does take time to see those mitigation effects take place. So as a result, literally four cents of that seven cents is actually going to be in Q2 and its also in the server business, which is where we see the greatest extent of that server sorry, of the tariff impact. So tariffs seven cents in a year, but the the sort of, like, the hottest part of the tariff sort of impact is really going to be borne in Q2.

Paul Glaser: Very good. Thank you, Wamsi. Next question, please.

Operator: And your next question today will come from Tim Long with Barclays.

Tim Long: Thank you. Sorry to keep beating the AI server horse here. But maybe, Antonio, just on the strategy side,

Antonio Neri: just curious. You know, it seems like from the outside, a year year and a half two years ago, some of your peers were really chasing model builders, lower gross margin business, and you guys seemed much more focused on you know, super compute and areas that had better margin to it. It it seems like that strategy has changed and now HPE is more willing to get into some of these lower margin businesses like the GV200 NPL72 I imagine very low gross margin. Whats whats with the am I right in that strategy change and in the future should we expect that you know, chasing the model builder business may never get better on a gross margin? Basis, so that might be something thats more challenging to continue to compete in if were gonna be talking single digit gross margins for that?

Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. So no, our strategy has not changed. You know, if you look at the Q1 performance on our server operating margins, it was not particularly driven by the AI gross margins or operating margins in many ways. Of the pricing of the deals. We participate in service provider where we believe through scale and other, you know, mixes that we drive in the in that deal, whether its services, manufacturing, the like, we we can make the ",,,,
