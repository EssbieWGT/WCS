The January 8 launch event featured remarks from leaders across the aviation, research and public sectors.
The panel focused on investment pathways, workforce development and the economic opportunity presented by large scale sustainable aviation fuel production.","Washington State leaders, aviation industry partners, research institutions, Tribal representatives and sustainability advocates on Jan. 8 launched the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator (CSAA). Announced at the Boeing Future of Flight, the initiative is the most comprehensive and well-funded across the region of its kind to accelerate the production, deployment and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Funded through a 2025 State of Washington appropriation and private philanthropic donation of an additional $10 million, the CSAA positions the Pacific Northwest as a global leader in an accelerated transition to sustainable aviation fuel while capitalizing on the once-in-a-generation economic opportunity of scaling local SAF production. In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, CSAA is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable fuels industry in the Pacific Northwest.

Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is formulated from sustainable feedstocks, like crop seed oil, agricultural and forestry waste. Advancements in SAF technology and greater availability of affordable SAF will reduce the carbon footprint of air transportation, improve air quality and contribute to a more sustainable future while creating new industries, jobs and economic opportunities.

""Sustainable aviation fuel puts the Cascadia region at the forefront of the next major chapter of the clean energy transition that will shape how the world is powered,"" said Washington State Gov. Bob Ferguson. ""Clean fuels are good for jobs, good for the economy and good for the environment. Washington is uniquely positioned to seize on this opportunity.""

The Cascadia region has been a trailblazer in aerospace innovation for over a century, and today it is uniquely positioned as a global center of aviation innovation, with an opportunity to unlock the next generation of sustainable fuel. With access to local, low carbon feedstocks, affordable clean energy, established infrastructure and a skilled workforce, the region has all the elements necessary to support production of up to one billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2035. Scaling production at this level would drive economic prosperity and development, strengthen regional energy security and independence, support state and regional climate initiatives and build on Cascadia's long legacy as an aviation innovator.

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. SAF is a safe, effective drop-in solution projected to be used for the next 70-plus years that can reduce emissions by 80% compared to fossil-based fuels and the transition to a thriving circular economy through locally produced SAF.

""This initiative will be successful because it is grounded here, in the communities where aviation, manufacturing and clean energy intersect,"" said Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers, who serves as chair of the CSAA board of directors. ""CSAA builds on the infrastructure, workforce and partnerships we have already put in place, and this is just the beginning. Coalition partners like Washington State University are eager to partner in the establishment of a world class research and development facility adjacent to Paine Field. Combined with our region's aviation industry cluster, these developments ensure we will be a leader in global aviation sustainability and investment well into the future.""

The region's strength is built on advanced science, technology and aviation expertise, supported by leaders like Washington State University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Boeing. This research foundation provides the technical backbone needed to move sustainable aviation fuel from small-scale production to commercial scale.

""For the last six decades in Snohomish County, Boeing has relied on strong community partnerships to turn ambitious ideas into reality,"" said Bill McSherry, Boeing vice president of government operations. ""Cascadia is a concrete example of that collaboration toward meaningful progress on a Sustainable Aviation Fuel ecosystem right here at home.""

Local aviation and technology leaders recognize that scaling SAF research and production will require coordinated action across the entire aviation ecosystem. Manufacturers like Boeing bring the technical expertise to integrate sustainable aviation fuels into aircraft and operations, while operators including Alaska Airlines and Amazon provide the operational expertise and market demand for cost-competitive SAF. Lawmakers, like Washington State Senator Marko Liias, have championed these partnerships at the state level by advancing legislation that supports SAF development and unlocks long-term investment.

""Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are committed to this journey to reduce carbon emissions for a more sustainable future for aviation, and while we are proud to be the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. carrier, SAF remains the biggest lever for us to meaningfully lower our emissions and reach our decarbonization goal,"" said Diana Birkett Rakow, CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. ""We're thrilled to be a founding partner of CSAA because regional, cross-sector efforts like this are critical to align policy, public and private investment, to identify and invest in the right technologies and to incentivize and scale local production.""

Combined with existing infrastructure, affordable clean energy and access to feedstocks, research institutions are advancing the science that makes sustainable aviation fuels viable, and policymakers are ensuring sustainability and airport community impacts remain central as the industry transitions to cleaner fuels.

""Washington has led the world in aerospace innovation for generations, and now we face a defining moment for the next generation of aviation,"" said Washington State Senator Marko Liias. ""Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it. This is the moment to act, and CSAA gives us the vehicle to lead.""

The January 8 launch event featured remarks from leaders across the aviation, research and public sectors. Executives from Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines and Boeing spoke to the importance of aligning the full ecosystem of manufacturers and operators, policy, research, financing and public awareness to scale sustainable aviation fuel and secure the long-term future of aviation. Representative Mia Gregerson highlighted the need to center sustainability and airport communities as the industry transitions to cleaner fuels. Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell underscored the role of research and innovation in advancing sustainable aviation fuel from the lab to commercial deployment, while Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyn addressed the state's investments in clean energy, economic development and partnerships with Tribal nations.

The event also hosted a panel discussion moderated by Tim Zenk, a sustainable aviation fuel expert at Earth Finance, featuring executives Guy Palumbo at Amazon; Andy Billig, board member at SkyNRG; labor leader Jon Holden, Machinists Union, District 751; and Port of Seattle Executive Director Steve Metruck. The panel focused on investment pathways, workforce development and the economic opportunity presented by large scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

The Renewable Fuels Association said the latest USDA report underscores the pressing need to eliminate regulatory obstacles that are suppressing demand and limiting market opportunities for corn and ethanol alike.
Lawmakers should pass the Ethanol for America Act, which would simplify regulatory requirements related to E15 pump labeling and equipment compatibility.
The administration should also finalize the robust Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements it proposed last year, restrict small refinery exemptions (SREs), and reallocate any exempted volumes.
""We're calling on policymakers to act swiftly to remove barriers to expanded ethanol use and open new markets for U.S. farmers.""","The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed today that farmers harvested a record-large corn crop in 2025, estimated at more than 17 billion bushels. At the same time, corn stockpiles are expected to climb to their highest level in eight years, while prices are projected to fall to lows not seen in six years. The Renewable Fuels Association said the latest USDA report underscores the pressing need to eliminate regulatory obstacles that are suppressing demand and limiting market opportunities for corn and ethanol alike.

""Today's surprise USDA report serves as a sobering wake-up call about the state of farm economy and underscores the need for lawmakers to take immediate action to expand markets for America's corn growers,"" said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. ""The fastest and easiest way to shore up the growing supply-demand imbalance in the corn market is to permanently remove the summertime barrier on E15 sales and eliminate obsolete fuel retail infrastructure rules. These decades-old regulatory barriers are literally choking off demand and shortchanging America's farmers.""

Cooper added that expanding access to higher ethanol blends represents the most effective path to creating long-term stability in the corn market. ""Allowing E15 to be sold year-round nationwide could, over time, create new demand for more than 2 billion bushels of corn and sorghum,"" he said. ""Unlocking that opportunity now would deliver much-needed economic relief to farming communities across the Heartland, while also saving consumers an estimated 10 to 30 cents per gallon at the pump.""

According to RFA, several policy and regulatory changes are necessary to help prevent a broader economic downturn in the agricultural sector:

Congress should adopt legislation permitting year-round, nationwide sales of E15 without relying on temporary emergency waivers.

Lawmakers should pass the Ethanol for America Act, which would simplify regulatory requirements related to E15 pump labeling and equipment compatibility.

Congress and the administration should repeal antiquated ""denaturant"" rules that require ethanol producers to add toxic substances to their clean, renewable fuelrules that complicate the production of sustainable aviation fuel and ultimately reduce corn demand by displacing ethanol with low-quality hydrocarbon additives.

The administration should also finalize the robust Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements it proposed last year, restrict small refinery exemptions (SREs), and reallocate any exempted volumes. While EPA's proposed RFS volumes for 2026 and 2027 would help strengthen demand for farmers, those benefits depend on ensuring that exemptions do not erode the program's integrity. The last time corn supplies were this large and prices this lowduring the 2018-19 periodwidespread SRE approvals significantly undermined demand for ethanol, biodiesel, corn, and soybeans.

""By taking these straightforward actions, Congress and the administration can reinforce the strength of American agriculture and help avert a looming crisis in farm country,"" Cooper said.

Cost an ongoing problem

Prices twice those of normal fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could force airline ticket prices up by as much as 40 percent, an industry expert has warned, with the greener alternative unlikely to match the cost of conventional jet fuel until around 2050.

The aviation sector accounts for 2.5 percent of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, and will require almost $3.2 trillion of investment to reach net zero by 2050, according to estimates from the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The net zero by 2050 target, derived from the 2015 UN Paris climate agreement, refers to the goal of balancing greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, with removals so total emissions fall to zero by mid-century.

SAF is central to that effort. The fuel can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent and is expected to deliver around 65 percent of the emissions reductions needed for the sector to meet its 2050 target, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The problem is cost. The International Air Transport Association says that SAF prices in 2025 were more than double those of conventional jet fuel, rising to as much as five times higher in markets where usage is mandated, such as the EU and the UK.

""In our view, the 2050 target is achievable and by that date we could have prices that are really affordable for airlines and operations,"" said Mohamed Khalifa Rahma, director of the International Civil Aviation Organization's air transport bureau, speaking on the sidelines of the annual International Renewable Energy Agency assembly in Abu Dhabi.

A global aviation decarbonisation framework agreed in Dubai in 2023 includes a target to cut industry emissions by 5 percent by 2030.

""We need to accelerate the production and deployment of SAF to meet this goal,"" Rahma said.

The International Air Transport Association estimates that SAF output in 2025 would reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024, but still only 0.6 percent of total jet fuel consumption.

At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The Gulf is well-placed to soar on SAF - but not yet

Ahmed Badr, director of project facilitation and support at the International Renewable Energy Agency, said widespread use of SAF at current prices would translate directly into higher fares.

""Ticket prices would go up by around 40 percent,"" he said. ""It's something people cannot afford.""

The UAE plans to supply its airlines with 1 percent domestically made SAF by 2031 and produce 700 million litres annually. Airlines Etihad Airways and Emirates, oil company Adnoc and several government entities formed a national consortium in 2023 to advance SAF development.

Emirates has begun receiving SAF from oil refiner Neste at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport and signed a deal with Shell in 2024 for deliveries into Dubai Airport. In November 2025, the carrier signed a partnership with oil company Enoc to explore joint SAF initiatives in Dubai.

""I think there is very little SAF around the world in any airport that we operate to today,"" Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in an interview in November. ""We are always going to be a buyer of SAF if it is available.""

The Emirates Airline chief said last year that passengers will ultimately determine whether the aviation industry can afford to go green, suggesting higher fares might result from environmentally friendlier fuel.

""If you want a certain product, then you have to pay for it,"" he said at the Dubai Airshow in November when asked whether travellers would be willing to shoulder higher fares tied to sustainable energy.

The startup has also ranked 4th in the 2026 Startups 100 Index powered by Sage, the UK's longest-running index of promising new businesses.

OXCCU was founded in 2021 by Andrew Symes, Dr Jane Jin, Dr Tiancun Xiao, Dr Benzhen Yao, and Professor Peter Edwards. The UK startup is tackling the need to find alternative means of maintaining our standard of living without relying on fossil fuels, by using cutting-edge technology to make waste carbon usable.

OXCCU's OX1 demonstration facility at London Oxford Airport has already logged 1000 hours producing liquid fuel, with high conversion rates and excellent selectivity for SAF.

Following this success, the business secured 20.75m in Series B funding at the end of last year, to further scale its sustainable fuels and technologies.

OXCCU's technology

The team has developed a breakthrough single-step process that combines captured CO with green hydrogen to create jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons.

Its patented iron catalyst converts CO and CO directly into liquid hydrocarbons in a single reaction, avoiding intermediate steps and minimising byproducts. This translates into lower capital costs, lower operating costs, and more competitive prices for SAF.

Future goals

OXCCU aims to produce 10,000 tonnes of SAF per year before 2030 (for context, a Boeing 787 transatlantic flight uses around 50 tonnes) while exploring applications beyond aviation in chemicals and plastics.

This could lower the environmental impact of fuel-guzzling industries.

From lab breakthroughs to commercial demonstrations, OXCCU is proving that waste carbon doesn't have to be a problem; it can also be the solution.

OXCCU's co-founder and CEO, Andrew Symes, says, ""Being recognised in the Startups 100 Index reflects the momentum we've built this year.

""Securing our 21m Series B funding, starting the build of our second demonstration plant OX2, and growing the team has given us strong foundations to move forward.

""With strong investors alongside us, the focus now is on proving the technology at a larger scale and building the foundations for a pathway that can make a meaningful difference to future aviation fuel production.""

And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap."" Bridging the gap with book and claim Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).
""Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets."" ""SAF production facilities are not everywhere,"" she reiterates.
By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden.
""The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that.","And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It's why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, ""SAF is the main pathway"" to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

""The great thing about SAF is it's chemically identical to Jet A fuel,"" he says. ""You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.""

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn't the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

""SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,"" believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. ""Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn't really picked up massively. It's not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.""

Bridging the gap with book and claim

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF's availability improves.

""To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,"" says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. ""Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.""

""SAF production facilities are not everywhere,"" she reiterates. ""They're very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic."" It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. ""It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,"" she points out. ""But at the moment, that's not the case.""

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell's Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

""It's also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers  whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines  a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it's been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they're getting retired,"" says Ojha.

He adds: ""The most important or critical part is the transparency that it's providing to our customers to be sure that they're not saying something which they can't confidently stand behind.""

Moving beyond early adoption

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated ""ecosystem play,"" says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. ""It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there's a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, 'oh this is how we do it.' There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.""

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  though there are hopes that might change.

""The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,"" says Wolff. ""The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There's a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.""

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. ""The solution is there,"" she says. ""There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.""

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it's critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. ""Don't wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms  act now,"" he says. ""That's very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don't try to do everything independently or in-house.

""Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won't have to establish auditability from scratch.

""And fourth, don't look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.""

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization  and turning the tide on emissions' steep upward ascent.

Because aviation is global, emissions policy has traditionally been coordinated by ICAO, the UN's aviation body.
""Climate change is and will continue to disrupt lives, livelihoods, and productivity around the globe.
IATA echoed these concerns in its warnings about climate change.","Bill Gates said that aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, warning that it will require urgent innovation and stronger government policies to drive down emissions.

""The world has made meaningful progress in the last decade, cutting projected emissions by more than 40%,"" Gates wrote in his annual note for 2026. ""But we still have a lot of innovation and scaling up to do in tough areas like industrial emissions and aviation.""

Aviation is especially hard to decarbonize due to long aircraft lifespans and the high cost of sustainable aviation fuel, which is three to five times that of jet fuel. And SAF still makes up just 0.7% of global supply.

Gates warned that unchecked climate change will cause suffering on par with poverty and disease, especially for the world's poorest, and stressed the need to adapt to its impacts alongside cutting emissions.

""Government policies in rich countries are still critical because unless innovations reach scale, the costs won't come down and we won't achieve the impact we need,"" he said.

Climate Change Top 5 Business Risk to Air Transport

Gates' warning comes as aviation faces growing pressure, with SAF projects collapsing and airlines scaling back near-term climate goals amid European greenwashing crackdowns.

A new International Air Transport Association report lists climate change at the top of the list of risks to the industry that have both a high negative impact and a high likelihood of happening. IATA says it is major threat to airline profit margins this year from both disruptions caused by extreme weather and government regulations.

Aviation faces a patchwork of climate taxes and policies around the world. Because aviation is global, emissions policy has traditionally been coordinated by ICAO, the UN's aviation body.

""In global civil aviation we can see an increase in national and regional policy initiatives that depart from ICAO's 80 years of global harmonization,"" IATA said. ""Different frameworks now compete to determine how to address CO emissions from air transport.

IATA said such policies:

Do little to cut emissions but make air travel more expensive

Undermine global climate coordination, slowing progress

Meanwhile, IATA said, climate change continues to impact businesses and livelihoods.

""Climate change is and will continue to disrupt lives, livelihoods, and productivity around the globe. Extreme weather, commodity price swings, supply chain stresses, can affect agriculture, infrastructure, global trade, and investment flows.""

It said unstable environments and economies can slow progress and harm the growth of aviation. The report painted a broader picture of climate disruption, warning that extreme weather, price volatility, and supply chain stress could affect aircraft production and aviation growth.

Migration is a Growing Concern

IATA also warned that climate-related migration could disrupt aviation and global systems.

Various reports link extreme weather and climate shifts to gradually destabilizing economies and societies.

Take for instance sea-level rise: By 2100, up to 410 million people may be living in areas less than 2 meters above sea level and at risk from sea level rises.

IATA echoed these concerns in its warnings about climate change.

""The world has turned more hostile toward immigration,"" the report stated. ""The total number of displaced persons reached 123.2 million in 2024  nearly double the figure a decade ago. Both welcoming and rejecting migrants will strain borders and support systems.""

In this issue of Biomass Magazine, we examine how renewable carbon is being defined, deployed and scaledfrom pyrogenic biocarbon standards and orchard waste solutions to the accelerating role of renewable natural gas in transportation. Collectively, the feature articles we've delivered underscore a central theme: biomass is moving away from a niche solution, emerging as a critical tool in the broader energy and carbon-management transition.

In ""Developing Pyrogenic Biocarbon Standards"" on page 20, Associate Editor Katie Schroeder explores the growing urgency around clear definitions and standardized testing for biochar, biocarbon and biocoal as these materials move from pilot projects to commercial markets. Through insights from Myles Gray of the U.S. Biochar Initiative and Chris Wiberg of Timber Products Inspection/Biomass Energy Lab, the article explains how standards are essential for investor confidence, global trade and safe handlingparticularly as industrial demand for low-carbon materials accelerates. As interest from sectors like steelmaking and construction grows, this feature highlights why consistent terminology and ISO-aligned frameworks are foundational to the next phase of biocarbon growth. And hopefully, it serves as a resource in regard to the commonalities and differences among pyrogenic biocarbon, which is the broad term encompassing these materials.

Our biochar coverage continues with ""From Burn Piles to Biochar"" on page 14, by contributing writer Keith Loria, which takes a deep dive into California's San Joaquin Valley as it completes the final phase of its agricultural burn ban. With open burning no longer an option, growers are navigating higher costs, limited infrastructure and mounting volumes of ag residue. Loria examines how localized biochar and biomass solutionssuch as the Sitos Group and Treehouse California Almonds pyrolysis projectcould offer a viable alternative, while also outlining the regulatory, economic and logistical hurdles that still stand in the way of large-scale adoption. It's a timely look at how policy, agriculture and bioenergy intersect on the ground.

Rounding out our feature article lineup is ""Fueling the Future"" on page 26, by contributing writer Caitlin Scheresky. The story profiles OPAL Fuels and the rapid expansion of renewable natural gas as a transportation fuel, tracing OPAL's evolution from landfill gas-to-power roots to a vertically integrated RNG producer serving heavy-duty trucking fleets across North America. Against a backdrop of shifting policy incentives, depressed D3 RIN prices and growing international interest, the article illustrates why methane abatement and RNG infrastructure are increasingly viewed as some of the most practical and impactful near-term decarbonization toolsespecially for hard-to-electrify sectors.

Together, these feature stories reflect an industry at an inflection pointone where definitions matter, local solutions are critical and scalable projects are beginning to reshape how biomass contributes to a lower-carbon future. Also complimentary to this theme are our contribution articles, which focus on sustainable aviation fuel's potential, feedstock dynamics in the wake of SAF and maritime mandates, and lessons learned in material handling design and execution.

2025 was ripe with challenges, but we've also seen many successes and have been fortunate to help tell these stories. As we move into the year ahead, we wish everyone across the biomass value chain a year defined by progress, resilience and success. From project development and policy clarity to market growth and deployment, Biomass Magazine looks forward to telling the stories that shape the industry's future.
