Implementing advanced threat detection systems and incident response plans can mitigate potential risks. Conduct regular risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts. Employee education and training programs can also enhance awareness and best practices for safeguarding company data.

ID1,AB InBev,2/26/2025 8:07,Reuters,"Brewer AB InBev's shares surge as profits rise, debts fall",2/27/2025,,Emma Rumney,"LONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), opens new tab on Wednesday reported forecast-beating fourth-quarter profits and progress in cutting debts that have hung over the company for a decade, sending its shares up 8% even as China weakness dragged on sales.
Pricier labels like Corona and Michelob Ultra helped AB InBev to push revenues to an all-time high. The world's largest brewer said cost management also drove margin expansion, producing a 10.1% rise in fourth-quarter profits versus analyst forecasts of 7.7%.
The company cut its debt down to a range that investors and analysts said could unlock returns for shareholders that have been stymied for years by high leverage.
""We are turning a corner on debt repayment,"" said Johannes Moeller, portfolio manager at MW Compounders, an AB InBev investor.
""I expect them to significantly step up both buybacks and dividends over the coming years,"" he said.
An earlier acquisition drive left AB InBev with some $100 billion in debt built up following the company's blockbuster takeover of SABMiller announced in 2015.
The debt came down to 2.89 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by the end of 2024, within the range investors generally see as acceptable for companies.
The group produced strong growth across various key regions, including the U.S. market, where a consumer boycott of core label Bud Light over a social media promotion with a transgender influencer has hurt sales in recent years.
Analysts described the company's results as a strong end to the year. That follows bumper results from rival Heineken (HEIN.AS), opens new tab, the world's No.2 beer maker, and Carlsberg.
All three brewers forecast further profit growth next year, with AB InBev forecasting between 4% and 8%, adding to optimism around the sector.
Its shares were 7% higher at 0817 GMT, despite a 19% drop in volumes in China that dragged AB InBev's fourth-quarter volumes below expectations.
The brewer makes around a fifth of its sales in the country, analysts estimate, where a weak economy has hit demand for AB InBev's portfolio of pricier labels.",Error in Article,2,https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/brewer-ab-inbevs-q4-profits-beat-expectations-2025-02-26/,"Anheuser-Busch InBev reported fourth-quarter profits beating forecasts and making progress on debt reduction.

ID1,AB InBev,2/26/2025 15:07,Yahoo Finance,Budweiser maker Anheuser-Busch InBev says tariff impact remains 'very limited',2/26/2025,,Brooke DiPalma,"Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) CFO Fernando Tennenbaum said the beer maker isn't worried about President Trump's tariffs disrupting its business.

""Most of our beer is sourced, brewed, and consumed locally, so any exposure to tariff is very limited,"" Tennenbaum told Yahoo Finance over the phone. Tennenbaum stated that 99% of what AB InBev sells in the US is made domestically.

""We source the vast majority of our ingredients and other raw materials also in the US,"" Tennenbaum added.

The Trump administration recently levied 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which could raise prices for aluminum cans, and an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods. The president also announced a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada that is currently on hold and put like-for-like tariffs on other countries on the table.

Anheuser-Busch InBev's message diverges from other beer makers who face tariff exposure. Constellation Brands (STZ), in particular, will need to keep a close watch on Mexico tariffs, as it has two breweries in the country that ship its Corona and Modelo beers to the US.

""We have a number of what ifs,"" Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands said on a call with investors following its latest earnings results. ""It's really too early to hypothesize about what might or might not happen. As you would expect, we have a lot of permutations that we have considered and, certainly, we'll adjust our approach depending on ... what plays out as we go forward.""

Molson Coors (TAP) and AB InBev appear better positioned for tariffs, Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane told Yahoo Finance over the phone ahead of the Super Bowl earlier this month.

""As we head into the summer ... the [year-over-year] comparisons are easy,"" Spillane said. ""We don't know what's going to happen with tariffs ... will Mexican beer prices have to go up? If they do, that's probably going to be good for both Molson Coors and Bud.""

The potential trade impacts come as AB InBev is starting to see momentum in the US, which Tennenbaum called an ""inflection point."" AB InBev's stock jumped nearly 8% in afternoon trading Wednesday following its quarterly results.

In the US market, AB InBev's Michelob Ultra and Busch Light brands saw the first- and second-largest volume share gain in the market, he said.

Tennenbaum also pointed to a 0.5% increase among sales to retailers in the fourth quarter, which is the volume of products sold to stores, restaurants, and bars, versus a 12% decrease in the same time period a year ago. US revenue increased 0.8% for the quarter.",Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) CFO Fernando Tennenbaum said the beer maker isn't worried about President Trump's tariffs disrupting its business.,3,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/budweiser-maker-anheuser-busch-inbev-says-tariff-impact-remains-very-limited-195839897.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJJBftDKO640DRV_Mdhlg6nEgWT-WKLLxexXBjiTx9MTBA8EvHZgnF_1TxK8dyh1uBo8yYjwaAggJpvx38A1V_zQ9G7jI-hndpFhOZzMrshw15eorOI24DWYRNQjMhEIsxw4Hd8_Dhvb9n14duipMP0mkHxog4gzHjJe_T_2TRg9,"Anheuser-Busch InBev's CFO, Fernando Tennenbaum, stated that tariffs imposed by President Trump are unlikely to significantly impact the company's US business due to its domestic sourcing and brewing practices. The majority of AB InBev's sales in the US are made domestically, with only 1% sourced from abroad.

(1) Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliations between GAAP revenue and core revenue for Q1 fiscal year 2025 are set forth on page 6 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. Core revenue growth rate as projected for Q2 fiscal year 2025 and full fiscal year 2025 excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Most of the excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided for the projection.

(2) Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share primarily exclude the impacts of restructuring and other related costs, asset impairments, intangibles amortization, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs and pension settlement loss. Agilent also excludes any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations, and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 4 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

(3) Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q2 fiscal year 2025 and full fiscal year 2025 exclude primarily the estimated impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformational initiatives, and acquisition and integration costs.

(a) The adjustment for taxes excludes tax expense (benefits) that management believes are not directly related to on-going operations and which are either isolated, temporary or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability such as the realized gain/loss due to sale of a business, windfall benefits on stock compensation, and the impact of R&D capitalization under section 174 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For the three months ended January 31, 2025, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 12.50%. For the three months ended January 31, 2024, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 13.50%.

We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to restructuring and other related costs, asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs and pension settlement loss.

Restructuring and other related costs include incremental expenses incurred in the period associated with restructuring programs, usually aimed at changes in business and/or cost structure. Such costs may include one-time termination benefits, facility-related costs and contract termination fees.
 
Asset impairments include assets that have been written down to their fair value.
 
Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers including costs to move manufacturing, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and human resources and financial systems.
 
Acquisition and integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, tax, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs.
 
Pension settlement loss resulted from the transfer of the Netherlands defined benefit plan to an unaffiliated insurance company.
 
Other includes certain legal costs and settlements, special compliance costs, acceleration of stock-based compensation expense and other miscellaneous adjustments.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.

We compare the year-over-year change in revenue excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency rate fluctuations to assess the performance of our underlying business.
 
(a) The constant currency year-over-year growth percentage is calculated by recalculating all periods in the comparison period at the foreign currency exchange rates used for accounting during the last month of the current quarter and then using those revised values to calculate the year-over-year percentage change.
 
(b) The dollar impact from the current quarter currency impact is equal to the total year-over-year dollar change less the constant currency year-over-year change.

ID3,Albertsons,2/21/2025 8:07,Supermarket News,Messy end to merger results in Albertsons debt issuance,2/21/2025,,Chloe Riley,"Albertsons Companies, Inc. is looking to reduce the substantial debt it acquired as a result of its failed merger with Kroger by offering it up to investors.

The Boise, Idaho-based retailer said Wednesday that it intends to offer $600 million in “aggregate principal amount of new senior notes due 2033.”

Senior notes are a type of debt security. They are typically issued by companies to raise capital and come with a fixed interest rate and maturity date.

The company plans to use the money it gets from this sale, along with the cash it already has, to pay off its $600 million debt that’s due in 2026 and cover the costs that come with refinancing and issuing the notes.

The offering, which includes Albertsons Companies and subsidiaries Safeway Inc., New Albertsons L.P., Albertson’s LLC and Albertsons Safeway LLC as co-issuers, is expected to close around March 11, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.

Albertsons’ proposed merger with Kroger was blocked last year by federal and state judges. Albertsons had previously stated that if the deal wasn’t approved, it would have to consider cost-saving measures such as cutting jobs. Since the merger was halted, Albertsons has sued Kroger for a $600 million termination fee and billions in legal fees.

Albertsons Companies and its subsidiaries are offering notes (similar to bonds) to qualified investors within and outside the U.S. These notes are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and can only be sold to specific types of investors who meet certain requirements or qualify for an exemption.","Albertsons Companies, Inc. is looking to reduce the substantial debt it acquired as a result of its failed merger with Kroger by offering it up to investors.",6,https://www.supermarketnews.com/finance/messy-end-to-merger-results-in-albertsons-debt-issuance,"Albertsons Companies is issuing $600 million in senior notes due 2033 to reduce its substantial debt from a failed merger.

The Delhi – Ghaziabad – Meerut corridor is a long semi-high-speed rail and regional transit system that connects the National Capital Region (NCR) cities of Delhi, Ghaziabad, and Meerut as part of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project. With trains running at a maximum speed of 180 km/h, the distance between Delhi and Meerut will be covered in less than 60 minutes. It provides a reliable and comfortable transportation system, three times faster than the metro and aimed at passengers looking to travel longer distances.

The Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System development and construction works commenced in June 2019. The entire 82-kilometre-long Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut length will be open to the public by end of 2025.

The ArcelorMittal Europe – Long Products mill in Gijon, Spain, produced rails for a new rapid rail corridor that brings Delhi closer to other important cities. In January 2025, a 13-kilometre stretch of the Namo Bharat Corridor was successfully inaugurated by India’s Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, a couple of years after the inauguration of the first phase of the same project.

22 000 tonnes of rails from Gijon, Spain: a long route from bid to inauguration

Before the first passengers could enjoy the new, comfortable journey, ArcelorMittal sales teams were at the forefront, promoting our first-class steel rails that would make it possible. Bids for this tender were submitted in February 2020, and offer evaluation lasted until August 2020. After a lengthy evaluation process, ArcelorMittal’s bid emerged as the best proposal, and our rails could be produced in our Gijon rail mill, with deliveries spread out over a 24-month period.

ID5,AXA,2/27/2025 6:07,Insurance Journal,AXA CEO Says Prevention Needed to Keep Home Insurance Affordable,2/27/2025,,Claudia Cohen,"A leading insurance executive said the best way to keep price increases in check for property insurance in regions exposed to climate change is to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.

Prevention needs to become “a mandatory part” of insurance “to avoid climate risks not being insurable anymore,” AXA SA Chief Executive Officer Thomas Buberl said in an interview. The idea would be to shift “our own activities toward helping the customers to better protect their properties.”

“How will these buildings be rebuilt?” he said. “Concrete buildings didn’t burn, only wood buildings did.”

The LA catastrophe drew global attention to a crisis in the California insurance market after carriers had pulled back from wildfire-prone areas in recent years. They have argued it has become unprofitable to offer protection as the costs of disasters keep rising while state regulation has limited the ability of insurance companies to raise rates.

It’s something that has played out around the globe as rising temperatures are making natural disasters more frequent, increasing the damage they deal to properties. In response, insurers either hike prices or, if that’s not possible, cut exposure, sometimes leaving homes uninsured.

Piggy-Bank Mechanism

The prevention measures proposed by Buberl to counter that development should include “public-private partnerships,” he said in the interview.

An existing insurance scheme in France that seeks to spread the losses caused by natural disasters across a wider group of payers could serve as a model, Buberl said, labeling it a “piggy-bank mechanism.” The idea is to “put money aside frequently instead of suffering from a big peak when the natural catastrophes end up happening,” he said.

The CEO was referring to a French compensation system known as Cat Nat that has been in place for more than four decades. Under the scheme, all property and casualty insurance policies include protection for natural disasters, which is financed by an extra premium set by the French government. The country’s insurers can also get unlimited reinsurance by state-backed reinsurer CCR.

Cat Nat’s payouts in 2023 exceeded its revenue for a seventh consecutive year, prompting it to almost double the rate it charges home owners, CCR said last year. It pointed to climate change as a main reason for the decision.

The “insurability of climate risks” has become a tangible problem as “some insurers started to plan their withdrawal from geographic regions previously considered hazard-free,” CCR said in its 2023 annual report published last April.

Less Affected

AXA said in its full-year earnings report published Thursday it expects losses totaling about €100 million from the LA wildfires.

“We are large in the US but very much focused on commercial properties, which were less affected by the fires than residential properties,” Buberl said in the interview.

Speaking about the renewals of reinsurance contracts that happen at the beginning of each year, Buberl said this time around they came at prices that were”much lower” than in previous years and “even negative” in some cases. However, the LA wildfires are likely to “give a spike for a tighter market.”

Buberl has been leading AXA since 2016 and has shifted its focus from life insurance to property & casualty and health insurance.

ID6,Best Buy,2/21/2025 8:07,Retail Dive,Best Buy launches free degrees for full- and part-time workers,2/21/2025,,Kathryn Moody,"This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Best Buy is expanding its education benefits to offer no-debt, no-cost pathways to college degrees for all full- and part-time employees in the U.S., according to a Feb. 13 announcement.

The consumer electronics retailer said it will provide immediate access to the program on an employee’s first day of employment. The benefit operates through Strayer University’s Degrees@Work program, which includes coursework for certificates or associate, bachelor’s or master’s degrees.

“At Best Buy, we believe that fostering continuous learning not only enhances personal and professional growth but also contributes to an inclusive and thriving workplace where everyone can succeed,” Charlie Montreuil, senior vice president of HR rewards at Best Buy, said in a statement.

Best Buy employees will be able to choose programs in areas such as business and information technology, the announcement said. Employees can also access Sophia Learning, a self-paced online learning platform that provides college-level general education courses.

Best Buy has offered tuition discounts and reduced fees for more than a decade, according to the announcement, but the expansion is intended to help more employees access education and develop skills.

ID7,BNY Mellon,2/26/2025 10:07,The Wall Street Journal,"BNY, America’s Oldest Bank, Signs Multiyear Deal With OpenAI",2/27/2025,,Isabelle Bousquette,"Bank of New York Mellon Corp, also known as BNY, on Wednesday announced a multiyear relationship with artificial intelligence heavyweight OpenAI.

Under the deal, America’s oldest bank will gain access to cutting-edge OpenAI tools such as Deep Research and its most advanced reasoning models, supercharging the bank’s internal AI platform, Eliza. In return, OpenAI said it hopes to gain insight into how well its models work for complex tasks in the real world.

Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. 

“We feel AI has transformational power and will be part of every product and service,” said Sarthak Pattanaik, head of BNY’s AI hub. 

Banks are emerging as early leaders in AI adoption and as top-filers in AI patents, as well as top tech-talent recruiters plucking researchers from academic institutions.

OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap attributes that to the industry taking advantage of stark opportunities to simplify complex workflows. OpenAI boasts existing deals with companies like Morgan Stanley, Spanish bank BBVA and Swedish fintech Klarna. 

“We’ve felt a lot of pull and a lot of demand there. I don’t suspect that’s going to let up,” he said, adding the BNY collaboration is also an opportunity to jump in with a company advanced on the AI maturity curve. BNY launched its Eliza platform last year. 

Eliza functions as both a chatbot trained on BNY knowledge and a platform where employees can select from a range of publicly available models to build AI tools and agents for specific use cases. All 52,000 employees have access, and over 50% of them actively use Eliza. They have built tools like a lead generation app for salespeople.

Through the deal, BNY will also gain access to ChatGPT Enterprise, OpenAI’s plan aimed at large companies.

ChatGPT Enterprise has some overlapping capabilities with Eliza, but BNY will lean on complementary ones, giving licenses to a select number of users, including developers, product owners, and business leaders who will use it to explore cutting-edge features from OpenAI. 

The features include Deep Research, an agent that can take in large amounts of online information to complete multistep research tasks, and Operator, which can access the internet through its own browser and click, scroll and type as a person would. Operator is in early research preview, but will be available for ChatGPT Enterprise at some point. 

The major value of the collaboration will be BNY’s access to OpenAI’s application programming interfaces, or APIs, which will give Eliza access to OpenAI’s most advanced reasoning models, Lightcap said. And as capabilities like Deep Research and Operator become available via APIs in the future, BNY will be able to integrate them directly into Eliza as well.

“BNY has already built an amazing internal product here, and so we’re kind of just drafting off the work they’ve already done and trying to figure out how our new models, our reasoning models and the like, can continue to extend the capabilities of that platform,” Lightcap said.",Error in Article,12,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bny-americas-oldest-bank-signs-multiyear-deal-with-openai-74987d1d,"Bank of New York Mellon Corp has partnered with OpenAI, gaining access to cutting-edge AI tools, including Deep Research and advanced reasoning models.

ID11,CVS Health,2/21/2025 8:07,Reuters,CVS cuts bonuses after low profit levels in 2024,2/21/2025,,Not Available,"""We did not meet our financial goals in 2024, and that's reflected in our corporate bonus,"" a company representative told Reuters in a statement.

The conglomerate has faced a more pronounced impact from rising costs as it enrolled the highest number of new members under the Medicare plans for people aged 65 and older, or who are disabled.

Its healthcare business has been hurt by increased use of medical services, a change in quality ratings and bonus payments for its Medicare Advantage plans and a rise in sicker members enrolled in its Medicaid plans for lower-income people.

In October, CVS replaced CEO Karen Lynch with company veteran David Joyner, after it faced pressure from investors, including activist Glenview Capital, to improve its stagnant share price.

The company had also laid out cost-cutting plans and named a new insurance head in November as part of Joyner's efforts to turn around the company.

Earlier this month, CVS beat Wall Street estimate for fourth-quarter profit and provided an annual forecast that largely met expectations, hinting at an improvement in performance in its first full quarter under the new CEO.

ID11,CVS Health,2/21/2025 8:07,Fierce healthcare,"CVS MinuteClinic, Emory team up to boost primary care access",2/27/2025,,Paige Minemyer ,"CVS Health's MinuteClinic and Georgia-based Emory Healthcare are expanding their partnership to provide in-network primary care services at the retail clinics.

Primary care services at MinuteClinic will be made available to members in the Emory Healthcare Network, the two organizations announced. The goal is to provide additional options for people in the state to access primary care, driving better health outcomes and engaging more individuals with the health system.


Patrick Hammond, CEO of Emory Healthcare Network, told Fierce Healthcare in an interview the Atlanta metropolitan area and the state broadly both face a shortage of critical providers, and leaning on MinuteClinic and its reach can help ease some of that burden.




""We felt this was a really good opportunity to expand primary care in a different way to our community,"" Hammond said.

CVS is expanding its MinuteClinics into primary care. Here's why
There are 35 MinuteClinic locations in Georgia, allowing for same-day visits. MinuteClinics also have evening and weekend hours or virtual services that make connecting more convenient.


Creagh Milford, president of retail health at CVS Health, told Fierce Healthcare that MinuteClinics largely serve younger, healthier patients, and their expectations around interacting with the healthcare system are unique, so having MinuteClinic as a network option expands the reach of primary care.

""What we've found in CVS surveys over and over is patients want access and convenience,"" Milford said. ""And, if you offer those things in a primary care model, patients will engage in the model and MinuteClinic.""

Emory and MinuteClinic have been partners since 2011, with MinuteClinics providing walk-in physicals, wellness exams and sick visits. The locations are staffed by MinuteClinic nurse practitioners and other advanced practice clinicians, with physicians from Emory serving in a collaborative role.

With the expanded partnership, patients who visit MinuteClinics for primary care will also have access to Emory's hospitals, specialists, and diagnostic and laboratory services. Both Emory and MinuteClinic use Epic, making it simpler to keep the full care team in the loop across different patient interactions.

MinuteClinic's primary care model is focused on prevention, with routine maintenance visits, chronic care management and critical screenings. Milford said that MinuteClinic has also invested significantly in behavioral health services, allowing it to integrate those into the patient care experience as well.

The MinuteClinic team is actively engaging with other major providers and payers with the goal of establishing similar partnerships in the future, Milford said. There is also significant opportunity to continue building in the relationship with Emory, Hammond noted.

CVS first announced plans to expand into primary care with its MinuteClinics in October. Milford said the goal isn't to pull people away from established relationships with their PCP but to open up options for people who may not have a consistent relationship with the healthcare system.

For instance, if a patient who comes to MinuteClinic for a walk-in later presents at an Emory emergency department, the partnership makes it easier to close the loop for that patient, he said.

""It's our belief, through all the data that we look at, that there is a large population in any given MinuteClinic that does not have a PCP or hasn't seen a PCP in a long time,"" Milford said. ""And so if you think of that population, that's the folks that we're targeting.""",Error in Article,17,https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/retail/cvs-minuteclinic-emory-healthcare-team-expand-access-primary-care-georgia,"CVS Health is expanding its partnership with Emory Healthcare to provide in-network primary care services at MinuteClinic locations across Georgia.

ID12,Danone,2/26/2025 8:07,Reuters,Food group Danone to step up acquisitions after strong 2024 cash performance,2/26/2025,,Dominique Vidalon,"The consumer goods giant, whose brands include Evian and Badoit water and Activia yoghurt, also improved its profit margin last year thanks to higher volumes as price hikes slowed.

""Danone is now stronger, more resilient. The company is ready for more challenges,"" CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique said.

When asked how Danone would use some of the 3 billion euros ($3.15 billion) in cash it said it generated last year, Saint-Affrique told analysts: ""We want to move to the front foot on acquisitions.""

Saint-Affrique cited specialized nutrition and products where ""science can make a difference"" for consumers as targets.

Danone reported 2024 sales of 27.376 billion euros, a like-for-like rise of 4.3%, compared with analysts' expectations of 4.2% in a company-provided consensus.

The performance reflected sustained demand for medical nutrition and baby food in China as well as coffee creamers and high protein products in North America.

The recurring operating margin for 2024 rose to 13% of sales from 12.6% in 2023, in line with expectations of 13%.

For 2025, Danone said its forecast was in line with its mid-term ambition of like-for-like sales growth of 3% to 5%, with recurring operating income growing faster than sales.

Saint-Affrique declined to provide analysts with forecasts for the first quarter, saying Danone does not give quarterly guidance.

Its shares were up by 0.8% in early morning trade.

""Share price could see a limited outperformance to peers on the headline sales beat but after a strong year to date performance, we see nothing new here to support further rerate,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note, citing ""an uninspiring outlook for now.""

With record cash flow of 3 billion euros in 2024, which came above analysts' expectations of 2.45 billion, Danone also plans to raise its dividend by 2.4% to 2.15 euros per share.

'VOLATILE WORLD'

""We foresee for 2025 what I would call an almost back to normal level of inflation, remaining within a reasonable corridor,"" Chief Financial Officer Juergen Esser said.

""From what we know today this inflation will be driven mainly by milk, milk ingredients, and few components of packaging,"" he said.

Esser noted though some price swings were possible.

""We are living in a volatile world, and so there could be some ups and downs ... which could come from energy, ups and downs which could come from potential custom duties.""

For the fourth quarter alone, sales grew 4.7%, beating analysts' estimates of 4.2%, with contributions from all its three businesses - Essential Dairy products (EDP), Specialised Nutrition and Waters.

Dive Brief:

Instacart’s total revenue, number of orders, gross transaction volume (GTV) and transaction revenue all rose by double digits year over year during its fourth quarter, the company reported Tuesday.

An 11% increase in orders, driven by monthly user growth and higher order frequency, fueled Instacart’s Q4 results, CFO Emily Reuter told investors on the earnings call.

While Reuter said Instacart “closed the year strong,” the company’s Q4 revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates, and the company’s stock price dropped more than 8% Tuesday.

Dive Insight:

As Instacart looks to continue its financial growth, the company is focused on continually innovating its solutions to remain “indispensable” to customers, retailers and brands, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo told investors Tuesday.

The company’s Caper Cart smart carts, in particular, seem promising for long-term growth, company executives said on the call. Instacart is piloting location-aware display ads on the smart carts as well as testing online delivery offers on the carts to draw new customers, Simo said in a shareholder letter. Along with bringing Caper Carts to more U.S. grocers such as Heritage Grocers Group and Weis Markets, the carts recently rolled out to a Coles Supermarkets store in Australia.

“We’re seeing double-digit increases in basket size at a lot of the retailers that we’re in pilots with,” Simo said about the carts during Tuesday’s earnings call.

As grocery shoppers remain price sensitive, Instacart is focusing on getting retailers to adopt money-saving tools like online SNAP acceptance, loyalty program integrations and digital flyers, Simo said. The grocery technology company is urging its retail partners to move to price parity with in-store pricing, she said, noting that Kroger recently launched same-as-in-store pricing on items featured in its weekly ad.

“We still believe that [affordability] is an absolutely critical thing for us to continue leaning into in order to continue accelerating online adoption,” Simo said.

Instacart is continuing to build out its base of retail partners and advertisers. In 2024, the company launched 30 net new retailer sites — more than double from the prior year — and continued to diversify its ad base, which has included “seeing extreme strength in emerging brands,” Simo said. Advertising and other revenue was up 10% year over year during Q4 to $267 million, accounting for 3% of GTV.

Instacart grew its overall number of users in the past year, converting quarterly users to monthly ones and also monthly users to weekly ones at faster rates year-over-year, Simo said. Instacart+ membership is also increasing more rapidly than monthly users, she said, noting that members “remain our most loyal and engaged audience.”

“We continue to see deeper penetration of Instacart+ members among our overall user base and the engagement of our members has been strong, especially as we’ve launched new use cases like restaurants and $10 minimum baskets,” Reuter noted.

During fiscal 2024, Instacart saw GTV as well as advertising and other revenue increase 10% year over year. Total revenue and transaction revenue both increased 11% and orders were up 9% year over year. GAAP net income of $457 million marked a 128% increase from the GAAP net loss of $1.6 billion for FY 2023.

For Q1, Instacart is expecting GTV to fall between $9 billion and $9.15 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 8% to 10%, and adjusted EBITDA between $220 million to $230 million. Instacart also predicts a year-over-year decline in its average order value mainly due to restaurant orders and the company’s new $10 minimum basket feature, Reuter said.",This audio is auto-generated.

ID19,Instacart,2/25/2025 8:07,PYMNTS.com,Instacart CEO Says It Has 70% Share in Digital Grocery Baskets $75 and Higher,2/26/2025,,PYMNTS,"Instacart has solidified its leadership in the grocery industry by driving digital transformation and integrating online and in-store shopping experiences to meet changing consumer needs, according to CEO Fidji Simo.

Since 2019, grocery prices have surged by 25%, Simo noted Tuesday (Feb. 25) during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call, adding pressure to traditional brick-and-mortar stores that already face high fixed costs and low margins. Meanwhile, online grocery shopping continues to grow at an accelerated pace.

Instacart’s Advantage

“Online grocery is outpacing in-store grocery growth by more than 3X, making this a pivotal moment for grocers to compete digitally,” Simo said in her shareholder letter. “With high fixed costs and low operating margins, winning a point of share can drive incremental profit dollars and margin expansion for grocers, while losing a point of share can mean double-digit percentage losses in profits. But the vast majority of grocers don’t have the technology, time, or resources to adapt alone — they need an ally.”

That is a “huge advantage” for Instacart, Simo added.

“Because we partner with over 1,800 retail banners on our marketplace and power the enterprise storefronts for approximately 600 retail banners, we can invest and innovate more than retailers could on their own,” she explained. “We can also make integration more seamless than other technology providers.”

At the heart of Instacart’s strategy is its ability to provide tools that make grocery shopping more affordable and more convenient. As consumer expectations rise, with shoppers demanding a better balance of convenience, selection, price, and speed, Instacart has adapted its platform to meet these needs, Simo said.

One example is the recent reduction of the minimum basket size for free delivery from $35 to $10 for Instacart+ members. This adjustment helps increase order frequency by making it easier for consumers to use the service, even for smaller purchases, and strengthens the platform’s subscription model.

Fourth-quarter revenue rose 10%, to $883 million while transaction revenue also grew 10%, to $616 million. Full-year revenue increased 11%, to $3.37 billion while transaction revenue also rose 11%, to $2.42 billion.

What’s next?

Future of Omnichannel Shopping

“The future is clearly omnichannel,” Simo said. “In addition to winning online, there’s a massive opportunity to crack omnichannel because we know the future of grocery won’t be about choosing between shopping online and in-store — most of us are going to do both.

“And research shows that omnichannel customers are more valuable, with higher purchasing power and more annual shopping trips than brick-and-mortar-only customers. Our deep integrations with retailers position us well to win in omnichannel.”

Consumers are also focused on omnichannel shopping. A PYMNTS Intelligence report, “2024 Global Digital Shopping Index: U.S. Edition,” created in collaboration with Visa Acceptance Solutions, shows about one-third of U.S. consumers are Click-and-Mortar™ shoppers, using digital features during their in-store experience. According to the report, 19% of consumers prefer shopping in-store with digital technologies, while 11% opt for online orders with in-store pickup.

To capitalize on the trend toward omnichannel shopping, Instacart has invested heavily in solutions that integrate online and in-store shopping experiences. Innovations like artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Caper Carts, electronic shelf label technology (Carrot Tags), and FoodStorm’s catering management system are helping retailers enhance their in-store operations while creating a more integrated experience for consumers who shop both in-person and online.

Enhancing Performance

“Performance is just as important as scale,” Simo added. “This is why we’re constantly tuning our AI and ML [machine learning] models to enhance search relevance and contextual recommendations, in addition to new types of targeting, measurement, and optimized bidding tools on our platform. Rich data is even more important with the rise of AI.”

In the past 12 years, Instacart has built a dataset that provides insights into consumer preferences, product details, and shopping behavior, Simo said. Leveraging real-time data from shoppers and advancements in AI, Instacart is developing tools like AI-powered shelf scanning to further optimize the shopping experience.

“Our edge begins with the breadth and depth of our product catalog, encompassing more than 2 billion product instances across our vast network of retailers” Simo said.

“We refine this into 17 million unique items, and layer on detailed product insights, like nutrition facts, which can help with personalization, such as addressing dietary needs. We’re also developing a real-time view of store shelves, powered by over 10 million data points collected daily by Instacart shoppers.

“Soon, we’ll begin testing advanced store-shelf scanning using AI to analyze videos from shoppers, and in the future, from our Caper Carts as they move through the aisles.”","Instacart has solidified its leadership in the grocery industry by driving digital transformation and integrating online and in-store shopping experiences to meet changing consumer needs, according to CEO Fidji Simo.",24,https://www.pymnts.com/aggregators/2025/instacart-rides-digital-wave-to-stay-ahead-of-growing-online-grocery-market/,"Fourth-quarter revenue rose 10%, driven by a 10% increase in transaction revenue, reaching $3.37 billion.

ID20,J&J,2/25/2025 8:07,Reuters,J&J sues Samsung Bioepis over Stelara biosimilar,2/24/2025,,Sneha K,"The lawsuit, filed late on Monday in a New Jersey federal court, involves an unauthorized sublicense deal with a private label provider that J&J declined to identify. The suit seeks a preliminary injunction to bar U.S. sales of the private-label version of Samsung Bioepis' Stelara biosimilar, called Pyzchiva.

Samsung and J&J signed a settlement agreement in July 2023 allowing for the launch of Pyzchiva this month.

J&J in the lawsuit claimed that the agreement did not permit Samsung to introduce an additional private label drug at the expense of J&J market share and fair competition. It also requested a permanent injunction and financial damages as part of its lawsuit.

Samsung Bioepis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

Stelara, introduced in 2009, has been J&J’s top-selling drug since 2019, with sales reaching more than $10 billion in 2024.

Its patents began to expire in 2023, opening the door to cheaper biosimilars entering the market. Legal agreements aimed at escaping lengthy patent litigation delayed market entry of Stelara biosimilars in the U.S.

AbbVie held onto almost all of the Humira market for more than a year after close copies of the drug were launched in early 2023. That changed when CVS Health removed Humira from its list of covered drugs and more patients switched to a biosimilar in three weeks than had in the prior 15 months.

CVS, which owns a pharmacy benefit manager that negotiates rebates and fees with manufacturers and creates lists of medications, known as formularies, that are covered by insurance, replaced Humira with a biosimilar that was jointly marketed with its Cordavis unit, a private label provider.

J&J in its lawsuit said Humira's market erosion was illustrative of the harm Samsung Bioepis' private label deal could have.

Stelara biosimilars launched in Europe, Canada and a few other markets last year, and at least seven close copies of Stelara are expected to begin selling in the U.S. this year.

Pyzchiva is approved to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

ID20,J&J,2/24/2025 8:07,Cardiac Rhythm News,J&J to resume Varipulse cases following ‘voluntary pause’ of US external evaluation,2/27/2025,,Not Available,"Following a temporary, voluntary pause of US external evaluation and all US cases with its Varipulse catheter, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is set to resume the limited market release of these devices in the USA in light of a comprehensive investigation that found they operate as intended.

J&J will update the instructions for use (IFU) globally for the Varipulse catheter to include enhanced guidance, as stated in a recent press release.

An earlier release—dated 5 January—noted that, “out of an abundance of caution”, J&J had temporarily paused all US Varipulse cases and US external evaluation of the device while the company investigated the root cause of four reported neurovascular events in the external evaluation. J&J claimed that, as the US external evaluation leveraged a unique platform configuration, there would be no impact to commercial activity nor Varipulse cases outside of the USA.

The earlier release also highlighted the fact that, since beginning external evaluation cases with the Varipulse platform in the USA, J&J had completed more than 130 cases across 14 sites and 40 operators (as of 3 January 2025), while the successful global rollout of Varipulse had seen over 3,000 commercial cases completed.

An investigation into potential device-, procedure- and patient-related factors subsequently concluded that Varipulse devices operate as intended and there is no difference across the performance of the available Varipulse system configurations globally.

The investigation found that the risk of neurovascular events may increase if a high number of ablations, the stacking of ablations, and/or ablations outside of the pulmonary veins, are delivered, according to J&J.

The company is communicating with healthcare professionals using Varipulse to recommend that they review and adhere to the updated IFU, and share information with patients.

“We will continue to educate healthcare professionals with guidance around recommended practices aligned to our clinical studies,” J&J’s recent release notes.

ID24,Medtronic,2/25/2025 8:07,ThePrint,Medtronic explores options to optimize manufacturing operations amid Trump’s tariff threats,2/25/2025,,Not Available,"By Bhanvi Satija and Kashish Tandon

HYDERABAD (Reuters) – Medical device maker Medtronic is looking at options to modify its global manufacturing footprint as part of efforts to mitigate any impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff plans, a company executive told Reuters on Tuesday.

The company, whose products range from insulin pumps to surgical robots, has been closely monitoring Trump’s tariff plans due to its presence in Mexico. The country houses the device maker’s third largest manufacturing facility, according to its latest annual report.

“We continue to look at ways to optimize our manufacturing footprint,” Medtronic’s Chief Technology Officer Ken Washington said on the sidelines of the BioAsia conference in the southern Indian state of Telangana.

Trump imposed 25% duties on imports from Mexico and Canada that were to go into effect in early February, but then paused them until March 4, pending negotiations with those two nations.

Medtronic’s Washington did not comment on whether India was part of the strategy to refine the manufacturing operations. The company had in 2021 launched its largest research and developmental center outside of the U.S. in Telangana.

Washington said the company would stay focused on its core work in a reply to Trump’s threats to impose a “25% or higher” levies on semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports.

“A company like Medtronic can’t survive for 75 years if you don’t learn the skill of navigating the ups and downs, and ebbs and flows of different political platforms.”

Washington said he was focused on the adoption of artificial intelligence. He expects digital and AI roles to grow and digital spending to increase, without providing specific details.

“We have set expectations that everyone should embrace AI as a way of doing business.”

ID26,Nike,2/23/2025 8:07,Business Insider,Nike is betting Kim Kardashian can be its next Michael Jordan,2/23/2025,,Jordan Hart,"Nike will partner with Kim Kardashian's Skims to launch NikeSkims womenswear brand.

The collaboration aims to enhance Nike's appeal to female athletes and consumers.

Like the Jordan brand, NikeSkims is intended to be a long-term partnership.

Nike is extending its brand lineup through a rare partnership with Kim Kardashian's Skims. It's a bet that her star power can have a similar impact as Michael Jordan has on the sportswear giant — for women.

The two companies announced NikeSkims on Tuesday, a line of training apparel, footwear and accessories for women. While Nike regularly partners with athletes and celebrities for limited-edition sportswear, this seems a step up from that typical collaboration.

It's the first time Nike has partnered with an existing external company to create a brand. It's a ""win-win"" for both companies, Rachel Wolff, retail analyst at Business Insider's sister company EMARKETER, said.

As Nike pushes ahead with its play for appealing to all genders by upping its bets in female athletes, a deal with a womenswear superpower like Skims will fuel its ""gender offense,"" as CEO Elliott Hill called it during a recent earnings call. The long-term deal, which neither company revealed the financial details of, marks the beginning of a womenswear-specific brand intended to exist alongside Jordan, Nike, and Converse.

It does, however, call to mind Nike's biggest partnership yet — with Michael Jordan. In 1984, the popular basketball player inked a deal with Nike for $500,000 a year, plus royalties, Forbes reported. They introduced the world to Air Jordans the following year with the release of the Air Jordan 1 sneaker.

As the sneakers grew in popularity, it extended beyond basketball shoes to include streetwear. Today, Jordan himself has a $3.5 billion net worth, and Nike paid him some $260 million before tax over its past fiscal year, per Forbes.

Forty years later, the Jordan brand is still a revenue driver for the company. It brought in approximately $6.9 billion in wholesale equivalent revenue for fiscal 2024 — about 17% of Nike's total wholesale equivalent sales.

Like it used Jordan's massive popularity decades ago, Kardashian's global influence and more than 350 million Instagram followers will be a valuable boost in visibility for Nike. She cofounded Skims in 2019 as a shapewear brand before expanding into loungewear, and it has boomed in size, reaching a $4 billion valuation in 2023.

""Nike has the opportunity to capitalize on Skims' intense popularity among women consumers, who are an important target audience for the athletic brand, while Skims gets access to a much larger group of consumers as well as Nike's manufacturing capabilities,"" Wolff said.

Nike representatives directed BI to a press release in response to a request for comment. Skims did not immediately respond.

The two brands have been working on NikeSkims since 2023, the New York Times reported. Skims CEO Jens Grede drew parallels between Skims and Nike in October 2024, but experts seemed hesitant to agree at the time.

While Nike has become a brand that can sell ""a lot of things to a lot of people,"" as BMO analyst Simeon Siegel put it, others have said Skims' proximity to Kardashian could be a problem.

""Skims is not likely to be a 'for everyone' brand because there are going to be people who don't want the association with Kim Kardashian,"" Matthew Quint, director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership at Columbia Business School, said in October.

However, it's hard not to think of Kardashian ""as the Michael Jordan of influencers,"" Grede told NYT. Her net worth, as estimated by Forbes before the deal, is $1.7 billion.",Nike will partner with Kim Kardashian's Skims to launch NikeSkims womenswear brand.,36,https://www.businessinsider.com/nike-kim-kardashian-skims-next-michael-jordan-brand-for-women-2025-2,"Nike has partnered with Kim Kardashian's Skims to launch NikeSkims, a womenswear brand offering training apparel, footwear, and accessories.

ID28,Philips,2/26/2025 17:07,GreenBiz,How Philips is working with hospitals to cut medical equipment emissions,2/26/2025,,Heather Clancy,"Dutch medical equipment company Philips is counting on circular business models and eco-design consultations with hospitals and other healthcare organizations to advance its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2045.

The company delivered early on a 2025 promise to develop all new products using EcoDesign principles, according to its 2024 integrated financial and sustainability report published Feb. 21.

The framework calls for reducing energy consumption, eliminating hazardous substances, choosing lighter weight and/or recycled materials for packaging, and introducing service models that prioritize durability, reuse and upgradability.

What’s more, Philips is close to meeting a pledge to offer takeback programs for its medical equipment and to generate at least 25 percent of its revenue from circular business models for replacing or upgrading Philips products. These include everything from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems to patient monitors to electronic toothbrushes.

Both programs are crucial for addressing the vast majority of Philips’ annual greenhouse gas emissions, which shrank slightly to 4,398,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for 2024, according to the company’s sustainability chief.

“Circularity is super important to reach science-based targets and climate emissions targets,” said Rob Metzke, senior vice president and global head of sustainability at Philips. “Half of the emissions reductions need to come from circularity, but driving for climate solutions touches many more impact areas than just climate.”

Why product redesigns matter

Philips, which reported close to $19 billion in sales for 2024, is one of a handful of multinationals that publish an environmental profit and loss (EP&L) statement that puts a monetary value on its planetary impact. For 2024, Philips reported an EP&L of about $4 billion, off slightly from 2023.

Most of Philips’ environmental impact (+/- 48 percent) is related to use of sold products, and much of that is linked to energy consumption, according to that analysis. The conglomerate’s largest impacts after customer use comes from raw materials, packaging, water consumption, waste, volatile organic compounds and related processes.

Those insights drove Philips to prioritize changes to its hardware as an avenue for emissions reduction. For example, the company speeded scanning for imaging equipment using artificial intelligence, cutting energy consumption. It has also introduced MRI magnetics that use a very small amount of helium — a super-scarce, super expensive gas — for cooling. That feature, called Blue Seal, has saved 2.75 million liters since 2018.

Philips, which spends about 9 percent of its annual revenue on research and development, pushed more of that money into the business units for customer-facing projects in 2023. The EcoDesign approach appeals to the growing number of healthcare organizations that are becoming more concerned about environmental sustainability and asking suppliers for emissions reduction plans, Metzke said. The sector contributes 9 percent of U.S. emissions when including the gases for patient treatment, such as anesthesia or inhalers.

“Three-quarters of the impact of hospitals are in their supply chains,” said Metzke. This is substantial. Once they understand that, they become more keen to understand what they are buying.”

Close to 70 percent of healthcare organizations have made some commitment to address climate change, according to a 2023 report by Practice Greenhealth, which represents approximately 1,700 hospitals focused on sustainability. About the same percentage is applying those concerns to procurement.

“Most sustainability initiatives can also save money,” said Gwneth Jones, director of network learning and innovation at Practice Greenhealth. “The resilience piece is huge. Hospitals are anchor organizations [in their communities]. The focus on how they can become more resilient is huge.”

The Philips pitch: Decarbonization reduces healthcare costs

Some large Philips customers are helping the company develop new services that deliver emissions cuts while improving patient care. A common theme: Doctors and clinicians are deeply involved.

For example, Philips is collaborating with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to identify approaches that can reduce emissions associated with radiology departments. The ultrasound, magnetic resonance, computed tomography and X-rays machines across Vanderbilt’s system are used for about 12,000 patient scans a month. Their impact over 10 years is about the same as driving 1,000 gas-fueled cars in a year, according to their research.

One surprising revelation: 44-75 percent of the energy used by this equipment happens outside of patient scanning times, suggesting a need for automation that addresses that consumption and for new healthcare practices for managing these machines. It’s not just the technology, either. Roughly 10 percent of the emissions came from production and use of linens, and 8 percent was related to disposable supplies.

“We can’t just have linear thinking about how to address this,” said Dr. John Scheel, professor of radiology and vice chair of global health for Vanderbilt’s radiology and radiological sciences department. “We’re really trying to sift through the data and come up with a logical solution. We’re trying to use this information and these thought experiments so it does good.”

Another example of how Philips collaborates with customers involves Miami-based Jackson Health System, which runs one of the largest public health networks in the U.S.

Jackson Health expects a transition to Philips digital patient monitors to cut the emissions associated with this equipment by 47 percent. At the same time, it’s eliminating the need for 420,000 AA disposable batteries and approximately 6.5 million sheets of paper. The estimated cost of using this technology over 10 years will save Jackson Health about $1.2 million.

Philips’s five-year contract with another customer, the Champalinaud Foundation, comes with financial penalties if it fails to help the Portuguese cancer and biomedical research center cut the carbon footprint from its diagnostic and imaging equipment in half by 2028. This is being accomplished, according to Metzke, not just by switching to lower-emissions equipment but by shortening patient stays and reducing readmissions, which lowers the footprint.

During the first year, Champalimaud reported a 24 percent cut in its radiology and nuclear medicine department per patient exam. “If we help them achieve their target, or our joint target, to reduce emissions by 50 percent, then we get an additional part of the payment released,” Metzke said. “And if we don’t … . So we have skin in the game.”

This sort of contract isn’t yet common, but it could be. “I think it’s fair if you really want to do something together that you think about risk sharing,” Metzke said.",Dutch medical equipment company Philips is counting on circular business models and eco-design consultations with hospitals and other healthcare organizations to advance its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2045.,37,https://trellis.net/article/how-philips-is-working-with-hospitals-to-cut-medical-equipment-emissions/,"Philips has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045 through circular business models and eco-design consultations.

ID28,Philips,2/20/2025 8:07,Medical Device Network,Philips losses intensify amid demand drop in China and recall fallout,2/20/2025,,Robert Barrie,"Philips has posted 33.6% higher losses for 2024 compared to 2023 as the company continues to battle weaker demand in China and settlements for its faulty sleep apnoea devices.

Philips reported losses of €698m for the full year 2024, up from the €463m it lost the year before. Nominal sales growth decreased by 1%, with the Dutch medtech giant bringing in revenue just over $18bn. Earnings per share missed estimates by Zacks-surveyed analysts by $0.01.

Shares in Philips at market open on the 19 February reflected the weaker than anticipated financials, opening 5.2% down on the Amsterdam exchange. Shares continued to slump on the 20 February, losing a further 4.4% in value compared to the previous day’s opening price. Bank of America Securities analyst Julien Ouaddour reiterated a ‘hold’ rating on the company’s stock.

Philips CEO Roy Jakobs made no secret of the reason for the lack in profitability, citing the lower demand in China – a pressure that is affecting much of the medtech industry. Despite positive performance in the US, the company experienced a double-digit decline in demand for consumer and health systems in China.

The anti-corruption drive by the Chinese government has come down hard on international companies supplying medical devices to the country. GE HealthCare cut its 2024 revenue growth outlook last year due to the supply freeze, whilst Siemens’ Q3 sales were hit by order delays in China. Philips already slashed its full year forecast in November citing a “significant deterioration” in demand from the country.

Despite progress in other markets, China ultimately dragged down Philips’ revenue in 2024, and 2025 may also fall victim to macroeconomics according to Jakobs. The CEO expects a continuation of headwinds from the country at least in the first portion of the upcoming year.

“In China, we expect consumer demand to remain subdued. We expect demand from hospitals to continue to be impacted by the consequences of the anti-corruption and the slow implementation of the national renewal program, at least into the first half of the year,” Jakobs said.

In its earnings report, Philips stated that the market conditions in China are “expected to remain uncertain.” This has been compounded by the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on the Asian country, thrusting the relationship between the two manufacturing powerhouses into unknown territory. Jakobs did not provide detailed comment regarding the tariffs, saying only it was “hard to speculate on what will happen next.” The company did, however, include the impact of the tariffs on its outlook, which includes a mid-single-digit decline in comparable sales growth in Q1.

Respironics settlement and restructuring

After years in and out of courts, Philips is nearing the end of its ventilator recall saga. The company received final approval for the medical monitoring and personal injury settlements – a $1.1bn payment is expected to be made in the first half of 2025. Despite agreeing to pay out proceeds to end the long-lasting legal battle, Philips has neither admitted fault nor liability.

Restructuring is also in the pipeline this year as Philips targets saving of about $835m. The company expects restructuring costs to be 100 basis points in 2025, with “some headcount reductions” according to chief financial officer Charlotte Hanneman.",Philips has posted 33.6% higher losses for 2024 compared to 2023 as the company continues to battle weaker demand in China and settlements for its faulty sleep apnoea devices.,38,https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/news/philips-losses-intensify-amid-demand-drop-in-china-and-recall-fallout/,"Philips has reported a 33.6% increase in losses for 2024 compared to the previous year, primarily due to weaker demand in China and settlements related to its faulty sleep apnea devices.

Shares plummeted after the announcement, with shares opening 5.2% down on February 19th and losing an additional 4.4% the following day.

ID28,Philips,2/21/2025 8:07,EIN News,Philips and Mass General Brigham announce collaboration to improve patient care with live AI-powered insights,2/27/2025,,Not Available,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Cambridge, MA – Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, and Mass General Brigham (MGB), home to one of the largest hospital system-based research enterprises in the US, today announced a new collaboration to develop and deploy advanced data infrastructure and AI designed to integrate and process live healthcare data from a wide range of sources to improve patient care.

Today, healthcare providers often rely on disparate data sources, including static Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data, clinical notes, and isolated device alarms. By streaming accurate, reliable and detailed data from medical devices and other sources, Philips and MGB aim to create a scalable, unified, near real-time data and insights ecosystem. Powered by Philips software platforms, the collaboration aims to enable clinicians to capture, analyze, and react to data as it is available, potentially improving the effectiveness and efficiency of patient care.

""This exciting collaboration marks a key step forward in healthcare innovation, harnessing the full potential of AI and medical device data to advance patient safety, operational efficiency, clinician ergonomics, while opening new discovery possibilities,” said Dr. Tom McCoy, Medical Director of Biomedical Engineering at Massachusetts General Hospital. “By mobilizing previously siloed medical device data into an integrated high speed, high resiliency, real time data fabric we will be able to deliver the transformative potential of software to the patients who need it most.""

The collaboration will leverage a combination of Philips technologies to unify active data streaming from medical devices at the bedside, such as ventilators and monitors, with other longitudinal clinical data, such as lab results and EMR data, to create a comprehensive and actionable data environment. Philips Capsule Medical Device Information Platform brings together data from different devices, allowing Philips Clinical Insights Manager to facilitate retrospective analysis and testing, and Philips Capsule Surveillance to leverage continuous algorithmic processing to deliver smart alerts into live clinical practice.

For the collaboration, Mass General Brigham is bringing together the expertise of its biomedical engineering team, clinical sub-specialists, digital teams and internal AI business unit (Mass General Brigham AI) with Philips’ research and business teams. The joint effort will deliver data insights, enhance data integration and foster the development of new algorithms, capable of identifying patient-cohort patterns and generating smart alerts for clinical intervention. These alerts will provide clinicians with actionable insights at critical moments to support better patient care.

An initial research program as part of the collaboration focuses on patients undergoing continuous, real-time heart monitoring. By analyzing this data, the research aims to improve early detection of cardiac events and other critical health issues, potentially saving lives and expediting treatment.

“This collaboration between Philips and Mass General Brigham represents a significant step forward in the integration of advanced data analytics into clinical practice,” said Betsabeh Madani Hermann, Global Head of Research at Philips. “By developing predictive data analytics and AI algorithms, key tools for enhancing patient care, we’re empowering clinicians and supporting better care for more people.”",Error in Article,39,https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/787964018/philips-and-mass-general-brigham-announce-collaboration-to-improve-patient-care-with-live-ai-powered-insights,"Philips and Mass General Brigham are collaborating to develop advanced data infrastructure and AI to integrate live healthcare data from various sources, aiming to improve patient care.

ID34,Société Générale,2/25/2025 8:07,Groupe Société Générale,A milestone for women in the Group,2/26/2025,,Not Available,"Born in Paris in 1901, Lucienne Henry came from a working-class background. Fatherless, she was raised by her mother, a humble seamstress from Normandy, and grew up in the Paris suburbs. It was at school that she revealed her potential. A gifted, conscientious and diligent pupil, she obtained her Primary Education Certificate and, on the recommendation of her teachers, then earned herself a shorthand diploma.

The First World War was raging, and as the conflict became bogged down in a bloody stalemate, civilians were victims of the rising cost of living. In the spring of 1917, Lucienne therefore decided to move to the town of Le Havre, France, far from the battle zone. She immediately found a job as an accountant in a trading firm specialising in freight transport. Her reliability and good knowledge of the English language soon began to open new doors for her.

On 22 April, 1919, she was hired by the town's Societe Generale branch as an assistant typist. The experience was a success. With her good interpersonal skills, the young woman carried out her duties with assiduity, expertise and efficiency, never missing an opportunity to help her colleagues in order to meet the expectations of the branch's clients. Much appreciated by her superiors, Lucienne gradually developed genuine professional skills and began to set her sights on moving up the corporate ladder. Her versatility, speed of assimilation and strength of character impressed those with whom she came into contact. Her Branch Manager, who had total trust in Lucienne, was full of praise for the young woman and encouraged her to follow in-house training, a prerequisite for accessing senior positions.

Proving very successful, and still at the Le Havre branch, she became principal employee in 1928, office manager in 1931 and managing clerk in 1936. Within the banking sector, Lucienne was acknowledged in Normandy as one of the leading specialists in sales operations involving international clients. During the German invasion, in May 1940, she in extremis helped hide the branch's securities. It was with a similar resolve that she defended the institution's interests during the Occupation and took measures to protect the branch's personnel during bombing raids.

In recognition of her outstanding service, Lucienne was appointed Deputy Branch Manager in 1946. With her extensive experience, she continued to serve the bank with enthusiasm and passion, spending more and more time training young members of staff and teaching them new banking techniques. Health issues caused her to take early retirement February 1957, but her name was to go down in history. In December 1956, Senior Management bestowed the honorary title of Branch Director on Lucienne Henry, a unique occurrence for a woman in the history of the Societe Generale group.

ID34,Société Générale,2/22/2025 8:07,entrevue.fr,"Secretary General of the Élysée Alexis Kohler expected to join Société Générale, the Élysée is looking for his successor",2/22/2025,,Radouan Kourak,"Secretary General Alexis Kohler is preparing to leave the Élysée to join Société Générale, where he would take over the retail banking business, according to information revealed by The Opinion. This departure, expected for several months, received the green light from the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life (HATPV), a mandatory step for any transition from a public position to a high-level private function. The Élysée, while officially denying any signature, nevertheless acknowledges that the president is actively looking for a replacement for the man who has held this key position since 2017.

A shadowy figure of Emmanuel Macron for over a decade, Alexis Kohler has accompanied the head of state from Bercy to the Élysée, playing a central role in the management of the presidential apparatus. A pillar of Macronism, he has embodied a line of rigor and continuity, reflecting the president's decisions with absolute discretion. His departure, long considered and then postponed due to successive crises, comes at a time when the executive seems to have achieved relative stability.

Several names are circulating to succeed him, starting with Emmanuel Moulin, current chief of staff of Gabriel Attal and former director of the Treasury. However, the latter is said to be aiming for the management of the Caisse des Dépôts, a highly coveted position that could dissuade him from accepting the position of Secretary General of the Élysée. Former minister Julien Denormandie is also being mentioned, although he has moved away from politics to join the private sector.

Other figures close to the president are also expected, such as Didier Casas, State Councilor and Secretary General of the Bouygues group, who played a key role in the 2022 presidential campaign. The appointment of Nicolas Roche, current ambassador to Iran, could also mark a more diplomatic shift, in an international context that is increasingly central to Emmanuel Macron's policy.

The choice of the future secretary general is of strategic importance for the end of the five-year term. It will be a question of either favouring continuity with a profile from the senior administration, or opting for a more political figure in order to give new impetus to the presidency. The decision should be made quickly, as the function is essential to the proper functioning of the executive branch.

Emmanuel Macron, who does not like to see his close collaborators leave, could also surprise by appointing an unexpected profile. A way for him to reaffirm his authority while preparing the last months of his mandate under a new balance at the top of the State.","Secretary General Alexis Kohler is preparing to leave the Élysée to join Société Générale, where he would take over the retail banking business, according to information revealed by The Opinion.

ID35,Starbucks,2/23/2025 8:07,Forbes,Starbucks Has More Than Business Problems To Fix: It’s Losing Customer Goodwill,2/23/2025,,Pamela N. Danziger,"No two ways about it, Starbucks is a great brand. Yet like so many other great brands, it’s had its ups and downs over the years, but it’s been mostly downs recently.

In 2024, Starbucks dropped a few notches in Interbrand’s top 100 global brand ranking, from 48 in 2023 to 52. However, it plunged from no. 15 to no. 45 in the Brand Finance report of the most valuable global brands, the greatest decline of any brand among its top 100.

Starbucks 2024 year-end results didn’t help. While it reported basically flat revenues at $36.2 billion, global comparable store sales declined by 2% due to weakening store patronage. In the first quarter 2025, the decline in comparable store sales picked up pace dropping 4%, with comparable transactions down 6%, and in the U.S., comparable transaction volume was off even more, down 8%.

Net/Net: Starbucks is losing as the place where people want to hang out or grab a cup of coffee for their caffeine fix. Customers don’t feel the pull toward Starbucks that they once did.

While it shows up to a certain extent in the company’s financial reporting, consumers’ feelings toward the Starbucks brand is best measured in its brand reputation and that’s tanking.

Starbucks’ Reputation Drops

Stephen Hahn, executive vice president of Reptrak, says Starbucks’ reputation went from a strong 71.5 points in 2021 on a 100-point index to a vulnerable 57.7 points this January in an exclusive report shared with me. Starbucks did not return my request for comment.

Reptrak has been measuring brand reputations for more than 20 years across seven dimensions or what it calls drivers of reputation: Products/Services, Innovation, Workplace, Conduct, Citizenship, Leadership and Performance.

“Starbucks is strong in two things: great products and services and financial performance, but that’s only two of the seven drivers,” he explained. It’s important to note that the perception of strong financial performance is among consumers, not financial analysts, so people generally feel that Starbucks makes a lot of money.

So the greater question might be, how is Starbucks using all the money it makes to benefit its employees and customers, besides just giving employees a job with benefits and customers something tasty drink.

“Starbucks still is a strong retail brand, based upon the Brand Finance and Interbrand reports. But even a strong retail brand doesn’t translate into a strong corporate reputation. That might be the problem Starbucks is not solving for and it seems to be where many of its challenges reside,” Hahn observed.

Restoring Goodwill

In other words, Starbucks has lost a lot of the public’s goodwill over the last few years as measured in its corporate reputation, which is based on a nationally representative sample among those somewhat or very familiar with Starbucks, not just those aware of the brand. Overall RepTrak has collected ratings from more than 2,300 Starbucks “informed” individuals since January 2020.

To its credit, last September, Starbucks brought in a new CEO, Brian Niccol, to turn the company around after the less-than-stellar performance under previous CEO Laxman Narasimhan over his two years at the post.

Upon his arrival, Niccol introduced a four-pronged “Back to Starbucks” turnaround strategy. The new strategy hinges on taking care of customers, getting the “morning right,” reestablishing Starbuck’s as a community coffeehouse and telling its story better.

It kicked off its “Back to Starbucks” strategy to the public with a nationwide promotion the day after Super Bowl Sunday by offering a free coffee to members of its Starbucks Rewards Loyalty program.“Starbucks Monday” was the company’s most popular offer in its 50+ year history, according to Restaurant Business. And more people signed up for its loyalty program on that day than any day before.

However, Hahn observed, “To complete a turnaround, Starbucks can’t just rely on slick marketing, good-quality products or the coffee experience. It needs to find a new angle that allows people to better understand the totality of Starbucks and what it stands for.”

To do that, Starbucks must address its reputational shortfall in product value and innovation, leadership, conduct and workplace.

Product Value And Innovation Shortfall

Reptrak’ products/services driver includes measures of both the quality and value of goods and services. Starbucks ranks fairly high in quality, but on the value side of the equation, it gets its worst rating overall.

“You can’t win without there being a very strong value proposition to your business,” Hahn observed. “That doesn’t mean you have to lower your prices. It means you need to tell a compelling story around value. I’m not sure Starbucks has done that yet.”

On the product side too, it’s fairly weak on new products recently. Olive oil-infused coffee, introduced in February 2023 and now removed from the menu, was a big miss. However, its lineup of new products may help to overcome that shortfall. The newly introduced espresso-centric Cortado is more on-brand and its range of new Pistachio drinks has a curiosity appeal.

Yet, Hahn stresses the need for Starbucks to introduce “major new product innovation,” like the Pumpkin Spice Latte or Frapuccino, not just special offers or limited-time promotions.

Leadership Challenge

Leadership, specifically having a strong and appealing leader, is also a challenge for Starbucks. “We’re not passing judgments here, but the latest score on having a strong and appealing leader, specifically Brian Niccol, is not great. There’s a lot of room for improvement,” Hahn said.

Certainly, there is some hangover from the failed leadership of ex-CEO Narasimhan. And it’s hard for Niccol to step into the shoes of legendary Howard Schultz, who had to return two times to helm the company when it went off track, most recently before handpicking Narasimhan as his successor. Schultz is now Starbucks chairman emeritus and has resigned from the board, though he remains the company’s single largest shareholder.

Starbucks coffee seemed to flow in Schultz’s veins. For Niccol to outlast the short-lived period of his predecessor, he needs to model that level of devotion to the Starbucks brand and its many stakeholders, including employees and customers. He can’t just talk-the-talk but must walk-the-walk.

“The data suggests that people haven’t fully bought into Brian Niccol. A strong recommendation would be to go on a charm offensive and tell the ‘Brian Niccol’ story. What is your vision? What are your aspirations? What are your passions around Starbucks?”

There was never a question of this when Schultz was leading. But for Niccol, “That story still needs to be told,” Hahn observed.

Workplace And Conduct In Question

Also pulling down Starbuck’s reputational score are poor marks on openness and transparency, part of the conduct driver, and concern for employee well-being, a factor within the workplace driver.

“Perceptions around Starbucks as an employer brand are weak, specifically its concern for employee well-being,” Hahn said, pointing to the strike at some Starbucks locations this past Christmas Eve that shut down some 170 stores that day, though the union claimed more than 300 stores went on strike, according to Reuters. “That’s very bad publicity for the company.”

Striking employees were vocal about how they are treated and managed and the negative effects are bound to rub off on customers. “Negative feelings run really deep here. Twenty-years back, Starbucks was an aspirational place to work. It doesn’t have that luster anymore. As an employer brand, it’s partially damaged goods.”

Those negative employee feelings were exasperated by the well-publicized pay package Niccol got in joining the company – totaling up to $117 million, including stock options, that is said to be one of the highest in corporate America – not to mention the cushy deal allowing him to work from home in California with a corporate jet at his beck and call to fly him back and forth as needed.

Starbucks faces a growing movement to unionize at the grass roots. Over 11,000 baristas at 500 Starbucks stores have joined the Starbucks Workers United. That’s only a fraction of the 200,000+ employees and 11,000 company-owned stores in the U.S., but it signals growing frustration behind the counter.

An hourly Starbucks retail worker earns an average of over $18 per hour, with barista wages ranging up to $26 per hour. However, when benefits are factors in, an employee’s compensation package averages $30 per hour, plus eligible employees can earn equity in the company’s Bean Stock grants.

In addition, late last year, Niccol announced a plan to make Starbucks “the best job in retail,” with an expansion of employee benefits including extended parental benefits. Those changes will take effect in March.

Another lagging factor is having a positive influence on society. “Perceptions of Starbucks as being a purpose-driven employer brand are waning,” said Hahn. This despite Starbucks being committed to purpose-driven environmental, social and governance policies since 2001.

All in all, Starbucks has work to do recover what it’s lost in customer and employee goodwill.

“Culture is your north star and your reason for getting out and doing your job every day. In its absence, an employee loses their reason to believe,” Hahn explained. “That sense of togetherness – that sense of culture – is diminishing.

“Starbucks has become a more corporate and money-driven culture and that is trumping anything else in terms of community values and sense of purpose within the realm of the company. That’s potentially very dangerous ground. There has to be a combination of the two: a love for Starbucks to drive more profits and a love for Starbucks as a purposeful, good company. That sense of corporate values needs to be reinstilled.”

Let The Turnaround Begin

Hahn observes that Starbucks’ reputational shortfall can be fixed, but the company must identify the issues and get to work fixing them.

“The data shows there are a lot of people out there that don’t like Starbucks anymore, so they need a new reason to believe, to reconsider going back to Starbucks for a coffee experience, because right now, they’re not feeling the love.”

Niccol’s “Back to Starbucks” strategy is a start and it will take time to restore trust which is easier to lose than to regain, Hahn observed.

“There’s a lot of win-back opportunities out there for people to consider coming back to Starbucks. While the jury is still out, there’s still inherent reputational risks that need to be addressed. Is it really investing in the right things? Is it enough to turn the corner or is there more the company could be doing right?

“You can just say ‘I’m going to win you back.’ You have to prove it and give people a reason to believe. It’s got to be more than slick marketing. There’s got to be a connection between the promises you make and the ones that you fulfill. The data suggests there’s a bit of a disconnect somewhere along the line there,” he concluded.

Editor’s Note (02/24/2025): Context added per Starbuck employee pay and benefits.

ID36,U.S. Bank,2/25/2025 8:07,Banking Dive,"U.S. Bank scrubs DEI, fair pay references",2/25/2025,,Dan Ennis,"Like numerous banks in the past weeks, U.S. Bank scrubbed mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion from its latest annual filing, published Friday.

Gone from Friday’s filing is a three-paragraph section that was present in last year’s 10-K, detailing DEI efforts. Most notably, the bank’s pledge to interview at least one woman or person of color for all roles is absent from Friday’s filing.

U.S. Bank would not be the first major lender to de-emphasize such a policy. Citi, in a memo Thursday to staff, noted it is scrapping its previous requirements for diverse rosters of candidates for job interviews, and panels of diverse interviewers.

Also missing from Friday’s filing is a breakdown of U.S. Bank’s workforce by demographics. Last year’s document noted that 57% of the company’s U.S. employees were women and 39% were people of color. The previous filing also indicated that 34% of employees at the bank’s executive and senior management levels in the U.S. were women and 21% were people of color.

This year’s filing provides no such data, but it should be noted the Minneapolis-based lender has said its president, Gunjan Kedia – who is both a woman and a person of color – will become its next CEO as of April 15.

Not every bank has been so thorough in downplaying its previous DEI highlights. Morgan Stanley last week also wiped several DEI references from its annual filing but left in a demographic breakdown of its workforce.

References to equity in U.S. Bank’s paperwork were deleted even at the subheading level. Last year’s section on “Equitable and Competitive Compensation, Health & Wellness Programs” was retitled simply “Compensation, Health & Wellness Programs.”

Further, “flexible work” is no longer highlighted as an employee benefit in U.S. Bank’s filing from Friday. The bank, last March, mandated that employees work from the office three days a week. Thus far, there hasn’t been a public indication that that is changing. But its absence from the latest paperwork arguably leaves open that possibility.

By comparison, the bank’s February 2024 filing included the statement: “The Company continues to support flexible work programs with remote and in-person work arrangements, providing additional optionality and flexibility for most employees, which helps the Company attract and retain talent. The Company continues to adapt and evolve its flexible work programs as it recognizes the changes to employee and customer priorities and its customers’ and employees' changing needs.”

Also missing from Friday’s filing are huge swaths of language on pay equity, including a statement from last year’s document that U.S. Bank “remains committed to fair pay and continues to prioritize pay equity efforts,” and that it “has processes to address any gender and racial pay inequities identified within its workforce.” Rather, this year’s filing details only thatthe bank “maintain[s] competitive compensation and benefits practices” and discloses a compensation range for open positions to help with pay transparency.

The bank struck from its filing that it “conducts periodic reviews of base pay … across gender and racial categories with the assistance of an independent third-party consultant.” It also dispatched with a disclosure that its women employees “were paid greater than 99 percent of what their male counterparts were paid,” and that U.S.-based employees “were paid greater than 99 percent of what their white counterparts were paid.”

U.S. Bank would not be the first major lender to strike that language, either. Capital One’s most recent annual filing Thursday no longer includes verbiage describing pay comparisons by gender or race.","Like numerous banks in the past weeks, U.S. Bank scrubbed mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion from its latest annual filing, published Friday.",50,https://www.bankingdive.com/news/us-bank-dei-diversity-equity-inclusion-kedia-gender-race-fair-pay/740892/,"Major US bank U.S. Bank has removed references to diversity, equity and inclusion from its latest annual filing.

Carol B. Tomé is no stranger to breaking through barriers.

When she became CEO of UPS in 2020, she made history as the company’s first external hire for the role and its first female CEO. More significantly, she was also the first woman to lead a major logistics and transportation company.

A highly-regarded leader in the supply chain sector, Carol continues to drive change and innovation, with a focus on improving the experiences of both employees and customers.

Ranked No.1 in Supply Chain Digital’s latest Top 100 Supply Chain Leaders list, she remains committed to transforming UPS into a people-focused, customer-first organisation.

A career defined by leadership
Carol’s journey began in the financial sector as a Commercial Lender at United Bank of Denver, which later became part of Wells Fargo. She went on to hold leadership roles at Johns Manville Corporation and Riverwood International Corporation before making a career-defining move to The Home Depot in 1995.

Initially joining as VP and Treasurer, she quickly rose through the ranks, becoming SVP Finance and Treasurer before taking on the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in 2001.

During her 18-year tenure as CFO, Carol worked under every CEO in The Home Depot’s history, including founders Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, both of whom she credits as key mentors. Under her financial leadership, the company strengthened its position as one of the world’s largest retailers.

Leading today requires grace, humility, empathy and courage

After 24 years, Carol decided to retire in 2019.

“I was at peace,” she told SaportaReport in 2021. “This is going to be great. I’m going to do corporate boards, my foundation, my family office, the farm and spend more time with my family and friends.”

However, she soon realised retirement wasn’t for her. ""Bored"" and eager for a new challenge, she was drawn back into the corporate world. By March 2020, she had been named the 12th CEO of UPS, stepping into a role she describes as a perfect fit.

Arthur Blank praised her leadership skills at the time, stating: “Carol is a thoughtful leader with uncommon financial acumen and a keen understanding of how important a thriving culture is to the success of a large business. I know she’ll be an outstanding leader for this great company, just as she was for so many years at The Home Depot.”

Navigating challenges at UPS
Taking charge of a global logistics giant in the midst of a pandemic was no small task. When Carol assumed leadership at UPS, she faced immediate challenges, but her ability to lead under pressure quickly became evident.

“I thought I’d be travelling the world meeting people, visiting our facilities, shaking hands and meeting customers,” she reflected in her SaportaReport interview. “We’ve got lots of challenges here, but they’re fun to work on. We’re making some really good progress.”

Carol introduced a new strategy at UPS, focusing on being “better, not bigger.” Her leadership has seen the company prioritise efficiency, customer service and sustainability.

Key initiatives include establishing internal review boards, divesting non-core assets, enhancing same-day delivery and strengthening commitments to DE&I.

Under her leadership, UPS has also increased investment in employee development and community engagement, reinforcing its reputation as a people-centric organisation.

Inspiring future leaders
Carol is one of 52 female CEOs leading Fortune 500 companies today and she remains committed to mentoring the next generation of leaders.

Speaking on the How Leaders Lead with David Novak podcast in 2024, she shared her approach to leadership development: “For my executive leadership team, I have defined development plans for each of them and we meet frequently to measure progress. Those are harder plans to put together than operating plans – it’s much easier to talk about the numbers.”

“I spend most of my time on people development. Everyone gets motivated by different things and you’ve really got to understand that so you can invest in them and help them reach their highest potential.

“I believe leadership development is personal. If your boss takes a personal interest in you, then you’re going to grow differently.”",Error in Article,51,https://supplychaindigital.com/logistics/carol-b-tome-ups-top-100-leaders-no-1,"Carol B.

ID38,Voya,2/21/2025 8:07,Wealth Management,Voya to Pay $1 Million Penalty for Cybersecurity Failures,9/26/2018,,Diana Britton,"The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Voya Financial Advisors for cybersecurity failures, which also exposes a weakness in its independent advisor force. Voya settled the charges, which include violations of the Safeguards Rule and the Identity Theft Red Flags Rule, for $1 million.

In 2016, cyber intruders impersonated independent advisors in Voya’s network and called into the back office to get those advisors’ passwords reset, the SEC alleges. The intruders then used the new passwords to access personal information on 5,600 clients. They were then able to access account documents for three customers.

The SEC claims that Voya did not have the proper cybersecurity procedures in place to terminate the hackers’ access, and that the firm should have applied its procedures to its independent advisors.

“This case is a reminder to brokers and investment advisers that cybersecurity procedures must be reasonably designed to fit their specific business models,” said Robert A. Cohen, chief of the SEC enforcement division’s cyber unit. “They also must review and update the procedures regularly to respond to changes in the risks they face.”","The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Voya Financial Advisors for cybersecurity failures, which also exposes a weakness in its independent advisor force.
