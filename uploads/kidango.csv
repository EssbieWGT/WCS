According to Flagpole.com, the cuts included the following:



 The Mary Frances Early College of Education lost a $2.8 million Department of Education grant to train 50 graduate students in the school counseling and school psychology programs to provide mental health services to K-12 schools in rural Georgia — perhaps because the grant application mentioned that services “are inclusive in terms of race/ethnicity, culture, language and sexual self-identity.”
 A $99,704 USDA grant to conduct outreach to “small, new beginner, historically underserved [and] veteran farmers, ranchers and youth in Northeast Georgia and Metro Atlanta.”
 $346,897 from the National Science Foundation to create a “virtual distance learning community” for rural math teachers.   » Read more about: New Report Details Cuts to Education and Research Programs in Georgia  »",,https://capitalandmain.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/outside-edudawg-768x512-1.jpg,,,2025-06-05 11:09:04.121071
