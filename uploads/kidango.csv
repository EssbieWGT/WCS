Although AI-generated art is gaining recognition in the art world, its application in visual art education remains underexplored. To address this gap, we focused on AI-generated images-a specific category within AI-generated art that emphasizes visual representation. We integrated these images into visual art education and conducted an experiment to evaluate their effects. Seventy-eight fifth-grade students were randomly assigned to a treatment group (n = 39) and a control group (n = 39). Initially, both groups received conventional visual art instruction using classical images. Subsequently, the treatment group was introduced to a GAI-assisted teaching method utilizing AI-generated images, while the control group continued with conventional instruction. The results revealed that students in the treatment group exhibited significantly higher levels of classroom engagement compared to their peers in the control group. Moreover, the treatment group reported a strong sense of self-efficacy with the GAI-assisted method. Importantly, there were no significant differences in cognitive load between the two groups. A comparative analysis of the students’ paintings was conducted, focusing on technical skill, adherence to theme, composition and design, creativity and originality, effort, and improvement, which aligns with the increased classroom engagement and self-efficacy, thereby supporting the effectiveness of AI-generated images. This study is one of the pioneering works to propose and validate the use of AI-generated images to address challenges in developing learning materials within the context of visual art education.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-025-05860-2/MediaObjects/41599_2025_5860_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-09-30 12:59:19.983069

Despite strong evidence of its importance, policy investments in the social safety net in the United States continue to face political obstacles. One important contributor to the political dynamics of issues is public opinion, which can be shaped – for better or worse – by the news media. By reporting on, interpreting, and contextualizing policy issues, the news media play a key role in shaping public understanding of social issues. Eligibility criteria In this scoping review, we summarize cross-disciplinary literature that examined news media coverage of social safety net issues (N = 40 studies). Results We find that news coverage often focuses on individual stories and infrequently connects to broader, systemic issues, missing the opportunity to garner public support for the social safety net. Across studies, authors seldom note the implications of their work for journalistic practice nor for health equity. Conclusions Future work should examine how population health research evidence can be shared with journalists and news producers for more comprehensive media attention to the safety net within the context of the constraints news producers face.",,https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12889-025-23875-x/MediaObjects/12889_2025_23875_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-09-30 10:58:19.132993

The Bayley Scales, 3rd and 4th editions, were used to assess development. At 6- and 12-month visits, the minoritized-language group had significantly lower scores than the English-language group in cognitive, language, and motor domains. By the 24-month visit, the minoritized-language group appeared to catch up in cognitive and motor domains but a significant difference in language skills persisted.

Evidence-based programs are needed that incorporate violence prevention strategies alongside methods to improve wellbeing and healthy development for children and their families. This trial evaluates the Responsible, Engaged, and Loving Fathers (REAL Fathers) intervention, a Ugandan-led multilevel community-based mentoring program for young fathers (ages 16–25) with children below the age of three years. Methods To assess the REAL Fathers intervention, we use a cluster-randomized controlled trial design within 48 sub-counties randomly sampled from 24 districts in six regions of Uganda. Sub-counties were randomly allocated to treatment or control arms at baseline. Study participants are fathers ages 16–25 years and their cohabitating wives whose eldest child is below the age of 3 years (n = 3744 couple dyads). Primary outcomes are the following: (1) reduced intimate partner violence; (2) reduced violent discipline of children; (3) increased father-child engagement and play; (4) improved early childhood development. Secondary outcomes include the following: (1) father’s knowledge of and (2) attitudes towards positive parenting and discipline; (3) father’s use of positive parenting and discipline; (4) father’s use of emotional engagement with child; (5) couple communication and conflict resolution; (6) gender equitable household and caregiving decision-making and behaviors; (7) father engagement in child health-promoting activities; (8) improved knowledge of family planning methods; (9) reduced unmet need for family planning; (10) reduced problem alcohol use; and (11) supportive community norms for father-child engagement and play. Longitudinal survey data will be collected by trained enumerators using KoboCollect in six local languages at three time points: one month before the intervention (baseline); one month after the intervention (endline); and nine months after the intervention (follow-up). Intervention effects on primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed using difference-in-differences (DiD) mixed-effects models that account for the clustered design. Discussion This trial will examine the impacts of a multilevel community-based intervention for young fathers and their families in Uganda on positive parenting, childhood development, and violence reduction. Overall, successful completion of this study will contribute to the evidence-based on context-informed multilevel approaches that reduce harm and promote wellbeing in families with very young children.
