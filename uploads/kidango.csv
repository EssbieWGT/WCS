On Thursday, July 31, the Pasadena Museum of History offers a rare glimpse into this preserved time capsule during a guided tour of the 1906 Fényes Mansion, where Victorian décor, antique furnishings, and art collection remain largely unchanged. The mansion, designed by architect Robert D. Farquhar with a 1911 addition by Sylvanus Marston, represents more than architectural heritage—it is a window into women’s roles in California’s early cultural development. Eva Scott Fényes created more than 300 watercolor works, many preserved in museums. “Visitors can experience the historic Fenyes Mansion in depth… and see how the 1906 Beaux Art‑style residence has remained largely unchanged,” said Daniel Nevarez, Education & Program Coordinator. From 1948 to 1964, the mansion served as the Finnish Consulate. Located at 470 W. Walnut St. and 160 N. Orange Grove Blvd. in Pasadena, it is both a designated Pasadena Cultural Heritage landmark and listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1985. The docent-guided experience incorporates QR codes for additional imagery while preserving authentic period details. Tours involve stairs and have wheelchair accessibility limitations. “1906 Fényes Mansion Tour” will run on Thursday, July 31 at 12:30 p.m. Pasadena Museum of History, 470 W. Walnut St. in Pasadena.
