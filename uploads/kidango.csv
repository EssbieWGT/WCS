These subcultures are often embedded in neo-liberal dehumanising discourses, practices and cultural artefacts that proliferate in the marketised HE sector, as well as pedagogies centred on institutionalised hierarchies and highly particular notions of ‘valued knowledge’, born themselves of hierarchical cultures. This paper focuses on the aim of humanising assessment through interdisciplinary HE. It explores how this pedagogical approach can redefine the (student) research culture in HE and foster opportunities for interdisciplinary student research within the curriculum. Practical approaches that integrate such cultural critical scrutiny of modernity into interdisciplinary assessment are missing from the literature. Such critical pedagogy calls for the development of social and emotional literacy and intelligence and these competencies need to be reflected in the development of approaches to assessment that are academically rigorous. We see the ‘Student-Devised Assessment’ (SDA) as an effective, humanising form of interdisciplinary assessment which challenges, stretches, and redefines the notion of ‘research’ in HE, and which can be evaluated reliably and even systematically, ensuring academic rigour and quality. The SDA is an ideal assignment to develop core interdisciplinary skills, such as coping with uncertainty, while enhancing student-centred learning and academic ownership. Furthermore, it is effective in promoting the ethical use of AI-generative tools in assessment across disciplines, and allows students to contribute to knowledge in exciting and creative ways.",,,,,2025-07-29 00:05:36.135869

On Thursday, July 31, the Pasadena Museum of History offers a rare glimpse into this preserved time capsule during a guided tour of the 1906 Fényes Mansion, where Victorian décor, antique furnishings, and art collection remain largely unchanged. The mansion, designed by architect Robert D. Farquhar with a 1911 addition by Sylvanus Marston, represents more than architectural heritage—it is a window into women’s roles in California’s early cultural development. Eva Scott Fényes created more than 300 watercolor works, many preserved in museums. “Visitors can experience the historic Fenyes Mansion in depth… and see how the 1906 Beaux Art‑style residence has remained largely unchanged,” said Daniel Nevarez, Education & Program Coordinator. From 1948 to 1964, the mansion served as the Finnish Consulate. Located at 470 W. Walnut St. and 160 N. Orange Grove Blvd. in Pasadena, it is both a designated Pasadena Cultural Heritage landmark and listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1985. The docent-guided experience incorporates QR codes for additional imagery while preserving authentic period details. Tours involve stairs and have wheelchair accessibility limitations. “1906 Fényes Mansion Tour” will run on Thursday, July 31 at 12:30 p.m. Pasadena Museum of History, 470 W. Walnut St. in Pasadena.
