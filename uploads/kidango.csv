The program, called CBE Accelerate, is designed to offer a flexible, personalized and career-focused path to a degree for students balancing work, family and other responsibilities.

Two information sessions happened this week to introduce the new program at the Southwestern College Chula Vista and National City campuses.

The sessions introduced students to a revolutionary way to earn an associate’s degree in automotive technology – one that puts real-world skills, flexibility, and student success at the center, the college stated.

The program allows students to learn at their own pace and take exams when ready. It features fully online instruction with flexible scheduling and includes industry-relevant skills along with general education competencies such as critical thinking, communication, problem-solving and quantitative reasoning.

Faculty provide one-on-one feedback and support. The program uses a flat subscription fee per term for both part-time and full-time enrollment, with the option to add more learning at no extra cost if students finish early. There are three terms per year.

The program also integrates virtual reality for hands-on training and offers access to counseling, faculty and student services. It is intended for working adults looking to upskill or change careers, students seeking a flexible and affordable degree path, and individuals interested in automotive technology and innovative education models.",,https://www.thestarnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/college.jpg,,,2025-08-03 17:56:52.708026
