Running back Terrell Jennings and outside linebacker Harold Landry III have been assigned that game designation ahead of the Houston Texans matchup, as head coach Mike Vrabel announced during his final press conference of the week.

But cornerback Christian Gonzalez has cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol and will go without a game designation for the AFC East champions.

Here’s the final injury report leading up to Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.

The Texans will be without two wide receivers against the Patriots. Both stayed sidelined for three playoff practices while in concussion protocol. In 15 games during the regular season, Collins caught 71 passes for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns. The two-time Pro Bowler was carted to the locker room during Monday night’s wild card at Acrisure Stadium.

The Patriots opened Jennings’ 21-day window to return as preparations for the divisional round began. The sophomore running back had been placed on injured reserve following the bye week in December due to a concussion. Gonzalez aentered the NFL’s protocol late last weekend, yet the Pro Bowl cornerback has also since gone from a red non-contact jersey on Wednesday to a full participant for consecutive sessions.

As for the veteran sack leader off the edges for the AFC’s No. 2 seed, Landry has been managing a knee injury since late in the fall and was ruled out for back-to-back games to end the regular season. He was a non-participant on Friday.

“We’re just trying to do everything we can to give him enough time to see how it feels for Sunday,” Vrabel said of the defensive captain, who started and stayed in for 26 snaps in the wild card after finishing 2025 with 8.5 sacks, 10 tackles for loss and 19 quarterback hits.

Elsewhere, corner Alex Austin, recently a full participant while working back from a wrist procedure, will go without a game status as the deadline for his activation to the 53-man roster nears with an open spot. And all-purpose nose tackle Khyiris Tonga also stands with the green light to face the Texans after missing the previous three games due to a foot injury.

“Great to have him practice, but what matters is what it’s going to be on Sunday at 3,” New England’s head coach said of Tonga. “I would say that hopefully he can pick up where he left off in his production and what he’s been able to do inside there as an interior, rotational player.”",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2255933305.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C78.543181364843&w=1200,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:18.793003

The league is coming off a truly wild Wild Card Weekend, with most games decided in the final moments, setting the stage for what's shaping up to be one of the most memorable postseason runs in recent memory. The bar is high for the divisional round -- and it has a lot to live up to.

As much as the focus is on the matchups that will determine who advances and who goes home, injuries are also looming large. Wild Card Weekend delivered plenty of drama, but it also took a toll. The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle for the remainder of the season with a torn Achilles, while Texans wide receiver Nico Collins and Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez each exited their games with concussions. Meanwhile, the Seahawks are keeping a close eye on Sam Darnold after he suffered an oblique injury during practice.

Epenesa (neck), tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee, calf) and linebacker Matt Milano (ankle) also enter the weekend without injury designations after each was limited throughout the week. On Friday, Buffalo did activate both defensive tackle Ed Oliver and receiver Curtis Samuel off of injured reserve, signaling their return. Oliver hasn't played since Week 8.

Denver is relatively healthy heading into this matchup. Just four players appeared on the final injury report, and only two have been ruled out. Most notably, linebacker Dre Greenlaw logged a full practice on Thursday and carries no injury designation.

These teams met in Week 18 in what was a battle for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. It ended up in a dominant display for the Seahawks' defense as they stalled the 49ers' offense en route to a 13-3 victory.

That win ensured Seattle had last week off during the wild-card weekend. Now, they're back in action for the divisional round on Jan. 17.

San Francisco upset host Philadelphia last weekend thanks to some trickery on offense and standout performances by veterans on defense. They're on the road once again for this one.

This week marks the first playoff game for Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold since last year's wild-card round when he and the Minnesota Vikings lost to the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams' defense rattled Darnold with nine sacks in that one.

Darnold will look to change that narrative in the playoffs against his former team. He's 2-1 against the 49ers since spending the 2023 NFL season in San Francisco.

But he popped up on the injury report this week with an oblique issue. Here's the latest on his status for the divisional playoffs:

Is Sam Darnold playing against the 49ers?

The Seahawks quarterback explained what happened and why he ended up on the injury report during a Jan. 15 press conference. His response indicates he'll be on the field for the Seahawks-49ers game.

""Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said today. ""Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold didn't shine against the 49ers when they faced off three weeks ago but played well enough to earn the win. He finished 20-for-26 passing for 198 yards.

One more thing going well for Darnold and the Seahawks' offense: left tackle Charles Cross was cleared from the injury report and is expected to be a full-go for the upcoming game. He'd previously been on the injury report with a knee issue.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/16/USAT/88217022007-usatsi-27926980.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-16 18:02:29.324696

Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins remains in concussion protocol and missed Thursday’s media session, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander.

Collins is unlikely to play in Sunday’s divisional round game against the New England Patriots because of the steps needed to clear concussion protocol.

Collins suffered the concussion in Monday’s wild-card 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards in the game before going down.

If Collins cannot go, expect Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins, and Dalton Schultz to see an increase in targets. Jaylin Noel, Xavier Hutchinson and Cade Stover could also see an increased role.

Darnold told reporters he ""felt a little something"" during practice on Thursday but that he expects to play on Saturday.

As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is out for the rest of the postseason with a torn Achilles, veteran linebacker Fred Warner won't be activated and second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is questionable due to a nagging knee injury.

That unit will not have Collins in this pivotal matchup with the Patriots, however, as he's out with a concussion he suffered in last week's win over the Steelers. With Collins out, Houston's more unproven receivers like Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel will have to step up as primary targets for C.J. Stroud. Making things harder is star cornerback Christian Gonzalez has cleared concussion protocol for New England and will play.

The Patriots are 3-point favorites, and the total is 40.5 -- the lowest of this four-game slate.

Los Angeles Rams at Chicago Bears (6:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)

The Rams are in a good spot when it comes to the health department, and the biggest injury news for the Bears is that second-year receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with a foot injury that cost him considerable time this year. Odunze played last week and told reporters he expects to suit up against the Rams.

Although veteran WR Mack Hollins (abdomen) remains on injured reserve, the Patriots didn't rule any players on their active roster out on their final injury report. On Friday, New England listed OLB Harold Landry III (knee), and RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) as questionable for Sunday's divisional round matchup vs. the Texans.

Starting with the defense, Pro Bowl CB Christian Gonzalez was cleared to play and is off the injury report after being in concussion protocol this week. Gonzalez exited last Sunday's Wild Card win over the Chargers in the fourth quarter after he appeared to injure himself breaking up a pass earlier in the quarter. Gonzalez did not return to the game and was placed in the league's concussion protocol. During the week, the star cornerback practiced on Wednesday in a red non-contact jersey and then shed the red jersey as a full participant in the final two practices, indicating that he's trending in the right direction.

Gonzalez spent most of last week's matchup covering Chargers deep threat Quentin Johnston, breaking up both passes intended for Johnston. In all, Gonzalez didn't allow a catch on five targets vs. Los Angeles. As one of the best cornerbacks in the league, Gonzalez allows the Patriots to increase the blitz pressure because they trust their corners on islands. Last week, New England blitzed Chargers QB Justin Herbert on 45.5% of his drop-backs, pressuring him nine times. Texans QB C.J. Stroud ranks 17th in expected points added per drop-back against the blitz, so the Patriots might continue to heat up Houston's quarterback on Sunday afternoon with all their cornerbacks healthy.

Along with Gonzalez trending toward being available, the Patriots defense and short-yardage offense could get a big boost from the return of NT Khyiris Tonga. Tonga, who hasn't played since injuring his foot in Week 16, returned to practice this week. The big nose tackle is a stout run-stopper who registered 12 run stuffs this season and shows impressive power to dent the pocket as a bull rusher. Plus, the 335-pound defender has played 14 snaps on offense this season as a short-yardage blocker.

The Patriots have gotten pretty creative with Tonga on offense, moving him around to create advantageous blocking angles in the run game. One of the Texans defense's many strengths is its ability to stop the run (third in rush EPA), particularly in short-yardage situations, where Houston ranks fifth in power success rate (59.5%). Tonga could help the Patriots offense get those tough yards when they're in power situations.

The final puzzle piece on defense is the status of captain Harold Landry III, who has been managing a knee injury for the last several weeks. After resting his knee in the last two regular season games, Landry returned for the Wild Card win over the Chargers but didn't register any pressures in just 26 snaps. If the captain doesn't play, New England will likely lean on Anfernee Jennings and Elijah Ponder on the edge opposite K'Lavon Chaisson, while new addition Derrell Taylor is a candidate to be a practice squad elevation.

Moving over to the offense, the Patriots mostly have a clean bill of health. The only question mark was jumbo tight end/third tackle Thayer Munford Jr., who has been dealing with a knee injury over the last few weeks. Munford played through the injury last week, so one would expect him to play on Sunday. The jumbo package could be a big part of New England's game plan. With six offensive linemen on the field, the Patriots can load up protections to get multiple blockers on the Texans elite pass rushers. Houston ranks just 21st in pass EPA against jumbo packages, compared to first against regular personnel groupings. Therefore, one would expect the Patriots offense to test the Texans pass defense in jumbo packages.

As for the Texans, Houston ruled out star WR Nico Collins (concussion) after he exited their Wild Card win over the Steelers. Collins led the Texans with 1,117 receiving yards in the regular season, tied for ninth in the NFL, and also hauled in six touchdowns. This season, the Texans average nearly a full yard per play more with Collins on the field (5.6) versus off the field (4.8), so that's a major blow to Houston's offense. After not practicing the first two days, RT Trent Brown (ankle) is officially questionable.

New England also has the option to activate RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) and CB Alex Austin (wrist) from injured reserve, with both players practicing this week. The Patriots created an open roster spot by releasing veteran RB D'Ernest Johnson, who re-signed with the team's practice squad, which would suggest they might activate Jennings as their third running back. At cornerback, the Pats must activate Austin this week or his 21-day window to return from injured reserve will close, shutting him down for the rest of the season. Most likely, that'll come down to whether the Patriots prefer Austin over rookie DB Kobee Minor on special teams.

New England has until Saturday at 4 p.m. ET to activate Austin and Jennings from injured reserve, while the team can also use its two standard practice squad elevations for Sunday's game. We will keep you updated on all the moving parts on the roster. The Patriots will then host the Texans with kickoff at 3 p.m. ET at Gillette Stadium on Sunday.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/qez7daojcmdadpuzrmz4,N,,2026-01-16 18:02:46.231925

If McGary is back to form in 2026, the Falcons will once again have an offensive line that can set the tone for their offense.","FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — Atlanta's offensive line was dealt a tough blow on the final day of training camp when starting right tackle Kaleb McGary sustained a leg injury that ended his 2025 season before it began.

Further complicating matters was an ankle injury to swing tackle Storm Norton, who was McGary's primary backup. The injury was initially expected to cost Norton only a portion of the season, but he never suited up for the Falcons in 2025. That left Atlanta to enter the season with veteran journeyman Elijah Wilkinson starting on Penix's blind side.

Wilkinson ended up playing every offensive snap for the Falcons in 2025, joining Ryan Neuzil as the only two players to do so. Even with a heavy reliance on two new faces in the starting lineup, Atlanta's offensive line was still a force to be reckoned with on the ground.

Let's take a closer look at how the group did.

Biggest question facing the position group in 2026:

How will Kaleb McGary bounce back from injury?

McGary's season-ending injury late in training camp was a setback for an offensive line group that has been remarkably consistent the last few years. And while Elijah Wilkinson performed well in his stead throughout the 2025 season, McGary's return should bolster the offense.

The former first-round pick is under contract for the next two seasons, and his abilities as a run blocker should be valued by whoever the Falcons' next head coach and general manager are. Given that McGary sustained his knee injury before the 2025 season started, he should be back up to full speed next fall.

His return would be a benefit to Atlanta's run game, which just featured a record-setting performance from Bijan Robinson. McGary's ability in the open field has and should continue to be an asset to the Falcons' outside zone attack, and he has improved as a pass protector since joining the team in 2019.

If McGary is back to form in 2026, the Falcons will once again have an offensive line that can set the tone for their offense.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/falcons/udnsjuodoaelvcylcwl5,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:33.795560

The Houston Texans defense had the most complete game of any unit last season. How can the New England Patriots move the ball against them?

We’ll look at the most important matchups on both sides of the ball in the AFC’s two divisional games this weekend.

Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos (4:30 p.m. ET Saturday)

Key matchup: TE Dalton Kincaid vs. Broncos linebackers

From weeks 11 to 17 (the opposing Kansas City Chiefs rested starters in Week 18), the Broncos had a defensive drop-off, going from elite to very good. They still were a very disruptive defense in that span, leading the league in negative play rate (37.2 percent), but dropped to 10th in success rate (57.1 percent), 23rd in EPA per dropback (-0.13) and 21st in points per drive (2.25). Notably, they struggled against mobile quarterbacks. Marcus Mariota, Trevor Lawrence and Jordan Love, even though he doesn’t run as much, had success extending plays and scrambling against the Broncos.

Aside from Josh Allen’s ability to create off-script plays, there are a few ways the Bills offense matches up favorably against the Broncos defense. The Broncos defense specializes in taking away outside receivers with cornerbacks Patrick Surtain and Riley Moss, and of course, that will be an issue for the Bills, but they don’t rely on their outside receivers winning at a high rate to move the ball. The Bills rank fifth in receiving yards to tight ends and running backs.

In the playoff matchup with the Broncos last season, the Bills were able to run for 210 yards on a defense that ranked first in success rate that year. More importantly, they took advantage of the Broncos’ linebackers by targeting running backs and tight ends (seven catches for 101 yards). Dalton Kincaid has missed several games this season with injuries, but he’s improved as a player and should be a major part of the Bills’ game plan.

The Broncos have given up the ninth-most yards to tight ends this season and the eighth-highest average yards per reception to tight ends (10.7). They major in man coverage, but their linebackers don’t play man coverage at a high level. Dre Greenlaw should help, but he’s a better zone defender. Strong safety Talanoa Hufanga is elite in so many areas but weak in man coverage as well.

The Bills should have a similar game plan to last year’s playoff game and target Kincaid. We could even see running back Ty Johnson run some routes against the linebackers.

Key matchup: Bills defensive coordinator Bobby Babich vs. QB Bo Nix

Bills coach Sean McDermott and defensive coordinator Bobby Babich are doing their finest work this season with the defense. It has had injury issues upfront and is being pieced together by retread players such as 34-year-old safety Jordan Poyer and cornerback Tre’Davious White, who has a long injury history. But what they lack in athleticism, they make up for with knowledge of the system and savvy. The Bills are disguising at a high level and constantly breaking tendencies. It’s hard to get a bead on what they are doing with their pre-snap movement.

Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars’ passing game were on a tear coming into the postseason. The Bills held them to 7 points in the first half, but Poyer was hurt late in the second quarter. Poyer’s injury limited what they could do from an exotic coverage standpoint, but with more practice time with his replacement, Jordan Hancock, the Bills should be able to crank the dial up with their disguises more.

6:48 remaining in the third quarter, first-and-10

Here, the Bills initially showed two-high coverage with both safeties sitting deep.

After the snap, Hancock rotated down, making it appear the defense had rotated into a one-high coverage. Lawrence thought he would have tight end Brenton Strange open down the seam, but the Bills actually rotated a different two-high coverage than the initial look. They played inverted Cover 2 toward Strange’s side, meaning White was playing a deep half rather than staying outside.

White was able to run underneath Strange and nearly pick off the pass.

Bo Nix has struggled against disguised coverages this season. According to Pro Football Focus, when Nix faced two-high switching to one-high coverage rotations, his EPA per dropback was -0.26. Against one-high switching to two-high coverage rotations, his EPA per dropback was -0.02. To put that in perspective, Tennessee Titans quarterback Cam Ward ranked 33rd in EPA per dropback among qualifying quarterbacks, and it was -0.15. Nix’s performance dips significantly against disguised coverages, and the Bills disguise on 40 percent of snaps (league average is 33 percent).

Although the point has been made ad nauseam, it’s imperative the Broncos run the ball efficiently and keep Nix out of third-and-long situations where the Bills can get exotic. The Bills have statistically one of the worst run defenses in the league all season, but they’ve had some spike games when some of their run blitzes and line games hit home. The Jaguars did a good job using motion to displace them, and their running backs ran for 121 yards on 15 carries (8 yards per carry). They should have run the ball more.

The Broncos rank 12th in rushing success rate and explosive run rate. They are better than average at running the ball, but I’m not sure I’d trust them to dominate and completely take the ball out of Nix’s hands. If the game becomes a high-scoring one and they get into a passing script, how Nix can decipher the Bills’ disguised coverages will be key.

Houston Texans at New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET Sunday)

Key matchup: RB Rhamondre Stevenson vs. LB Henry To’oTo’o

Last week, for the Steelers-Texans game, I highlighted Pittsburgh running back Kenneth Gainwell’s matchup with Houston linebacker Henry To’oTo’o, who is a hyperaggressive player against the run but can struggle against the pass. Gainwell ended up converting six targets for four catches and 26 yards. He led the Steelers in catches and was tied for second in receiving yards. He was a big part of the Steelers’ game plan. He was open on several plays and dropped a pass, but ultimately, he had to chip the Texans’ ends on too many plays and couldn’t free release.

There aren’t many weaknesses in the Texans defense, and they have matchup advantages across the board against the New England Patriots’ pass catchers. Running back Rhamondre Stevenson had his most productive game as a receiver last week against the Los Angeles Chargers, catching three passes for 75 yards. Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels is one of the best at drawing up plays for pass-catching running backs.

The Patriots offensive line struggled to block the Chargers’ pass rush. The Texans’ pass rush is on an entirely different tier. Quarterback Drake Maye is going to have to get rid of the ball quickly. Quick passes to Stevenson or TreVeyon Henderson running routes against To’oTo’o should be an effective tool on early downs.

Key matchup: DT Milton Williams vs. Texans interior O-line

Milton Williams, one of the Patriots’ best defenders, missed all of December with a high ankle sprain. He came back for the final game of the season, and although he still hasn’t quite looked like himself, he flashed against the Chargers, sacking Justin Herbert twice.

The Chargers have arguably the worst offensive line in football, and there were quite a few plays in which Williams wasn’t disruptive. But maybe being another week removed from his injury and two games under his belt to get into game shape, we’ll see the Williams who was dominant at the beginning of the season.

The Texans don’t have an explosive run game, but they’ve become an efficient running team after making Woody Marks the lead back and getting more entrenched in first-year offensive coordinator Nick Caley’s scheme. Against the Steelers in the wild-card round, the Texans rushed for 164 yards, averaging 5.3 yards per carry. The Texans are a below-average pass-blocking team, and their offense was able to turn the corner when they started reducing the rate at which they faced third-and-long situations.

Before Williams was hurt in Week 11, the Patriots ranked eighth in defensive rushing success rate. In the six games he missed, they ranked 31st. The Patriots need Williams to be a stalwart for their run defense against a Texans offense that wants to run the ball on early downs and reduce risk.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/15212419/USATSI_25173167-scaled-e1768530292662.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:37.303706

For the Bears, Rome Odunze and linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin are both questionable, with defensive back Nick McCloud ruled out. Odunze has a foot injury that he played through last week against Green Bay and he plans to play on Sunday, too.

C.J. Gardner-Johnson is off the injury report and good to go for Rams-Bears, as well. He missed last week's game with a concussion.

Experts weigh in on 'crackpot' theory,Evan Webeck,,,,,https://www.mercurynews.com/2026/01/16/49ers-injuries-power-plant-theory-electromagnetic-waves/,"The low-frequency electromagnetic waves produced by a power plant neighboring Levi’s Stadium are apparently to blame for the 49ers’ injury woes, a recent viral social media thread alleges.
“There is definitely at least basic science research that suggests electromagnetic fields can potentially help healing,” Pandya said.
The theory, which claims “low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage,” has spread as far as the Niners locker room.
Wide receiver Kendrick Bourne quipped recently, “Yeah, it’s that power plant,” when he was asked about the toll of the team’s trouble staying healthy.
The city considered moving the power plant when Levi’s Stadium was constructed but opted only to reconfigure it at the same location.","The list of players who have ended up on the injured reserve in recent years is so long, so star-studded that the San Francisco 49ers faithful have had it.

They’ve resorted to online conspiracy theories.

The low-frequency electromagnetic waves produced by a power plant neighboring Levi’s Stadium are apparently to blame for the 49ers’ injury woes, a recent viral social media thread alleges. There is, in fact, some basis to the idea that electromagnetic waves can affect the human body, explained Dr. Nirav Pandya.

As a sports orthopedic surgeon at UC San Francisco, he has used them before. To help treat injuries, ranging from rotator cuff tears to bone fractures.

“There is definitely at least basic science research that suggests electromagnetic fields can potentially help healing,” Pandya said. “Unless you’re sitting in a lab and overexposing yourself, the (idea) that it would be detrimental and affect an entire team would be pretty remarkable.”

That is, however, precisely the premise of an idea that has taken hold among fans — and some players — of one of the NFL’s most injury-riddled teams.

After George Kittle became the latest 49ers star to see his season ended by injury, tearing his Achilles in their wild-card round win at Philadelphia, a post on the social media site X tying the team’s injury woes to a “massive electrical substation” next to their stadium and practice fields gained traction. It echoed a post from another user in October that was quickly shot down.

As of this writing, the post by Peter Cowan, a wellness entrepreneur with about 6,000 followers and a Substack blog, had been seen by 22 million users, garnered 35,000 likes and been reposted more than 5,800 times. He previously used the profile mostly to promote his app that hails the healing properties of sunlight.

The theory, which claims “low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage,” has spread as far as the Niners locker room. Wide receiver Kendrick Bourne quipped recently, “Yeah, it’s that power plant,” when he was asked about the toll of the team’s trouble staying healthy.

What “scares” Dr. Michael Hoff isn’t whether Cowan is right or wrong, he said, “I think crazy theories are fine. … But like, the fact that the rest of the world kind of goes, ‘Oh, maybe that’s true.’ That’s a scary thing. But that’s more about the internet.”

As the director of diagnostic medical physics in UCSF’s radiology department, Hoff called the idea “very, very crackpot” but he added, “That’s not to say something that hasn’t been proven doesn’t exist.”

Huff identified two “huge jumps” Cowan makes in his claim.

First, he questioned Cowan’s method of measurement. The earth’s magnetic field ranges from 250-650 milligauss (mG). Cowan uses a device that recorded a reading of around 8.5-9.0 mG above normal from the perimeter of the Niners practice facility, a hundred yards or so from the power plant. That amounts to a “tiny, tiny little extra amount of magnetic field,” Hoff said.

“Second of all, even if you multiplied it by a million and centered it in Levi’s Stadium, would it even damage tissue? There’s no evidence of that, either.”

According to the World Health Organization, “most scientists and clinicians agree that any health effects of low-level electromagnetic fields, if they exist at all, are likely to be very small compared to other health risks that people face in everyday life.”

Dr. Joel Moskowitz, a UC Berkeley researcher who serves on the International Commission on the Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, acknowledged that the theory laid out by Cowan is “not the most likely risk factor” to the 49ers’ injuries but wasn’t willing to write it off.

“I believe there is some credence to this theory,” he said. “Conventional wisdom is that none of this stuff can harm you, but that’s just BS in my point of view.”

While the EPA states “scientific studies have not consistently shown whether exposure to any source of EMF increases cancer risk,” Moskowitz cited a study that found increased leukemia risk in children at exposures as low as 4.0 mG and pointed to a meta-analysis of 345 studies since 1990 that found “significant adverse effects from exposure to … extremely low frequency and static electromagnetic fields.”

Most of the work, however, pertains to cancer risk. There is less evidence to back up Cowan’s claim that “the magnetic fields pouring out of the substation … trigger a multi-pathway assault on collagen,” weakening tendons and soft tissue.

Injury data does back up what we’ve seen with our own eyes: The Niners have been one of the least-healthy teams in the NFL. According to Sports Info Solutions’ analysis, only the Cardinals and Commanders were more impacted by injuries this season. Dating back to 2016, the year before Kyle Shanahan was hired as head coach, the 49ers’ 1,970 cumulative games lost on IR are the most in the NFL, according to analysis TruMedia conducted for SFGate.

However, when San Francisco made the Super Bowl in 2023-24, it was one of the league’s healthiest teams. And some of the team’s most serious losses, whether it be Fred Warner’s broken ankle or Brock Purdy’s turf toe, “have nothing to do with collagen or soft tissue,” Pandya, the orthopedic surgeon, said. “It’s football. It’s violent.”

Shanahan’s smash-mouth style on offense — and a defense focused on reacting and tackling at maximum effort — is one reason some have speculated could lead to injury. Players themselves cited turf issues at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium for a game that saw two 49ers tear their ACLs. San Francisco ranked eighth overall out of 32 teams on the NFL Players’ Association’s latest satisfaction survey, but its training room and training staff received the worst marks, both among the bottom third in the league.

The substation, which is owned and operated by Silicon Valley Power, has been there since 1986, three years before the team moved its headquarters and practice facility to the same site. The city considered moving the power plant when Levi’s Stadium was constructed but opted only to reconfigure it at the same location.

Former 49ers Jon Feliciano and Taybor Pepper have said the nearby substation had been a topic of discussion in the locker room long before Cowan’s post on Jan. 6, and Bourne made it clear that the current group has at least seen the recent discourse online. The Washington Post surveyed about two dozen NFL agents this week, roughly one-third of whom reported hearing concerns from their clients about the power plant.

With an NFC divisional playoff showdown set for Saturday in Seattle, the 49ers will be without Kittle, All-Pro defensive end Nick Bosa and in all likelihood Warner, in addition to a handful of other onetime starters. At least wide receiver Ricky Pearsall, who missed last week’s game with a nagging PCL strain, is trending toward returning against the Seahawks.

As for the unlikely explanation for why the 49ers will be so undermanned, the organization declined to weigh in. The City of Santa Clara, which owns Silicon Valley Power, did not respond to requests for comment.

“It’s just so hard to make the argument that this is the sole reason why they have more injuries,” Pandya said of the substation theory. “Particularly when there’s not even basic science data that suggests that this level of exposure could cause it.”",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BNG-L-49ERS-0112-4.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-16 17:04:13.930067

As with most linebacker ankle injuries, the concern is reduced mobility and ability to change direction.","As the NFL divisional round approaches, injuries are playing a major role in shaping each matchup. Several key starters and important depth players for the Saturday match-up are either sidelined or fighting through lingering issues. These injury reports give a clearer picture of who will be available and how each team may need to adjust its game plan.

Buffalo Bills

Maxwell Hairston – CB (Ankle) – OUT

Hairston injured his ankle late in the regular season and was unable to return to practice this week, leading to his official ruling out. The injury likely occurred in coverage when he was forced to plant and change direction, a common mechanism for ankle sprains in defensive backs. His absence removes a rotational corner and forces Buffalo to lean more heavily on younger or less experienced depth in sub-packages, which could be tested by Denver’s outside receivers.

Jordan Poyer – S (Hamstring) – OUT

Poyer’s hamstring injury has lingered, and the team opted not to push him in a short playoff week. Hamstring strains are especially problematic for safeties, as their role requires repeated sprinting, sudden stops, and lateral movement. Without Poyer, the Bills lose a key communicator and stabilizing presence in the secondary, increasing the risk of coverage busts and reducing reliability in run support.

Ty Johnson – RB (Ankle) – QUESTIONABLE

Johnson tweaked his ankle during late-season action and has been limited in practice, creating uncertainty about his availability and workload. An ankle injury can limit explosion and cutting ability, which are critical to his role as a change-of-pace back. If he is inactive or limited, Buffalo’s backfield rotation tightens, putting more pressure on the starters and reducing flexibility in pass protection and screen concepts.

Curtis Samuel – WR (Elbow) – QUESTIONABLE

Samuel has been dealing with an elbow issue that surfaced in practice and has restricted his reps. Elbow injuries can affect both catching reliability and willingness to engage in contact over the middle. If Samuel cannot go or is limited, the Bills lose a versatile weapon who is often used on jet motion, short crossers, and gadget plays, shrinking the playbook and making the offense easier to predict.

Ed Oliver – DT (Biceps) – QUESTIONABLE

Oliver suffered a biceps strain, most likely while engaging blockers in the trenches, and his participation has been limited. For an interior defensive lineman, arm strength and leverage are essential, and a compromised biceps can significantly reduce effectiveness. If Oliver is limited or out, Buffalo’s interior pass rush suffers, giving Denver’s quarterback more room to step up in the pocket.

Terrel Bernard – LB (Calf) – QUESTIONABLE

Bernard is dealing with calf tightness, an injury that often arises from overuse or sudden acceleration. Calf injuries can linger and limit range of motion, particularly in lateral pursuit. His potential absence would thin Buffalo’s linebacker rotation and weaken coverage against tight ends and running backs in the short passing game.

Damar Hamlin – S (Pectoral) – QUESTIONABLE

Hamlin injured his pectoral muscle, typically the result of contact or tackling impact, and has been limited in practice. A pectoral injury can affect tackling strength and ability to engage blockers. If he is limited or unable to go, Buffalo loses depth and physicality at safety, which could be exposed in Denver’s run game and play-action concepts.

Denver Broncos

Krull suffered a foot injury and was unable to practice, leading to his designation as out. Foot injuries for tight ends are especially challenging given the position’s dual blocking and receiving responsibilities. His absence reduces Denver’s depth in heavy packages and limits their ability to rotate tight ends to keep players fresh in the run game.

Drew Sanders – LB (Ankle) – OUT

Sanders injured his ankle, likely in traffic or while changing direction in pursuit, and has not been able to return. Ankle injuries significantly affect a linebacker’s ability to fill gaps and drop into coverage. Without Sanders, Denver loses athleticism and flexibility at the second level, which could be problematic against Buffalo’s spread formations and running back routes.

San Francisco 49ers

Ji’Ayir Brown – S (Hamstring) – OUT

Brown strained his hamstring, an injury commonly sustained during sprinting or sudden acceleration in coverage. Hamstrings are notoriously slow to heal and easily re-aggravated, making it risky to rush a player back. His absence reduces San Francisco’s flexibility in sub-packages and places more responsibility on the remaining safeties to handle deep coverage and run support.

Fred Warner – LB (Ankle) – OUT

Warner’s ankle injury is a major blow, as he is the emotional leader and on-field quarterback of the defense. The injury likely occurred in traffic or while planting to change direction, and the team has chosen not to risk further damage. Without Warner, the 49ers lose elite range, diagnostic ability, and communication in the middle of the defense, which can lead to misalignments and softer coverage against tight ends and crossing routes.

Jacob Cowing – WR (Hamstring) – QUESTIONABLE

Cowing is managing a hamstring issue that limited his practice reps throughout the week. As a speed-based receiver, any hamstring tightness directly impacts his effectiveness and ability to separate. If he cannot play, the 49ers lose a vertical and motion threat, narrowing the spacing of the offense and making coverage assignments easier for Seattle.

Luke Gifford – LB (Quadriceps) – QUESTIONABLE

Gifford is dealing with a quad injury, typically caused by overextension or direct contact. Quadriceps injuries can reduce power and burst, which are critical for special teams and rotational linebacker duties. If he is limited or inactive, San Francisco’s depth in the linebacker room becomes even thinner with Warner already out.

Ricky Pearsall – WR (Knee) – QUESTIONABLE

Pearsall has knee soreness that has restricted his workload in practice. Knee issues can affect cutting, route precision, and confidence when planting. If he cannot go or is limited, the 49ers lose another young receiver in the rotation, putting more pressure on the starters and reducing flexibility in three- and four-receiver sets.

Dee Winters – LB (Ankle) – QUESTIONABLE

Winters is nursing an ankle injury that has limited his reps. Like Sanders in Denver, ankle injuries for linebackers can be especially problematic because of the need for lateral movement and sudden direction changes. If Winters is unavailable, San Francisco’s linebacker depth is stretched dangerously thin, increasing the risk of fatigue and missed assignments.

Seattle Seahawks

Elijah Arroyo – TE (Knee) – OUT

Arroyo suffered a knee injury that has kept him out of practice, leading to his designation as out. Knee injuries often affect stability and leverage, which are essential for tight ends in blocking situations. His absence reduces Seattle’s ability to run two-tight-end sets and limits options in the short and intermediate passing game.

Josh Jones – OL (Knee) – OUT

Jones injured his knee and will miss the game, forcing Seattle to reshuffle its offensive line. Knee injuries for linemen are particularly disruptive because they affect anchor strength and lateral movement. Without Jones, Seattle may be forced to start a backup or move personnel around, increasing the risk of protection breakdowns against San Francisco’s pass rush.

Chazz Surratt – LB (Ankle) – OUT

Surratt’s ankle injury has sidelined him for the Divisional Round. As with most linebacker ankle injuries, the concern is reduced mobility and ability to change direction. His absence weakens Seattle’s depth in the middle of the defense and puts more strain on the remaining linebackers to handle both run fits and coverage responsibilities.

Sam Darnold – QB (Oblique) – QUESTIONABLE

Darnold strained his oblique muscle, an injury often caused by rotational stress during throwing. Oblique injuries can affect throwing power, accuracy, and overall comfort in the pocket. Even if he plays, Seattle may limit the game plan to shorter throws and quicker reads, which could restrict the offense and make it easier for the 49ers’ defense to anticipate play calls.

Conclusion

In the playoffs, every absence is magnified, and even one missing player can change the tone of a game. Teams with better health and depth will have a clear advantage as the competition tightens. Ultimately, how well coaches adapt to these injuries could be the difference between moving on and going home.",https://www.thebiglead.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/USATSI_27927076_168396005_lowres.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 16:01:53.168981

You have to go earn every single yard.""

In their last meeting, Seattle held the Niners to three points, Shanahan's fewest in a game since Week 1, 2017, and 173 total yards, the fewest in the coach's career. Seattle has been able to slow down the 49ers' run game while playing two-deep safeties to take away deep passes.

""We got to run the ball better; we got to be better on third down so we can get more ops to run the ball. That's really the biggest thing is we got to stay on the field so we can keep calling runs then hopefully, you can get the defense to commit another guy in the box, which helps other things.""

The 49ers are 7-1 since Purdy returned from injury that cut out the middle of his campaign. The only loss came in Week 18 to the Seahawks. From Weeks 11-17, he generated a 111.5 passer rating, but has just a 73.1 passer rating over his last two tilts versus Seattle and Philadelphia.

""It's going to take an exceptional effort on our part to give ourselves a chance,"" Bears defensive coordinator Dennis Allen said, via the Chicago Sun-Times.

In the Rams' wild-card win over Carolina, Nacua and Adams combined for 15 catches, 183 receiving yards and a touchdown. Nacua posted 10 grabs for 111 yards and the score on 18 targets. Adams, in his first game back after missing three tilts with a hamstring injury, snagged just 5 of 13 targets but generated 72 yards.

Nacua is the key to the L.A. offense, leading the NFL with 129 catches in 2025 and finishing second in the league with 1,715 yards. The powerful wideout's ability to make contested catches, coupled with his run-after-catch ability, makes him a handful for any defense. The only time Nacua faced an Allen-led defense, in 2023 against the New Orleans Saints, he put up 164 yards and a TD on nine grabs.

""You come away from there thoroughly impressed,"" Allen said of Nacua. ""He runs as fast as he needs to to get the job done. He's big, he's physical. He catches everything that's remotely close to him and he's tremendous with the run after the catch. I just think he does everything that you want a receiver to be able to do.""

Nacua's fearlessness at the point of attack and sticky hands leads to some ridiculous catches. He's also a bully with the ball in his hands and is faster on the field than his 4.57-yard 40 time indicates.

""He might not be the fastest, but he's damn sure one of the toughest,"" cornerback Chauncey Gardner-Johnson said.

Chicago knows Adams' ability well from his time in Green Bay. Only Calvin Johnson Jr. has more receiving touchdowns (11) than Adams (10) against the Bears in the Super Bowl era. Adams led the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns despite missing the final three games of the season. He's a weapon in the red zone that Chicago must keep out of paydirt Sunday.

Asked previously who needs to step up if Collins can't suit up, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said: ""Whoever is open, baby.""","Three must-know storylines

Maye faces his toughest challenge yet. Drake Maye has had an MVP-caliber second season, and he rebounded from a slow start last week to finish strong in a win over the Chargers. But Maye arguably faces his toughest test of his season with the Texans' defense, which ranked top three in the regular season in points per game allowed (17.4), yards per game allowed (277.2) and takeaways (29). Houston dominated the Steelers in last week's 30-6 win. The Texans are sure to take note of Maye's struggles when the Chargers went man coverage, completing only 1 of 7 passes for 7 yards while taking three sacks, per Next Gen Stats. Houston played man slightly less than the league average in the regular season at 25.2% of the time. But when the Texans went man against the Steelers on Monday, Aaron Rodgers was only 1 for 6 passing for 4 yards and a sack. The Patriots' offensive line, with two rookies starting, will have its hands full with an elite rush unit led by Will Anderson Jr., Danielle Hunter and Sheldon Rankins. Maye has an escape hatch with his running ability, and the Texans have occasionally struggled with running quarterbacks, even while keeping Josh Allen and others in check. But Maye also has receiving threats on all three levels. Kayshon Boutte and Kyle Williams are deep threats. Stefon Diggs and Hunter Henry often patrol the intermediate part of the field. And the Patriots have a strong short passing game, with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson getting more in on the fun, in addition to what they offer in the run game. Stevenson has especially been a weapon down the stretch, but the Texans have bottled up some quality backs this season.

Stroud hoping for bounce-back effort against reenergized Patriots D. C.J. Stroud was starting his fifth career postseason game Monday against the Steelers, which is why it was surprising he appeared spooked at times during a three-turnover performance. Stroud fumbled five times (losing two) and threw his first red-zone interception since 2023 in the win, thankfully bailed out by his team's dominant defense. Stroud also had some good moments in the game, but he'll need to have a far cleaner outing against a Patriots defense that mercilessly pressured Justin Herbert last week. Since getting Milton Williams back, the Patriots' pass-rush unit has appeared significantly more impactful, and they're also deeper and healthier at linebacker. Stroud's ballhandling issues were out of character, but the least he can do is get more in sync with center Jake Andrews; three of the fumbles came on shaky snaps. What steadied Houston's offense against the Steelers was a strong game from running back Woody Marks, who ran for 112 yards and put the game away with his fourth-quarter touchdown. The Texans run-blocked effectively, with only one negative-yard run, and were able to offset the inconsistent passing game. The Patriots' run defense has been very solid, especially since the return of Williams and Jack Gibbens, who had seven tackles on only 14 defensive snaps last week. If Marks can't get loose, the onus would shift back to Stroud to make plays. Staying patient against the Patriots, who don't allow a lot of big plays, might be the key, although they've shown more willingness to blitz and play more man coverage later in the season.

Injury robs viewers of great head-to-head matchup. Two star players -- Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez and Texans wide receiver Nico Collins -- were likely slated to face off head-to-head against each other quite a bit, but separate injuries clouded their respective statuses ahead of the Divisional Round. Although Gonzalez and Collins both suffered concussions during the Wild Card Round, Gonzalez came off the injury report Friday and is good to go, while Collins won't clear concussion protocol and must sit. The Patriots' defense is simply different with Gonzalez on the field, able to play more man defense when they want to, with Gonzalez often erasing his assignment. According to NGS, Gonzalez didn't allow a reception on five targets (26 coverage snaps) against the Chargers, with two passes defended. Collins, Houston's receiving-yards leader who now has been evaluated for multiple concussions in 2025, leaves a big hole by missing the contest. However, in the one regular-season game Collins missed this season prior to resting in Week 18 (Week 8 vs. San Francisco), C.J. Stroud was terrific, completing 30 of 39 passes for 319 yards, with two TDs and one pick. It was a balanced attack, too, with seven Texans catching multiple passes and no receiver having more than 69 yards. Texans tight end Dalton Schultz has been one of Stroud's most trusted pass catchers, and WR Christian Kirk had his first 100-yard game in more than two seasons on Monday and has a good postseason track record. The Texans also have leaned on Xavier Hutchinson and rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel at times. Asked previously who needs to step up if Collins can't suit up, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said: ""Whoever is open, baby.""

Darnold said he “felt a little something” in his oblique while throwing during Thursday’s practice, but he expects to play Saturday night.

“In routes on air, just kind of felt a little something in my oblique,” Darnold said. “Just didn’t want to push it. Wasn’t the day to push it. So that was it. So just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

Darnold started all 17 regular-season games for the Seahawks while helping lead them to a franchise-best 14-3 record and the NFC’s top seed. He finished eighth in the NFL in completion rate (67.7%), fifth in passing yards (4,048), tied for ninth in touchdown passes (25) and second in yards per pass attempt (8.5). He also threw 14 interceptions, which were the third-most in the league.

Darnold said he’s never experienced oblique issues before.

“We’ll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday,” Darnold said.

When asked about his chances of not being able to play, he responded: “It’s a very low percentage. Probably closer to zero.”

Seattle’s backup quarterback is Drew Lock, who has made 28 starts over his seven-year NFL career.

Lock, a 2019 second-round draft pick by the Denver Broncos, spent his first three seasons in the Mile High City before arriving in Seattle as part of the Russell Wilson trade in March 2022.

Lock then spent the next two seasons backing up former Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith, which included two starts in 2023 when Smith was sidelined with an injury. In the latter of those two starts, Lock led a dramatic game-winning drive against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday Night Football.

Lock signed with the New York Giants in 2024 with the hope of earning their starting job, but ended up making just five starts. He returned to Seattle last April on a two-year, $5 million deal.

Lock has completed 2 of 3 passes for 15 yards this season, with all three pass attempts coming in the latter stages of a Week 3 rout of the New Orleans Saints.

“Drew’s been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,” Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said. “A lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.”

Returning to the practice field on Wednesday in a limited capacity, Tonga was upgraded to a full participant on Thursday — another indication his return is near.

“It feels so good being around my teammates again,” Tonga said. “It sucked to watch them ball out and not be able to be there, but so fun to be back in the groove and getting the hang of things again with them.”

The 29-year old was one of the Patriots biggest surprises to begin the year. Prior to his injury, Tonga had started a career-high eight games and set personnel bests in pressures (14) and run stops (13) as the nose tackle became a key figure along the interior of New England’s defensive line that paced the league’s best run defense.

What the Bills need to do to win: Keep winning short-yardage situations. The tush push on fourth down that propelled Josh Allen 10 yards and helped secure Buffalo’s win over Jacksonville last weekend epitomised how the Bills dominated the game’s crucial moments. The Bills converted four of their five third downs with four yards or to go last Sunday, and they finished fifth in third-down rate in the regular season in the same situations. Denver were eighth this season in third-and-short defensive efficiency (50.6%). Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady will have to find ways to create leverage for Allen and the Bills in those vital moments to keep the scoreboard moving.

What the Broncos need to do to win: Copy the Jaguars (except the losing part). If James Cook, this season’s best running back, had been allowed to take off last Sunday, Jacksonville wouldn’t have kept the game so close. Cook’s meagre 46 yards on 15 carries meant the Jags almost pulled off the victory. Buffalo may struggle to establish the ground game even more against the Broncos: they lost their two best run-blocking receivers toACL tears against the Jags, Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers. Not that the Broncos’ rock-solid front needs too much help: they gave away the second-fewest rushing yards per game this season (91). If Allen is forced to throw, Sean Payton’s defense can feast. They have the most sacks and the highest rate of QB takedowns (68 at 9.7%) and allow the second-lowest pass completion rate (57.8%). Former Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib, who won a Super Bowl with Denver, is confident: “They sending Superman home,” he said this week.

Key player: Nik Bonitto, edge, Broncos. Bonitto has cemented his status as an elite pass rusher with two brilliant seasons in Denver, earning 13.5 sacks in 2024 and 14 in 2025. He has the power to hustle, harass and help show Allen the door.

Prediction: Bills over Broncos.

San Francisco 49ers v Seattle Seahawks (Saturday 8pm ET/Sunday 1am GMT)

What the 49ers need to do to win: Show no fear. San Francisco rolled into Philadelphia with a litany of injuries and proved that this team are so much more than the sum of their parts. You no longer feel that a key figure such as George Kittle landing on injured reserve with a torn achilles will slow them down. Adversity just keeps knitting them tighter together, so much so that, against the Eagles, journeyman receiver Demarcus Robinson produced his first 100+ receiving yard-game since November 2022. A large part of the 49ers’ fight comes from the ultimate underdog quarterback, Brock Purdy. His never-say-die attitude was crucial as he shook off two interceptions and backed his deep ball over a fierce Eagles secondary. If they bring the same fearless attitude to Seattle they can handle Sam Darnold, who says he will play despite being listed as questionable with an oblique injury.

What the Seahawks need to do to win: With Trent Williams back in at left tackle for the 49ers, the Seahawks will have a fight on their hands after a fairly straightforward 13-3 win over San Francisco in Week 18 of the regular season. A clear path to victory though lies behind punishing the 49ers’ weak run defense. In the Week 18 win, Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet’s combined 171 yards rushing yards were essential to keeping the Seahawks’ offense on the field as they chewed up the clock. The pressure told on Purdy, who had limited time to score while facing Seattle’s formidable defense.

Key player: Devon Witherspoon, CB, Seahawks. Witherspoon does everything brilliantly, though you may not always know it as quarterbacks often avoid throwing in his direction. Behind Witherspoon, the Legion of Boom 2.0 conceded the fewest points per game in the regular season (17.2).

Prediction: Seahawks over 49ers (all bets are off if Darnold doesn’t play though).

Houston Texans v New England Patriots (Sunday 3pm ET/8pm GMT)

What the Texans need to do to win: The Texans will expect their defense to make the Patriots suffer. Their offense is less of an asset and lost its best receiver, Nico Collins, to a concussion against Pittsburgh on Monday. Surprisingly, veteran receiver Christian Kirk stepped to lead the Texans to victory after doing next to nothing all season. Kirk made eight grabs for 144 yards and a touchdown and rapidly became Houston’s lone star on offense. In a perfect world, Collins makes it through concussion protocol – although that looks unlikely – if not Kirk needs to continue to do the heavy lifting.

What the Patriots need to do to win: Attack Houston’s offensive line. The Patriots knew they had a huge advantage over the Chargers’ wafer-thin pass protection, and they subjected Justin Herbert to six sacks, 16 pressures and 11 hits. The Patriots need to blitz CJ Stroud as much as possible to force the quarterback into mistakes. The Texans’ offensive line had the 22nd-ranked pass block grade from Pro Football Focus this season. After dominating the Chargers, defensive end Milton Williams needs to be relied on once more to make sure the Patriots punch their ticket to the AFC championship game.

Key player: Rhamondre Stevenson, RB, Patriots. Stevenson may not own the top spot in New England’s backfield for much longer but he showed how vital his versatility as a runner and receiver is in the win over the Chargers. He had 75 yards on three receptions while accounting for 30% of New England’s total offensive output. He is a workhorse whose all-round abilities will be crucial in trying to outfox Houston’s brutal defense.

Prediction: Patriots over Texans.

Los Angeles Rams v Chicago Bears (Sunday 6.30pm ET/11.30pm GMT)

What the Rams need to do to win: The Bears love a comeback, so Sean McVay needs to use every play he has secreted away while leaning on his vast array of offensive weapons. Wringing every last drop of production from Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua is the first step to blowing the Bears out of the water. Stafford targeted Nacua 18 times against the Panthers last weekend, so he should at least be aiming for more than 20 on Sunday. When the Panthers didn’t show Nacua special attention he pulled off a string of chunk plays. He was also deployed as a runner, and bulldozed through three defenders for a touchdown. The Bears will always believe they can dig out a victory so the Rams should give them no hope whatsoever by spamming Nacua’s involvement until Chicago break.

What the Bears need to do to win: Ben Johnson needs to be prepared for the Rams’ pass rush. Los Angeles have a key member of their secondary back: Quentin Lake, who freezes quarterbacks into holding the ball so that McVay’s heavy hitters, Jared Verse, Byron Young and Kobie Turner, can make a decisive sack. Johnson needs to scheme up the offense so they don’t get that chance. He should spotlight the out-of-structure playmaking of Caleb Williams – whose sack rate has dropped from 10.8% as a rookie to 4% this season – to stay one step ahead while using large doses of play action to draw the sting from blitzes. Williams needs to stay on his feet to get the ball out to his receivers who excel in yards after the catch.

Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins remains in concussion protocol and missed Thursday’s media session, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander.

Collins is unlikely to play in Sunday’s divisional round game against the New England Patriots because of the steps needed to clear concussion protocol.

Collins suffered the concussion in Monday’s wild-card 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards in the game before going down.

If Collins cannot go, expect Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins, and Dalton Schultz to see an increase in targets. Jaylin Noel, Xavier Hutchinson and Cade Stover could also see an increased role.

Patrick Mahomes said Thursday the doctors have been holding him back a bit in his rehab because he’s been pushing hard as he recovers from the knee injury he suffered late in the season.

The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback set a hopeful timeline for when he’ll be ready to go as he addressed reporters while he continues to work on getting back to full strength.

You want to be out there healthy and giving us the best chance to win. Obviously, I hope to be able to do some stuff in OTAs and get to training camp and hopefully be able to do a lot there. I’m excited for the process. It’s a long process, but I’m excited for it.""

The one-score games they won in 2024, which helped them to a Super Bowl appearance, turned out to be defeats in 2025. Too many dropped passes and other silly mistakes cost the team multiple times.

""I think just compounding mistakes,"" Mahomes said when asked what went wrong in 2025. ""You make mistakes throughout a game. For myself, I look at some of the red zone interceptions I threw in kind of bigger moments in the third and fourth quarter of games. That’s stuff that I haven’t done in the past, and so speaking for myself, just trying to be better in those moments. I think offensively we weren’t consistent enough throughout games. We had stretches in games where we played good, we had stretches in the season where we played really good.

""We’ve got to be better and that starts with me and then it kind of has to feed throughout the entire offense. So, I think like I said, guys are motivated, coaches, players, we’re all motivated to be better this next year. Like I said, it sucks watching these games. I want to be out there playing football, especially this time of year, it’s the best time of year to play football. It’ll give us the motivation, hopefully, for us to come back stronger next year.""

The relative parity in the league paved the way for tightly contested matchups in the wild card round. But ultimately six teams were sent packing and now we get to see the remaining eight, including the two top seeds, duke it out for spots in the conference championship games.

Here are the games we’ll be watching:

Saturday

Sunday

Last weekend, we learned a lot about the teams that prevailed. Here are the questions that will be answered this weekend.

Can a banged-up Josh Allen survive the Broncos’ pass rush and the altitude in Denver?

Bills quarterback Josh Allen made multiple trips to the injury tent during a physical wild card game against the Jacksonville Jaguars last weekend.

Earlier this week, Buffalo’s injury report listed Allen as “foot/knee/finger,” a testament to the many bumps and bruises he’s nursing at this point in the season. He’ll play, obviously, and continue his quest to seize the moment in a Kansas City Chiefs-less playoff field to finally get his Super Bowl glory.

But, the contact-prone (and some people might say “contact-seeking”) QB will now face a defense that excels at taking down the opposition – literally. The Broncos’ 68 sacks in the regular season were 11 more than any other team and 20 more than any team that made the playoffs.

Allen, the reigning MVP, is the better QB in this matchup, having the edge over second-year Broncos signal-caller Bo Nix, whose only prior playoff start was a loss to Allen and the Bills last season. But not only will Allen face a formidable pass rush, he’ll have to travel to Denver to do so.

The Broncos are healthy, better rested after getting the bye, and for the first time in 10 years, playing a postseason game at home where their acclimation to the mile-high altitude gives them an advantage.

Can the Texans do something they’ve never done before?

The Houston Texans are the NFL’s youngest franchise. But even still, it sticks out that in every one of their prior 23 seasons, they’ve yet to appear in a conference championship game.

Over that same time frame, the Patriots, on the other hand, have played in 12 conference championship games.

This Texans team, however, enters the divisional round on an incredible run – its 10-straight victories are the longest winning streak in the NFL right now and they’re coming off a first-ever franchise playoff road victory. Houston’s defense shone in a resounding 30-6 romp over the Pittsburgh Steelers that featured two defensive touchdowns and four sacks of Aaron Rodgers.

To make franchise history, though, they’ll have to win on the road, again, as underdogs, and potentially without Pro Bowl wide receiver Nico Collins, who is still in concussion protocol after getting injured in the wild card game.

And they’ll have to beat the possible MVP in Pats QB Drake Maye. The 23-year-old looked a little shaky in the first half of his first playoff game last weekend, but he settled down in the second half.

This New England team isn’t the same one that built a dynasty earlier in the 2000s, but taking down the Pats would still qualify as a sign that the Texans are all grown up as a team.

Can the Niners muster any offense in a rematch marred by injury?

It’s a rematch of the Week 18 showdown for the top seed in the NFC that saw the Seahawks prevail by stifling the 49ers’ offense. Seattle’s defense surrendered the fewest points in the regular season, only allowing a single field goal to San Francisco earlier this month. That victory was also part of an NFL-best 6-2 record against playoff teams.

It earned the Seahawks a week of rest while the Niners had to crisscross the country, traveling to Philadelphia for the wild card game and now back to the Pacific Northwest. After they played on Sunday last weekend, San Francisco’s head coach Kyle Shanahan implored the NFL to give his guys a full week of rest before the next round.

Instead, they’ll play Saturday – while their opponent had a bye, the Niners are stuck with a short week for the third time in the past month.

And the same offense that struggled against Seattle so recently will be even more shorthanded in this even higher-stakes matchup after losing George Kittle to a season-ending Achilles injury against the Eagles.

Of course, the injury advantage would tip back the other way if it ends up that Seahawks QB Sam Darnold, currently listed as questionable with an oblique injury, can’t play. Speaking on those reports, Darnold said “nothing to see here” and “feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

Can the Bears keep winning like this?

Last week, we wrote that if the Rams advanced, they could be the Super Bowl favorites. Advance, they did. Although the odds still give the edge to Seattle, the Rams are a very close second. Maybe they’re destined to duke it out officially against Seattle in the conference championship.

But first, they’ll serve as the proving ground for Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears to demonstrate that their high-drama overperformance is a trick that they can turn to even against formidable foes.

Against their rival Green Bay Packers, the Bears won in increasingly classic-for-them fashion. Which is to say, Ben Johnson repeatedly went for it on fourth down, which often failed in maddening fashion but worked just often enough.

On top of that, Chicago fell behind early, trailing 21-6 through three quarters, only to rally for their seventh fourth-quarter comeback of the season. Williams held on the ball for what felt like too long at times, only to rattle off the kind of under-pressure passes that showcased the rare physical tools that made him the top overall draft pick in 2024.

After last weekend, the Bears are 3-3 when trailing by 10 points or more in the final five minutes of the game. The rest of the NFL combined is 3-158. That shouldn’t be a replicable skill.

But if it is? Watch out.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26005565916878.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-16 11:04:10.106486

Darnold, the former Jets first-round draft pick and current Seahawks quarterback, popped up as a surprise name on the Seattle injury report on Thursday, two days before the Seahawks’ Saturday night home NFC divisional playoff showdown with the 49ers.

Darnold has an oblique injury and has been listed as questionable for the game.

It’s not clear when or how Darnold was injured, since Thursday was the first time such an injury was mentioned, and the Seahawks, as the No. 1 seed in the conference, had a bye last week.

Darnold wasn’t on the injury report prior to Thursday.

When speaking to reporters on Thursday, Darnold said he “felt a little something” in his oblique during practice but he expects to play Saturday night.

“[I] just kind of felt a little something in my oblique [and] just didn’t want to push it,’’ Darnold said. “It wasn’t the day to push it, so that was it. So, [I] just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

The last time Darnold played was in the Seahawks’ regular-season finale, a 13-3 win over the 49ers for the No. 1 seed at Lumen Field.

According to reports, Darnold was seen jogging on the practice field Thursday and didn’t appear to be laboring or having any trouble moving.

Seahawks backup quarterback Drew Lock got some reps with the first-team offense in practice Thursday and would start if Darnold can’t go. Rookie Jalen Milroe is the third-string quarterback and would back up Lock in that scenario.

Darnold, who completed 67.7 percent of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, led the Seahawks to a 14-3 record.

A year ago, he led the Vikings to an identical 14-3 record, throwing for 4,319 yards with 35 TDs and 12 INTs. But he flamed out in the Vikings’ one-and-done 27-9 playoff loss to the Rams, against whom he completed 25-of-40 passes with one touchdown and one interception while getting sacked nine times.

The Vikings, believing in first-round draft pick J.J. McCarthy, opted not to retain Darnold and missed the playoffs this year.

Darnold, of course, is hoping to shed the injury issue, play and atone for last season’s playoff meltdown with a win over the 49ers.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-iuo65w0x6-1768518078439.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1768500100&w=1200,N,,2026-01-16 12:03:47.246106

San Francisco 49ers star tight end George Kittle suffered a season-ending Achilles tear during 49ers’ playoff victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. He would be missing the rest of the postseason and probably some part of his 2026 campaign. It typically takes nine to twelve months for an Achilles tendon tear to repair. Just days before Kittle’s injury, a conspiracy NFL injury theory was doing cyberspace rounds. It states that the emissions of low-frequency electromagnetic fields from a substation near 49ers’ facility, has been degrading collagen, weakening tendons and causing soft tissue damage.

Achilles/patellar and hamstring/calf tears and high-ankle ligament injuries

According to a researcher Peter Cowan, a board-certified quantum biology practitioner and wellness entrepreneur, “The San Francisco 49ers are statistically the most injured team in the NFL over the past decade. Since they’ve moved to Levi’s Stadium in 2014, there have been seven to eight full Achilles/patellar ruptures, 40+ major hamstring/calf tears, and high-ankle syndesmosis [ligament] injuries every year.”

49ers players are reportedly aware of the EM fields

Cowan further re-shared Chat Sports host Chase Senior’s report on X that in early 2025, a retired 49ers guard Jon Feliciano said, “Players have joked around about there being an electrical substation right next to the practice field and how that has led to the Niners’ injury problems.” Senior further said that there have been a lot of studies how cell phones, blue tooth, wireless earbuds, etc emit a lot of EMF [electromotive force] and that it can be harmful to people.

EM field levels in the practice premises

The researcher visited the practice fields with a gauss meter [a device that measures the strength and direction of a magnetic field]. Typical background exposure is 0.5 to 3 mG. At the far edge of the practice field, the level was +8.5 mG and inside the facilities [weight room, film room, recovery areas], the level was 10 to 25 mG.

Effects of chronic ELF exposure

Degrading the collagen integrity in the players’ tendons, ligaments, and muscle-tendon junctions. The damage is subtle until a routine cut or block ends in catastrophic rupture. “The injury pattern matches the biological fingerprint of prolonged ELF [extremely low frequency] exposure documented in peer-reviewed research,” Cowan said in an X post which has generated nearabout 22 million views.

Such has been an occurrence often during Shanahan’s tenure in San Francisco.

This season alone, the 49ers lost defensive end Nick Bosa, linebacker Fred Warner and tight end George Kittle to season-ending injuries. Kittle tore his Achilles in this past Sunday’s NFC Wild Card Round win over the Philadelphia Eagles. The week prior, a theory was born.

The 49ers’ practice facility, which is next door to Levi’s Stadium, also neighbors an electrical substation. Peter Cowan, a self-proclaimed scientist, posted on X that, in his belief, the electrical substation was the reason for San Francisco’s injury outbreaks over the years.

“Chronic ELF exposure is degrading the collagen integrity in the players tendons, ligaments, and muscle-tendon junctions,” Cowan wrote as part of a thread. “The damage is subtle, until a routine cut or block ends in catastrophic rupture. The injury pattern matches the biological fingerprint of prolonged ELF exposure documented in peer-reviewed research.”

While there is no established evidence to support Cowan’s theory, per a recent report from Front Office Sports, the theory has caught on with agents around the league. The Washington Post spoke with about two dozen NFL agents. Several said that players had real concerns about it, and a couple “speculated the popularity of the theory could affect the 49ers’ ability to attract or retain free agents this offseason.”

NFL agents address 49ers injury conspiracy

“There is something there,” one agent told the Post. “Always wondered why my guys would take longer to heal [in San Francisco]. Then read this and makes sense.”

Other agents were skeptical it could impact San Francisco’s ability to do business this offseason. Trey Robinson of the AthElite agency said he conducted his own research.

“I’m not a scientist,” Robinson said. “But if there’s a way to eliminate something being an issue, we’ll take whatever steps we can to address our clients’ concerns.”

What is an undeniable fact is that the 49ers have been snakebitten by injuries. Despite that, San Francisco is one win away from the NFC Championship Game.

When Restrepo looked back at his rookie season, he said it was a learning experience.
After being inactive the first 10 weeks of the 2025 season while on the team's practice squad, Restrepo ended up playing in two games during the season.
""Work, work and more work,"" he said.
Restrepo said he got faster working with the team's strength and conditioning staff during the course of the year.","NASHVILLE – Xavier Restrepo had a legendary career at the University of Miami, where he finished as the school's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns.

It earned him All-American honors, along with plenty of other accolades.

The success didn't result in Restrepo being picked in the NFL Draft, however, and when he joined the Titans as an undrafted free agent last offseason, he had to wait a long time just to get on the field, after initially being cut.

When Restrepo looked back at his rookie season, he said it was a learning experience.

""It was very humbling,"" he said. ""But I think I learned so much through it, as far as being a pro each and every day, growing in my faith, and being ready when your time is called. And, for the most part, I think every time I stepped in the game, I was productive. I feel I took advantage of my opportunities, and that is what the NFL is about.""

But things weren't easy for Restrepo as he worked to get on the field.

And the experience has inspired him to work even harder moving forward following a season when he did plenty of soul searching, and praying.

""My faith is the only thing that kept me going,"" Restrepo said. ""My whole life story, I have always been an underdog. But it's different when you're at your dream, and your dream is so close, yet so far away. And the only thing you can rely on is your faith. Through so many prayers, and even doubt, I talked to my Lord and Savior and let Him know I was struggling with doubt and worry and this business, it's a Not For Long business. And I asked Him to give me confidence, and give me the joy of the game back, because I was losing it. I'll be honest: I was losing it.

""But me playing football again, God answered my prayers, and I am just super thankful.""

After being inactive the first 10 weeks of the 2025 season while on the team's practice squad, Restrepo ended up playing in two games during the season. Restrepo caught two passes for 26 yards in his NFL debut against the Seahawks on November 23, but the following week against the Jaguars he was carted off with an ankle injury after making one catch for 15 yards.

The lack of playing time, and final stats – three catches for 41 yards – wasn't exactly what Restrepo envisioned when he joined Tennessee, where he was initially cut out of training camp, and signed to the team's practice squad. Restrepo ended up spending the entire year on the practice squad, as he was a gameday elevation for the two games.

Earlier this month the team retained Restrepo's rights by signing him to a futures contract.

Restrepo made it clear the doubt he experienced as a rookie had nothing to do with his ability, but more with whether he'd get a chance.

As he heads into the offseason, his plan to get better – and make more a bigger impact moving forward – is hard, but simple.

""Work, work and more work,"" he said.

Restrepo said he got faster working with the team's strength and conditioning staff during the course of the year.

Restrepo was clocked at 20.1 miles per hour prior to arriving in Tennessee, but he said he ran a 21.51 after working with Zac Woodfin, director of sports performance, and John Shaw, assistant sports performance – speed training.

Restrepo, who recorded 200 receptions, 2,844 receiving yards and 21 touchdowns at Miami, said he felt like he got better as a player as well.

But there's more work that needs to be done, and Restrepo knows it.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/titans/seremrxaezic2v8chywy,N,,2026-01-15 23:58:44.968068

Mahomes said he hopes to be able to do ""some stuff"" in OTAs and ""a lot"" come training camp. The star quarterback suffered the ACL late in an eventual loss to the Los Angeles Chargers the same day the Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention and Green Bay Packers star Micah Parsons also tore his ACL. Speaking to the media Monday, Parsons also said he hoped to be back by Week 1 but ""realistically, probably like Week 3, Week 4.""

Mahomes said after suffering the injury he initially asked the Chiefs' medical staff if he could put a brace on the knee and finish the game, a request the staff denied.

Mahomes also looked back on the season as a whole as Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014 (Mahomes was a freshman at Texas Tech that year) and finished the season with a 6-11 record.

""I think just compounding mistakes,"" Mahomes said. ""You make mistakes throughout a game. For myself, I look at some of the red-zone interceptions I threw in kinda bigger moments in the third and fourth quarter of games. That's stuff that I hadn't done in the past. Speaking for myself, just trying to be better in those moments. I think offensively, we weren't consistent enough throughout games. We had stretches in games we played good, we had stretches in the season we played really good, but we gotta be better, and that starts with me and it has to feed throughout the entire offense.""

The Pro Bowl quarterback is suddenly questionable to play Saturday in Seattle’s NFC divisional playoff game against San Francisco at Lumen Field. The team listed him following practice Thursday on its official injury report for the game as having a new, oblique injury.

Darnold said he felt a pulling-like discomfort on his left, non-throwing side Thursday while throwing a pass during a no-pads practice outside. He, the team’s coaches and training personnel decided at that moment to shut him down for the rest of the practice, a move Darnold characterized as precautionary.

“Just in routes on air just kind of felt a little something in my oblique,” Darnold said following a practice he didn’t finish.

Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said veteran backup Drew Lock finished the practice with the starting offense Thursday, two days before top-seeded Seattle (14-3) hosts its rival San Francisco 49ers (13-5) in the Seahawks’ playoff opener at Lumen Field coming off a postseason bye.

“Just didn’t want to push it, wasn’t the day to push it. That was it,” Darnold said.

“So just came inside, got some rehab — and feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

This is the first time Darnold has had any issue to an oblique muscle in his side.

“It’s fun,” he said with a smile. “It’s fun. We’ll attack it in the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.”

The News Tribune asked Darnold what percentage of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers with the Seahawks two home wins from the Super Bowl.

“Very low percentage,” he said. “Probably closer to zero.”

He smiled.

Asked if he was going to be getting “around-the-clock” treatment between now and game time, Darnold said: “Yeah, we’ll be getting some treatment.

“But like I said, I feel really confident about going on Saturday.”

Kubiak, Darnold’s play caller, is keenly interested in his quarterback’s next 48 hours until kickoff against San Francisco. The team will test Darnold’s oblique with his throwing motion in pregame Saturday. The day before games are typically nothing but a walk-through of the game plan in T-shirts and ball caps. He doesn’t have to throw in that to prepare like his teammates on Friday.

“Obviously with any injury, you just want to know what the significance is,” Kubiak said.

The offensive coordinator referred all other questions and comments about Darnold’s injury to his boss, head coach Mike Macdonald. He is scheduled to next talk to the media Friday following the walk-through.

Darnold jogged from the team facility onto the practice field using a Theragun-type device on his throwing side, opposite where the oblique injury occurred early in the practice.

“Nothing to see here,” Darnold said to reporters, cheerfully.

NFL injury reports, explained

In 2016 the NFL did away with “probable” as one of the official designations on injury reports for games, which the league requires teams to submit to NFL headquarters two days before games. Since that change, any player who less than a virtual certainty to play gets listed as “questionable.” That is now the lowest designation before full go to play and a player not being on the injury report at all.

The designations for NFL injury reports are out, doubtful (75% chance he won’t play) and questionable (officially a 50% chance he won’t play). If a previously injured player is not on the injury report for a game, he’s playing.

That’s the case with Seahawks starting left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant. They’ve each missed the last three and two games, respectively, to end the regular season. But they are not on the injury report for the game Saturday. So Cross and Bryant are returning to play.

Same with linebacker Ernest Jones and cornerback Riq Woolen. Jones missed practice Tuesday and was limited Wednesday because of an unspecified illness. He was in the training room lifting weights with a mask on when practice was beginning Thursday. Yet Jones is not on the injury report, so he’s playing as usual Saturday.

Woolen was limited in practices Tuesday and Wednesday because of his own oblique issue. But Woolen is not on the injury report. He’s also full go to play.

Rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo was a full participant in practices this week coming off injured reserve. But the team added him to the game injury report later Thursday. He is out for Saturday. So is Chazz Surratt. The special-teams mainstay and former 49er is not coming off injured reserve, either. At least not yet.

Sam Darnold appeared on the Seahawks' injury report Thursday as a limited participant due to an oblique injury. This was unexpected; Darnold was off the report on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The team listed him as questionable to play in Saturday's divisional playoff game against NFC West foe San Francisco.

He later confirmed that he would indeed be suiting up against the 49ers.

""Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said today. ""Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Thursday was the final practice for the Seahawks due to the short week. They'll be at home for Saturday's game against the visiting No. 6 seed 49ers.

Seattle took care of business on the road against San Francisco the last time these two teams faced off. The Seahawks' defense held the 49ers' offense in check for a 13-3 win in Week 18.

Darnold was a steady 20 for 26 passing for 198 yards in that one. He fumbled once but it did not end in a turnover for the Seahawks.

This is the fourth time Darnold is playing his former team, but the first time in the postseason. Darnold spent the 2023 season with the 49ers on their way to an NFC title before signing with Minnesota in 2024. The Vikings and 49ers faced off in Week 2 of the 2024 season with Darnold and Minnesota earning a 23-17 win.

Saturday marks Darnold's first playoff game since the Vikings' 27-9 loss in the wild-card round of the 2024 playoffs. He struggled in that game and completed 25 of 40 passes for 245 yards, one touchdown, one interception and a fumble lost.

The Rams defense sacked him nine times in that game. He and the Seahawks will be hoping for a better result this time in the postseason.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/15/USAT/88204033007-usatsi-27893639.jpg?crop=4417,2486,x0,y225&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 20:00:19.403606

(AP) — Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold injured his left oblique during Thursday’s practice and was listed as questionable for Saturday’s NFC divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers, but he said he’s confident he’ll play.

Darnold said he felt something in his oblique while throwing passes to receivers with no defenders.

“Didn’t want to push it,” Darnold said. “Wasn’t the day to push it. That was it. Just came inside, got some rehab. Feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

The eighth-year quarterback said this is the first time he has dealt with an oblique issue and that he’ll be getting treatment leading up to the game. When asked about his chances of sitting out, Darnold said, “Very low percentage. Probably closer to zero.”

Darnold passed for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in his first season with the Seahawks, earning his second straight Pro Bowl selection. He led Seattle to a 14-3 record and the NFC’s top seed.

Backup Drew Lock has appeared in five games this season and attempted just three passes. Lock started five games for the New York Giants in 2024 and has 28 career NFL starts, completing 59.6% of passes with 34 touchdowns and 28 interceptions.

“Drew’s been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,” offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said. “A lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.”

Nonetheless, the Seahawks hope Lock’s services won’t be needed.

The doctor said that I could be, but I can’t predict what’s going to happen throughout the process,” Mahomes said.
Since then, he has primarily done his rehab in Kansas City under the supervision of Chiefs assistant athletic trainer Julie Frymyer, who helped Mahomes work through previous knee and ankle ailments.
Mahomes said he’s been following a rehab script set by Dr. Dan Cooper, the Dallas Cowboys team physician who performed his surgery.
Even after suffering his knee injury in December, Mahomes said he tried to talk his way back into his team’s 16-13 home loss to the Chargers.","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes says he’s targeting a Week 1 return after a knee injury ended his 2025 season.

Mahomes, speaking to reporters for the first time since he tore his ACL and LCL in a game against the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14, said Thursday that his rehab from surgery had been “going great so far.

“Obviously, I think long term, I want to be ready for Week 1. The doctor said that I could be, but I can’t predict what’s going to happen throughout the process,” Mahomes said. “But that’s my goal. And so I’ll try to prepare myself to be ready to play in that Week 1 and have no restrictions.”

Mahomes underwent surgery to repair his knee on Dec. 15. Since then, he has primarily done his rehab in Kansas City under the supervision of Chiefs assistant athletic trainer Julie Frymyer, who helped Mahomes work through previous knee and ankle ailments.

So far, Mahomes acknowledges that not every day has felt amazing. Some days, he wakes up determined to go all out during his workout. Other days, he’s just trying to get through.

On each of those days, he says, he’s been reliant on Frymyer.

“Julie has been crushing it, pushing me. And the doctor gives you goals to get to, and I just try to maximize those,” Mahomes said. “They hold me back because I always want to go a little bit further.”

Chiefs head athletic trainer Rick Burkholder said last month that a ballpark timeline for Mahomes to return was nine months.

Mahomes said he’s been following a rehab script set by Dr. Dan Cooper, the Dallas Cowboys team physician who performed his surgery. The goal is to return as quickly as possible without jeopardizing Mahomes’ long-term health.

“That’s why they give me limits to where I can push it,” Mahomes said. “Dr. Cooper, he described that to me. He said, ‘I’ll give you the limits of where you can push it to, and then it’s up to you how far you want to push it to that limit.’ And knowing me, I’m gonna push it to the exact limit every single day.”

Mahomes’ personal ambition is to do “some stuff” during May and June’s organized team activities, then “hopefully be able to do a lot” during training camp in July and August.

The next few months, meanwhile, will be different from past seasons. Mahomes typically hosts a passing camp for teammates in Texas during the NFL’s first phase of the offseason in April; because he’ll still be injured then, that voluntary program is now set to take place at the team’s facility in K.C.

Mahomes still hopes to build camaraderie with teammates during that time, whether that means being with them in the facility or going across the parking lot to attend Kansas City Royals games.

Even after suffering his knee injury in December, Mahomes said he tried to talk his way back into his team’s 16-13 home loss to the Chargers.

“When I was able to move, I asked one of the doctors if I could get a brace and just finish the game, but they wouldn’t let me,” Mahomes said. “Obviously, it kind of sunk in once the game ended, and then I was able to get the results from the MRI and stuff like that. It’s hard, but at the same time, you’ve got to flip the script fast, knowing that it’s gonna be a quick turnaround to get to the season.”

Mahomes completed 63 percent of his passes in 14 games in 2025, throwing for 3,587 yards with 22 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

He said the vision of being out there with his teammates in Game 1 next season keeps him motivated during a strenuous rehab process.

“There’s places you can’t go yet — which I want to, but I can’t go yet,” Mahomes said. “But at the same time, we’re doing it for a reason.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/15150100/GettyImages-2253282510-scaled-e1768507318677.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-15 23:00:23.027717

The injury occurred Thursday. Darnold said he ""felt a little something"" in the oblique on his left side while throwing during a routes-on-air period, and that he left practice as a precautionary measure.

""Just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said. ""Wasn't the day to push it. So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

The Seahawks listed Darnold as a limited participant.

The only other Seattle players with game designations are tight end Elijah Arroyo, linebacker Chazz Surratt and tackle Josh Jones, all backups who have been ruled out. Left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant will return after missing three and two games, respectively.

Darnold was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play Saturday.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Veteran Drew Lock is Darnold's backup. Jalen Milroe, a rookie third-round pick, is Seattle's QB3.

Darnold said he has never dealt with an oblique injury and that he'll get treatment between now and game time, adding: ""We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold, signed by the Seahawks in March after they traded Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders, is set to make the second playoff start of his eight-year NFL career. He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by coach Mike Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.

""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said. ""... We've got such great guys in that locker room, mature leaders at every position group. So everyone's just ready to go, attacking the week, per usual, and getting ready to go up against a really good 49ers team that's been rolling, and we're excited to go up against them.""

Darnold and the Seahawks beat the 49ers in Week 18 at Levi's Stadium to win the NFC West and secure the conference's top seed. With that win, Seattle finished the regular season 14-3, the same record Darnold posted last year with the Minnesota Vikings on his way to his first career Pro Bowl selection.

Darnold made the Pro Bowl again this year, completing 67.7% of his attempts for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdown passes while also leading all NFL players with 20 turnovers.

Darnold lost his playoff debut last January when he was sacked nine times in a wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He said the Week 18 win over the 49ers felt like a playoff game because of everything that was at stake and how loud the crowd was at Levi's Stadium.

The Seahawks will have home-field advantage in the rematch.

""Being able to use cadence is going to be huge, and then having our 12s there making noise when they're on offense is crucial,"" Darnold said. ""So, it's going to be an awesome atmosphere and something we're all looking forward to.""

This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017. The Seahawks' only other home playoff game since then was at the end of the 2020 COVID-19 season, when they lost in the wild-card round to the Rams in an empty stadium.

""We know Lumen's going to be rocking,"" Darnold said. ""It's an important game. We don't get it twisted at all. We understand the implications of the game. The playoffs, it's awesome to be playing in games like this, especially in January. But yeah, we're treating this week as another week and we're excited about it.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1228%2Fr1594429_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 20:00:27.982189

Collins suffered the concussion in Monday’s wild-card 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards in the game before going down.

If Collins cannot go, expect Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins, and Dalton Schultz to see an increase in targets. Jaylin Noel, Xavier Hutchinson and Cade Stover could also see an increased role.

Seattle Seahawks tackle Charles Cross was downgraded to a limited participant in practice on Wednesday with a knee injury added to his previous hamstring injury. Tackle Josh Jones did not participate in practice with a knee injury. Linebacker Tryice Knight was also DNP on Wednesday.

Shavers was injured during Sunday's wild-card round win over the Jaguars during a punt return. After being listed as questionable to return, he re-entered the game later on.

The 26-year-old out of San Diego State played all 17 regular-season games for the Bills, catching 15 passes on 23 targets for 245 yards and one touchdown. He recorded one catch for 14 yards prior to exiting the Jaguars game.

When a follow-up question asked Darnold the likelihood that he would not play, he said, ""It's a very low percentage, probably closer to zero.""

Later in the press conference, when he received yet another question about the injury and what will need to happen between now and Saturday, Darnold said, ""We'll be getting some treatment, but I feel really confident about going on Saturday… I just felt a little something and didn't want to make it worse.

The Houston Texans on the other hand, could be without Nico Collins for Sunday’s AFC Divisional Round matchup, as the Pro Bowl wide receiver missed his second straight practice due to a concussion.

Collins isn’t the only member of the Texans offense that is in danger of missing the playoff battle, as starting offensive tackle Trent Brown sat out his second consecutive session with an ankle injury.

“Houston #Texans Thursday Injury Report for the Divisional Round at the New England Patriots,” the Texans official account posted on X.

Brown had two stints with the Patriots earlier in his career, sandwiching a 2019 Pro Bowl campaign with the then-Oakland Raiders with both runs in New England.

The 32-year-old was part of the Patriots’ Super Bowl LIII-champion team before his two seasons with the Raiders.

Brown was reacquired by New England in a trade in March 2021, played three more years with the organization and signed with the Cincinnati Bengals in March 2024.

He played just three games with Cincinnati before suffering a season-ending torn patellar tendon.

Brown signed a one-year, $3 million deal with Houston last March and spent the summer on the Texans’ active/PUP list while rehabbing from his injury.

He was cut by Houston in late August but re-signed with the club’s practice squad the next day.

""Just didn't want to push it. It wasn't the day to push it,"" Darnold said, per Gregg Bell of The Tacoma News Tribune. ""So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab. I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold said he never had oblique issues before. He put a positive spin on the midweek hurdle that he's eager to clear ahead of the biggest game of his career.

""It's fun. We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday,"" Darnold said.

Darnold, a righty, explained he experienced the discomfort on his left side on a throw.

He was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers this weekend at Seattle's Lumen Field.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Darnold played all 17 games in the regular season, his first with the Seahawks after signing a three-year deal reportedly worth $100.5 million.

He picked up where he left off in Minnesota last season when he led the Vikings to a 14-3 record as a replacement for the injured J.J. McCarthy.

This time around, he became the fourth quarterback in NFL history to guide two different teams to 14-win seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Jared Goff.

Despite a league-high 20 turnovers, Darnold made the Pro Bowl. With a win over San Francisco in the regular-season finale, Seattle earned the division title and the NFC's No. 1 seed, which came with a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.

Darnold is now slated to face the resilient 49ers again. He's hoping for playoff redemption after throwing a pick, losing a fumble and being sacked nine times during the Vikings' 27-9 wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams last season.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/beCv9xn2YO20orJLfepxYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f83c21d0-e5bf-11f0-b2bf-afb15505eb98,N,,2026-01-15 20:01:11.925508

Offensive tackles Morgan Moses and Thayer Munford Jr. returned for Thursday’s practice after knee ailments kept both sidelined to begin the week.

Elsewhere in Foxborough, running back Terrell Jennings and cornerback Christian Gonzalez shed red non-contact jerseys while phasing through the NFL’s concussion protocol. Both joined a growing list of full participants that also included defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga on the heels of missing three games due to a foot issue.

Here’s the second injury report ahead of Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET divisional round at Gillette Stadium.

While head coach Mike Vrabel and the AFC East champions had a full house, the same four remained absent for the Texans. Count Collins among them. The perennial 1,000-yard receiver was carted to the locker room during Monday night’s wild card at Acrisure Stadium due to a concussion. With back-to-back missed practices logged since then, he is doubtful to be cleared in time for the No. 5 seed to visit the No. 2 seed.

As offensive bookends returned from knee injuries, a total of four Patriots went in a limited capacity on Thursday. At right tackle, Moses started and stayed in for all 64 snaps last weekend. And as an extension of the line, Munford reported as an eligible tight end on four occasions after carrying a questionable game designation.

The Patriots opened a 21-day window to return from injured reserve as Texans prep began. And Gonzalez, who was ruled out in the closing minutes of the wild card, has also graduated to full participation. The Pro Bowl corner was among a handful in all to go without restrictions on Thursday. And so was Tonga. The all-purpose nose tackle has not played a down since Week 16 and hadn’t returned to practice until sights set on the divisional round.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2254079684.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C6.4211265613046%2C100%2C78.545990303732&w=1200,N,,2026-01-15 19:01:34.449431

Darnold confirmed that the injury occurred during the routes on air portion of Thursday's practice.
""Drew's been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,"" Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said following Thursday's practice.
""Started a lot of football games, 28 games in the league.
While Lock will have to be ready, Darnold has made it clear that he fully expects to be on the field while making his second career postseason start.","Sam Darnold has been labeled as questionable for Saturday's divisional round playoff matchup with the San Francisco 49ers. The Seattle Seahawks' starting quarterback was added to Thursday's injury report with an oblique injury.

Darnold confirmed that the injury occurred during the routes on air portion of Thursday's practice. He said he felt some discomfort on his oblique on the left side and decided not to take any risks regarding practice.

""Didn't wanna push it,"" he said after practice. ""Wasn't the day to push it. That was it. Came inside, got some rehab, and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold said that there is a ""very low percentage"" that he isn't on the field for Seattle's first playoff game.

""Probably closer to zero,"" he said with a slight smile.

Darnold, 28, has been a big key to Seattle's success this season under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Following a Pro Bowl season with the Vikings last year, Darnold was named to his second straight Pro Bowl this season after throwing for over 4,000 yards and 25 touchdowns in helping lead the 14-3 Seahawks to the NFC's No. 1 seed for the postseason.

Darnold split his two starts this season against the 49ers, throwing for less than 200 yards in both games and not throwing a touchdown pass. He didn't throw any interceptions in those games either while completing 73.5% of his passes.

If Darnold isn't able to play, the Seahawks would turn the keys of the offense over to Drew Lock, who during Thursday's practice received reps with Seattle's first-team offense. Lock, 29, is a former second-round pick who attempted just three passes during the regular season. He does have 28 career regular season starts under his belt that includes 13 starts in 2020, his second season with the Broncos.

""Drew's been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,"" Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said following Thursday's practice. ""Started a lot of football games, 28 games in the league. Lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.""

Robinson was the NFL's best running back this season, leading the league with 2,298 scrimmage yards. He's been such a dominant presence for the Falcons backfield in his three years with the club. His 5,648 scrimmage yards is the third-most by a player in his first three seasons in NFL history, trailing only Hall of Famers LaDainian Tomlinson (6,145) and Eric Dickerson (5,816). The All-Pro back is a huge draw for whomever is hired to be head coach.

With all of the injuries the 49ers offense suffered in 2025, McCaffrey had to be exceptional for his team to make the playoffs, let alone play for the NFC's No. 1 seed in Week 18. And boy, was he. He led the NFL with 413 scrimmage touches (44 more than any other player) and was second in scrimmage yards (2,126). It was the third time McCaffrey logged at least 2,000 scrimmage yards and 15 touchdowns in a season, tied for most in NFL history with LaDainian Tomlinson.

Taylor was exceptional in the first half of the season with five 100-yard rushing games, including a 244-yard, three-TD performance in an overtime win over Atlanta in Germany. That was one of four instances in which Taylor rushed for three scores. Unfortunately, Taylor's production trailed off after the injury to Daniel Jones . He still led the league in attempts and rush TDs but fell to third in rush yards. Taylor (2021, 2025) joined Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith (1992, 1995) as the only players in NFL history to have multiple career seasons with 1,500-plus rush yards and 18-plus rush TDs. Imagine what could've been had the injury bug not landed in Indy.

After signing an extension in the preseason, Cook showed his worth by leading the NFL in rushing yards. He was an absolute playmaker out of the backfield, so it was no surprise that Buffalo finished No. 1 in the league in rushing offense. Cook ended up with 12 games with 100-plus scrimmage yards (T-most in the NFL) and the Bills were 11-1 in those games. They were 1-4 when he had fewer than 100 yards, further proving his worth to that offense.

Gibbs wasn't quite the dynamo in the run game this year as he previously was in Ben Johnson's offense, but he still amassed 1,839 scrimmage yards. He was a real problem as a pass catcher, and it was great too see him evolve in that aspect of his game. He posted career highs in targets, receptions, receiving yards and receiving TDs. Good things happen when Gibbs gets the ball.

Other than some early-season fumbling issues, Henry had one hell of a season at 31 years old. In fact, he has now posted back-to-back campaigns with at least 1,500 yards and 15 rush touchdowns -- no other player in NFL history has even one such season at age 30 or older. The ageless wonder continued to trounce defenses and finished the season with an absolute bang, rushing for 570 yards and six touchdowns on 85 carries over the final four games. That's 6.7 per clip. Normally, the football world starts to wonder when 31-year-old running backs will consider hanging 'em up. Henry feels far from it.

There weren't a ton of positives for Miami's offense in 2025, but Achane did more than enough to catch my attention. He was great in every way for the Dolphins' rushing attack and continued to be a valuable asset in the pass game. There are likely to be a ton of changes this offseason -- beginning with a new head coach -- but Achane will be a mainstay and is a huge draw for whomever will lead that offense in 2026.

Fresh off a three-year extension, Williams rushed for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns for the third consecutive season to help the Rams feature a top-10 rushing attack for the first time since 2020. Blake Corum cut into Williams' workload (Williams had 57 fewer carries in 2025 than he had in 2024) but Williams made the most of his touches. He even logged career highs 50 targets, 36 receptions, 281 receiving yards and three receiving TDs -- illustrating his improvement in the pass game. Was he worth that new contract? You bet!

2025 stats: 16 games | 252 att | 1201 rush yds | 4.8 ypc | 11 rush TDs | 35 rec | 137 rec yds | 2 rec TDs | 2 fumbles lost

Williams made the most of his one-year deal in Dallas with his career-best campaign by far. Though the Cowboys sprinkled in Malik Davis and Jaydon Blue at times, Williams was the reason they finished in the top 10 in rushing yards for the first time since 2022, when Ezekiel and Tony Pollard led the charge. Williams has more than earned a new contract with this team this offseason.

2025 stats: 16 games | 280 att | 1140 rush yds | 4.1 ypc | 7 rush TDs | 37 rec | 273 rec yds | 2 rec TDs | 1 fumble lost

Barkley wasn't the same behind a beat up O-line in 2025. After struggling for the first three quarters of the campaign, the Eagles offense looked slightly better down the stretch due in part to Barkley averaging 20.5 carries and 100 rush yards per game in his last four regular-season contests. Every season can't be historic.

Etienne bounced back in a big way from a disappointing 2024 campaign. He led the Jags with nearly 1,400 scrimmage yards and a career-high 13 scrimmage TDs. He also led the team with six receiving touchdowns, making him the only RB in the league to pace his team in the category. The Jags would be making a mistake if they let Etienne hit free agency after what he showed he can do in Liam Coen's offense.

Jacobs dealt with ankle and knee injuries late in the season, which hampered his production down the stretch. In Weeks 1-10, Jacobs averaged 21.1 touches and 93.9 scrimmage yards per game with 11 total TDs. Those numbers fell off from Week 11 on, with Jacobs averaging 13.3 touches and 61 scrimmage yards per game with three total TDs. Despite having nearly 70 fewer carries than he did in his first season with the Packers, Jacobs still was a huge asset in the red zone, posting double-digit rush TDs for the second straight season and fourth time in his career.

Reuniting with Ben Johnson was just what Swift needed to increase his efficiency. After posting fewer than 4.0 yards per carry last season, Swift averaged 4.9 yards per attempt while splitting time with rookie Kyle Monangai . That allowed him to become the first Bears RB with at least 1,000 rush yards since David Montgomery in 2020. And here's one more bonus nugget for you: Swift is one of five backs drafted outside of Round 1 since 2000 with five-plus rush TDs in each of his first six seasons, joining Montgomery, Derrick Henry, Clinton Portis and yours truly. You love to see it.

Walker split carries with Zach Charbonnet but logged 1,000 receiving yards for the second time in his career. He's a big reason the Seahawks finished the campaign strong, as they averaged 171.3 rush yards per game in the final three weeks of the season when the division and NFC's top seed were on the line. Walker showed his worth in a contract year and should make some good money in free agency, whether from Seattle or another team.

Dowdle made the most of his opportunity with the Panthers by posting his second consecutive 1,000-yard rushing season. The highlight of his campaign came in Weeks 5-9 when he rushed for a league-high 130.4 yards per game. His production tailed off in the season's second half, when he averaged just 42.6 rush yards per game, leaving a question mark about whether the Panthers will re-sign him in the offseason. For the record, I still think they should.

Brown registered career highs in carries, rush yards, targets, receptions and TD receptions in 2025. He's a dynamic player but deserves more touches in Cincinnati's pass-heavy offense. The Bengals ranked in the bottom four of the league in carries and rushing. I would love to see them play with a little more balance and get Brown, who posted 10 games with at least 90 scrimmage yards since Week 7, more attempts.

Give Hall his flowers for logging 1,000 rush yards in that offense. The fourth-year pro was easily the biggest bright spot on the 2025 Jets and should earn a big payday this offseason. He's a top-seven back when it comes to talent. With better pieces around him, he could easily rank even higher. The Jets must re-sign him.

Skattebo made a huge impact on a young Giants offense prior to his season-ending ankle injury just eight games into his rookie campaign. He was the best running back in this year's rookie class and was on his way to becoming a top-10 player at the position prior to the injury, thanks to some noteworthy performances (SEE: three TDs vs. Philly). If he makes a full recovery and can stay healthy, Skattebo should build off his promising campaign next season under a new regime.

There wasn't much to get excited about in the Browns offense this season, as the unit ranked 31st in scoring and 30th in yards. The rookie class was a bright spot, though, and Judkins put some nice things on tape, including a 110-yard rushing outing in London.

The Commanders had four running backs with starts this season and couldn't shake the injury bug at really any position. Croskey-Merritt and Chris Rodriguez Jr. took turns starting after Austin Ekeler 's season-ending injury in Week 2. JCM had a pair of notable performances in which he rushed for more than 100 yards and had multiple rush TDs (Weeks 5 and 17). The seventh-round rookie has talent but needs to find more consistency.

Dobbins was having a great season before a Lisfanc injury landed him on IR. Despite playing in 10 games, the physical vet led the Broncos in rush yards for the season. He was a great fit in Sean Payton's offense, and even with Dobbins' injury history, I would be surprised if Denver doesn't bring him back on a team-friendly deal this offseason.

Jeanty's rookie season didn't go quite as we thought it would. The Raiders underperformed in most offensive areas, starting with the offensive line, and it led to the firing of OC Chip Kelly in late November. Jeanty did put some positives on tape and I'm not going to write off his 1,321 scrimmage yards, which broke Josh Jacobs' team record for most by a Raiders rookie, but there's a lot more to be desired with this talented young back. Hopefully, we'll see just how special he is under a new regime.

Irving struggled to stay healthy a year after his rookie breakout campaign. He scored only once on the ground in 10 games and rushed for more than 4.0 yards per tote in only two of those games. Irving still led the team in carries and rush yards, which pretty much sums up the Bucs offense in 2025. The next offensive coordinator must find ways to get this backfield going.

The Patriots don't have a top-six rushing attack without the dependable backfield duo of Henderson and veteran Rhamondre Stevenson . The rookie led the team in carries, rush yards, rush TDs and scrimmage yards (1,132), and his success was highlighted by his explosiveness. Henderson posted four rush touchdowns of 50-plus yards in 2025, tied for the most by a rookie in NFL history.

Stevenson slots in right behind his teammate. He has an equally dynamic skill set but was banged up some and had a slower start to the campaign. In his first 10 games, Stevenson averaged 32.4 rush yards per game and 3.2 yards per carry. In his final four games, the vet had 69.8 rush yards per game and 9.6 yards per carry.

After a superb 2024 campaign in which the Panthers extended Hubbard midseason, his production dropped significantly in 2025 when partnering with Rico Dowdle in the backfield. Hubbard lost the starting job midway through 2025 and finished the year with only one rush TD and without a 100-yard rushing performance (he had four such games in 2024).

In his first season as the starter, Warren posted career highs in carries, rush yards, rush TDs and receiving TDs. He mainly struggled with consistency, posting only two 100-yard rushing performances in Weeks 7 and 16. As I mentioned last month, Pittsburgh needs an improved run game in 2026, so the pressure is on Warren to become more consistent in his second year as the team's lead back.

The rookie was a consistent player for the Texans, though his 3.6 yards per carry were the second-fewest among 52 players with at least 100 carries in 2025. Marks showed a lot more in his first pro season than I saw from him at USC.

Mason was great in his first season in Minnesota and led the team in most rushing categories out of the backfield. The Vikings ranked in the bottom six in rushing attempts -- surprising considering all of the QB troubles -- and Mason's 4.8 rush yards per attempt should've swayed Kevin O'Connell to lean more heavily on the physical fourth-year back. I'm curious to see if O'Connell uses Mason more in his second season with the club.

The rookie was a perfect fit for Ben Johnson's offense and a great complement to veteran Swift. Monangai gradually worked his way onto the field, earning his first double-digit carry outing in Week 6 and finishing the campaign with two 100-yard performances. Monangai and Swift became the second pair of Bears RBs to each have 750-plus rush yards in the same season, joining Hall of Famer Walter Payton and Roland Harper in 1978. Monangai showed a lot of promise in Year 1, a great foundation of what's to come in this offense.

The Chiefs didn't have much of a run game in 2025 as the team shuffled through backs frequently. An injury to Isiah Pacheco led to Hunt gaining a bigger role, and he ended up leading the team in carries, rush yards and rush TDs. Hunt is a free agent and so is Pacheco. This backfield needs a reset.

After jumping on the scene as a rookie, Tracy's production dipped in Year 2. He began the season as the starter but quickly lost that job to rookie Cam Skattebo , only to reclaim it when Skattebo was lost for the season in late October. Tracy had one 100-yard rushing performance (Week 18) and didn't elevate the struggling offense enough when he was on the field.

The 31-year-old struggled to stay healthy and eventually took a backseat to Jordan Mason , who logged more carries, rush yards and rush TDs than Jones. The nine-year vet was still efficient when available and looked explosive at times, but you have to wonder what his role will look like in Kevin O'Connell's offense in 2026.

Gainwell played a huge role in the Steelers' dink-and-dunk pass offense. The fifth-year pro led the team in receptions after logging five-plus catches in six of his last eight regular-season contests. Pittsburgh's 25th-ranked overall offense would have been far worse without Gainwell in the backfield.

The rookie took on the role of featured back after J.K. Dobbins went down with an injury in Week 10, averaging 16.9 touches per game from that point through the end of the regular season. He's gotten good volume but his efficiency in the run game hasn't been all that great (3.7 yards per carry). I will say that he's been a great asset in the pass game and a beast near the goal line. He led all Broncos and rookies with 12 scrimmage touchdowns in 2025.

Allgeier didn't get much shine with Bijan heavily featured in the Falcons attack, but he served as a great change-of-pace back and made his money in the red zone with a team-high eight rush touchdowns. If Atlanta lets Allgeier hit free agency, he'll likely earn an upgraded role on another team.

I'm still surprised how little Kellen Moore used a healthy Kamara early in the season. The five-time Pro Bowler averaged his lowest attempts per game (11.9) since his rookie season (7.5), when he backed up Mark Ingram. But now that the quarterback position seems a little more settled, maybe Moore will look to get Kamara more involved.

Hampton's talent is undeniable but the injuries limited him too often in 2025. He was efficient when he was available, averaging 60.6 rush yards per game, the most by a Chargers rookie since LaDainian Tomlinson. But with all the O-line injuries his team endured this season, Los Angeles needed him on the field.

White's production has decreased in each of the last three seasons. It's telling that, in the games White started when RB1 Bucky Irving was sidelined, Sean Tucker got a lot of carries. In fact, Tucker was the only Bucs running back to rush for 100 yards in a game in 2025. White is a free agent this offseason and will likely get a fresh start elsewhere.

Chubb began the season as Houston's starter but was passed up by rookie Woody Marks midway through the season. He was banged up some and never had more than 10 carries in a game after Week 9. What should be a concern for Houston is that Chubb's three rush TDs led the team.

The sixth-round rookie had at least one carry in all but one game and flashed at times. The big-bodied back was a key contributor near the goal line and in short-yardage situations. Jaylen Wright was a more efficient runner but only played in 10 games, which is why I ranked the dependable and available Gordon higher in this list.

Wilson has carved out a nice role in Matt LaFleur's offense, as he's gotten more touches in each of his three seasons in Green Bay. He played 31 percent of the team's offensive snaps and even returned kickoffs late in the year.

A knee injury sidelined Pacheco in late October and he never was able to really get going when he returned nearly a month later. It was a forgettable season for the fourth-year pro, who failed to rush for more than 60 yards in any game. The soon-to-be free agent could be headed elsewhere.

The Cardinals went through a laundry list of starters at the running back position because no one could stay healthy.

Yes, the Green Bay Packers were hit with some difficult injuries in 2025.

Guess what?

Their injury situation was no better or worse than most, and it placed them in the middle of the NFL in two key categories.

According to Sports Info Solutions, Green Bay finished 13th in the NFL in most games missed to injury.

The website also measures “Total Points Missed” due to injury. To determine this statistic, the website measures how valuable each player was to his team’s ability to score or prevent points, using Expected Points Added as the currency. That figure is then multiplied by the number of games missed due to injury.

Green Bay finished 14th in Total Points Missed.

The Packers finished the year with 15 players on the injured reserve list. Alphabetically, that list included safety Zayne Anderson, tight end John FitzPatrick, offensive tackle Travis Glover, cornerback Kamal Hadden, cornerback Nate Hobbs, center Elgton Jenkins, offensive guard/tackle Donovan Jennings, tight end Tucker Kraft, running back MarShawn Lloyd, wide receiver/cornerback Bo Melton, defensive end Micah Parsons, defensive tackle Jordan Riley, linebacker Kristian Welch, wide receiver Savion Williams and defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt.

Parsons was without question Green Bay’s best player and losing him was undoubtedly an enormous blow to the defense. In fact, Green Bay went 0-5 after Parsons was lost to a torn ACL midway through the Packers’ Week 15 loss to Denver.

Kraft was arguably the Packers’ second-most important player on offense after quarterback Jordan Love. And Wyatt was arguably Green Bay’s third most important defensive player after Parsons and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper.

Jenkins was a starter at center, but the Packers’ offensive line play actually improved when Sean Rhyan took over at that spot. The rest of that the Packers’ I.R. list consisted of backups and special teams players.

Still, that didn’t stop Green Bay from playing the injury card whenever possible.

“To be at your best, you need everybody available,” Green Bay head coach Matt LaFleur said. “And we always talk about your best ability is your availability and it's tough when you lose some guys.”

Chicago missed the most games due to injury with 336. Detroit was second at 326, while Buffalo (297), Arizona (296) and Pittsburgh (279) rounded out the top five.

Green Bay was 13th with 237 games missed due to injury.

In the “Total Points Missed” category, Arizona was first with 266, followed by Washington (230), San Francisco (200), Buffalo (190) and Miami (182).

Green Bay was 14th with 136.

Perception is reality, though, which is why the Packers tried selling the notion that injuries ruined their season. Instead, the reality was their injury situation placed them in the middle of the pack.

“I don’t think it made it easier,” LaFleur said of the injuries. “But we’re not going to live in that world because all they are is excuses. We’re going to take the guys that we have, we’re going to put them in the best position possible and, unfortunately, we didn’t do a good enough job of that.”

The Buffalo Bills’ hopes of making it to their first Super Bowl since the 1993 season have been dinged and dented as they get set to play the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round.

Even as banged up as he is, the ball has been in Allen’s hands to make magic on the field. He did that against the Jacksonville Jaguars as he scored three times, including a passing touchdown to Dalton Kincaid with 8:56 left in the game and a rushing score to put Buffalo ahead with about 1:04 left.

The Broncos, who have one of the best defenses in the NFL, are highly aware of what Allen can bring to the table. He had 272 passing yards and two touchdowns in their matchup last year.

""One thing we need to eliminate is his second-chance opportunities,"" Broncos cornerback Patrick Surtain II said of Allen. ""He thrives off that and finding opportunities even if the play is not there. He is a great player, so we have to game plan and eliminate the explosives.""

Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph gets the privilege of scheming up a defensive plan to stop the Bills.

""His legs are special, he's got that size, he can make every single throw. That's not different for us, but you can't simulate it, obviously. If you could, you would. But you can't,"" Joseph said. ""There’s one Josh Allen, and he lives in Buffalo.""

For all of Allen’s greatness, the injury report is extensive and he lost another weapon.

Bills wide receiver Tyrell Shavers will miss the rest of the playoffs after he suffered a torn knee ligament, head coach Sean McDermott said on Tuesday. The news came a day after McDermott said Gabe Davis had suffered a similar injury.

Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman and Brandin Cooks represent the healthy receivers on the team’s official depth chart. Mecole Hardman and Stephen Gosnell are candidates to be promoted to the active roster. The team also added Kristian Wilkerson to the practice squad.

Kincaid (knee/calf), Ty Johnson (ankle) and Curtis Samuel (elbow) are the other injured offensive players on the roster. Samuel is on the reserve/injured list.

Terrel Bernard (calf), A.J. Epenesa (neck), Maxwell Hairston (ankle), Damar Hamlin (pectoral), Matt Milano (ankle), Ed Oliver (bicep), Jordan Poyer (hamstring), Greg Rousseau (back), Shaq Thompson (neck) and Matt Prater (right quad/right calf) are also listed on the report.

""What we need to focus on is what's in front of us … and that's handling the things that we can handle and control,"" McDermott said, via the team’s website. ""It's next man up. That's pretty stone cold what it is and what has to happen here for us.""

That’s where our focus lies today. We are going to examine how miserable things really are for the 18 non-playoff teams. To do so, we have a subjective, non-scientific formula that measures two factors: how the 2025 season went and the overall future outlook of the situation. With that, we have our Misery Index, a more nuanced way to gauge the situation of a franchise than simply looking at the standings. The factors considered when assigning the grade for future outlook were potential new voices/subtractions in the front office and coaching staff, cap space to work with this offseason and draft picks available in 2026 and 2027.

Note: The higher the number, the more positive it is for the team. The ranking is based on the sum of both numbers.

2025 season: 6/10

Future outlook: 9/10

The Dan Campbell era has set a new standard for Lions fans, and missing the playoffs is not acceptable. Considering the Lions went from 15-2 in 2024 to out of the postseason in 2025, this season was a disappointment. However, the Lions posted a winning record of 9-8 and were the only top-10 team in the league in point differential to miss the playoffs — all after losing both coordinators. They didn’t meet their new standard, but it’s far from panic time. All of the core pieces are under contract, and while you’d love more draft capital, they do have their first- and second-round picks. The most important thing will be getting the offensive coordinator hire right.

17. Baltimore Ravens

2025 season: 5/10

Future outlook: 8/10

The injuries, especially to Lamar Jackson, helped sink the 2025 season, but the Ravens didn’t feel like a team with much potential — even if Tyler Loop had made that field goal and they had snuck into the playoffs. Obviously, the head coaching hire will contribute strongly to how the future outlook is viewed, and the same can be said for every team with an opening. But the Ravens have an elite quarterback in his prime and some competent pieces in place on both sides of the ball. That’s pressure on the next coach to produce instant results.

16. Kansas City Chiefs

2025 season: 4/10

Future outlook: 8/10

You can’t really fall below an 8 on the overall outlook if you have prime Patrick Mahomes on your roster, but the timing of his injury is concerning. It’s also concerning that Mahomes played almost the entire season and it still wasn’t good enough to get the Chiefs in the playoffs (yes, Kansas City was still alive in the game in which Mahomes got hurt, but the playoffs had already become a long shot). There are a lot of question marks on offense this offseason, from Mahomes’ health to Travis Kelce’s future to how reliable Rashee Rice can be, both from an on-field perspective and with the off-field concerns. Andy Reid is one of the greatest coaches of his generation and now the longest-tenured active coach in the league, but he has some serious evaluation to do on that side of the ball.

15. Cincinnati Bengals

2025 season: 4/10

Future outlook: 7/10

Losing Joe Burrow for such a significant chunk ended any hope for this season, but as Cincinnati’s 2024 campaign showed, there needs to be more than just great quarterback play and offensive fireworks. Right now, the defense is so bad that there’s no margin for error on offense. There needs to be a significant defensive overhaul to get the Bengals back up as an AFC power.

14. Dallas Cowboys

2025 season: 4/10

Future outlook: 6/10

The good news is that Dak Prescott showed that when he’s healthy, he’s capable of playing at an MVP level. The bad news is he did that for a large chunk of 2025, and the Cowboys were still eliminated from the playoffs with a few weeks left to play. The defensive coordinator hire will get all the buzz, but they need to upgrade their personnel on that side, too. Offensively, the George Pickens extension will be under the spotlight, and he has the same agent as Micah Parsons, so get your popcorn ready.

13. New Orleans Saints

2025 season: 4/10

Future outlook: 6/10

There’s an easy way to view the Saints’ 2025 season: 1-7 with Spencer Rattler as the starting quarterback and then 5-4 with rookie Tyler Shough as the starter, with two of those four Shough losses one-possession defeats. The Saints hired a new head coach last offseason in Kellen Moore and now have a quarterback to pair with him. They still have another year of dealing with the Sean Payton salary-cap hell, so it’s easy to be optimistic right now about where they’ll be in the next couple of years.

12. Tampa Bay Buccaneers

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 6/10

The 2-7 post-bye week record was jarring and a stark contrast from the 6-2 start to the season. Tampa Bay has some core players on both sides of the ball — Mike Evans and Lavonte David — getting up there. One thing that has snuck up on them is Baker Mayfield’s contract. Next season is the final year of Mayfield’s current deal. He’s worth it for his current price tag, but the question will be how much he’s looking for on his next deal, and how high the Bucs are willing to go, especially with uncertainty looming at head coach.

11. Washington Commanders

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 6/10

Washington’s magical 2024 season came crashing down in 2025, and that was with one of the oldest rosters in the NFL. Quarterback Jayden Daniels had three stints of absence due to injuries, but Washington’s problems extend beyond that. The defense was downright atrocious, finishing second worst in the league in total defensive EPA, ahead of only the Cowboys.

10. New York Giants

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 6/10

You could highlight the importance of the head coaching hire for any of the teams looking for one, but there’s a different emphasis for the Giants. They made John Harbaugh their priority from the start and, as of Wednesday night, were working to finalize a deal to make him their next head coach. Coupling Harbaugh with what Jaxson Dart showed as a rookie in 2025 could deliver a turnaround in fairly short order for the Giants.

9. Atlanta Falcons

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 5/10

It’s a shame they started playing their best football after being mathematically eliminated from the postseason in early December because the division was as winnable as it gets. The bigger shame is that they don’t even have their first-round pick in 2026, as they dealt that to the Los Angeles Rams last year. There are big decisions to be made at general manager, head coach and the quarterback room, namely Kirk Cousins’ contract and future in Atlanta. Those are arguably the three most high-profile positions in an organization. No pressure, Matt Ryan.

8. Tennessee Titans

2025 season: 2/10

Future outlook: 5/10

After one win in their first 12 games, the Titans had two wins in their final five. Cam Ward had just one interception over the final nine games of the season. Tennessee has a top-five draft pick again this year and should focus on building around Ward, who showed flashes as a rookie of being a franchise quarterback. There’s a lot of work to be done by the front office and the incoming head coach, but prioritizing Ward’s development should be front of mind.

7. Miami Dolphins

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 4/10

The Dolphins went 7-10 in 2025, and that record somehow feels a lot better than what the season felt like. Within a stretch of five wins in six games, the general manager got fired. Mike McDaniel was on the hot seat when the team started 2-7, then Tua Tagovailoa got benched when the team lost three of its last four games. Miami has already hired a new GM in Jon-Eric Sullivan, is searching for a new head coach after firing McDaniel and has some major question marks, including Tagovailoa and his gargantuan contract and wide receiver Tyreek Hill.

6. Minnesota Vikings

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 4/10

The quarterback they had in 2024, who led them to a 14-3 season, helped the Seattle Seahawks to the No. 1 seed in the NFC in 2025. Meanwhile, J.J. McCarthy did not provide encouraging results when he was on the field. If Brian Flores leaves in the current hiring cycle, it will also be a big blow to the defense. On top of all of that, the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers aren’t going anywhere, and the Lions are likely to rebound.

5. Cleveland Browns

2025 season: 2/10

Future outlook: 4/10

As it has for decades, the problem at quarterback continues to linger over this franchise. It doesn’t have a definitive answer, and neither Dillon Gabriel nor Shedeur Sanders showed enough to commit to building around them. The positivity has mostly to do with the defense, spearheaded by Myles Garrett. But the offense also has some nice pieces at the skill positions, particularly Quinshon Judkins and Harold Fannin Jr. None of it will matter, though, if the quarterback is an issue.

4. Indianapolis Colts

2025 season: 2/10

Future outlook: 3/10

The talent on the roster keeps the Colts from being ranked worse on this list, but it’s hard to imagine a team lower on the vibes measure. On Nov. 3, the Colts were 7-2, with growing confidence in Daniel Jones as their future, Jonathan Taylor getting some MVP buzz and their full load of premium draft picks. The Colts acquired Sauce Gardner in a trade that cost them two first-round picks and lost Jones to an Achilles tear. Taylor has put on a lot of mileage through six years in the NFL, too. They go into the offseason having lost their last seven games, not knowing when Jones will be ready and how effective he’ll be when he returns, and without a first-round pick in the draft.

3. Las Vegas Raiders

2025 season: 1/10

Future outlook: 3/10

The Raiders were atrocious in 2025, and that’s not even just about wins and losses. Their head coach and quarterback were win-now veteran pieces, but most of the roster was nowhere close. They drafted a talented running back very high to put behind a terrible offensive line. They also angered their best player by shutting him down for the season against his wishes. On the bright side, they have money to spend and the No. 1 pick.

2. New York Jets

2025 season: 1/10

Future outlook: 3/10

There were four teams tied for the worst record in the league this season at 3-14. The Raiders got the tiebreakers necessary to land the No. 1 pick, but if I had a vote, the Jets would probably win the distinction for the worst team in the NFL. Going a full season without an interception is wild, especially when the head coach is a former Pro Bowl defensive back. The offense set records of ineptitude on what seemed like a weekly basis. The silver lining for the future is the work to stockpile draft picks. The Jets have two first-round picks and two second-round picks this year, then three first-round picks in 2027. They have to hit on them, but the ammunition is there.

1. Arizona Cardinals

2025 season: 1/10

Future outlook: 2/10

Aside from Trey McBride, the Cardinals’ biggest bright spot on offense was the emergence of 2023 third-round pick Michael Wilson. While the revelation of Wilson was nice, it was offset somewhat by the disappointment of Marvin Harrison Jr., the No. 4 pick in 2024, and the continued regression of Kyler Murray. The Cardinals have Murray on a hefty contract but clearly don’t believe he’s the answer at quarterback anymore. They play in a division in which the other three teams were all in contention for the top seed in the conference for the last few weeks of the season and reached the divisional round of the playoffs. It’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/14192418/0115nflmisery.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-15 17:02:02.168186

In a lawsuit as legally significant as it is titillating, former NFL player Matt Kalil is suing his former wife, Haley Kalil, claiming that she violated his right to privacy during a livestreamed interview by describing his genitals as being too big. Haley Kalil, a social media personality with millions of followers, gave the interview with Marlon Lundgren Garcia, another popular online figure with millions of followers. During the 12-minute interview, Haley implicitly referenced Matt’s genitalia, claiming that his penis was like “two Coke cans, maybe even a third,” and described the daunting dick as the primary reason for the couple’s divorce.

Perhaps because the interview remains widely available on YouTube, Haley has not publicly disputed the facts alleged in the complaint, which go far beyond the aluminum can comparison. She claimed that sex with Matt was “painful,” “impossible,” and left her “in tears.” She added that the couple tried “medical and therapeutic intervention,” and that the physical challenges made their sexual relationship “unhealthy” and were a major factor contributing to the couple’s subsequent divorce. Given the broad reach of Garcia’s livestream, these intimate details were then spread to many different sources, amplifying the harm that Matt alleges.

That harm is firmly anchored in a branch of privacy law that has long been recognized, but has fallen into disfavor in recent years. The law of personal injury, while primarily concerned with physical injuries, also protects certain dignitary interests, including reputation (the law of defamation), emotional well-being, and four distinct categories of privacy. Only one of these is alleged to apply in this case: public disclosure of private facts.

But what facts are private? Given the explosion of news and entertainment outlets—where every information source from network television and national press down to a TikTok personality with a few hundred followers scrambles for the public’s attention—it’s easy to conclude that nothing about us is private. Everything, it seems, is fair game for virality. And the law has indeed moved strongly in the direction of valuing the public’s right to know over individuals’ privacy—especially when the information concerns people who fall into what’s now the vast but amorphous category of “public figures.” Not surprisingly, then, there are not many recent cases that claim a private fact was maliciously made public.

Yet it’s a mistake to conclude that everything about us is fair game for public consumption. The Second Restatement of Torts, which many courts rely on in creating and interpreting legal rules, strikes a sensible balance between privacy and the public’s right to know. Publicizing the private life of another person is actionable if the matter publicized is of a kind that A) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and B) is not of legitimate public interest. Sensible, but not easy to apply—at least not the second requirement.

We can rely on a jury to determine what a reasonable person would find offensive. Many people would be offended by having this fact bandied about—especially when the Coke-can commentary is part of a larger discussion of the serious problems Haley tied to the size statement.

But the harder problem lies in determining what counts as a matter of legitimate public interest and what does not. This question is typically resolved by a judge, not the jury, and it’s only the most private of facts that today’s courts are likely to protect. What are such facts? In a federal appellate case involving an unsuccessful privacy claim, the distinguished Judge Richard Posner provided a helpful catalog of information that is definitely private and that would be “mortifying” if disclosed, including depictions of bodily functions, nude photos, and descriptions of a person’s sexual activities: “The desire for privacy,” he added, “is a mysterious but deep fact about human personality … that deserves … legal protection.” And that’s true even of the most public figures, such as Matt Kalil. He’s entitled to marital privacy, as well.

What are the damages from such disclosure, though? Cannily, the complaint names two quite separate categories, which can be seen as mirroring each other. On the one hand, the plaintiff claims that he and his family have suffered ridicule and that his dignity, peace of mind, and enjoyment of life have been compromised. Matt is seeking “in excess of $75,000” for his alleged pain and suffering, emotional distress, and harm to his reputation. But at the tail end of the complaint, he flips the switch and requests that Haley be required to cough up the financial gain she’s alleged to have realized from sharing these private facts, unjust enrichment acquired though “increased viewership, increased engagement, and monetization through various social medial platforms and … coverage.” It would be “inequitable and unjust,” Matt claims, to allow Haley to retain the benefits of her wrongful conduct. In other words, his loss of privacy and dignity was her gain. But not for long, if the claim succeeds.

Matt Kalil’s complaint reserves the right to seek punitive damages, as well. I hope he does, and that the jury sees fit to punish this kind of conduct. More generally (and based on what’s known now), this claim should succeed. There has to be some kind of private space we are all permitted to occupy, even in 2026. This case might serve valuable public interests by discouraging this kind of lurid oversharing and by beginning to push back a bit on the idea that there’s nowhere to hide.",https://compote.slate.com/images/c694dfbc-8df7-474e-9d81-52b46e23bfe6.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-15 17:02:06.481906

PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Wild defenseman Jonas Brodin is week to week with a nagging lower-body injury, coach John Hynes confirmed Thursday.
He missed four games in mid-December with an injury that Hynes indicated is related and something the team has been monitoring closely.
“It didn’t happen in one game,” Hynes said.
“He’s played some solid hockey,” Hynes said.
… He’s played an efficient game.” Brodin, who has played in 42 of the Wild’s 47 games this season, has been injured often throughout his career because of the tough minutes he plays.","ST. PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Wild defenseman Jonas Brodin is week to week with a nagging lower-body injury, coach John Hynes confirmed Thursday. The big question now is whether his availability for the Olympics is in jeopardy.

Hynes wouldn’t go so far as to predict that.

Brodin, the team’s shutdown left-shot blueliner, has been dealing with this injury for a while, but it’s just now getting to the point that he’s being shut down, with the team seeking further information. He missed four games in mid-December with an injury that Hynes indicated is related and something the team has been monitoring closely.

“It didn’t happen in one game,” Hynes said. “It’s something that I think has been building up a little bit.”

In the meantime, the Wild flipped Matt Kiersted for right-shot David Spacek from AHL Iowa ahead of Thursday’s game against the Winnipeg Jets at Grand Casino Arena. Spacek, the son of longtime NHLer Jaroslav Spacek, will make his long-anticipated NHL debut on a third pair with Daemon Hunt — less than a month before he’s set to represent Czechia in the Olympics.

With Brodin out, Minnesota will elevate left-shot Jake Middleton to the second pair with Jared Spurgeon against the Jets. Zach Bogosian (lower body) will miss his fifth consecutive game with a foot injury and didn’t skate Thursday after skating earlier this week. But Hynes indicated that Bogosian and injured center Joel Eriksson Ek will be on the upcoming trip to Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.

Spacek, 22, had a terrific career with Sherbrooke of the QMJHL, being named the league’s defensive rookie of the year in 2021-22. The Wild drafted him in the fifth round in 2022. He’s in his third season with Iowa and has scored 10 goals and 62 points in 168 games there. He won a gold medal with Czechia at the 2024 World Championship and was outstanding in two World Juniors appearances, winning silver in 2023.

“He’s played some solid hockey,” Hynes said. “He’s a good puck-moving defenseman. … He’s played an efficient game.”

Brodin, who has played in 42 of the Wild’s 47 games this season, has been injured often throughout his career because of the tough minutes he plays. He dealt with injuries throughout last season, including a shoulder injury. He was then cleared to play in the World Championship, though the organization tried to talk him out of going. He played, aggravated the injury and ultimately underwent surgery in Colorado in June.

He missed most of camp as part of his recovery and the first game of the season.

The latest injury could lead the Wild to try to convince Brodin not to play in the Olympics, where he’s set to join teammates Eriksson Ek, Filip Gustavsson and Jesper Wallstedt on Team Sweden.

“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,” Hynes said. “That’d be between Billy (Guerin) and Jonas. Right now, we’ll just see where he’s at and exactly what it is. There needs to be more things looked at in order for us to get to that point. Maybe he’s ready before the Olympics; maybe he’s not. We don’t know at this point out in time. But let’s let it play out a little bit and see truly what’s going on.”

If Brodin can’t go, several other Swedish defensemen who were initially snubbed could replace him, including the Edmonton Oilers’ Mattias Ekholm, who played for the team at the 4 Nations Face-Off, the Boston Bruins’ Hampus Lindholm and the Detroit Red Wings’ Simon Edvinsson.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/15123722/GettyImages-2207264245-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-15 15:01:36.480849

Flagg twisted his left ankle while trying to defend Nuggets guard Peyton Watson’s drive to the rim. Flagg initially attempted to play through the injury, but after halftime, he remained behind in the locker room and never returned.

Dallas listed Flagg as doubtful for Thursday’s game against the Utah Jazz. Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said Wednesday that he didn’t know whether his star rookie forward would miss the game.

“He stepped on someone’s foot,” Kidd said. “Last game, he twisted his ankle, too. We decided to hold him for the second half. So, next man up.”

Flagg has been one of the Mavericks’ most durable players this season, missing only one game. He tweaked his left ankle Monday against the Brooklyn Nets but returned and led Dallas to a 113-105 win.

Flagg, the No. 1 pick in last summer’s draft, has been impressive this season, averaging 19.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 4.3 assists and earning two Western Conference Rookie of the Month awards. He leads the Mavericks in total minutes, points, rebounds, assists and steals.

Flagg’s injury Wednesday came one day after the Mavericks announced Anthony Davis would miss at least six weeks. Davis suffered ligament damage in his left hand in a Jan. 8 game against the Jazz.

The Mavericks played most of the second half Wednesday without two starters. Early in the third quarter, center Daniel Gafford limped off after he aggravated a nagging right ankle injury and never returned. Gafford initially hurt his right ankle on the Mavericks’ first day of training camp. He has already missed 12 games this season.

The Mavericks (15-26) are on a 30-win pace at the halfway point of the regular season. They are in 12th place in the Western Conference.

“This is a hard time for us,” Kidd said. “We have had a lot of injuries. … We have been hurt since day one of training camp. This is the norm.

If Jennings is not activated from IR, then the Patriots could elevate Johnson from the practice squad for Sunday’s game against the Texans.","FOXBORO — Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez was present for the start of Wednesday’s practice in a non-contact jersey and participated in initial drills, indicating he is already in the fourth phase of the NFL’s five-phase concussion protocol.

Gonzalez was officially listed as limited in Wednesday’s injury report.

With two practices and four days left before Sunday’s divisional-round playoff game against Houston, Gonzalez needs only to be cleared for full practice participation before he can then be cleared for game action. Gonzalez was diagnosed with a concussion in the second half of last Sunday’s Wild Card playoff win over the Chargers.

His return would significantly boost a Patriots defense preparing for a Texans offense that may be without No. 1 receiver Nico Collins, who sustained his own concussion last Monday versus Pittsburgh.

Defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga returned to practice in a limited capacity for the first time since hurting his foot at Baltimore on Dec. 21. He returned next to injured backup running back Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol), whose 21-day window has been opened for a potential activation off injured reserve later this year. Jennings also donned a non-contact jersey and was listed as limited.

Relatedly, the Pats released running back D’Ernest Johnson from their active roster earlier this week and re-signed him to the practice squad.

Patriots right tackle Morgan Moses, tight end Hunter Henry, outside linebacker Anfernee Jennings and backup offensive lineman Thayer Munford Jr. were all absent for the start of practice. Moses (knee) and Munford (knee) did not participate in practice. Henry (knee) and Jennings (knee) arrived at practice late and were listed as limited. Outside linebacker Harold Landry (knee) was also limited in Wednesday’s session.

Gonzalez was named to his first Pro Bowl this season after being named a second-team All-Pro last year. He missed the first three weeks of the season with a hamstring injury but has started every game since, registering 69 tackles, 10 pass breakups and one tackle for loss.

Playing opposite fellow starting cornerback Carlton Davis, Gonzalez allowed 35 catches on 80 targets for 357 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions this season, including Sunday’s wild-card round win over the Chargers.

Gonzalez was one of the Patriots’ best players in that game, holding Chargers receivers catchless on four targets with two pass breakups. It was the second consecutive game and the third this season that Gonzalez did not allow a reception.

“Gonzo continues to play at a high level,” head coach Mike Vrabel said Monday. “Those are the expectations that he has for himself and that we have for him. … We appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. It’s not quite as easy as — we’ve been through this, but different coverages, locations, motions and things like that. So, he’s handled that all really well. Hopefully, we’ll get him back.”

Gonzalez, Davis and Marcus Jones, who primarily plays in the slot, are the Patriots’ starting cornerbacks. The team also has Charles Woods and Kobee Minor to serve as depth on the 53-man roster. Alex Austin, who continued to practice Wednesday, is eligible to be activated from injured reserve. Miles Battle also provides depth on the practice squad.

If Gonzalez were to shadow anyone on the Texans in coverage, it would be Collins, who wasn’t spotted at the beginning of Wednesday’s practice. The Texans are deep at wide receiver with rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel and veterans Christian Kirk and Xavier Hutchinson ready to take on bigger roles. Collins is clearly the Texans’ best pass catcher, however, with three consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons.

The Patriots have an open spot on their 53-man roster, which could be filled by Terrell Jennings or Austin. The team has just two running backs on their 53-man roster, after releasing Johnson, in Rhamondre Stevenson and rookie TreVeyon Henderson. They’ve gone into every game this season with three active running backs. If Jennings is not activated from IR, then the Patriots could elevate Johnson from the practice squad for Sunday’s game against the Texans.

The Patriots can elevate up to two players from the practice squad. They can elevate players in the playoffs an unlimited number of times.

They elevated defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III and wide receiver Jeremiah Webb last week. Webb wound up being inactive, however, since Kayshon Boutte, who was questionable with a hamstring injury, suited up and played. The Patriots might not need Taylor this week if Tonga returns to action. Taylor has been effective, however, so the team could still elect to elevate him and play him over rookie Eric Gregory.",https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsnl43.jpg?w=1024&h=764,N,,2026-01-15 13:02:11.462748

Compiling his annual list of the rookie classes that produced the most for their teams for ESPN, Aaron Schatz ranked the 2025 Saints crop at the top of the heap.

Schatz is an analytical pioneer who created the DVOA metric for Football Outsiders and now works for FTN Network. He based this year’s rookie rankings on several data points, starting with Sports Info Solutions’ Total Points system, which attempts to assign value to individual players. He then adjusted his rankings based on positional importance, ESPN tracking data and his own DVOA formula.

These rankings are meant to organize the draft classes by the impact the rookies had on this year’s teams rather than trying to assess future value or potential — which hurt teams such as the Jacksonville Jaguars, who only got seven games out of No. 2 pick Travis Hunter.

New Orleans ranked No. 1 on Schatz’s list because of the contributions it received from quarterback Tyler Shough and left tackle Kelvin Banks — its top two picks — but also because several other members of the class contributed in a positive way.

Some other sources back up Schatz’s rankings: Pro Football Reference keeps a proprietary statistic (Approximate Value, or AV) that attempts to quantify a player’s value to a team in a given season.

This year, Pro Football Reference found 35 players from the 2025 draft class to post an AV of 6 or better. The Saints accounted for three of them — Shough (7), Banks (6) and safety Jonas Sanker (7). The only other teams with three or more players to reach that benchmark were the Patriots (4) and Bears (3).

Each of the nine players the Saints selected in the 2025 draft appeared in at least one game this season, though seventh rounders Moliki Matavao and Fadil Diggs spent most of the season on the practice squad, and third-rounder Vernon Broughton missed the final 15 games of the season with a hip injury.

Shough was the gem of the Saints class — for the 2025 season, at least — having recently been named a finalist for the NFL’s Offensive Rookie of the Year despite starting only nine games.

He finished a close second to Giants QB Jaxson Dart (91.7) in QB rating (91.3) and led all rookie passers in passing yards per game (216.7) and completion percentage (67.6 %). Most important, Shough also won five of his nine starts — the only rookie to lead his team to a winning record in his starts.

In Shough and Banks, the Saints found two foundational players at premium positions to accelerate their rebuild with their top two picks. But they also hit on some defensive starters on Days 2 and 3 of the draft.

Sanker played solid football throughout the season after taking over as the starting safety in Week 2 following Julian Blackmon’s season-ending shoulder injury. The third rounder was one of five rookies to record at least 80 tackles and two interceptions this season.

Quincy Riley took over as a starting outside corner after the first quarter of the season and impressed the Saints with his play-making ability, finishing fourth among NFL rookies in passes defended (10). Linebacker Danny Stutsman finished eighth among rookie linebackers in tackles (53) despite playing only 19 % of the Saints defensive snaps.

The Saints were one of three NFC South teams to rank in Schatz’s top six, with the Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons checking in at the No. 5 and 6 spots, respectively. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers checked in at No. 16.

Carolina (Tetairoa McMillan) and Tampa Bay (Emeka Egbuka) both drafted receivers who will at least draw consideration for Offensive Rookie of the Year — and in McMillan’s case, probably win it. Atlanta, meanwhile, found three impact defensive players in James Pearce (rookie-high 10.5 sacks), Xavier Watts (rookie-high 5 interceptions) and Jalon Walker.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/95/89529828-68cd-521f-b614-1bda55822bf2/69487173bcfe8.image.jpg?crop=1631%2C857%2C0%2C126&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-15 17:02:10.480679

Kirk's career-high 144 receiving yards helped fuel the Texans' 30-6 win and set a franchise postseason record, eclipsing Collins' mark from last year's wild-card win over the Los Angeles Chargers.

""I was really happy for Christian knowing the type of guy that he is,"" Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. ""He's one of the best guys in our locker room and he works extremely hard throughout the week. He's been grinding all season to be an impact player for us. I'm happy it worked out for him in one of our biggest games of the year.""

Quarterback C.J. Stroud leaned on Kirk as he grinded through an uncharacteristic night in which he threw an interception and lost two fumbles. The three turnovers were his most in a game since his rookie season.

But Stroud and Kirk were still able to execute on pivotal third downs, with the Pro Bowl quarterback targeting Kirk nine times for 126 yards and a touchdown. Kirk especially came up big after Collins and Justin Watson entered the concussion protocol and were ruled out in the second half.

""I think he's one of the best in the league,"" Stroud said of Kirk. ""We've tried to find ways to get him the ball. ... I told him it's not easy being in the year he's in [and] not having the production, stats-wise. For him to keep going week in and week out, prepping the right way, to see it pay oﬀ was really dope. Super proud of him.""

The regular season was up and down for Kirk, whom Houston traded a 2025 seventh-round pick to acquire from the Jacksonville Jaguars in the offseason. Kirk, in his eighth year, finished with a career-low 239 receiving yards in the regular season, where he missed four games with hamstring injuries. His 64 receiving yards in Week 5 against the Baltimore Ravens was his high in the regular season.

As for Collins' availability for Sunday's divisional round game against the New England Patriots on Sunday (3 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC), Ryans said, ""We'll see how the week goes."" The Pro Bowl wideout didn't practice Wednesday, and the last time he suffered a concussion -- in Week 7 against the Seattle Seahawks -- he didn't play the following week.

""We're one unit, and any of us at any moment can step up and be able to fill the void, and make plays when they are needed,"" Kirk said.

England take on Wales in three and a half weeks, with their Six Nations squad set to be named next week.

After the opening round of action, England travel to Scotland on 14 February and then take on Ireland at Twickenham on 21 February before the Six Nations' rest week.

Smith came off the bench in the opening-round defeat by Ireland in last year's competition and was promoted to the starting XV for the remaining four matches of England's campaign.

Steve Borthwick's side finished second in a hugely encouraging campaign, and Smith won selection for the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia over the summer.

However, while Smith endured a disappointing time with the Lions, unable to exert pressure on Finn Russell for a Test spot, George Ford impressed in England's Tests against Argentina and the United States.

Ford was preferred during the autumn, starting at 10 in victories over Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, while Smith, unable to offer Marcus Smith's versatility, was restricted to a win over Fiji and the fringes of the matchday 23.

""It is hard to take,"" Smith told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show in December.

Just over three months after he suffered a devastating ankle injury, linebacker Fred Warner returned to practice on Tuesday. And, shockingly, he is not ruling out availability for Saturday's divisional round game against the Seattle Seahawks.

Such a speedy recovery is a remarkable feat for Warner, who was initially deemed out for the season when he broke and dislocated his ankle in Week 6 against the Bucs. Warner underwent surgery after teammate Ji'Ayir Brown rolled up on his leg and twisted his ankle at an awkward angle.

""We're taking it day by day,"" Warner said Wednesday when asked if he anticipated playing this weekend. ""I think they said last week they weren't going to open my [practice] window, and then my window is now open. So we're just taking it day by day.""

Warner was part of the wave of injuries that devastated the 49ers early in the year. Defensive end Nick Bosa was lost for the season due to a torn ACL he suffered in Week 3, and key contributors including quarterback Brock Purdy and Ricky Pearsall also missed time. Star tight end George Kittle saw his campaign come to a close in the Wild Card round when he tore an Achilles tendon.

Despite the poor injury luck, San Francisco stands just two wins away from the Super Bowl.

If Warner returns to the lineup this weekend, he would bolster a defense that seems to be rounding back into prime form. The 49ers surrendered a modest 19 points to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round and gave up just 13 points to the Seahawks in the season finale. But things have not always been so bright in Warner's absence.

""I feel amazing,"" Warner said. ""Just so grateful, blessed to be back. I think, obviously, when all this happened, I didn't really think about the possibility of returning in-season. But the way things progressed and being able to have this opportunity to be back with my teammates, have a chance at helping them win this week and so on and so forth, that's my only goal moving forward.""

While the injury dashed his chances of securing first-team All-Pro honors for the fourth consecutive year and fifth time in six seasons, Warner has a chance to rewrite an otherwise lost season. He is one of the best linebackers in the NFL and would contribute immense amounts of leadership and playmaking ability to the middle of the defense if he suits up before the postseason run is over.

""Fred's the ultimate energy-giver, so just having him out there is awesome,"" defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. ""Yesterday was a little bit more tempo down, but today obviously with higher tempo it'll be fun to get him out there, see him running around.""

Warner had not missed a game in his career prior to the injury. If he does not play again this year, he will finish with a career-low 51 tackles, two tackles for loss and three passes defended.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/14/c798649c-072b-4cc6-af16-cd8dbae03793/thumbnail/1200x675/9cb1bc0c99c0f7014af672a2a6783509/gettyimages-2240299559-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 12:02:34.621912

FOXBOROUGH — Patriots star cornerback Christian Gonzalez is on the right track as he navigates through the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Despite suffering a concussion during last Sunday’s victory over the Chargers in the wild-card round of the playoffs, the defensive back was back on the practice field Wednesday as the Patriots prepared for Sunday’s divisional-round bout against the Texans at Gillette Stadium.

According to New England’s injury report, Gonzalez was a limited participant during Wednesday’s practice, meaning that he’s officially reached Stage 4 of the league’s five-step “return to participation” protocol.

The final step is “full football activity,” meaning that Gonzalez still has a few more practices to be cleared for full contact and get the green light to play on Sunday against Houston.

A healthy Gonzalez would be a welcome sight for a Patriots defense that dominated earlier this week against the Chargers. According to Next Gen Stats, Gonzalez did not allow any catches on five targets within 26 coverage snaps in that win over Los Angeles.

Speaking on Monday, Mike Vrabel did not lay out an official timeline for Gonzalez’s availability.

“Gonzo continues to play at a high level,” Vrabel said. “Those are the expectations that he has for himself and that we have for him, and yeah, I would say that he would be in the protocol. How long that lasts, I don’t know, but when you don’t return to the game, when they won’t let you go back in the game, that would put him in the protocol.

“So, wherever that goes, that goes, but we appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. It’s not quite as easy as — we’ve been through this, but different coverages, locations, motions, and things like that. So, he’s handled that all really well. Hopefully, we’ll get him back.”

If cleared for Sunday, Gonzalez would likely be matched up against Houston’s top wide receiver, be it Nico Collins (whose status could be in doubt after suffering a concussion on Monday vs. Pittsburgh), Christian Kirk, or rookies Jayden Higgins or Jaylin Noel.

In his third season in the NFL, Gonzalez has allowed 35 catches on 80 targets for 357 yards, with one touchdown and no interceptions.

Late in the season, New England discovered their run game.","Buffalo Bills: Run defense

Defending the run has long been a sore spot for the Bills – they finished the season 25th in defensive rush success rate. Inside, they lack mass, and are too easily pushed around by teams committed to a smashmouth approach. Outside, they struggle with discipline and technique. Against Jacksonville last weekend, both fell apart. The Jaguars rushed for 154 yards, with 119 of those yards coming on outside runs. It was the Jags’ highest total on outside runs this season. This weekend, against a Broncos offense that is happy to punch anyone in the mouth, that could put the Bills in a lot of trouble.

But Sean McDermott is a defensive mastermind. And his answer to the run game woes has been, effectively, to give up. McDermott has stopped trying to load the box or reinforce the front. He is happy, it seems, to concede steady yards on the ground if the Bills do not cough up an explosive run (10-plus yards). And by not adding extra bodies to the box, he’s been able to maintain schematic flexibility in the secondary. McDermott has now centered his defense around disguises on the back-end secondary, betting that, eventually, opposing offenses will want to throw the ball even on run-obvious downs. Blurring the coverage, without superstar talent, is the best way for a coach to induce mistakes.

McDermott put on a clinic against the Jaguars, baiting Trevor Lawrence into errant throws that forced Jacksonville off the field. Sticking with that plan moving forward is the Bills’ best way out of the mess.

Chicago Bears: Creating pressure

The Bears are living a charmed life on offense. They have a water-tight scheme. They hammer people with the run. And with Caleb Williams, they have a quarterback capable of creating something out of nothing.

Defensively, however, they are more limited. They have lived on turnovers this season, leading the league in takeaways. In the playoffs, that doesn’t cut it. You’re facing the best of the best – and they’re the best precisely because they don’t turn the ball over. All season long, Chicago have worked around their lack of a pass rush. They finished last in the league in the regular season in pressure rate with a four-man rush (a necessity in the playoffs) and in time to pressure from those four-man looks. Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen, a true warlock of a coach, has counteracted that by going hog-wild with blitzes. He has pressured creatively and relentlessly. But coaching can only cover up so much. Even the Bears’ blitz package has been ineffective, generating pressure at the lowest rate among the remaining playoff field.

Some coaches blitz selectively, and that’s key in the playoffs when the best quarterbacks can pick apart defenses that send extra rushers. No quarterback has been as potent against the blitz this year as the Rams Matthew Stafford, who the Bears faces this weekend. Allen hasn’t been able to be selective. He needs to fire extra bodies into the line of scrimmage to make the quarterback uncomfortable. Against the Rams, he’ll likely roll the dice again, hoping that enough pressure gets home that Stafford panics or is moved off his spot, where he is less effective. From there, the Bears will have a chance to snag the turnovers that have kept their head above water all season. It will be a gamble, but it’s Allen’s only path forward.

Denver Broncos: Bo Nix

Nix is the great unanswered question of the playoffs. Is he a needle mover at quarterback? Or is he surviving in a solid scheme, supported by an outstanding defense?

Everything else is in place for the Broncos. They have the best offensive line in the postseason, the top pass-rush and a future Hall of Fame coach. They also have enough firepower at wide receiver to go toe-to-toe with anyone in the AFC, from the reliable Courtland Sutton to the explosive threats of Troy Franklin, Pat Bryant and Marvin Mims. Even with that cast, at some point Nix will need to make big throws on third-and-long.

Nix has already debunked many ideas about his game. He isn’t a game manager; he takes risks down the field. He isn’t a point guard; he can scramble around and extend plays. According to PFF, he ranked behind only Stafford and Dak Prescott in big-time throws this season. Where Nix has struggled is taking the easy openings and moving on with the game. But he has been able to offset some poor decision-making by avoiding sacks and turnovers. The Broncos won’t ask him to be anything else during the playoffs. And if he can hit those difficult third-and-longs, he could put together the kind of playoff hot streak we’ve seen from Joe Flacco and Nick Foles.

Houston Texans: Passing game

The Texans’ performance against the Steelers on Monday was an outlier. They were able to run the ball and sustain a long drive. For much of the season, they’ve been reliant on a brittle passing game and the odd explosive play to launch them down the field. Even when in scoring position, their performance in the redzone has been brutal.

It was Houston’s defense that kept them alive against Pittsburgh. Without a dominant performance, it would have been a game characterized by CJ Stroud’s unusual mid-game meltdown. The Texans cannot afford a repeat performance from their quarterback. Given the lack of talent along the offensive line, they’re unlikely to repeat their success on the ground. It will need to be Stroud who puts them over the top. He has the talent – and he’s done it in the postseason before. The problem, however, is that the passing game has been inconsistent. The Texans have to work hard for their yards. There are few easy buckets. It’s a system reliant on receivers making tough, contested catches or Stroud creating out of structure. That’s a thin tightrope to walk, especially when the team’s No 1 receiver, Nico Collins, is out with a concussion.

Los Angeles Rams: Special teams

The Rams having a punt blocked against the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs was no anomaly. They’ve had a special teams blunder in three of their five losses this season.

It’s not just a season-long issue, either. It’s institutional. Over the last five years, the Rams rank 32nd in special teams EPA, and there is a chasm between the Rams and the second-worst team over that spell. In successive postseasons, they’ve flirted with disaster, only to be bailed out by their offense and defense. This year’s errors led Sean McVay to a first: firing a coach during the season. But the change in coordinator hasn’t had the desired effect. The Rams have become more effective at limiting kick returns, which has helped their starting field position on defense. But they remain just as prone to bone-headed lapses when they’re kicking the ball themselves.

As they move into the final eight, there is no margin for error. The Rams have all the ingredients of a championship team: they can win in any way on offense, their defense creates havoc in the pocket and they have the quarterback. But they have ignored the third phase of the game for too long. So far, they’ve been able to outrun it. But if they fall apart between now and the Super Bowl, it will probably come down to another untimely kicking mistake.

New England Patriots: Pass protection

Like the 49ers and Bears, the Patriots’ defense does not create a ton of pressure on defense. But they do have a pair of one-on-one winners – Milton Williams and Harold Landry – who could flip a game on their own. The concern is with their own protection.

Late in the season, New England discovered their run game. After struggling for much of the year to move the ball on the ground, the Patriots have a 46% rushing success rate since week 12. That’s helped support a bombs away passing attack that has been the bedrock of the league’s leading offense. But even with the return of first-round left tackle Will Campbell, they allow too much pressure on quarterback Drake Maye. They finished the regular season with a 38.7% pressure rate conceded, which puts them 28th in the league. And the Patriots don’t just concede pressure; they give it up quickly and often unblocked. It makes what Maye has done this season more of a minor miracle.

Maye, for all his brilliance, is prone to taking drive-killing sacks. But against the Texans this weekend, the Pats line could be in big trouble. They struggle with power-based pass-rushers, and Houston have the best duo in the league: Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter. Squeak past the Texans, and the Broncos could be on deck, a team who pressure and sack quarterbacks at the highest rate in the league.

The Patriots need to be able to run the ball to mitigate the risk, and then hope Maye can deliver some flashes of brilliance under duress.

San Francisco 49ers: Pass rush

Robert Saleh deserves credit for dragging the Niners’ defense this far. He has been able to keep a no-name defense competitive throughout the year, despite a battery of injuries and a lack of a pass-rush.

Against the Eagles on Sunday, Saleh loaded the box to stop the run and dared Jalen Hurts and Philly to throw. Against a high-school caliber offense, it was effective. Against tougher opposition, though, it will be tough to make up for.

Saleh, for all his brilliance, runs a fairly simple scheme. He doesn’t disguise coverages. The Niners led the league this season in their use of zone coverage, and those coverages fall into just three buckets. He’s not a blitzer, either, relying on four players to detonate the pocket and attack opposing quarterbacks. It’s difficult to navigate through the playoffs with such a static, predictable scheme without unrelenting pressure. Across the season, the Niners finished with a 22% pressure rate with a four-man pass-rush, 31st in the league and almost half the typical threshold for Super Bowl winners. Against the Eagles’ offense, with all its faults, that figure fell to 11%. That won’t cut it against the Rams, Seahawks or whoever comes out of the AFC, unless Saleh has a late-season curveball he can throw.

Seattle Seahawks: Sam Darnold

Darnold put together a magical first half of the season. He was a front-runner for MVP, driving the ball to all areas of the field, creating plays with his legs and adding newfound refinement to his game. He was hitting difficult, tight-window throws deep down the field at a historic clip. But much of that has dried up in the second half of the year. As Seattle’s defense has risen to match the league’s best and the team’s run-game has come alive, Darnold’s game has soured – at least by his early-season standards.

Since Week 11, Darnold ranks 22nd in the league among eligible starters in the RBSDM composite, which measures the value of a play and how much the quarterback can be deemed responsible for the value. That’s the lowest of any remaining quarterback in the playoffs. His turnovers are up, and the deep ball has withered.

The rest of Seattle’s roster is good enough to cover up for Darnold. Facing the Niners in the divisional round could also prove to be a get-right game, given San Francisco’s defensive frailties. But Darnold has never been to the final eight before, and the Seahawks offense isn’t playing with great rhythm. No single player serves as a bigger pivot point of the postseason. If Darnold limits turnovers, the Seahawks are the front-runners. If he can tap back into his early-season form, they will be the runaway favorites. But if he has a repeat performance of last season’s playoff outing for Minnesota, the Seahawks will be heading home early.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4b40d9d21ab5933de69c9b01deffdff3c1596a/266_0_2645_2117/master/2645.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e6dfd7962e6489b745fb332dde50d21",N,,2026-01-15 11:04:45.935300

Wideout Jordyn Tyson has the chance to end that five-year drought.

Tyson made a name for himself during the 2024 season with 75 receptions for 1,101 yards and 10 touchdowns to help the Sun Devils reach the Big 12 Championship and College Football Playoff before missing the postseason due to a collarbone injury.

He returned for his redshirt junior campaign, where he recorded 628 yards and eight touchdowns on 57 catches over the first seven games before a nagging hamstring issue caused him to sit out three of the team’s five final contests.

The two-time First Team All-Big 12 wideout declared for the draft on Dec. 10, and is projected as one of the top receiver prospects available.

Although he enters a stacked class featuring USC’s Makai Lemon and Ohio State’s Carnell Tate, Tyson’s explosiveness and play-making ability have draft experts roundly expecting him to go early in the first round.

Here’s where a collection of mock drafts have Tyson landing on April 23 now that the 2025 NFL regular season has concluded.

Where is ASU’s Jordyn Tyson being taken in 2026 NFL Draft mocks?

Pro Football Focus

No. 6 overall, Cleveland Browns

The Browns have the second-worst team receiving grade in the NFL this season and didn’t have a single wide receiver place higher than 100th in PFF grade. Tyson would immediately become the top weapon for whoever’s playing quarterback for Cleveland and has an 89.5 PFF receiving grade over the last two seasons.

CBS Sports

No. 24 overall, Cleveland Browns

Tyson is an explosive receiver with the size, speed and catch radius to win at all three levels. A smooth hands-catcher, he consistently makes contested and high-point grabs look effortless while creating surprising separation at the top of his routes for his size. Tyson can hit top-end speed in just a few steps and shows the type of short-area quickness reserved for smaller, shiftier WRs. He’s also an asset in the screen game, making him a dynamic threat both outside and from the slot.

The Athletic

No. 7 overall, Washington Commanders

When healthy, Tyson is the most complete receiver in this class. The only holes in his game are on his career injury report. He blocks, adjusts to poor throws, runs crisp routes and wins in the air. He’s everything Jayden Daniels needs to take the next step in his development.

Bleacher Report

No. 11 overall, Miami Dolphins

The Miami Dolphins offense underwent a massive evolution since Mike McDaniel became the head coach, but it still needs another significant threat at wide receiver.

…

Whoever takes over will need another weapon on the outside to complement Jaylen Waddle, with Tyreek Hill likely on his way out as well. Jordyn Tyson adds a different dynamic.

ESPN

No. 6 overall, Cleveland Browns

Unless they want to package their two-first round picks to move up, the Browns won’t be able to pick a quarterback. But they do need pass catchers to join breakout rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and veteran wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. Tyson is a creative route runner who can make catches outside the strike zone with his strong hands at the catch point. He’s also capable of making big plays after the catch.

Yahoo! Sports

No. 6 overall, Cleveland Browns

The future is bright, but Seahawks need to capitalize now

Cross’ knee injury calls into question his status for Saturday night’s NFC Divisional Round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. Prior to Wednesday’s practice report, he appeared on track to make his first start since Week 15.

If Cross’ availability is in question, that could be a major problem for Seattle. Backup offensive tackle Josh Jones, who started the past three games at left tackle in place of Cross, hasn’t practiced this week due to a knee injury.

Meanwhile, cornerback Riq Woolen (oblique) was limited for a second straight day and linebacker Ernest Jones IV (illness) sat out practice Wednesday.

On a more positive note, five-time Pro Bowl defensive end Demarcus Lawrence (Achilles) was upgraded to a full participant on Wednesday after being limited on Tuesday. Head coach Mike Macdonald said earlier Wednesday afternoon that he expects Lawrence to play on Saturday night.

Safety Coby Bryant (knee) and rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee), who are both returning from injuries, were full participants for a second straight day.

In addition, backup linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) was upgraded to a limited participant on Wednesday. Key special teams player Chazz Surratt (ankle), who spent the past six weeks on injured reserve, was upgraded to a full participant.

""Feeling great man,"" Dotson said Wednesday.
""It's one of those things that's day-by-day, but it's feeling great every day.
His physicality, his ability to go out there and play is great, but also just the energy he brings.
""Even the last game really, it was like, it hurt me to not be out there with my guys,"" Dotson said.","WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. – Rams offensive lineman Kevin Dotson was estimated as a limited participant in Wednesday's practice, marking his first step toward a possible, but anticipated, return from his ankle injury this Sunday against the Bears in the divisional round of the playoffs.

""Feeling great man,"" Dotson said Wednesday. ""It's one of those things that's day-by-day, but it's feeling great every day. It's feeling way, way better compared to what it was at the beginning, so I'm ready to try it out at least.""

Given Los Angeles only conducted a walkthrough Wednesday afternoon, head coach Sean McVay said Thursday's practice will give the team a real gauge of how Dotson's ankle is feeling, ""but he's got a good look in his eye"" and that ""his intentions are to be able to go play and go do his thing"" on Sunday.

""We take it day-to-day, and we have a lot of tests that we have to go through first before we can truly assess it,"" Dotson said.

Dotson has been sidelined by that ankle injury since Week 17, sustaining it the prior week in the Rams' Thursday Night Football loss to the Seahawks in Seattle. Dotson said he felt like he was initially hurt from getting run into, and wasn't aware he had been stepped on by Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall until two days later. Hall's actions drew a one-game suspension without pay from the NFL.

""Because I gave him the benefit of the doubt,"" Dotson said. ""Because my teammates were like – I'm thinking he accidentally stepped on me, and I'm not going to make nothing out of it. And then I'd seen after the play, my dawg (center) Coleman (Shelton) fought for me, pushed for me, then he told me like what really happened and stuff like that. So I was like, okay, and if I would have knew that, I probably would have stood up. I didn't know somebody stepped on me and did all that until I had seen the film and stuff. But I would've knew that. ... I'm past it, I'm not going to hold nothing against him until I can see him (and) get my get-back. Not gonna step on nobody (though), I'll get it between the plays. But I'm fine, I'm fine.""

If the rest of the week goes according to plan and brings McVay's optimism to fruition, Dotson's return would give back to the Rams offensive line the guard with the third-highest run blocking grade in the 2025 regular season (89.3), according to Pro Football Focus. His 86.4 offensive grade also ranked third overall among qualified guards by PFF.

""I mean, he's a mountain of a man,"" quarterback Matthew Stafford said. ""He's a beast. When he was playing this year, I thought he was one of the best guards, if not the best guard in the league. So if we can get him back, obviously that would be a huge boost. His physicality, his ability to go out there and play is great, but also just the energy he brings. I know if you guys see him celebrating sometimes when we do good stuff. So he's a great guy to have out there and be around. But if not, I thought (Justin) Dedich played really well last week, and we'll roll with him again.""

Dotson will do everything in his power to be on the field Sunday.

""Even the last game really, it was like, it hurt me to not be out there with my guys,"" Dotson said. ""Even just to get our get back, I want to be there for that, and couldn't be there for it. So hopefully I can be here for this game, and I want to be able to make an impact.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/rams/yhbn1qwagauhdjn6bh5t,N,,2026-01-15 02:58:50.059363

The crash happened around 3 a.m. on November 15 in the 400 block of Scott Street in Covington. Video from a neighborhood security camera that Covington police provided to Local 12 News shows a vehicle running a red light at an intersection and slamming into a parked car. The impact caused a black Jeep to flip over, landing on its roof just out of the camera’s frame.

Police records show the Jeep involved in the crash is registered to Taylor-Britt.

The following day, November 16, Taylor-Britt played in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, during which he suffered an injury that ended his season.

According to the official crash report, Taylor-Britt is listed as the backseat passenger. Covington police say no one was arrested or charged in connection with the crash.

However, body camera video obtained by Local 12 shows confusion at the scene, with officers and those involved going back and forth over who was actually behind the wheel. Police say Taylor-Britt and others left the scene before officers could determine responsibility.

The black Jeep had crossed over the Roebling Bridge and into Kentucky moments before it slammed into a red Chevy Cruze parked on Scott Street.

The first officers at the scene encountered two vehicles badly mangled after the collision, but no one was inside or around them. One officer can be heard on body camera saying, “No one is in there, no one is in there they all fled, I guess.”

A short time later, a man walks up to officers and identifies himself as Jafabian Booker, saying he is Cam Taylor-Britt’s brother. During an exchange captured on police body camera, Booker tells an officer the vehicle belongs to Taylor-Britt and claims a woman was driving at the time of the crash.

“This is my brother’s car,” Booker says in the video. When an officer asks where Taylor-Britt is, Booker responds, “He wasn’t in here. I had a female in here. She was drunk driving and this happened.” When the officer asks where she went, Booker replies, “She ran off.”

Officers walk around looking at the aftermath, and body camera video captures their remarks.

“I smell weed reeks of weed.” “Girl supposed to be 5’4 driving the car with the seat all the way back — ain’t no way. Football player was driving, yeah he was driving.”

Police tracked Taylor-Britt to his home, where officers found him outside, mid-conversation on his phone. This is his exchange with an officer.

“It is what it is.” Taylor-Britt then offers to go back to the scene. “I can go back there, but there ain’t nothing to it. I wasn’t driving.”

The officer asks, “Who was driving?”

Taylor-Britt says, “He’s there. He’s there, he’s there right now.”

The officer responds, “No one was there. What was the name of the guy that was driving?”

Taylor-Britt says, “Jafabian (Booker).”

Covington police then redact the body camera footage, allowing only the audio to be heard. The exchange stretches on for nearly 20 minutes, involving Taylor-Britt, officers at the scene, and his brother, Jafabian Booker, who is on the phone.

OFFICER – Sir, were you the one who was driving the car?

BOOKER – No, sir. No, sir. I already gave the description to the other officer of the woman that it was. I was letting her drive.

TAYLOR-BRITT – So Fabian

BOOKER – Yeah.

TAYLOR-BRITT – Keep it gangster, brother, ’cause now it sounds like we got a bunch of what do you call it going on.

Around one minute later, one officer tells another, “Jafabian is saying he’s driving now.”

The police report states that Jafabian Booker initially denied driving but later admitted he was behind the wheel. The report lists the date and time as 11/15 at 3:21 a.m.

In another exchange that was also audio-only, an officer is heard asking Taylor-Britt about his injuries. In the video, his white shirt appears torn at the left shoulder, with what looks like blood visible.

OFFICER – You hurt or anything, man? You look like you got a little blood on you.

TAYLOR-BRITT – No, nah. I’m good.

OFFICER – You aren’t hurt?

TAYLOR-BRITT – Nah, I’m good. I’m really pissed off.

The next day, November 16, Cam Taylor-Britt took the field against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He suffered a foot injury during the game that ended his season.

On January 6, Taylor-Britt appeared in court using crutches while still recovering from that injury and faced a Hamilton County judge.

The 26-year-old pleaded guilty to reckless driving and driving with a restricted license. Cincinnati police cited him twice in 2025 — once in June and again in September.

In court, Taylor-Britt’s attorney told the judge he has no intention of driving anytime soon and said he has relied on others for transportation for several months.

A police officer described the reckless driving incident in detail: “There’s lots of traffic. Lots of pedestrians. Mr. Britt went over the yellow lines, did a burnout, and drove on the wrong side of the road at a high rate of speed up Joe Nuxhall Way.”

Taylor-Britt apologized to the court, acknowledging the seriousness of his actions.

“I just want to apologize for my actions. I plan already to knock out those things that got me into this place, because it is not me, and I don’t want to be here,” Taylor-Britt said.

Judge Bernie Bouchard questioned Taylor-Britt about the danger posed by his actions.

“You’re putting yourself and everybody else in danger on the street. Why?” the judge asked. “No reason at all,” Britt replied.

He was then taken to the Hamilton County Jail to serve his five-day sentence.

One of the charges he just went to jail for was driving under a suspended license. When Covington police asked to see a license after this November accident, Taylor-Britt said he would have to talk to his attorney because at the time he did not have one.

When asked why so much of the body camera video was redacted, Captain Justin Bradbury said, “The entire screen was blacked out on those videos because they were recorded at Mr. Taylor-Britt’s home address. Given his prominence, we felt it necessary to redact the video of the interaction. No matter where the officers turned their camera, it either picked up his numerical address on the building or showed the surrounding area, making it easy for his address to be identified. This was done solely to protect Mr. Taylor-Britt’s privacy.”

Captain Bradbury added, “This case was not turned over to any prosecutor’s office because no one committed a crime.”

Local 12 also reached out to Taylor-Britt’s attorney, Joseph Tekulve, for comment and did not receive a response.",https://local12.com/resources/media2/16x9/830/1320/8x0/90/7cd8e5dd-daee-4cde-9af8-2298c8264c3e-GMCCAMTAYLORBRITTcrash.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 02:59:03.751274

Gonzalez suffered a head injury in the Patriots' wild-card playoff game against the Los Angeles Chargers. He was targeted in coverage on Chargers' wide receiver Quentin Johnston, who ended up falling on Gonzalez's head during the play.

At first glance, the blow didn't appear all that significant, but an eye test never tells the full story when it comes to head injuries. Gonzalez was ultimately pulled from the game early and never returned, as the Patriots went on to knock off the Chargers in a 16-3 victory.

The fact that Gonzalez is returning to practice this early is a great sign for his chances of playing in Sunday's divisional matchup against the Houston Texans. His presence in the defensive backfield is game-changing for the team. He was targeted five times by the Chargers and didn't allow a single reception.

Offensive tackles Morgan Moses and Thayer Munford Jr. stayed sidelined during Wednesday’s preparations for the Houston Texans due to knee ailments. But there were returnees in Foxborough.

Running back Terrell Jennings, nose tackle Khyiris Tonga, cornerback Christian Gonzalez were all back on hand in a partial capacity for the No. 2 seed.

Here’s the first injury report leading up to Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.

Moses stayed in for all 64 offensive snaps during Sunday’s 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. The starting right tackle went into the wild card at Gillette Stadium without a game designation after missing the first practice of the playoffs because of an illness. But a knee injury did see Munford finish last week as a non-participant for consecutive sessions on the way to being listed as questionable. The latter has served an extension of the offensive line since circling back to the organization as a member of the 53-man roster in November.

On the other side of the divisional round, a team captain and back-to-back Pro Bowl wide receiver was among the sidelined for the No. 5 seed. Collins had been carted to the locker room after suffering a concussion on Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He finished with north of 1,000 receiving yards for the third regular season in a row.

Wednesday saw Tonga practice for the first time since sustaining a foot injury that resulted in three games missed. The limited participants in Foxborough also included a pair working through the NFL’s concussion protocol.

In the secondary, Gonzalez was present in a red non-contact jersey after being ruled out late last weekend. And in the backfield, so was Jennings as his 21-day window to be activated from injured reserve officially opened. The 2024 undrafted arrival out of Florida A&M had not practiced since the calendar turned to December.

After spending the past two weeks as a limited participant, Austin graduated to full participation for the Patriots on Wednesday. The corner returned to practice on New Year’s Eve and still awaits a return to the 53-man roster following a wrist procedure.

A trio also went in full for the Texans.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2255814332.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C4.9793839856932%2C100%2C78.523935767461&w=1200,N,,2026-01-14 19:59:26.825838

""But still the way this team fought and battled and made it as far as it did, with completely unforeseen things like that, I love this team,"" Slater added.
""Not being out there was really tough and there's a fire to be back out there,"" Alt added.
And the return of Slater and Alt could do wonders as the Bolts look for more success in Year 3 under Jim Harbaugh.
""Just try to make a game out of it because it's tough being out,"" Alt added.","Each player missed a significant amount of the 2025 season, with Slater not playing a single snap since he sustained a torn patellar tendon during an August 3 practice.

The 26-year-old, who signed a multi-year contract extension less than two weeks before the injury, gave an update Monday on his recovery process.

""It's been tough. Feel good, the rehab's been going very well. Just doing everything I can to make sure that I'm 100 percent next year,"" Slater said. ""Obviously, a huge disappointment not being able to contribute this year. Just controlling what I can control and get ready for next year.""

Slater noted that he's gotten positive reports during his rehab, which he said is a nine-to-12 month process.

""It's been smooth. All reports have been that it's been going extremely well. I'd say ahead of schedule pretty much the whole time, but just chipping away at it. It's a long rehab, but everything's going smooth,"" Slater said.

He was later asked about being ready for training camp.

""Just the way things have been going and the way I'm working at it, I have full intent obviously to do that,"" Slater said. ""But of course, everything's going to prioritize just making sure it's 100 percent first. But that's definitely the goal and the plan.""

Alt, meanwhile, suffered an ankle injury in Week 4 against the Giants but returned in Week 9 against the Vikings. His presence lasted only two games as he further injured the ankle in Week 9.

The second injury knocked him out for the remainder of the 2025 season.

""It was pretty much what you guys saw. I [messed] my ankle up pretty good in all facets. It was a tough blow but we bounced back,"" Alt said.

He later added: ""It was everything you could do to an ankle … I did it, pretty much.""

Alt was superb in the six games he started, ranking sixth among all tackles with a pass-blocking grade of 82.3. The Chargers went 5-1 in games where Alt started, with the lone loss coming in Week 4 when he was injured after playing just 10 snaps.

Those six stellar games were enough to earn him his first Pro Bowl nod.

""Extremely grateful,"" Alt said. ""Thankful to everyone who voted for me. It was definitely a surprise at the time … for me it's just gratitude and wanting to get healthy.""

Alt said his rehab ""has been going really well"" and that he is confident it won't affect his offseason training.

""Every day has been getting better and better. Out of the boot now, so close to where I want to be,"" Alt said.

The hope, of course, is that Alt and Slater both return to full strength and bookend a Chargers offensive line that will look for more consistency in 2026.

Slater said Monday that he already has high expectations for the unit.

""We've got a good group, you know? We do. We really do,"" Slater said. ""Me and [Joe] going down, it hurt.

""But still the way this team fought and battled and made it as far as it did, with completely unforeseen things like that, I love this team,"" Slater added. ""We've got a team full of warriors, a team full of competitors. I'm excited. I'm very excited.""

Alt also echoed that sentiment in the locker room, saying there's already a fire burning inside him to help the Chargers offense next season.

""I'm guessing he does. And I know I do,"" Alt said. ""You want to be on the field. That's my favorite part of this.

""Not being out there was really tough and there's a fire to be back out there,"" Alt added.

The Chargers will have a new offensive coordinator next season.

But the nucleus of the offense, led by Pro Bowl quarterback Justin Herbert, remains on the roster.

First-round running back Omarion Hampton showed plenty of promise as a rookie before an ankle injury set him back while fellow rookies Tre' Harris and Oronde Gadsden each flashed a rapport with Herbert.

Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston have each flashed big-play ability early in their careers, too.

And the return of Slater and Alt could do wonders as the Bolts look for more success in Year 3 under Jim Harbaugh.

""It was obviously tough on both of us,"" Alt said. ""Being able to go through that together and have each other to lean on, we've made it our own competition in the recovery room.

""Just try to make a game out of it because it's tough being out,"" Alt added. ""Being able to battle with each other and battle back has been a lot of fun.""

Slater said: ""I love ball. This is like what I do every single day. I don't really go on vacation much. I kind of just work out all the time and think about playing football, so it wasn't fun. It wasn't easy, but I'm just excited for the future. I can't really control what happened, just doing everything I can to make sure that next year is better.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chargers/k0wodkkyb1rcrfx7kdpj,N,,2026-01-14 21:59:35.185957

The league is coming off a wild Wild Card Weekend, where a bulk of the games came down to the final moments. That's shaping these playoffs into one of the most memorable runs to the Super Bowl in recent memory, so this upcoming divisional round has a lot to live up to.

As much as we'd like to focus solely on the games themselves and the individual matchups that'll help determine who advances and who goes home, we also have to keep an eye on injuries. For as entertaining as Wild Card Weekend was, there were several notable injuries. The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle for the remainder of the year due to a torn Achilles, while Texans receiver Nico Collins and Patriots corner Christian Gonzalez each departed their matchups with concussions.

With teams getting back onto the practice field this week to gear up for the upcoming playoff slate, we'll take the temperature of those injuries and more by dissecting the injury reports.

Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos

Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)

Bills: After conducting a walkthrough practice on Tuesday that saw Josh Allen listed as a limited participant, Buffalo's Wednesday injury report saw the quarterback improve to a full participant. Allen is listed with foot, knee and right finger injuries.

Meanwhile, three Bills players were missing on Wednesday: cornerback Maxwell Hairston (ankle), safety Jordan Poyer (hamstring) and receiver Tyrell Shavers (knee). Shavers is out for the year with a torn ACL. Linebacker Terrel Bernard (calf), defensive end A.J. Epenesa (neck), tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee, calf), linebacker Matt Milano (ankle), defensive tackle Ed Oliver (biceps), defensive end Greg Rousseau (back) and linebacker Shaq Thompson (neck) were limited.

Broncos: Denver's injury report on Wednesday mirrored its initial report of the week. Linebackers Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) and Drew Sanders (ankle), along with tight end Lucas Krull (foot), were limited. Defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers was listed with a hip injury but practiced fully.

San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks

Saturday, 8 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)

49ers: One of the more fascinating developments for the 49ers is the looming return of linebacker Fred Warner. He returned to practice last week as he works his way back from an ankle injury he suffered in October. San Francisco listed Warner as a limited participant for the second day in a row, so it does seem like a return this week is in play. Joining Warner as a limited participant were defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos (knee), receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee), guard Dominick Puni (ankle), defensive end Keion White (groin, hamstring), and linebacker Dee Winters (ankle). Safety Ji'Ayir Brown (hamstring) and linebacker Luke Gifford (quad) did not practice.

Seahawks: Seattle offensive tackle Charles Cross (hamstring, knee) was downgraded from a full participant on Tuesday to limited on Wednesday, so his status will be worth monitoring the rest of the week. Along with Cross, linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) and corner Tariq Woolen (oblique) were limited. Linebacker Ernest Jones did not practice on Wednesday due to an illness.

Houston Texans at New England Patriots

Sunday, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN, ABC | Fubo, try for free)

Texans: Houston did not have standout receiver Nico Collins to begin the week of practice on Wednesday. He left Monday's win over the Steelers with a concussion.

The Texans also listed defensive end Denico Autry (knee), offensive tackle Trent Brown (ankle) and receiver Justin Watson (concussion) as nonparticipants. Linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair (knee), offensive lineman Tytus Howard (ankle), guard Ed Ingram (ankle), running back Jawhar Jordan (ankle), corner Kamari Lassiter (ankle, knee) and defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins (elbow) were limited.

Patriots: Christian Gonzalez left New England's wild card victory over the Chargers with a concussion, but the star corner was out at practice on Wednesday, albeit on a limited basis.

Along with Gonzalez, tight end Hunter Henry (knee), linebacker Anfernee Jennings (knee), running back Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol), linebacker Harold Landry (knee) and defensive lineman Khyiris Tonga (foot) were limited. Offensive tackles Morgan Moses (knee) and Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) were held out of the week's opening session.

Then, in his sixth game as a pro, the Titans rookie edge rusher suffered a fractured leg in the team's game at Las Vegas.
It was a setback for Oladejo, who moved from an off-the-ball linebacker at UCLA to the edge position during his senior year.
""Now I have to keep growing and progress my craft and take things day by day, developing all aspects of my body, flexibility, mobility, and things of that nature.

Then, in his sixth game as a pro, the Titans rookie edge rusher suffered a fractured leg in the team's game at Las Vegas.

Oladejo was placed on Injured Reserve, and he spent the rest of the season recovering, rehabbing, and learning, while thinking about what's next.

At times, it wasn't easy.

""Just keeping my faith in God, staying prayed up, reading my Bible, staying in touch with my family,"" Oladejo said. ""And being around my teammates as well, that helped a lot.""

""(My teammates) told me to keep my head up, things happen. Everyone's journey is different, and you just have to take it day by day and not let the present get too ahead of the future.""

A second-round pick of the Titans in the 2025 NFL Draft, the 6-foot-3-inch, 259-pound Oladejo tallied 13 tackles, six quarterback pressures and two tackles for a loss in while playing in six games for the Titans. Before being injured on his 23rd snap in the team's October 12 game against the Raiders, Oladejo had already recorded three tackles, two tackles for a loss, and a quarterback hit. It was arguably his best showing during his brief rookie campaign.

It was a setback for Oladejo, who moved from an off-the-ball linebacker at UCLA to the edge position during his senior year. In his eyes, the more reps, the better.

And while Oladejo wasn't able to play another snap in 2025 after the injury, he did practice with the team the final few weeks of the year while remaining on Injured Reserve.

The year was a learning experience for Oladejo.

""I have a lot of developing to do,"" he said. ""Now I have to keep growing and progress my craft and take things day by day, developing all aspects of my body, flexibility, mobility, and things of that nature. But I know the potential is there.""

Oladejo said he plans to work on his body this offseason, whether it's doing Pilates, hot yoga, or boxing, while working on pass rush on the field in an effort to be more explosive.

He has big plans for his second NFL season.

They did so without the services of star receiver Nico Collins throughout most of the second half. He was injured in the win and entered the NFL's concussion protocol after landing hard on his head trying to haul in a pass from C.J. Stroud over the middle of the field.

Collins exited the wild-card game with three catches for 21 yards and a team-high seven targets at the time.

Houston will travel to Foxborough to play the Patriots in the divisional round on Sunday afternoon. The question remaining is whether the star wide receiver will be available as the Texans hope to upset the No. 2 seed on the road.

The Patriots stifled the Los Angeles Chargers, 16-3, and their defense would benefit if Collins can't play this week.

Here's the latest on Collins.

Nico Collins injury update

Collins remains in the NFL's concussion protocol as of Wednesday, Jan. 14. It is unclear how much time he might miss, if any.

Collins was quickly ruled out with a concussion after hitting his head on the ground in the Texans' wild-card round game in Pittsburgh on Monday night.

As of Wednesday, the team has not yet provided an update on Collins.

Collins will have two more chances to practice fully this week before the Texans likely tag him with a designation ahead of Sunday's game against the Patriots.

Collins has one fewer day to complete concussion protocol because the Texans played on Monday. He appears to be trending towards missing this weekend's game against New England.

What is the NFL's concussion protocol?

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury. It's a five-step process that a player must complete before they can return to play. Those steps are, as defined by the NFL:

Symptom-limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football-specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

Before a player enters the protocol, they are evaluated on the sideline. The tests are conducted by the team's physician and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant. The evaluation includes observing any ""no-go"" symptoms, which are things like loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia, and more, in addition to a history of concussions, other signs/symptoms, and video review.

At that point, a neurological exam is conducted and the player is escorted to the locker room if the sideline evaluation leaves any doubt.

Texans WR depth chart

Here's a look at the Texans' WR depth chart:

Nico Collins (injured)

Xavier Hutchinson

Christian Kirk

Jayden Higgins

Jaylin Noel

Justin Watson

Braxton Berrios

Houston played one game this season without Collins after he suffered a concussion in Week 7; Higgins led the team with eight targets.

Higgins and Noel, two rookies from Iowa State, have seen increased opportunities in the absence of Collins and Kirk throughout their first season. Higgins is an X-type receiver (6-4, 215 pounds) like Collins on the outside, while the smaller Noel is similar to the veteran Kirk.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/14/USAT/88182618007-usatsi-27826590.jpg?crop=4875,2744,x0,y4&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-14 17:00:36.876528

Blood tests to monitor evolving brain injury in ischemic stroke could be a cost-effective and fast alternative to currently used noninvasive approaches such as MRI. Here, Vlegels et al. used a single-molecule detection assay on blood samples and found that brain-derived tau abundance was associated with the severity of brain injury in three cohorts of patients with ischemic stroke. Brain-derived tau in blood tracked the trajectory of brain injury (including treatment effects of recanalization and the neuroprotectant nerinetide) and could predict functional outcomes for up to 36 months. These findings suggest that brain-derived tau in blood could be used to monitor brain injury and treatment effects in patients with ischemic stroke. —Daniela Neuhofer

Abstract

A specific and accurate blood test for acute brain injury could help monitor infarct growth in ischemic stroke and serve as a surrogate end point in clinical trials. Using a single-molecule detection assay, we assessed plasma brain-derived tau (BD-tau), a marker selectively quantifying tau protein from the central nervous system, in a prospective cohort of 502 patients with acute ischemic stroke with serial blood sampling from admission to day 7. Higher BD-tau concentrations at admission were associated with more extensive early brain injury on computed tomography and predicted larger final infarct volumes. BD-tau increases from admission to day 2 were related to infarct growth. BD-tau concentrations rose until day 7 and were higher in patients with secondary events, including recurrent stroke. After thrombectomy, the rise of BD-tau was smaller in patients with complete versus incomplete recanalization. BD-tau outperformed other blood markers and imaging metrics in predicting 90-day functional outcome across infarct size strata and time points. In an independent multicenter prospective cohort (N = 519), BD-tau showed higher performance than magnetic resonance imaging–derived final infarct volume in predicting functional outcomes at 3, 12, and 36 months. In the biomarker substudy of a phase 3 trial assessing nerinetide in patients with ischemic stroke (N = 193), BD-tau showed predictive performance comparable to the other cohorts, mediated the relationship between recanalization and functional outcome, and showed a 49% smaller increase in the nerinetide group versus placebo. Overall, plasma BD-tau tracked ischemic brain injury over time, outperformed other biomarkers in predicting functional outcomes, and identified possible treatment responses.

“Disbelief and stillness were all I felt as I yelled, get up, get up, over and over again,” Claire began. “He always gets up. He’s George — he can do all things. He just does it. It hurts. There’s no preparing for it.

“I love this man with everything I have in me. He is a unicorn in this world, and he will be back stronger and better than ever before.”

Kittle, the Niners’ beloved tight end, popped his Achilles in the first half of Sunday’s 23-19 wild-card win over the Eagles in Philadelphia.

Claire and 49ers owner Jed York headed to the locker room in the wake of the crushing injury.

When York asked Kittle if there was anything he needed, the seven-time Pro Bowler requested a bottle of tequila and was swiftly provided with a bottle of Patrón, according to reports.

Kittle, who has played his entire career with the Niners beginning in 2017, broke his silence Monday.

“Football sucks sometimes,” Kittle wrote on Instagram. “But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place.”

With a trip to Seattle on deck for the divisional round, Kittle and his forever teammate will be supporting the team as they push toward a Super Bowl berth — a game that will be played at their home Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara next month.

“The mind of a heartbroken athlete is a determined one. He is unf–kwithable, as is this entire team,” Claire added Tuesday. “I’m proud of these guys and the rally-together grit they fight with each week. It’s a special year, you can feel that and we’re not done yet.

“Thank you for loving G and carrying some of this pain for us.”

Kittle and Claire have been married since 2019.

Wearing a red non-contact jersey, starting cornerback Christian Gonzalez was present during the short media window at the start of the session. While his participation status has yet to be determined, his presence on the practice field is itself a positive sign: it suggests that he already is in the fourth of five stages of the NFL concussion protocol.

Gonzalez, 23, left the Patriots’ victory over the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday night following a pass breakup in the early fourth quarter. The Pro Bowler hit his head in the process and after staying on the field for an ensuing third down incompletion headed into the blue medical tent on the sidelines.

Shortly thereafter, Gonzalez exited for the locker room. He was initially announced as questionable to return to the game with a head injury before ultimately being ruled out late in the contest.

On Monday, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel announced that Gonzalez had been placed in the concussion protocol.

The 17th overall selection in the 2023 NFL Draft, Gonzalez is one of the best cornerbacks in football and a core member of the Patriots’ defense. A Pro Bowl selection this season, he started all 14 regular season games he appeared in and played 771 defensive snaps, fourth most on the team. He registered 69 tackles and broke up nine passes along the way, and was one of the best players on the field versus the Chargers.

The last time the Bills and Broncos met was at Highmark Stadium in the 2024-25 Wild Card Round.
Remarkable toughness, remarkable commitment to the team.""
Overcoming injuries isn't new to Buffalo, but McDermott emphasized that there's no other choice but to have the next man up mentality.
""It's a great team, No.","The Buffalo Bills advanced to the AFC Divisional Round with a win over the Jaguars on Sunday. Buffalo heads to Denver, the No. 1 seed in the AFC, for its next postseason stop. The last time the Bills and Broncos met was at Highmark Stadium in the 2024-25 Wild Card Round. Buffalo advanced, winning 31-7 in that game.

""He embodies what we're all about,"" McDermott said of Shavers. ""I believe [the injury] happened somewhere in the second quarter when we went out there to look at him, and for him to then come back into the game – and then for it to turn out to be what it was – is remarkable. Remarkable toughness, remarkable commitment to the team.""

""What we need to focus on is what's in front of us … and that's handling the things that we can handle and control,"" McDermott said. ""It's next man up. That's pretty stone cold what it is and what has to happen here for us.""

The Bills' wide receiver room slimmed down after Wild Card week with Shavers and Davis tearing their ACL. Overcoming injuries isn't new to Buffalo, but McDermott emphasized that there's no other choice but to have the next man up mentality. He said on Tuesday that he's confident in his wide receivers to do just that.

""Another guy's got to step up. That's point blank what it means. And I don't mean to be short, it's just right now it's full confidence in the guys in that room,"" McDermott said.

From that room, Khalil Shakir had a huge game in the first round of the playoffs. He had 12 receptions, not dropping a single pass that went his way, and also acted as an extension of the run game in some regard. While others had explosive, chunk plays, Shakir was a player Allen and offensive coordinator Joe Brady relied on when the run game slowed.

After an up-and-down season on and off the field, McDermott expressed his confidence in Keon Coleman. Coleman had one reception for 36 yards on Sunday. Throughout the season, Coleman popped in and out of the lineup. Slowly, he worked his way back on his coaches' radars in terms of maturity and consistency.

""He, along with others, need to step up and [I'm] confident he will,"" McDermott said of the second-year wide receiver. ""He's moving in the right direction. You saw the production he had last week, the big play down the sideline. He continues to work on the other areas of the game as well that matter just as much as catching balls. So, his growth is going to be important for us down the stretch here.""

""We're going to need everyone. I mean, that's the short answer and is the simple truth. We're going to need everyone,"" McDermott said. ""It's a great team, No. 1 seed in the AFC and they've earned that [and] we're at their place. It's that type of game and you've got to be able to do your 1/11th at a very high level. If we don't make the adjustments this week and the improvements we need to make, it's going to be really hard – awfully hard for us to get a win out there.""

""They've got great players, interior and their edge guys. It's just a great defense, great scheme,"" offensive lineman David Edwards said. ""We're going to look at that film just to identify what they're doing versus combinations and maybe blitzes or whatever, just to get an idea. But it could be a scheme different, different game. So, we'll have to see when we're out there.""

""They've got some absolute studs over there. Obviously, they rush the passer extremely well,"" Allen said. ""Interior there, some big, stout guys that can really push the pocket, and they can stop the run in the backend too … Understand the game plan, get to the right checks, get to the right calls, execute and play for each other because we can't give [Denver] any help. That's a good team over there, and anytime you're facing a really good defense and you got to go out there and do your part.""

The Bills are third in the league in red zone efficiency at 66.2 percent. Despite being one of the best in the NFL, though, they face the No. 1 red zone defense (allows 42.6 percent).

""The space, obviously, shortens down there. But when you've got speed and pass rushers, that's a pretty good combination,"" McDermott said. ""Those pass rushes are longer type of guys and twitchy at the same time. Their roster speaks for itself, and the way that they play also is extremely impressive.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/r0a3plochhmk6wfddsw1,N,,2026-01-14 17:00:55.043361

The NFL wife, 31, posted an emotional tribute on Instagram to the San Fransisco 49ers tight end, 32, who suffered a season-ending injury when he tore his right achilles during their Wild Card playoff game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, Jan. 11.

Claire, who wed George in April 2019, wrote about the feelings she experienced while watching her husband go down before halftime, and get carted off the field into the locker room.

While George won't be taking another snap, the San Fransisco 49ers are headed to the divisional round after beating the Eagles 23-19.

""I’m proud of these guys and the rally-together grit they fight with each week. It’s a special year, you can feel that and we’re not done yet,"" she wrote in her caption, concluding, ""Thank you for loving G and carrying some of this pain for us ❤️.""

Claire's heartfelt caption accompanied a slideshow of photos, featuring intimate moments with George with a swollen right ankle upon sustaining his injury and sweet PDA-filled pics with him on the sideline before the game.

In an Instagram post of his own, George — who reportedly requested for a bottle of tequila in the locker room after the injury — candidly opened up about his injury one day after the game.

“Football sucks sometimes. But I love it,"" the 49ers tight end began in his caption. Kittle included some photos of himself on the field and a picture of his wife kissing him in the locker room.

“I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out,” he added. “I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet!”

""It [the injury] was just disappointing timing but nonetheless feel good about where we are heading into this offseason and what next year should hold.""

Hunter underwent season-ending surgery on November 11 and the Jaguars had previously said that he was expected to return to ""full football activities"" within six months, but head coach Liam Coen was non-committal on whether that would mean taking on both offensive and defensive roles when asked about the situation at the time.

“I understand there’s a lot of questions about if he’ll remain a two-way player and all those kind of things,” Coen said told reporters on November 12 via the New York Post. “All of that is very premature, and at the end of the day like every player on this roster he’ll be evaluated at the end of the season and we’ll be able to give him his three better, three best and the things that we need to continue to improve upon and the things we need to build on.”

Hunter, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, was placed on injured serve on October 31.

“Very fair to say that his rehab process is going as expected. He’s hitting it hard,” Gladstone said. “Obviously, the joy he brings to the everyday operation is still something that permeates throughout the space that he enters. … We still expect him to play on both sides of the ball.”

Gladstone said Hunter could see more of an emphasis at cornerback, given that the Jags have several players at that position whose contracts expired after the 2025 season, including Montaric Brown, Greg Newsome and Keith Taylor.

The Jags traded up to select Hunter in the 2025 draft, a bold move that showed belief in Hunter’s abilities as both a wide receiver and cornerback. He appeared in seven games as a rookie, recording 28 catches on 45 targets for 298 yards and one touchdown. As a cornerback, Hunter recorded 15 tackles, three pass breakups and a fumble recovery.

Hunter sustained an LCL injury in his right knee during practice on Oct. 30 and underwent season-ending surgery on Nov. 11. At the time, Hunter was expected to resume “full football activities” within six months.

“The steps that he was taking by the midpoint of the season really made us feel good about what the back half of the year was going to look like on both sides of the ball, being a feature piece on offense and an impact player on defense,” Gladstone said. “It was just disappointing timing, but feel good about where we are heading into this offseason and what next year should hold.”

The Jags traded for receiver Jakobi Meyers in November, in part due to injuries in the wide receiver room. The Jaguars won five of Meyers’ first six games in Jacksonville, helping pave the way to the team’s first playoff appearance since 2022, and the team signed Meyers to a three-year contract extension in December.

Coach Liam Coen wouldn’t specify where Hunter would land on the offensive depth chart upon his return, instead saying, “It’s all part of the evaluation process.”

“For (Hunter) right now it’s about getting his rehab right and diving in mentally because of some of the limitations we’ll have throughout the offseason program,” Coen said. “I’m really excited about getting back to work with Travis and continuing that evolution.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/09/10192545/GettyImages-2234223630-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-14 15:00:53.143663

Los Angeles Rams: The Entire Special Teams Operation Special teams are the monster hiding under the bed in football.","The NFL playoffs are not usually decided by the matchups everyone is looking at most closely. In Round 1 alone, the Packers' kicker cost them seven points. The Patriots won with a dominant defense, not Drake Maye heroics. Chicago lost the turnover battle but won anyway. The Eagles won the turnover battle but lost anyway.

Those moments are reminders of how thin the margins can be when obvious advantages are canceled out and the game tilts on hyper-specific matchups, miscues under pressure, and the ability to exploit the tiniest of weaknesses.

Here are the potential pressure points remaining for each of the eight teams left competing for the Super Bowl:

Seattle Seahawks: Nick Emmanwori’s Versatility

Emmanwori’s physical profile isn’t one you can easily typecast into a role on a traditional NFL defense. He was seen as too big and too vulnerable in deep coverage areas to truly be a safety, but too small to serve as an every-down linebacker. The Seahawks took a chance on him early in the second round anyway and immediately found ways to maximize his impact as a true disrupter on the field. The 6-foot-3 220-pounder has found a home at safety, where he frequently blitzes, fitting the run and covering tight ends out of the backfield. Given that Seattle has a rubber match lined up with San Francisco on Saturday night, Emmanwori will be featured often as the 49ers try to involve Christian McCaffrey in their offense as much as possible.

Emmanwori is not likely to win Defensive Rookie of the Year—Browns linebacker Carson Schwesinger is a heavy favorite for that award—but he’s certainly had an impact in turning Seattle into a top-tier defense. And that defense is the reason the Seahawks broke the franchise record for regular-season wins and why the NFC playoffs run through Lumen Field.

Emmanwori still has flaws in coverage and can be exposed for his overaggressive nature at times. He relies heavily on his instincts and his athleticism, which Kyle Shanahan will be sure to try to exploit on Saturday. But his ability to make game-changing plays is rare for a rookie, and he's the perfect Kyle Hamilton–esque piece for Mike Macdonald to play with.

San Francisco 49ers: Jake Tonges Replacing George Kittle

Kittle’s torn Achilles leaves San Francisco dangerously understaffed on reliable and healthy skill position players. Without Kittle, Brandon Aiyuk, and probably Ricky Pearsall, Kyle Shanahan will have to plunge even further into the depth chart. The Niners pulled off the upset in Philly on Sunday thanks to a Jauan Jennings passing touchdown and 111 yards on six catches from journeyman DeMarcus Robinson. If the Niners are going to knock off another top NFC contender on the road, Tonges could be the difference maker. The Seahawks don’t have a lot of weaknesses defensively, but they do allow the sixth-most yards per game to opposing tight ends.

Tonges caught the game-winning touchdown in Week 1 in Seattle and grew into a bigger role when Kittle was sidelined by injury earlier this season. In the last three games that Kittle hasn’t played, Tonges has seen his production skyrocket.

Week 5 vs. Rams: seven receptions, 41 yards, one TD

Week 6 vs. Buccaneers: six receptions, 58 yards

Week 17 vs. Bears: seven receptions, 60 yards, one TD

In some ways, it’s very fitting that an offense led by a seventh-round draft pick quarterback is now turning to an undrafted tight end to help fill in the gaps.

Chicago Bears: Colston Loveland’s Late-Season Emergence

When rookie tight end Tyler Warren was filling up the stat sheet for Indianapolis early in the season, it was fair to wonder whether the Bears had made the wrong choice by selecting fellow tight end Loveland four spots earlier in the 2025 draft.

Loveland wasn’t necessarily absent from the Bears’ passing game, but for much of the year, he was far from a focal point. He didn’t record a single game with more than seven targets over the first 16 weeks of the season, operating more as a complementary piece than a featured option. But as Chicago’s offense has matured, Loveland’s role has expanded within it.

Caleb Williams has targeted Loveland at least 10 times in each of the past three games, culminating in a breakout performance in the wild-card round. Loveland finished with a career-high 137 yards on eight catches and 15 targets in the Bears’ comeback win over Green Bay.

Chicago still wants to be a run-first team at heart, but defensive issues have forced it into shoot-outs. To keep pace with the high-powered offenses remaining in the NFC playoffs, the Bears will need to score—and score often—which makes Loveland’s emergence even more critical.

What stood out most in his wild-card performance was the versatility of his route running. Chicago moved Loveland all over the formation, and he consistently won both over the middle and outside the numbers. His late-season breakout is a major reason the Bears are still alive, and if this improbable run of comebacks and late-game heroics is going to continue, Loveland will need to remain a focal point of the offense.

Los Angeles Rams: The Entire Special Teams Operation

Special teams are the monster hiding under the bed in football. You never know when they’re going to show up and ruin your night. It’s never going to lead the game preview discussions in the television studio, and it’s likely only going to lead the postgame show when something goes terribly wrong.

For the Rams, special teams woes have been the underlying dread in an otherwise awesome season. Miscues cost the Rams the division and home-field advantage. On Saturday, a blocked punt by the Panthers nearly bounced L.A. out of the playoffs. Multiple blocked kicks cost it a win against the Eagles in Week 4. The Rams then fired special teams coordinator Chase Blackburn in December after Rashid Shaheed’s punt return touchdown led to a blown fourth-quarter lead against Seattle in an instant-classic Thursday night thriller.

The errors have eliminated the Rams’ margin for error and turned up the difficulty sliders to the highest setting, considering they’ll likely need to win three consecutive road games to reach the Super Bowl.

The Rams finished the regular season 31st in EPA from special teams. And it’s not a problem specific to this season. Since 2021, only the Packers are worse in EPA lost from special teams than the Rams. The gap between those two teams and everyone else is significant, and it's pretty ominous given how Green Bay’s season just ended.

Houston Texans: The Non–Nico Collins Wide Receivers

After Collins was carted off the field with a concussion on Monday night, it seems highly unlikely that he’ll play on Sunday in New England. The Texans’ passing offense has been extremely dependent on Collins: He had more than double the receiving yards of every other wide receiver on the roster in the regular season.

If you were expecting a big playoff breakout from a Houston receiver not named Collins, you probably would have picked Jayden Higgins. If not him, maybe Xavier Hutchinson. Or maybe even rookie Jaylin Noel, who has made the occasional downfield splash at various points this season. The point is that you’d have picked just about any of the young receiving options on this roster and not veteran journeyman Christian Kirk. The 29-year-old, now on his third team, was barely a factor for the Texans this season, yet he turned in a career-high 144 yards on Monday night to help propel Houston into the divisional round.

Houston’s offense isn’t consistent or reliable from down to down, but it really doesn’t have to be to win football games. The Texans, bolstered by an immense defense, just need someone to step up and produce a handful of explosive plays. With the Patriots’ top corner Christian Gonzalez also in concussion protocol, opportunity is lurking.

New England Patriots: Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson as Pass Catchers

Houston’s defense is built to hunt the football. It’s one of the league’s most aggressive and physical units, constantly moving downhill both in coverage and in the pass rush.

Drake Maye has been as successful as any quarterback in the league pushing the ball downfield this season, but that may not be where this game is decided. The clearest path to neutralizing an elite Houston defense may be using its aggression against it—forcing linebackers and safeties to step forward before slipping the ball underneath.

If Houston stays in attack mode, the Patriots’ running backs in the passing game become less of a checkdown and more of a pressure point. And if New England can consistently flip that aggression into manageable gains, it can keep Houston from fully dictating the terms of the game. The Steelers and Aaron Rodgers failed to do that on Monday night, but Maye is better equipped at this stage of his career to navigate the pocket, buy time, and create with his legs when plays break down.

Stevenson’s 48-yard catch-and-run out of the backfield on Monday directly led to a Patriots field goal. Henderson hasn’t always been reliable snap to snap, but he’s the type of home-run hitter who has found success generating explosive plays from time to time. With the Patriots potentially needing to beat two elite defenses on the road to Santa Clara, Stevenson and Henderson in the passing game may be less a luxury and more a necessity—an extension of an inconsistent running game and a way to keep Houston from playing downhill all night.

Denver Broncos: The Enigmatic Riley Moss

Whatever your opinion of Moss as a corner, you can find a statistic to prove you’re right. He finished the season with the most passes defended in the NFL. Is that a positive because he was constantly in position to make plays on the ball? Or is it a negative because opposing offenses felt comfortable throwing at him over and over?

There might not be a single CB2 who inspires more words, film breakdowns, and debate than the corner playing opposite Patrick Surtain II on one of the NFL’s best defenses. Denver ranks eighth worst in DVOA against no. 2 wide receivers, yet the Broncos also finished top eight in open coverage rate, per FTN—a combination that perfectly captures the ambiguity of Moss’s season.

Evaluating Moss is one of the most complicated exercises in the NFL right now, and it’s a puzzle Denver’s playoff opponents will have to solve when putting together their game plan. And if you’re Denver, would you have Surtain shadow the Bills top receiving option, when it’s almost certainly tight end Dalton Kincaid?

Buffalo Bills: The Safety Playing Next to Cole Bishop

Buffalo’s safety depth was already thin. After the wild-card round, it’s a glaring potential liability. Jordan Poyer left the game with an aggravated hamstring injury, leaving the Bills without a clear option to play next to Bishop. Taylor Rapp is out for the year. Damar Hamlin hasn’t played since Week 6. There isn’t an established replacement waiting behind them.

The back seven of the Bills defense has struggled all season to get off blocks. It’s an undersized group to begin with, and those limitations have left them as vulnerable as any Bills defense in the Josh Allen era.

The safety issue shows up in the numbers, too. Buffalo finished the regular season bottom-eight in explosive play rate allowed and bottom-eight in big runs allowed. Bishop stepped up with a crucial interception to seal the win against the Jaguars in the wild-card round, but Sean McDermott will need to get creative schematically to deal with a Denver offense that is constantly hunting and chasing explosive plays to make up for their down-to-down inconsistency.",https://wp.theringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cropped-PlayoffXFactors_Getty-Ringer-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 18:00:57.581873

George Kittle and Cooper DeJean

San Francisco’s been a great story all year. Decimated by injuries and an amazing fringe theory on why, they somehow made it to 12-5 and even had a shot at the 1-seed in Week 18 but lost to Seattle. That meant a drop to 6th in the NFC and a road game at the defending champion Eagles.

But the one story that matters here is that of George Krieger Kittle, and it’s an awful one. I won’t post the video of the injury. I saw it live, then saw a couple of replays from Fox. That was enough for me. Kittle caught 1 pass for 6 yards in San Francisco’s shock 23-19 win, and on that reception planted with his right foot as he came down with the ball. You saw that odd wiggle in the calf when his foot planted. He went down in a heap along the sideline and it was later confirmed he tore his Achilles. That is a 9-12 month recovery time so perhaps we see Kittle in late 2026. What a terrible moment for Kittle, who’s had an excellent career but has also been ravaged by injuries. Just hope he can get through this one and be back late next season.

On the other sideline, Cooper DeJean’s incredible season - one that saw him earn first-team all-Pro honors - comes to an end after 2 tackles and 2 passes defended. Philly - weird team. Do they all like each other? Seems like a firm no.

San Francisco and their insane list of injuries head to the Divisional Round and a date in Seattle Saturday night.

Lukas Van Ness, Nick Niemann, and Tory Taylor

Now that we’re done mourning, we move onto the rest of the weekend. Saturday and most of the Sunday games were fun! We’ll start in the Windy City as the Bears managed a remarkable comeback to upend Green Bay, 31-27. Tory Taylor didn’t punt a single time. I was surprised when I looked at the box score but there it is - No Chicago Punting.

On the other sideline, Lukas Van Ness logged 3 tackles and a sack, while Nick Niemann picked up 1 tackle. I don’t know how the heck Green Bay lost this game. I’m just happy this rivalry is back in our lives. The teams don’t like one another, the coaches don’t like one another, the fans don’t like one another…YES. Welcome back, Chicago-Green Bay rivalry! The league is better having you back. We got three fantastic games from them this year. Keep that going for the next decade, please!

Chicago hosts the Los Angeles Rams Sunday.

AJ Epenesa

Really quick on AJE. The defensive end had 1 tackle as the Bills won late over Jacksonville, 27-24. Not much to report here, other than Buffalo advanced Sunday afternoon. They head to Denver for a date with our man Riley Moss Saturday afternoon. Buffalo’s injury situation is pretty close to that of San Francisco’s, and especially in their wide receiver room where only three receivers remain from the active roster.

Yahya Black and Kaleb Johnson

Good and bad here. Yahya Black had a nice game, collecting 2 tackles and recovering a fumble. That’s the good! The rest is really bad. Kaleb Johnson was a healthy scratch for the fourth-straight game, capping a disastrous rookie year in which he had just 28 carries. Oh and of course, the Steelers were shot into outer space by Houston, 30-6, Mike Tomlin fired himself on Tuesday, and they don’t know if Aaron Rodgers is coming back or not.

Beyond just the knee issue, though, Tom wants to dig deeper into the sports science to uncover why he battled as many injuries as he did.
In addition to Tom, the Packers also lost All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons to a season-ending ACL injury in Denver.
Tom lauded Walker for his durability and hopes the former seventh-round pick may be back next year.
""Anytime you have injuries at any position, it's difficult to develop that chemistry but especially on the O-line,"" Tom said.","GREEN BAY – Zach Tom strained as hard as he could and exhausted every available option to get on the field Saturday night for the Packers' NFC Wild Card playoff game in Chicago.

Until finally Green Bay's starting right tackle came to terms with the fact his injured knee wasn't going to fully cooperate.

""It was probably one of the hardest decisions I've had to make in my life,"" Tom said. ""Obviously you want to be out there in the playoffs because that's when everything's at stake. I just don't think I was in a position where I could go out there and help the team.""

Tom knew what he was up against as soon as he suffered a partially torn patellar tendon during Green Bay's Week 14 matchup with the Denver Broncos. It's a risky injury with dire consequences if it tears completely.

The 6-foot-4, 304-pound tackle underwent a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection with the hope it would hasten his recovery and possibly get him back for the playoffs.

But the knee didn't improve as much as Tom or the training staff hoped and the fourth-year veteran was forced to watch from the sidelines as the Packers' season ended in a 31-27 loss to the Bears.

""I feel like I could do a lot of what I need to do (but) I was never really comfortable in pass protection,"" Tom said. ""If somebody's truly trying to run through my chest, I don't think I would've been able to be competitive.""

It was a bitter ending to a season that started with so much promise for Tom, who was rewarded for years of stability on the offensive line with a long-term contract extension this past July.

A 2022 fourth-round pick out of Wake Forest, Tom started 37 straight games (including playoffs) for Green Bay and looked like he was picking up where he left off before suffering an oblique injury in the Packers' regular-season opener against Detroit.

Tom played just one snap over the next three games and was listed with a back injury for the remainder of the year even after returning. He was doing as well as an offensive lineman could be doing in December when the knee injury struck in Denver, and it proved to be the last straw to his frustrating 2025 campaign.

Tom said he's ""leaning towards"" surgery to fix the patellar tendon, which would require a six-month recovery. Beyond just the knee issue, though, Tom wants to dig deeper into the sports science to uncover why he battled as many injuries as he did.

""It's tough. You can feel sorry for yourself, or you can use the offseason to figure out if it's something I'm doing,"" Tom said. ""Maybe I need to put on some weight. … Maybe I need to get in better shape. Obviously, we need to figure something out because I keep tearing (stuff).""

When healthy-ish, Tom remained one of the best at his position and still received the fourth-most votes among right tackles in AP All-Pro balloting despite missing five games.

In addition to Tom, the Packers also lost All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons to a season-ending ACL injury in Denver. Green Bay didn't win a game the rest of the season.

""I think it's just the execution,"" Tom said. ""There were some things that we did up front there in the game that (you) just can't make those mistakes in a playoff game. Part of that falls on me, that's something where I need to improve. I need to be a better leader. I need to take control.""

This will be an interesting offseason for the Packers' offensive line, which also lost Elgton Jenkins to a season-ending ankle injury in Week 10. Tom's 2022 draft classmates – left tackle Rasheed Walker and center Sean Rhyan – are both set to become unrestricted free agents in March.

Rhyan told reporters on Monday that he avoided a significant knee injury in the waning moments of the Bears game, suffering only a bone bruise that shouldn't threaten his offseason training.

Tom lauded Walker for his durability and hopes the former seventh-round pick may be back next year. Walker has played in 55 consecutive games, including 48 starts, since the 2023 regular-season opener.

""Coming in, getting drafted in the seventh round, and then turning into a starting left tackle in the NFL is just a blessing from God,"" Walker said. ""Really enjoyed my time here, took pride in protecting Jordan Love or whoever was in the backfield playing quarterback, made a lot of great relationships with a lot of guys. It's just been a good time for me, and I'm just ready for whatever's happening next.""

Tom is ready to put the 2025 season behind him. He's excited to work alongside rookie second-round pick Anthony Belton, who took over at right guard for the stretch run, and hopes better health and continuity lead to improvement in 2026.

""Anytime you have injuries at any position, it's difficult to develop that chemistry but especially on the O-line,"" Tom said. ""Obviously you want to be out there. You want to be able to build that chemistry, especially because they moved Belton next to me and you want to be able to get as many reps with him as you can. It just didn't work out like that.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/xa0zlkatygqqmd6wznh5,N,,2026-01-14 16:01:59.560994

After San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle suffered a serious injury during a playoff game, his wife shared raw emotions on social media.

George Kittle was carted off the field during the second quarter of the 49ers’ 23-19 Wild Card win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The victory pushed San Francisco forward in the playoffs, but it came at a painful cost. It was later confirmed that the 32-year-old tight end tore his Achilles tendon, an injury that ended his season and began a long road to recovery.

Claire Kittle posted photos from the locker room, showing quiet moments with her husband after the injury. Her caption revealed how helpless and stunned she felt in the moment everything changed.

“Disbelief and stillness were all I felt as I yelled, get up, get up, over and over again,” Claire Kittle wrote. “He always gets up. He’s George — he can do all things. He just does it. It hurts. There’s no preparing for it.”

Claire Kittle Shares Heartfelt Message After George Kittle Injury

Claire Kittle's message did more than describe the injury itself. It showed the emotional weight carried by families who live every snap alongside the players. She called her husband “a unicorn in this world” and said she believes he will return “stronger and better than ever before.”

She also praised the mindset that has defined George Kittle throughout his career.

“The mind of a heartbroken athlete is a determined one,” she wrote, adding that he and the team remain “unf—withable.”

Claire Kittle made it clear that despite the pain, she still believes this season holds meaning for the 49ers.

“It’s a special year, you can feel that and we’re not done yet,” she added, before thanking fans for supporting George Kittle and helping carry some of the pain.

The 49ers star responded directly to his wife in the comments, keeping his reply short and full of love.

“You’re the best teammate for this journey ❤️,” he wrote.

George Kittle’s Achilles Injury

The injury happened when George Kittle made a six-yard catch with about six minutes left before halftime. After being tackled near the sideline, he was slow to get up and clearly in pain. Trainers quickly attended to him, and he was eventually carted off the field.

Despite losing one of their leaders early, the 49ers rallied to finish the game. Christian McCaffrey scored the go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter, sealing the win. Still, the locker room knew the moment was bittersweet.

The day after the game, George Kittle addressed the injury himself on Instagram.

“Football sucks sometimes. But I love it,” he wrote, sharing photos from the field and a moment of Claire kissing him in the locker room. He admitted feeling heartbroken but grateful for the support he received from teammates, fans and the organization.

He also noted that 49ers owner Jed York was the first person to meet him in the locker room, a moment that reminded him he is “in a special place.” George Kittle ended his message with optimism, writing, “I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet!”

For Claire Kittle, the injury was another reminder of how fragile the game can be, even for someone as strong and fearless as George Kittle.

As George Kittle prepares for surgery and recovery, the 49ers move forward in the playoffs with his presence still felt and with the unwavering support of the teammate who knows him best.

Hunter underwent surgery in November to repair his LCL, and the initial timeline for his return to football activities was six months. The two-way standout could be ready for OTAs in May if he remains on schedule.

Hunter sustained the non-contact injury in practice and landed on injured reserve on Oct. 31. While there was no initial indication that Hunter would miss the rest of the season, his surgery two weeks later marked the end of what was quickly becoming a strong rookie campaign.

""Very fair to say that his rehab process is going as expected,"" Gladstone said. ""He's hitting it hard. Obviously the joy that he brings to the everyday operation is still something that permeates throughout the space that he enters.""

When Hunter returns to full strength, the expectation is that he will reprise his role as a contributor at both wide receiver and cornerback. He played over 100 snaps at both spots as a rookie with slightly more time spent on offense.

Pete Prisco

That positional flexibility could evolve throughout Hunter's career. Gladstone hinted at an expanded role on defense in 2026 given the state of the Jaguars' roster on the heels of an AFC South title and first-round playoff exit.

""We still expect him to play on both sides of the ball,"" Gladstone said. ""Obviously you can take a peek at expiring contracts on our roster and which side of the ball has more. Obviously at this point walking into the offseason, corner is a position that we have a few guys who are on expiring contracts. So by default, you can expect there to be a higher emphasis on his placement.""

The Jaguars made an effort to involve Hunter in the offense to a greater extent in the weeks leading up to his injury, and it resulted in an uptick in production. His final game of the year was his most stellar outing to date, as he racked up a season-high 14 targets and turned them into eight receptions for 101 yards and his first touchdown.

For the season, Hunter posted 28 catches, 298 yards and a touchdown on offense with 15 tackles and three passes defended on defense.

""The steps that he was taking by the midpoint of the season really made us feel good about what the back half of the year was going to be on both sides of the ball and what that impact was going to look like, being a featured point on offense and an impact player on defense,"" Gladstone said. ""It was just disappointing timing, but nonetheless feel good about where we are heading into this offseason and what next year should hold.""",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/14/de70548d-d3cd-4502-ba06-21e00342593b/thumbnail/1200x675/52c80d4239f011fd4d333937589dc04c/gettyimages-2241245544-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 13:01:01.821046

He amassed 26 punt returns this past season for 291 yards, including a 54-yarder and an 11.2 average per punt return.","Position Group: Wide Receivers

Players: Mike Evans, Chris Godwin Jr., Emeka Egbuka, Jalen McMillan, Sterling Shepard, Kameron Johnson, Tez Johnson, Garrett Greene (practice squad), Dennis Houston (practice squad)

2025 Evaluation: Future Hall of Famer Mike Evans missed six games due to a broken collarbone and was placed on injured reserve on October 22. He had missed three games earlier in the year with a hamstring injury and had appeared in four contests prior to the second sustained ailment. Evans returned for the Week 15 Thursday Night Football matchup with the Atlanta Falcons and quickly returned to peak form, finishing the 2025 campaign with 30 catches for 368 yards and three scores. He is the Bucs' all-time leader in nearly every receiving metric, and in 2025 he led the Bucs with 74 receptions for 1,004 yards and 11 touchdowns, tying Jerry Rice's record by eclipsing the 1,000-yard marker for the 11th consecutive season. Evans played 357 offensive snaps in 2025 and is the club's Bona fide deep threat. The A&M product consistently commands double teams and is nearly unstoppable at executing back-shoulder catches off the fade or winning on go routes. He uses his length to climb the ladder with ease and has a feel for coverage, utilizing trademark routes to set up opportunities – baiting cornerbacks by appearing to work outside for the fade then cutting inside for the slant in the red zone. He has the ability to power through the jam and once again stunned with captivating play in 2025 when he was on the field.

Chris Godwin Jr. missed five games in 2025 due to a fibula injury and played 428 snaps. Two games into his return from the significant ankle injury he suffered last November, Godwin sustained the aforementioned leg injury in Week Five at Seattle. He was leading all NFL players in receptions at the time of his injury in 2024 and had already scored five touchdowns in seven games. This past season, Godwin resumed his role in the slot and showcased his physicality at the catch point and willingness as a crack blocker to spur rushers. Godwin makes contested catches look routine and plays with a fiery demeanor. The RAC threat helped bolster the Bucs' aerial attack when on the field to move the chains.

Emeka Egbuka became an integral cog in the Bucs' 3-1 start, emerging as the team's leading receiver during a month in which Evans, Godwin and Jalen McMillan missed time. He concluded the month of September with 18 receptions for 282 yards (15.7 average) and four touchdowns, including a game-winner with 59 seconds left in the team's Week One victory over the Falcons. Egbuka became just the second player since the 1970 merger to record a game-winning touchdown reception in the final minute of regulation in his first career game. In Weeks One-Four, Egbuka was one of four NFC wide receivers, and the only rookie, with 75-plus yards from scrimmage in three-or-more games in September alongside Justin Jefferson, Puka Nacua and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Per NextGen Stats, Egbuka led all rookies and ranked second behind only Amon-Ra St. Brown in passer rating when targeted (128.0) among all players with 25-or-more targets in 2025, while also leading his class in receiving EPA with 11.2. Since 2000, Egbuka is one of four players with 15-plus receptions, 250-plus receiving yards and four-plus touchdown receptions through four career games joining Ja'Marr Chase, Calvin Ridely and Roy Williams. He played the most snaps of any Bucs receiver this past season at 886 and lined up at all three receiver spots along the formation. His production hit a lull in the latter half of the year due to a variety of factors, but overall, Egbuka showed the route-running acumen and detailed subtleties that made him a first-round selection out of Ohio State.

Jalen McMillan suffered a serious neck injury in a preseason contest with the Steelers that landed him on injured reserve and kept him in a constrictive brace for several months. He made his highly-anticipated return against the Falcons in Week 15 and quickly made his presence felt between the hashes. McMillan played 138 snaps in 2025, including his first 100-yard receiving game against the Dolphins. He hauled in seven catches for 114 yards, including a 33-yarder off a Baker Mayfield pump fake in the clash. McMillan, a long-strider, has an innate feel for how to generate separation mid-route with leverage and fakes. He plays with effective acceleration and elite body control and can manipulate defensive backs with an expansive release package. McMillan has impressive control of speed on routes, with the capability of making sudden stops.

Both Sterling Shepard and Tez Johnson recorded 495 snaps in 2025 and helped boost the receiver room, particularly when it was thinned by injuries. Shepard played with a competitive disposition, reliable hands and quick cuts. The smooth route runner can hit the gas pedal out of his breaks and once again created a rapport with his former Oklahoma Sooners' teammate, Mayfield. Johnson, the Bucs' seventh-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft out of Oregon, displayed his explosiveness and prowess before and after the catch. He is hard to bring down by open-field pursuit and is adept off screens, jet sweeps, verticals and short-to-intermediate routes with speed to blow past defenders.

Kameron Johnson tallied 105 snaps in 2025 but made most of his impact on special teams as a kick/punt returner. In Tampa Bay's season-opener against the Atlanta Falcons, Johnson sparked a pivotal go-ahead, second-half touchdown drive with a 54-yard punt return in the third quarter. It marked the Buccaneers' longest punt return since Bobby Rainey took one 58 yards on Oct. 11, 2015 vs. Jacksonville. In addition to his contributions as a returner, Johnson also served as a gunner on Tampa Bay's punt team, which ranked seventh in the NFL, and third in the NFC, in Week One in net yards per punt (44.0). Johnson was responsible for one of two punts downed inside the 20-yard line by the Buccaneers in that game – tied for the second-most among any NFL team in Week One. Since joining the Bucs as an undrafted free agent out of Barton College in 2024, Johnson has solidified Tampa Bay's return game. In 2025, Johnson averaged 25.4 yards per kick return and totaled 685 yards on 27 kick returns, with his longest being a 44-yarder. He amassed 26 punt returns this past season for 291 yards, including a 54-yarder and an 11.2 average per punt return.

2026 Outlook: Mike Evans and Sterling Shepard are impending unrestricted free agents in March and the Buccaneers will have some decisions to make regarding the room. Evans will take time to reflect and make his resolution regarding the future, similar to that of teammate, Lavonte David.

""We both had long talks today, individually, separately, and we had our private conversations,"" said Head Coach Todd Bowles on discussions with Evans and David following the conclusion of the season. ""I think they've earned that right to make that decision when the time comes. They're both [the] heart and souls [of] the Buccaneers and it's just a matter of once they get over the pain and the wound and see how they feel and think clearly, then we'll kind of go from there. But, we've allowed them to make that decision so we'll wait and see.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/cjjpzmblnnrgxvzfyudj,N,,2026-01-14 16:02:08.295294

With a short week ahead and familiar opponent on deck, Shanahan addressed the injury report, workload management, and the unique challenges of facing a division rival for the second time in three weeks.

Here are the top takeaways from Shanahan as postseason preparation continued:

Injury Report, Warner and Kittle Updates

Shanahan opened with updates from Sunday's playoff victory, outlining the injury report as the team navigates a condensed week.

Linebacker Luke Gifford (quad) and safety Ji'Ayir Brown (hamstring) did not practice for the team's first workout of the week. Offensive lineman Dominick Puni (ankle), defensive lineman Keion White (groin/hamstring), wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee), defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (knee), linebacker Dee Winters (ankle), and tackle Trent Williams (hamstring/veteran day) were all listed as limited.

Shanahan added that linebacker Nick Martin remains in protocol and will not be activated yet, while linebacker Fred Warner's practice window has officially opened.

""We're opening his window so he can do some stuff,"" Shanahan said. ""But again, we're not doing much, so he'll walk-through out there with us today and things like that. But, hoping he can be ready for next week.""

Also, Shanahan announced that tight end George Kittle will undergo season-ending surgery Wednesday. The surgery comes three days after tearing his right Achilles tendon in the second quarter of the Wild Card contest.

Managing a Short Week

With the Divisional Round matchup set for Saturday night in Seattle, Shanahan said the coaching staff adjusted the team's schedule to prioritize recovery.

The 49ers shortened Tuesday's workday to roughly three-and-a-half hours, holding only walk-throughs and avoiding any full-speed reps.

""We usually bring them in for about seven hours today. They're only in for about three-and-a-half. We'll do all walk-through, nothing full speed. We won't go against each other at all. And then we'll see how it goes.""

Shanahan noted the approach differs from Week 18, when San Francisco played its third game in 13 days.

""That week we didn't do one thing full speed,"" Shanahan said. ""We'll see how guys feel and decide what we want to do tomorrow.""

Familiar Foe Means Simplified Preparation

Facing the Seahawks for the second time in two weeks presents a unique postseason challenge, but Shanahan shared that familiarity works both ways.

""We know each other very well. We've played against each other a ton. The schemes even the last time we played didn't change much on both sides as opposed to Week 1. So, I think both teams got an idea of exactly what to expect.""

While wrinkles and situational adjustments remain, Shanahan said the postseason naturally simplifies preparation.

""You definitely can't overthink it,"" Shanahan said. ""Playoffs as a whole are kind of that way too.""

Confidence in Next-Man-Up Performances

Shanahan praised several defenders who stepped into expanded roles against Philadelphia, including linebackers Garret Wallow and Eric Kendricks and safety Marques Sigle.

Wallow led the team with 11 tackles in his first career postseason start, while Kendricks added 10 tackles and Keion White recorded the first postseason sack of his career.

""Sigle showed us early in the year, and we see him at practice every day. We never knew when his (opportunity) would come and right when Tig (S JiAyir Brown) went down, he was ready and he did play as good as it felt live. Kendricks was another story, just coming off the street, being at home.

""All those guys played at such a high level, and that's what we need. We've had a lot of guys injured, so guys have to come in and step it up.""

Shanahan said their performances provided confidence heading into another physical playoff matchup.

Building Drives

Looking back at the Wild Card win, Shanahan emphasized the importance of sustaining drives, particularly when the opposing offense controls time of possession.

""When another team holds the ball for a while… you have to be on point. Whether that's doing better on first and second down so you avoid as many third downs as we did. But, if you don't do that, you've got to do good on third down.""

Shanahan credited quarterback Brock Purdy's ability to layer throws, pointing to the 45-yard completion down the middle of the field to wide receiver Jauan Jennings.

""I'm not going to say anyone's better than Brock at it. That's probably one of Brock's best things. He can really drop it in a bucket. The guys can be deep and if there's a way to get it over that guy and bring it down before you sail it over a receiver, he's going to do that and he doesn't miss it very much.""

The team got an injury scare after Sunday’s 27-24 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars when star quarterback Josh Allen was seen limping around the locker room.

However, it seems the Bills and Allen avoided a worst-case scenario. Though he’s “sore,” Allen, the reigning MVP doesn’t seem to be in jeopardy of missing Saturday’s matchup against the top-seeded Denver Broncos.

But unfortunately for Buffalo, it will be without a few key offensive contributors as the team got some bad injury news on Monday, and followed it up with even more crushing injury news on Tuesday.

Bills’ WR Corps Takes Another Hit

The team announced on Monday that wide receiver Gabe Davis had torn his ACL, knocking him out for the rest of the postseason.

Davis, 26, caught 2 passes on 3 targets for 14 yards before exiting the wild-card matchup in the first half.

If that weren’t bad enough, head coach Sean McDermott announced 24 hours later that fellow wide receiver Tyrell Shavers had also torn his ACL and would also miss the rest of the playoffs.

Remarkably, Shavers suffered the injury on a punt return in the second quarter and came back out and finished the game. He didn’t know the severity of his injury until after he was evaluated following the game.

“[Shavers] embodies what we’re all about,” McDermott told reporters. “… For him to then come back into the game, and then for it to turn out to be what it was is remarkable. Remarkable toughness, remarkable commitment to the team.”

With Davis and Shavers both out, and Joshua Palmer on injured reserve, the Bills wide receiver room has taken blow after blow over the last few weeks.

Buffalo heads into Saturday’s matchup against the Broncos with Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks, and Keon Coleman plus a few practice squad options in Mecole Hardman, Stephen Gosnell, and Kristian Wilkerson.

“Another guy’s got to step up,” McDermott added. “That’s point-blank what it means. And I don’t mean to be short. It’s just right now, it’s full confidence in the guys in that room, and we brought back Kristian Wilkerson, and he’ll be a good addition back to us on the practice squad, and we go from there.”

There is Some Positive Injury News

While the Bills are down three wide receivers, they could be getting some reinforcements in that department.

Receiver Curtis Samuel practiced with the team on Monday. The 29-year-old hasn’t played since Nov. 16 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His return could be a big boost for a banged-up Bills wide receiver corps.

In addition to Samuel, Buffalo could also get a boost on defense as well.

Star defensive tackle Ed Oliver also returned to practice on Monday. He missed 14 games after tearing his pectoral against the Carolina Panthers back on Oct. 26.

Before his injury, Oliver was a force on the defensive line. He recorded 12 tackles, 11 pressures, 6 hurries, 5 run stuffs, 3 sacks, 2 QB hits, and a forced fumble, according to Pro Football Focus.

Oliver also finished tied for the third-most tackles for loss (7) on the team despite playing in less than 1/4 of the season.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2166481231.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-14 13:01:06.153877

Follow along with Yahoo Sports for the latest NFL news and injury updates ahead of the divisional round.","Wild-card weekend is officially a wrap, with the Houston Texans steamrolling the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday night.

The shocking loss, in which the NFL’s most expensive defense forced three turnovers against Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud but ultimately fell by a 24-point margin, preceded the announcement that Mike Tomlin would be stepping down as Pittsburgh’s head coach after 19 seasons. The team made it official with a statement from team president Art Rooney II on Tuesday afternoon.

In addition to plenty of shakeups in the league’s coaching carousel — currently sitting with nine head coaching vacancies — it was a record-setting wild-card round. This round marked the first time in NFL history that four-plus games were decided by four or fewer points in a single postseason round, per Opta Stats; it’s also the first time there have been six-plus fourth-quarter lead changes in a single playoff round in NFL history, Dante Koplowitz-Fleming of NFL research noted.

The Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers opened things up with a surprising thriller; after LA entered the week as historic road favorites, its 34-31 win over Carolina came down to the wire as MVP favorite Matthew Stafford threw a 19-yard, go-ahead touchdown to tight end Colby Parkinson in the final minute of the game. The Panthers got bad news on top of the loss, as starting left tackle Ikem Ekwonu reportedly suffered a ruptured patellar tendon, which could affect his availability next season.

That was followed by another Saturday thriller, as Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears mounted yet another comeback win — this time, over their NFC North rival, the Green Bay Packers — to advance to the divisional round. The Packers were off to a 21-3 lead in the first half before the Bears dropped 25 points in the fourth quarter to take the win.

On Sunday, the magic continued with the Josh Allen-led Buffalo Bills defeating Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars, ending Liam Coen’s Cinderella-esque first season as a head coach. After Allen managed a rushing touchdown after the two-minute warning (right after the best tush push ever, perhaps?), a perfectly timed interception from Bills safety Cole Bishop put Allen in position to kneel it out and snag the team’s first road playoff win in 33 years.

The San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles followed that up with another game that came down to the wire, as the Niners dethroned Philly with a late fourth-quarter touchdown drive (and some trickery from wideout Jauan Jennings). Despite the thrilling win, the Niners will have to deal with yet another brutal blow on the injury front, as All-Pro tight end George Kittle suffered a torn Achilles injury, ending his season.

Despite holding Drake Maye to just one touchdown, the Los Angeles Chargers couldn’t muster up enough offense to take down the New England Patriots. Los Angeles failed to score a touchdown during the contest, losing 16-3 and inviting questions over whether the Chargers’ coaching staff needs to be shaken up over the offseason.

The NFL just wrapped up what might be the craziest playoff week we’ve witnessed in quite some time. The 2025 NFL Wild Card round was a treat to watch for fans, as nearly all of the games went down to the wire. It was an awesome week for football fans. However, the injury bug does not take time off, and it took some important people down last week.

49ers tight end George Kittle – torn Achilles tendon

Perhaps the most notable player to get injured last week is San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle. Against the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round, Kittle came down with what seemed to be a lower leg injury after making a catch early in the game. The replays showed a worrying sight: a ripple through his calf, usually indicative of a torn Achilles tendon.

The tests unfortunately confirmed that Kittle suffered a torn Achilles tendon. As a result, Kittle will miss the rest of the 49ers’ playoff run, as well as a good part of the 2026 season. It’s a brutal injury to one of the best players in the NFL at his position.

Texans wide receiver Nico Collins – concussion

Another key player to get injured this week is Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins. The star wide receiver was slow to get up after attempting to catch a pass during their game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins hit his head on the ground pretty hard during the play, leading to him getting ruled out of the game with a head injury.

It was later announced that Collins had entered the concussion protocol after suffering the head injury. His status for the Texans’ Divisional Round game remains uncertain, as it will depend on the wide receiver’s status throughout the week. Should Collins miss the game, it will another blow to a Texans offense that’s already struggled even with the star wide receiver.

Bills wide receivers Tyrell Shaverss, Gabriel Davis – torn ACL

The Bills suffered two massive blows to their already thin wide receiver room. Gabriel Davis, a late-season pickup by the Bills, exited the game with a lower leg injury and never returned. Sophomore wide receiver Tyrell Shavers also suffered a lower body injury in the first half, but he was able to finish the game.

Afterwards, it was announced that both Davis and Shavers suffered torn ACLs during their game against the Jaguars. It’s impressive that Shavers was able to play through a torn ACL, but the injury still is a big hit to the Buffalo offense. The good news for them is that WR Curtis Samuel might be returning soon, but losing two core wide receivers in the same game is a tough pill to swallow.

Bears linebacker TJ Edwards – fractured fibula

The Bears’ already depleted defense lost another man on Sunday night. Linebacker TJ Edwards came down hard after trying to make a play. Edwards was carted off the field, never returning to the game. Chicago has already placed the injured linebacker on IR due to a fractured fibula, ending Edwards’ season.

Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzales – concussion

One of the cornerstones of the New England Patriots’ stout defense might miss their upcoming game against the Texans. Pro Bowl cornerback Christian Gonzales suffered a head injury against the Los Angeles Chargers and did not return to the game. Gonzales is now on the concussion protocol, leaving his status against the Texans in doubt.

Other notable injuries this week were Bills QB Josh Allen (listed with foot, finger, and knee injuries this week), Rams QB Matthew Stafford (finger) andBears left tackle Ozzy Trapilo (torn patellar tendon).

Shawn Smith is the referee, who is in his 11th season and 8th as referee. This is Smith’s 10th postseason assignment, including 5 Wild Card Playoffs, 3 Divisional Playoffs and 2 Conference Championships.

Since becoming a referee in 2018, Smith has called eight New England games. They are 4-4 in those contests, with the most recent of them being a 33-15 win over the New York Giants in Week 13. That day, the Patriots were flagged four times in front of their home crowd, with the three penalties that were accepted costing them 30 yards of field position. The Giants were penalized on five occasions losing 30 yards as well on four accepted calls.

Overall in 2025, Smith has officiated 16 games with 194 accepted penalties among 229 total flags thrown. His most-called infractions this season are false start (34+0), offensive holding (29+5) and defensive pass interference (20+3).

Bland played 12 games for the Cowboys in 2025 before being placed on injured reserve for the final three games of the year. He also missed Weeks 2 and 3 of the season with a right foot injury that he suffered in practice.

The newest surgery marks the second straight year that Bland has had a procedure done on his left foot. In training camp leading into the 2024 season, Bland suffered a fracture in his left foot, which led to the first surgery. He would go on to return and play seven games that season for Dallas.

Evidently, back-to-back seasons ending in surgery on the same foot is not what Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones or anyone wanted for Bland.

""I'm not a doctor... but I don't like that at all,"" Jones said. ""I don't like the sound of that. You have to watch feet, relative to the future.""

In August, the Cowboys signed Bland to a four-year, $92 million extension, two years removed from an All-Pro season where Bland set the NFL record for most pick-sixes in a season with five in 2023.

Despite two straight years of disappointing injury circumstances cutting Bland's seasons short, Jones and the Cowboys do not regret signing Bland to his extension that keeps him in Dallas long term.

""He has been everything you could ask for relative to his rehab, relative to his competes,"" Jones said in December. ""He's done the best that he's had to work with as it turns out with his injury. He's thumb's up.""

Now, the hope is that Bland is able to recover over the course of the offseason and get rid of the nagging foot issues with a full offseason ahead before he retakes the field for the Cowboys in 2026.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/uplznkoh3qo1my3qowjv,N,,2026-01-14 14:03:39.990635

""Lamont has been empowering kids through flag football for over two decades,"" Silva said.
""He has been a tremendous partner to the Bears helping us start high school girls flag football in the Rockford area in 2022 and launch a middle school girls flag football league in 2025.
We are so grateful to Commissioner Goodell for recognizing Lamont.""
His work in spreading the sport across northern Illinois helped girls flag football become sanctioned by the Illinois High School Association in 2024.","The longtime Rockford Park District general manager, who has dedicated much of the last 20 years to providing access to flag football for both boys and girls, stood along the Bears sideline before Saturday's wild card game against the Packers, where he met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

Jones was not only attending the game to cheer on his hometown team, but also to watch two 14U boys flag football teams and two middle school girls flag football teams, all from the Rockford area, that would be competing during halftime later that evening.

While Jones thought his longtime friend, Bears director of football development Gustavo Silva, was simply connecting him with Goodell, he and the Commissioner had an alternative plan. After speaking with Jones about the power of the work he's done for years, Goodell surprised him with two tickets to Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, Calif.

""We always want to honor our fans, but Lamont is much more than a fan,"" Goodell said. ""He's making a difference in our communities, and what he's doing in flag football by giving kids that opportunity to play and giving them a future is incredible. We're proud to honor him.""

""I can't even fathom it,"" Jones said, ""and I don't even know if I'm gonna call my wife until I get back on the bus, but, I was already planning for the Super Bowl, 'Are we gonna have some friends over? Let's watch the game on TV,' and things like that. But now we're actually gonna be going to the Super Bowl. And the only thing that can make this even more special is if my favorite team can go along with me.""

Having worked with NFL Flag since 2003, Jones and the Bears have been connected for decades. The team recently donated turf from the Walter Payton Center as part of the $7.6 million construction upgrade of Rockford's Clarence Hicks Sports Complex.

""Lamont has been empowering kids through flag football for over two decades,"" Silva said. ""He has been a tremendous partner to the Bears helping us start high school girls flag football in the Rockford area in 2022 and launch a middle school girls flag football league in 2025. I can't think of a more deserving recipient. We are so grateful to Commissioner Goodell for recognizing Lamont.""

While the Bears first launched the high school girls flag football program in 2022 with Chicago Public Schools, Rockford was the second league created, thanks to Jones' support. His work in spreading the sport across northern Illinois helped girls flag football become sanctioned by the Illinois High School Association in 2024.

For leaders like Goodell, watching flag football grow across Illinois and the world, especially ahead of the sport's debut in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, is always rewarding, especially given the league's dedication to providing access to football at all levels.

""It's fantastic,"" Goodell said. ""I think for young boys and girls to be able to play our game and participate in an Olympic sport, I just think it's a great opportunity for all of them. It's awesome to see.""

Between seeing those kids soak up the moment of playing on the same field as the Bears at a playoff game, receiving such a special honor from the NFL Commissioner and of course, watching his favorite team mount the biggest postseason comeback in franchise history, Saturday night felt like a dream to Jones.

""I've been involved and had a relationship with Chicago Bears for over 24 years now, and I never wanted anything back in return other than support for my kids,"" Jones said. ""And as you can see, we have 45 of them here today.

""It's creating a memory for them that keeps me going. So what I've done over these last 24 years would not be possible without the relationships that I've had with the Chicago Bears, and it's just been a ride that I'm not ready to get off of yet.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bears/clfuf3pw6bsdz5qncn8p,N,,2026-01-14 14:03:46.912131

One of the youngest rosters in the league is poised to get even younger.

What can't be overlooked is how important the seven players taken in the first draft overseen by GM Darren Mougey and HC Aaron Glenn were to the team in the 2025 season. Though several had to deal with injuries (TE Mason Taylor, CB Azareye'h Thomas, LB Kiko Mauigoa and DL Tyler Baron) young men like S Malachi Moore and RT Armand Membou played -- and played well -- in all 17 games.

Moore Grabbing an Opportunity and Holding On

When opportunity knocked during his rookie season with the Jets, S Malachi Moore opened the door to what has the making of a long and productive career in the NFL.

Moore (5-11, 197) was the second of the Jets' two fourth-round selections in the 2025 NFL Draft after GM Darren Mougey completed a trade, swapping a fifth- and a sixth-round pick with the Eagles to move up 15 spots for the four-year starter and two-time captain at Alabama.

He got his first start of the season at Tampa Bay in Week 3 and then saw time at slot corner, his original position with the Crimson Tide before former coach Nick Saban suggested he move to safety. He got a chance to show his promise at safety when Andre Cisco (torn pectoral), who signed with the Green & White, sustained a season-ending injury in Week 8 at Cincinnati -- the team's first win of the Aaron Glenn era. Moore teamed with Tony Adams until Adams sustained a groin injury in Week 15 that ended his season. Moore stepped in at safety and never left the rest of the season.

""I feel like that's the best way to learn is to get thrown into the fire, because nothing is like a real game,"" Moore told team reporter Caroline Hendershot. ""And so when you finally get out there, I feel like the more reps I got, the more comfortable I became out there and just being comfortable with myself around the teammates on the field we were playing. I just think with more reps comes more experience and more confidence.""

Moore led all rookie defensive backs with 95 total tackles, 3 TFL, a forced fumble and 3 PDs. In the process he became the first Jets rookie DB with 90-plus tackles in a season in the last 20 years. Moore earned praise and guidance from a guy who wasn't a bad DB himself -- Glenn.

""AG, I love him,"" Moore said. ""I love playing for him, he's tough on all of us, but that's because he expects a lot out of us. You don't want anything else from a player. AG, he looks at us and he sees what we could be down in the future and not where we are right now. So that's how he coaches us. And you have nothing but respect and I've had fun playing for Coach AG. He brings energy to the program, to this organization. He wants us to play an old school style of football, fast, physical and violent, and that's what we try to do this year. And next year we'll try to do the same thing.""

Mauigoa Always in the Moment

Though he won't be suiting up for Miami in the National Championship game on Jan. 19, LB Francisco (Kiko) Mauigoa played a critical role for the Hurricanes during his two seasons there. After being taken in Round 5 last year, Mauigoa played well in 12 games before sustaining a season-ending neck injury against the Miami Dolphins in Week 14.

""The biggest takeaway from this year is just being able to enjoy every single moment, not taking any moment for granted,"" Mauigoa (6-2, 233) said. ""Because although I didn't finish the way I wanted to finish, they go out like that, just like that. So I'm taking every single moment in and soaking all the information in so that I'll be ready for Year 2. So I feel like that's the biggest thing is being able to learn from the vets, the guys that have been here and just be able to take it step by step and prepare for what's ahead.""

Over those 12 games, he was credited with 45 total tackles while taking 43% of the snaps on defense and contributing on special teams taking 60% of the snaps. He's bullish on his fellow draftees from last year and sees good things ahead.

""It's why they bought us here, right?"" he said. ""You got fresh bodies from college and guys that are here to make an impact. And I feel like every single one of us came in with the mindset that we're going to be able to contribute to this team and be able to make an impact.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/ygervpbtibacgdggqvb8,N,,2026-01-14 12:03:00.577901

Beal, who played for the New York Giants, was last seen near Virginia Beach in Virginia on July 12, 2025. He was 28 years old at the time he was reported missing but would now be 29.

According to details provided by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, which is a federal system for tracking people who have disappeared in the U.S., Beal's girlfriend was the last person to see him.

Beal's girlfriend reported that he borrowed her car and was supposed to head to work. Instead, she got a call from him a day later, with Beal reportedly saying that he was in Virginia Beach, but was headed home.

""Samuel has not been heard from or seen since the phone call,"" the NMUPS alert for him said.

Federal officials said they don't believe he brought anything with him to Virginia Beach other than the clothes he was wearing, some extra shoes and a wallet containing his credit card and driver's license.

When the vehicle was recovered in Virginia Beach by one of the girlfriend's family members, officials say, the family member found Beal's shoes and socks on the floor of the car along with some sand.

Virginia Beach is an oceanfront city in Virginia just north of the North Carolina border. It's unclear how far Beal drove to get to Virginia Beach, or how far it was from his work.

Beal's sister, Essence Zhane, shared a post on Facebook on Jan. 12 that included additional details about the case, urging anybody with info about the NFL player's disappearance to come forward.

In her post, Zhane included photos of a paid parking ticket for a beachfront lot in Virginia Beach with a timestamp from just before 6 p.m. on July 13.

""Tomorrow makes it 7 months since we’ve last heard from or seen my brother,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""We’ve done everything we could on our end to piece things together and at this point we’re in desperate need of support on all ends.""

Beal was selected by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2018 supplemental draft, and appeared in six games as a cornerback for the team.

His career with the NFL was cut short in the 2020 season when he opted out of playing because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to court documents, Beal was arrested in July 2020 during a traffic stop in Ohio, where he was charged with improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of marijuana. He was indicted a month later on the two weapons charges and initially entered a plea of not guilty. Beal eventually changed his plea to guilty in June 2021 and was placed on probation for a year.

Davis met with his doctor on Tuesday to be evaluated for the ligament damage he suffered late in Thursday’s game against the Utah Jazz when his left hand got scrunched up against Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen’s body while defending a drive to the basket. Davis had his left arm wrapped in a sling Saturday when the Mavericks faced the Chicago Bulls in the final game of their road trip.

Earlier Tuesday, Davis pushed back on reports that he had played his final game this regular season. On the social media platform X, Davis wrote “Lies!” in response to a since-deleted message stating he was set to undergo season-ending surgery on his left hand.

ESPN reported earlier Tuesday that Davis was “likely to undergo surgery to repair ligament damage in his left hand and miss several months.”

On Monday, Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said Davis would be meeting with a hand specialist this week, and that it was too early to know if Davis would need surgery.

“I think that’s sometime this week that he’ll talk to the doctors, but there is no schedule or timetable on when he’s going to make that announcement,” Kidd said.

The Athletic reported Friday that Davis was expected to miss several weeks, even if he didn’t need surgery. In the weeks before he went down with his latest injury, the Mavericks were exploring his trade market. The Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors were two of the teams that registered interest, multiple league sources told The Athletic.

The Mavericks acquired Davis in a trade for Luka Dončić in February, but injuries have marred Davis’ time in Dallas. He suffered a left adductor strain in his first game with the Mavericks in February and missed close to six weeks. He was then sidelined for 14 consecutive games this season with a left calf strain.

The Mavericks have a 10-10 record when Davis plays this season and are 5-15 when he sits. In his 11-month Dallas tenure, Davis has played in 31 games and missed 44.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/13130919/USATSI_27964831-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-14 12:03:08.967304

First-round edge rusher Mike Green had 3.5 sacks, and undrafted cornerback Keyon Martin had 23 combined tackles and a sack.
Parrish became the regular slot cornerback and finished with 76 combined tackles, seven passes defensed, two picks and two sacks.","High expectations are placed on incoming NFL rookies to help change the franchise and fill holes. From the 2025 season's group, players like Emeka Egbuka, Carson Schwesinger and Tetairoa McMillan met those expectations. But it's not always that simple. Some rookies will get injured, not get enough playing time or struggle once they do get on the field.

Below, we're taking a look at all 32 rookie classes in the NFL and ranking the value of their contributions in 2025. We want to emphasize that this list is based only on how much production teams got out of their rookies in their first season -- it's not predictive. There might be great future contributions from rookies such as Travis Hunter(knee) and Cam Skattebo(ankle), but those players missed much of the 2025 campaign because of injury.

To rank the rookie classes, I started with Sports Info Solutions' total points metric. Based on game charting, total points takes every element of a play and uses that data to evaluate each player on a scale that allows us to compare between positions: How many points do we estimate that this player either earned for his offense or saved for his defense?Then I adjusted some teams up or down based on the importance of certain positions or how well players did in ESPN tracking metrics and the FTN Network DVOA ratings. (Postseason performance is not included.)

There's a significant gap this year between our top four teams and the rest of the league. Yet unlike in other recent seasons, this year's strongest rookie performances did not necessarily translate into immediate team turnarounds. Our top three teams had losing records.

1. New Orleans Saints

The Saints' rookie class is headlined by second-round quarterback Tyler Shough, who ranked 21st with a 49.2 QBR in nine starts. That's not quite ""the Saints are set for years"" territory, but Shough has certainly earned the right to come back and try to improve as the starter. (Just remember that he's already 26 years old.)

Shough's blind side was protected by first-round left tackle Kelvin Banks Jr.,who started all 17 games. He ranked above average in run block win rate (75.6%), although he was below average in pass block win rate (87.7%).

Then we go to the defensive side of the ball, where the Saints improved to a surprising 13th in defensive DVOA this season. In Ben Solak's All-Rookie team, he highlighted third-round pick Jonas Sanker as a premier communicator and coverage player who made plays from sideline to sideline. Fourth-rounderQuincy Riley, the team's third cornerback,was above average in my coverage DVOA metric and started five games. Another fourth-round pick, linebacker Danny Stutsman, didn't start any games but had 53 combined tackles. Next season, the Saints will also get back third-round defensive tackle Vernon Broughton, who suffered a season-ending hip injury in Week 2.

2. Cleveland Browns

Usually, the teams that lead in total points by rookies are going to be led by a quarterback. That's not the case here. Rookie quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders both came out with negative total points and terrible QBRs (31.3 for Gabriel, 19.0 for Sanders). Those would have been the bottom two ratings in the league if Gabriel and Sanders had enough pass attempts to qualify.

The star in Cleveland was a linebacker. Second-round pickCarson Schwesingeris the clear favorite for Defensive Rookie of the Year and was second in total points among all rookies. Schwesinger's 156 combined tackles led all rookies by more than 50. He was joined on the defense by first-round defensive tackle Mason Graham, who started the entire season and improved significantly in November and December. Undrafted defensive tackle Adin Huntington also made an impact.

Meanwhile, the offensive skill positions for the Browns were filled with rookies. Tight end Harold Fannin Jr. was probably the best, with 72 receptions for 731 yards and six touchdowns. The Browns also had wide receiver Isaiah Bond and running backs Quinshon Judkins and Dylan Sampson.

3. New York Giants

The Giants' rookie class was about quality rather than quantity. First-round quarterback Jaxson Dart led all rookies in total points and ranked 18th with a 57.8 QBR, thanks partly to the value of his run plays. No. 3 pick Abdul Carter had only four sacks, but his 56 pressures led all rookie edge rushers. Third-round defensive tackle Darius Alexander had 3.5 sacks as a rotational lineman. And fourth-round running backCam Skatteboenergized the team in five starts, with 410 rushing yards, 207 receiving yards and seven touchdowns before an ankle injury ended his season.

Seventh-round cornerback Korie Black and fifth-round offensive tackle Marcus Mbow also started games but didn't perform particularly well.

4. New England Patriots

Let's start with the left side of the offensive line. The Patriots got 13 starts out of left tackle Will Campbell (first round) and left guard Jared Wilson (third round) before they were injured in the final few games of the season. Campbell was below average in pass block win rate (88.3%), and Wilson (93%) was close to average for guards. Both were below average in run block win rate. Nonetheless, Campbell and Wilson were significant upgrades at their positions for the Patriots.

New England's other rookie who got a lot of attention was second-round running back TreVeyon Henderson. He had 180 carries for 911 yards and nine touchdowns. Four of his carries were touchdowns of 50 or more yards. But the player that total points registers as the most valuable is fourth-round safety Craig Woodson. He started 15 games and made 79 combined tackles with three passes defensed and two fumble recoveries.

Other rookies included third-round wide receiver Kyle Williams, fourth-round tackle Joshua Farmer, sixth-round kickerAndy Borregalesand two undrafted free agents in edge rusher Elijah Ponder and wide receiver Efton Chism III.

5. Carolina Panthers

The Panthers were the only team other than the Saints to have five rookies with 10 or more total points. But there was one real star: wide receiverTetairoa McMillan, the favorite to win Offensive Rookie of the Year. He finished the season with 70 catches for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns.

The Panthers used their second- and third-round picks on edge rushers, Nic Scourtonand Princely Umanmielen. Scourton finished the season with 5.0 sacks, and Umanmielen had 1.5 sacks. Fourth-round safety Lathan Ransom was also an important part of the Carolina defense, starting six games with 51 combined tackles, plus an interception, a sack and a forced fumble.

Other top rookies on offense included fifth-round tight end Mitchell Evans, fourth-round running back Trevor Etienneand sixth-round wide receiver Jimmy Horn Jr. Undrafted kicker Ryan Fitzgeraldfinished 24-of-29 on field goals and ranked third in my gross kickoff values.

6. Atlanta Falcons

The headline for Atlanta's rookie class was itstrade upto be able to select bothJalon Walker andJames Pearce Jr. at edge rusher in Round 1. Pearce had 10.5 sacks and 30 pressures, and Walker had 5.5 sacks and 23 pressures. However, the most important Falcons rookie turned out to be third-round safety Xavier Watts, who had five interceptions and 55 combined tackles. Watts finished fourth among rookies in total points, as the leading safety in a very good season for rookies at the position.

Fourth-round safetyBilly Bowman Jr. was another impactful rookie, with one interception and 1.5 sacks in six games before anAchilles injury in late November. Atlanta's rookie class was top-heavy rather than deep, as no other rookies had much playing time.

7. Chicago Bears

Let's start on offense. First-round tight end Colston Loveland (58 catches for 713 yards and six touchdowns) and second-round wide receiver Luther Burden III (47 catches for 652 yards and two touchdowns) had big seasons. Another one of Chicago's impact second-round picks was left tackle Ozzy Trapilo, who started seven games after an injury to veteran Braxton Jones. Seventh-round running back Kyle Monangai far outplayed his draft position with 169 carries for 783 yards and five touchdowns. And undrafted wideoutJahdae Walker'scatchin Week 16against the Packers sent the game into overtime.

The Bears got less out of rookies on defense, however. The third second-round pick, defensive tackle Shemar Turner, played only five games as a reserve before a torn ACL ended his season, and fourth-round linebackerRuben Hyppolite IIplayed in only seven games.

8. Los Angeles Chargers

The Chargers' rookie impact came primarily from skill players on offense, led by fifth-round tight endOronde Gadsden. He ended the season with 49 catches for 664 yards and three touchdowns. First-round running backOmarion Hamptonmissed games because of a fractured ankle but ended up with 124 carries for 545 yards and four touchdowns in nine games. Second-round wide receiverTre' Harriswas less productive than expected but had 30 catches for 324 yards and a touchdown.

On defense, the most impactful rookie was sixth-round safetyRJ Mickens. He started five games and had 29 combined tackles with two interceptions as part of a three-safety package with Derwin James Jr. and Elijah Molden. Third-round defensive tackle Jamaree Caldwell had five starts and 31 combined tackles with a forced fumble.

Other impact players included undrafted cornerback Nikko Reed and fifth-round wide receiver KeAndre Lambert-Smith.

9. Baltimore Ravens

The Ravens' top rookies were almost entirely on defense. First-rounderMalaki Starks was a valuable rookie safety, starting 15 games with 84 combined tackles and two interceptions. Fourth-rounder Teddye Buchanan started 13 games at inside linebacker before tearing an ACL to end his season. He ended 2025 with 93 combined tackles. First-round edge rusher Mike Green had 3.5 sacks, and undrafted cornerback Keyon Martin had 23 combined tackles and a sack.

The one significant non-defensive contributor was sixth-round kicker Tyler Loop, who went 30-for-34 on field goals.

10. New York Jets

The Jets had yet another excellent rookie safety inMalachi Moore. He was a fourth-round selection but started 14 games and finished the season with 101 combined tackles. Third-round cornerback Azareye'h Thomas started five games with 22 combined tackles and seven passes defensed. The Jets also got value from fifth-round linebackerKiko Mauigoa.

On offense, the big name was Armand Membou. The seventh overall selection slid right into the right tackle spot and ranked ninth out of all tackles with a 79.1% run block win rate. Second-round tight end Mason Taylor had 44 catches for 369 yards and a touchdown. Fourth-round receiver Arian Smith played a little but had just 52 receiving yards. We can't really give the Jets credit for undrafted quarterback Brady Cook. He was forced to start four games because of injuries and had an 11.6 QBR.

11. Tennessee Titans

No. 1 pick Cam Ward was not good from a statistical perspective, with a 33.1 QBR. Ward took a league-high 55 sacks and completed less than 60% of his passes. These stats are a part of why the Titans are down here at No. 11 despite starting a rookie quarterback all season. However, most film watchers strongly believe that Ward played well despite those stats and was victimized by a poor supporting cast.

Of course, a lot of that supporting cast was also made up of rookies. Fourth-round wide receivers Elic Ayomanor and Chimere Dike had a combined 89 catches for 938 yards and eight touchdowns. Dike was also one of the top return men in the league with two punt return touchdowns. Tight end Gunnar Helm, taken in the fourth round between Dike and Ayomanor, had 44 catches for 357 yards and two touchdowns.

On defense, the top performer was third-round safety Kevin Winston Jr., who started six games with 34 combined tackles. Sixth-round cornerback Marcus Harrisstarted five games with 28 combined tackles and five passes defensed.

12. Dallas Cowboys

The Cowboys' first two picks were their top two rookies. Tyler Booker was above average among guards with a 93.1% pass block win rate and 75.1% run block win rate. Edge rusher Donovan Ezeiruaku had only two sacks but 23 pressures and 40 combined tackles.

At cornerback, Trikweze Bridges was actually a seventh-round pick of the Chargers, but the Cowboys picked him up after Los Angeles cut him, and he played 16 games with two starts, 23 combined tackles and an interception. Third-round pick Shavon Revel Jr. was injured for the first part of the season but came back to start five games with 35 combined tackles. And fifth-round linebacker Shemar James started six games and had 91 combined tackles, 1.5 sacks and a forced fumble.

13. Miami Dolphins

The Dolphins had a lot of rookie impact players who didn't necessarily have outstanding numbers. For example, first-round defensive tackle Kenneth Grant played in all 17 games but had just 33 combined tackles with two sacks. Left guard Jonah Savaiinaea, a second-round pick, started the entire season but finished near the bottom of the league with an 87.2% pass block win rate and a 65.8% run block win rate. Fifth-round safety Dante Trader Jr. had 54 combined tackles but just one pass defensed. Fifth-round cornerback Jason Marshall Jr. played in 12 games and had 23 combined tackles, four passes defensed and an interception.

At the bottom of the board, sixth-round running back Ollie Gordon II had 70 carries for 199 yards and three touchdowns. Seventh-round defensive tackle Zeek Biggers played nine games with 20 combined tackles and 1.5 sacks. And seventh-round quarterback Quinn Ewers eventually took over when Tua Tagovailoa was benched, starting three games with a 31.3 QBR.

14. Arizona Cardinals

The Cardinals' draft class was led by two cornerbacks. The real surprise was fifth-round pick Denzel Burke, who ranked 35th out of 98 qualifying corners in my coverage DVOA metric, starting eight games with 11 passes defensed and three interceptions. The success of second-round pick Will Johnson was more expected; he started 10 games with 10 passes defensed and was 57th in my cornerback coverage DVOA metric.

Fourth-round linebacker Cody Simon started nine games with 76 combined tackles, undrafted left tackle Josh Fryar started five games after Paris Johnson Jr. was injured, and seventh-round safety Kitan Crawford played 15 games with 20 combined tackles.

Arizona might have ranked higher if first-round defensive tackle Walter Nolen III had been able to play more than six games. He was actually the Cardinals' leader in total points, despite missing much of the season, and had two sacks, two passes defensed and a fumble recovery for a touchdown.

15. Buffalo Bills

Buffalo's rookie leader in total points was fourth-round defensive tackle Deone Walker. He started 16 games in the middle, with 39 combined tackles and a sack. Second-round defensive tackleT.J. Sandersstarted two games and had 16 combined tackles and a sack. The Bills also got help from two cornerbacks. First-rounder Maxwell Hairston missed the first month and a half of the season because of alateral collateral ligament sprain but came back to play 11 games with three starts. He had five passes defensed and two picks. Sixth-rounder Dorian Strong played four games in September with a major role before suffering a neck injury.

On offense, fifth-round pick Jackson Hawes had 16 catches for 187 yards and three touchdowns at tight end, while also providing outstanding blocking in the run game.

16. Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Let's start with first-round wide receiverEmeka Egbuka. His production slowed down in the second half of the season, but that's in part because Baker Mayfield was throwing him fewer catchable passes. For the entire season, Egbuka had 63 catches for 938 yards and six touchdowns. Fellow wide receiver Tez Johnson, a seventh-round pick, had 27 catches for 322 yards and five touchdowns.

Meanwhile at cornerback, the Bucs were getting production out of second-round pick Benjamin Morrison and third-round pick Jacob Parrish. Parrish became the regular slot cornerback and finished with 76 combined tackles, seven passes defensed, two picks and two sacks. Morrison played in 10 games and had 26 combined tackles with four passes defensed. The Bucs also got help from defensive linemen, fifth-rounder Elijah Roberts and the undrafted Elijah Simmons.

17. Denver Broncos

The top Broncos rookie was second-round running back RJ Harvey, who led all rookie backs in receiving value, according to my DYAR metrics. His standard stats included 146 carries for 540 yards and seven touchdowns, plus 47 catches for 356 yards and five touchdowns. Also on offense, third-round wide receiver Pat Bryant finished with 31 catches for 378 yards and a touchdown in 15 games.

On defense, the top rookie was first-round cornerback Jahdae Barron. He played in all 17 games, starting five, with 35 combined tackles, five passes defensed and one interception. Fourth-round edge rusher Que Robinson played in only six games, garnering 12 combined tackles with a half-sack.

Sixth-round punter Jeremy Crawshaw was around league average in gross punt value once adjusting for the altitude in Denver.

18. Philadelphia Eagles

Much of Philadelphia's impact came from two defensive players, first-round linebacker Jihaad Campbell and second-round safety Andrew Mukuba. Campbell played in all 17 games, with 10 starts, and had 80 combined tackles with an interception. Mukuba played 11 games, also starting 10, and had 46 combined tackles with two interceptions. Campbell and Mukuba each ranked among the top-13 defensive rookies in total points.

But there wasn't much after that. Fifth-round center Drew Kendallstarted one game and played in seven. Fourth-round defensive tackle Ty Robinson played in 11 games, and fifth-round linebackerSmael Mondon Jr. played in all 17, primarily on special teams, with 11 combined tackles.

19. Seattle Seahawks

First-rounderGrey Zabel started all 17 games at left guard. He led all guards with an 83.0% run block win rate when no other guard was above 80%, but he had a below-average pass block win rate of 89.9%. The other major addition for the Seahawks was second-round pick Nick Emmanwori. Nominally a safety, Emmanwori actually bounced between linebacker and slot cornerback. His ability to play the run allowed the Seahawks to constantly stay in nickel personnel, even on clear run downs. Emmanwori finished the season with 81 combined tackles, 11 passes defensed and 2.5 sacks.

None of the other Seattle rookies played more than 13 games. Tight end Elijah Arroyo, another second-round selection, finished the season with just 15 catches for 179 yards and a touchdown. Fifth-round wide receiver Tory Horton had 13 catches for 161 yards and a surprising five touchdowns in just eight games. Fifth-round fullback Robbie Ouzts was an important part of the run game but didn't catch a pass.

20. Houston Texans

Let's start with second-round left tackle Aireontae Ersery, who started most of the season. He had a low pass block win rate of 88.2% but was closer to average with a 73.6% run block win rate. At running back, Ersery was often blocking for fourth-round pick Woody Marks, who finished the regular season with 196 carries for 703 yards and two touchdowns (plus three receiving touchdowns). The Texans' offense also featured two rookie receivers from Iowa State:Jayden Higgins(41 catches for 525 yards and six touchdowns) andJaylin Noel(26 catches for 292 yards and two touchdowns).

On defense, the Texans got smaller contributions from sixth-round safety Jaylen Reed (seven games) and third-round cornerback Jaylin Smith (four games).

21. Kansas City Chiefs

First-round pick Josh Simmonsmanaged to start only eight games as the Chiefs' top rookie. He was above average with a 91.6% pass block win rate but below average with a 71.6% run block win rate. Undrafted Esa Pole started four games when Simmons was out late in the season with a wrist injury.

On defense, third-round cornerback Nohl Williams had five starts and 48 combined tackles with five passes defensed. Another cornerback, undrafted free agentKevin Knowles, pitched in on special teams and also had two passes defensed late in the season. Third-round edge rusher Ashton Gillotte had 38 combined tackles and 1.5 sacks. Second-round defensive tackle Omarr Norman-Lottplayed only five games before a torn ACL.

The Chiefs also had seventh-round running back Brashard Smith, who was particularly good as a receiver. He had 44 carries for 151 yards and 25 catches for 172 yards and a touchdown.

22. Detroit Lions

Second-rounderTate Ratledge started all 17 games at right guard, although he was below average in both pass block (87.4%) and run block (69.9%) win rates. First-round defensive tackle Tyleik Williams started 10 games and played in all 17, with 18 combined tackles and a sack. Third-round wide receiver Isaac TeSlaa had 16 catches for 239 yards, but six of those receptions were touchdowns, mostly of the highlight film variety.

The only other Lions draft picks to even play were fifth-round guard Miles Frazier (five games, no starts) and seventh-round receiver Dominic Lovett (12 games, mostly on special teams).

23. Cincinnati Bengals

The top Bengals rookie was second-round linebacker Demetrius Knight Jr. He had 14 starts and racked up 106 combined tackles with three sacks and two interceptions. Fourth-round linebacker Barrett Carter got 12 starts next to Knight and also had 106 combined tackles. Elsewhere on defense, first-round edge rusher Shemar Stewartplayed only eight games because of injuries and had just a single sack and eight pressures.

On offense, third-round left guard Dylan Fairchildstarted 15 games but was below average in both pass block (90.3%) and run block (70.2%) win rates. Across from Fairchild, fifth-round lineman Jalen Rivers started seven games at right guard in the middle of the season.

24. Indianapolis Colts

How much do you value one player on a list like this? The Colts got a fantastic showing from first-round tight end Tyler Warren, who had 76 catches for 817 yards and four touchdowns. He also scored a touchdown on the ground. But after Warren, there's a significant falloff in production from the Colts rookies, most of whom played limited seasons.

Quarterback Riley Leonard, a sixth-round pick, had a good game in his Week 17 start but didn't play much otherwise, as the Colts chose to sign veteran Philip Rivers because of worries about a knee sprain for Leonard. Fourth-round pick Jalen Travis started four games at right tackle. Second-round edge JT Tuimoloau played in 13 games but had just 17 combined tackles without a sack. Undrafted cornerback Johnathan Edwards started five games, and undrafted safety Reuben Lowery III started one.

25. Washington Commanders

Here's another team led by a rookie offensive tackle, this time first-round pick Josh Conerly Jr. He started all 17 games on the right side but was below average in both pass block (88.8%) and run block (71.2%) win rates. Seventh-round running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt took over as the Commanders' starter for much of the season and had 175 carries for 805 yards and eight touchdowns. Fourth-round wide receiver Jaylin Lane (16 catches for 225 yards) also made an impact.

On defense, the most impactful rookie was second-round cornerback Trey Amos, who played in 10 games and started eight before a broken leg ended his season.

26. Las Vegas Raiders

The Raiders finished the season with one of the 10 worst run offenses of the past 45 years, according to DVOA, but it wasn't running backAshton Jeanty's fault. The No. 6 pick was near the top of the league in missed tackle rate; there's only so far you can get without good blocking. Speaking of the blockers, third-round pick Caleb Rogers started six games at right guard, and another third-round pick, Charles Grant, started one at left tackle.

The Raiders had two rookie wide receivers, but they didn't get on the field too much until the last month of the year. Second-rounder Jack Bech finished with 20 catches for 224 yards, and fourth-rounderDont'e Thornton Jr.had 10 catches for 135 yards.

The Raiders got defensive contributions from undrafted free agent cornerbackGreedy Vance(who played six games at the end of the season) and two defensive tackles who each appeared in nine games, fourth-rounder Tonka Hemingway and seventh-rounder JJ Pegues.

27. San Francisco 49ers

The top rookiefor San Francisco was third-round nickel cornerback Upton Stout. He was, shall we say, stout against the run but came out near the bottom of the league in my coverage DVOA metric after adjusting for an easier-than-average set of coverage assignments. Fifth-round safety Marques Sigle also got seven starts in the secondary and had 52 combined tackles.

Up front, the 49ers got value out of second-round defensive tackleAlfred Collins(one sack, 17 tackles) and fourth-round defensive tackleC.J. West(one sack, 21 tackles). First-round edge rusher Mykel Williams had one sack and 20 tackles before a season-ending ACL tear. Seventh-round guard Connor Colby started six games.

28. Pittsburgh Steelers

The surprise for the Steelers is that they didn't get more out of first-round defensive tackle Derrick Harmon, who missed six games with various knee injuries. He ended the regular season with 27 combined tackles and three sacks but should be more of a force in future seasons.

Instead, the most valuable Steelers rookies were elsewhere on the defense. Fourth-round outside linebacker Jack Sawyerhad 34 tackles, a sack and two interceptions. Fifth-round defensive end Yahya Black had 28 combined tackles and two forced fumbles. Third-round running back Kaleb Johnson had just 28 carries for 69 yards and infamously forgot to field a kickoff, which led to a Seahawks touchdown in Week 2.

29. Green Bay Packers

Aaron Nagler of Cheesehead TV warned me before the season not to get too excited about first-round pick Matthew Goldenbecause the Packers don't like to feature rookies at the wide receiver position. He was right. Golden caught only 29 passes for 361 yards and a touchdown in 2025. Look for him to play a bigger role in the offense in future years. We'll also see how Savion Williams develops; the third-round gadget receiver had 11 carries for 37 yards and 10 catches for 78 yards and a touchdown.

The Packers also got seven starts from second-round offensive lineman Anthony Belton and contributions from defensive linemen Warren Brinson (13 tackles) and the undrafted Nazir Stackhouse (12 tackles).

30. Minnesota Vikings

Much like the Colts, almost all the rookie value for the Vikings came from a single first-round pick. Minnesota took guard Donovan Jacksonwith the No. 24 selection, and he was a quality starter for most of the season. Jackson finished with a 92.6% pass block win rate (average for guards) and a 76.9% run block win rate (well above average).

And then ... that's about it. Undrafted free agent quarterback Max Brosmer was terrible when forced into action (14.0 QBR), and any other rookies had very minor impacts. This is Minnesota's second straight year at or near the bottom of this list.

31. Jacksonville Jaguars

Oh, what might have been ifTravis Hunterhad stayed healthy. The No. 2 pick did realize his goal of playing both ways at wide receiver and cornerback but suffered a knee injury during practice in October that ended his season. He finished with 298 receiving yards and a touchdown, plus 15 combined tackles and three passes defensed.

Otherwise, the top Jaguars rookie was fourth-round running back Bhayshul Tuten, with 307 rushing yards and seven combined touchdowns in 15 games. Safety Rayuan Lane III had 20 combined tackles, while seventh-round center Jonah Monheim started two games and undrafted edge rusher Danny Striggow started two games with 0.5 sacks.

32. Los Angeles Rams

The Rams were No. 1 on this list a year ago. This year's draft wasn't quite as productive, in part because the Rams traded away their first-round pick.

Second-round tight end Terrance Ferguson missed the first couple of games then gradually worked his way into the lineup. However, his 231 receiving yards and three touchdowns were behind a number of other rookies in a very good season for rookie tight ends. Third-round defensive end Josaiah Stewart had 22 combined tackles and three sacks. Seventh-round wide receiver Konata Mumpfield had 10 catches for 92 yards and a touchdown. Undrafted free agent linebacker Shaun Dolacmade an impact, particularly early in the season.

Has Sean Payton been holding back on offense ahead of NFL playoffs? | Broncos Mailbag

In his absence, P.J. Locke stepped into the starting lineup and has played solid football. Locke injured his ankle against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 18 and did not return to the game, though he took part in Denver's late-week practices last week and was not listed at all on Denver's Tuesday injury report.

""Yeah, no, B.J. was an amazing player,"" fellow safety Talanoa Hufanga said of Jones. ""It sucks that we lose a guy like that. But a guy like P.J. who studies his ass off is right there in line to be the next-best guy. So for me to play with him, it’s been amazing. We’ve never had, like, any lack of communication. It’s just learning what we’re comfortable with. We didn’t get training-camp reps together, it was a lot of me and B-Jones.

""So, for me, just getting these reps with him, we’ve definitely kinda settled into what we can disguise together, where we’re trying to be. And at the end of the day, meet at the ball, and try to take it away.”

Outside of Jones, though, the Broncos appear on track to get several other players back in the mix.

Inside linebacker Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) practiced Tuesday and Denver opened the 21-day practice window for tight end Lucas Krull (foot), who has been on injured reserve since Week 5. Inside linebacker Drew Sanders (foot) was a limited participant Tuesday after having his return-to-play window opened Saturday.

Starting defensive end John Franklin-Myers also returned to practice Tuesday, after missing last Friday with the birth of his third child.

Two other players who missed snaps due to ankle injuries against the Chargers, left tackle Garett Bolles and center Alex Forsyth, were not listed on Tuesday's injury report and are thus considered fully healthy.

Center Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) isn't eligible to return from injured reserve until next week, but he did conditioning work on the side field Tuesday during the open portion of practice. Payton said after Wattenberg was hurt that his injury would keep him out right about the minimum of four weeks, so it's possible he'll be in the mix for the AFC Championship Game should the Broncos advance past Buffalo on Saturday.

Broncos vs. Bills: Setting up Denver’s first home playoff game in a decade | Podcast

Banged up Bills. While Denver had every player on its 53-man roster at practice in some capacity plus two candidates to return from injured reserve, the Bills had a lengthy injury report.

They listed 14 players overall, including quarterback Josh Allen with foot, knee and right finger issues. They also found out that receiver Tyrell Shavers tore his ACL.

Overall, Buffalo had five players on the 53-man roster who didn't practice at all Tuesday. Everybody on the 53 in Denver practiced.

Buffalo could get a couple of players back from injured reserve in defensive tackle Ed Oliver (bicep) and wide receiver Curtis Samuel (elbow). Oliver was limited and Samuel full on Tuesday.

Bolles appreciates All-Pro nod. Left tackle Garett Bolles is having a banner year in his ninth NFL season. He is a Pro Bowl starter, he is the Broncos' Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee and Saturday he was named an Associated Press first-team All-Pro.

""I'm proud to represent this organization and to be able to get that accolade,"" Bolles said Tuesday. ""We have a lot of people in that locker room that deserve it. ... I'm grateful for all of them. We know where we're going. And, obviously, when you're winning and you're doing those types of things, obviously you're going to get those kind of accolades.

Running back AJ joined the Philadelphia Eagles after spending his first five seasons in the NFL with the Green Bay Packers, the team that drafted him.

But one of the things that didn't change: Gabrielle, AJ's wife, rooting for her other half.

Gabrielle, a lifestyle blogger and content creator, posted a heartfelt end-of-season tribute to her husband on Instagram Jan. 13.

Two days prior, the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles – who clinched back-to-back NFC East titles – were eliminated in the wild-card round in a shocking loss to the San Francisco 49ers.

""Season 6 ✅ Always a little bittersweet when it doesn’t end the way you hope, but this year in Philly was still so special. So many memories, incredible people, and moments we’ll always be grateful for,"" Gabrielle wrote in her post.

After AJ missed the entire 2024 season with the Pack because of a neck injury, he signed as a free agent with the Eagles in March on a one-year deal.

The Eagles' first preseason game of 2025 marked the first NFL game Dillon played in since coming back from his injury. Quadzilla took the field in his first regular-season game since New Year's Eve 2023 in the league's 2025 season opener.

He would end up playing in seven regular-season games, rushing for 60 yards on 12 carries and catching three passes for 21 yards. He was inactive for the Eagles' playoff game.

""Forever proud of you, @ajdillon2 your drive, composure, and resilience never go unnoticed 🫶"" Gabrielle continued in her post.

Earlier this season, adding defensive reinforcements seemed necessary due to Konate’s poor form, but the France international has looked more secure in recent weeks.
In recent weeks, right-back Calvin Ramsay and centre-back Wellity Lucky have been regulars on the bench due to Liverpool’s lack of squad depth.
Their squad size — ironically, given the lack of options Slot has had available to him for recent games — does present an issue.
In the Premier League squad, the most logical move would be Ramsay — adding a defender would move him back down the pecking order.","Conor Bradley’s season-ending knee injury has reduced Liverpool’s slim defensive options even further.

Head coach Arne Slot has already spent most of the season without summer signing Giovanni Leoni, who arrived at the end of August and suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in September’s Carabao Cup tie with Southampton.

Eight senior defensive options became seven, and now it has dropped to six — right-back Jeremie Frimpong, centre-backs Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez and left-backs Milos Kerkez and Andrew Robertson.

It is a precarious predicament, and while all indications were that they are set for a quiet January window, this latest injury setback should change that.

Earlier this season, adding defensive reinforcements seemed necessary due to Konate’s poor form, but the France international has looked more secure in recent weeks. Instead, additions are required because they are one more injury away from being in serious trouble.

Kerkez was the only fit senior defender who did not feature in the 4-1 FA Cup third-round victory over Barnsley and although Slot said before the game he would play a strong team, Van Dijk playing another 90 minutes felt unnecessary.

In recent weeks, right-back Calvin Ramsay and centre-back Wellity Lucky have been regulars on the bench due to Liverpool’s lack of squad depth. A tie against Barnsley, who lie 16th in the third-tier League One, offered an opportunity for Slot to give them first-team game time, but he didn’t. Ramsay, 22, was an unused substitute and Lucky, 20, did not make the matchday squad. Unless there is an extreme injury crisis, Slot is clearly reluctant to use them.

Liverpool have already been treading a fine line. Gomez, whose unfortunate injury history is well known, has been the only cover for centre-backs Van Dijk and Konate — and now the 28-year-old will also have to be the primary backup option at right-back for the remainder of the season.

Despite limited game time, Gomez has still needed to manage a knee injury this season. Frimpong, who has been playing right wing in recent weeks due to attacking shortages, has missed more than a dozen Liverpool games due to hamstring injuries. Konate’s chequered injury past — even if he has largely been reliable since Slot’s arrival — cannot be ignored either.

“Jeremie Frimpong has to play a lot of minutes, also comes back from an injury, has missed out on three or four months of a lot of playing time,” Slot told reporters in his post-Barnsley press conference.

“I liked him again today, by the way, but I have to make sure he can play again at the weekend and then we go to Marseille and to Bournemouth. It is nine games in January with six defenders available. I have to manage it in the right way.”

That sounds like a head coach who will have to find solutions internally.

Whenever Slot has been asked about his limited options at centre-back, for example, he has frequently referenced midfielders Ryan Gravenberch and Wataru Endo as possibilities. He has also shifted Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones from midfield to right-back.

Experimenting with Szoboszlai at right-back was forced on Slot in the opening weeks of the campaign because of injuries to Bradley and Frimpong. Wins were secured against Newcastle United, Arsenal and Burnley but its effectiveness has diminished.

Bradley and Frimpong were missing for the successive home defeats to Nottingham Forest, when Szoboszlai started at right-back, and PSV, when Jones lined up there. Opponents have begun targeting the defensive deficiencies of a midfielder playing out of position. Liverpool have looked more balanced with a natural right-back.

Liverpool’s ongoing 11-game unbeaten run has seen them start a defender at right-back in each game. Slot has also used more midfielders in his starting XI. That may change with Hugo Ekitike back fit and when Mohamed Salah returns from the Africa Cup of Nations, but needing to use a midfielder at right-back weakens the depth of another area of the squad while papering over the cracks of another.

Slot has made it very clear in recent press conferences that there is still plenty for his side to achieve this season. His strong line-up against Barnsley was an indication of his thoughts on an FA Cup run. Performances against Inter Milan and Real Madrid suggest a deep run in the Champions League is not improbable, but qualification for next season’s edition is a must.

Not accelerating summer plans — which Liverpool have done in the past — or making any move risks putting those aspirations in jeopardy.

Signing a right-back on loan, for instance, would be a sensible short-term solution, but whether players considered good enough are available is a different question. It would be more likely that Liverpool think long-term and buy a player who will help in the present and the future.

Their squad size — ironically, given the lack of options Slot has had available to him for recent games — does present an issue. They only have homegrown spaces available to register any new signings, which is one of the reasons Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi continues to make perfect sense.

A £35million ($47m) deal was all but finalised at the end of the transfer window until Palace pulled the plug. There is no guarantee Guehi leaves this month, as he will be a free agent and have his pick of clubs in the summer, but Manchester City are pushing to sign him.

If Liverpool made a signing that was neither under-21 nor homegrown, it would require them to unregister one of their 17 non-homegrown players.

In the Premier League squad, the most logical move would be Ramsay — adding a defender would move him back down the pecking order. Outside of him, it would mean sacrificing another lesser-used squad player, such as Federico Chiesa or Endo — although neither feels like a realistic possibility.

In the Champions League, even if the player was under-21, they would have to be registered. That would be a tougher decision — Ramsay was not originally included and Leoni, who also could not be classed as an under-21 player because he has not been at the club for over two years, has already been replaced by Chiesa.

Chiesa was the surprise omission from the initial squad, with Rio Ngumoha chosen ahead of him. The former has played 61 minutes across three appearances in the Champions League, while the latter clocked up 16 minutes in his only appearance on matchday one against Atletico Madrid. A tough decision may have to be made.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/13053035/GettyImages-2255958038-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-14 07:00:44.475637

Linebacker Dre Greenlaw, who was one of the Broncos' biggest free agency acquisitions this past offseason, returned to the practice field and is on track to play in the divisional round game at Empower Field at Mile High.

Greenlaw, who missed eight games this season because of injuries and one because of a suspension, had missed the last two games of the regular season with a hamstring injury.

Greenlaw left the Broncos' Dec. 21 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars when he pulled up trying to chase down Travis Etienne Jr. with just over two minutes left in the game. He had missed six other games earlier this season with a thigh injury.

""It's good to have a healthy Dre Greenlaw back in the game,'' Broncos coach Sean Payton said after Tuesday's practice, the Broncos' first on-field work of the week.

Given the Bills led the league in rushing this season with 159.6 yards per game, it is a welcome return even for a Broncos defense that has been one of the league's best this season. Especially since it was also the Bills who unceremoniously shoved the Broncos out of the playoffs this past January with 210 yards rushing in the 31-7 wild-card win with 79 of those rushing yards coming in the first quarter alone.

James Cook III, who led the league in rushing this season with 1,621 rushing yards with a 5.25 yards per carry average that was second best in the NFL, finished Buffalo's playoff win this past January with 120 yards on his 23 carries.

""Obviously they whupped our butt last year,'' Broncos outside linebacker Nik Bonitto said.

""There were a lot of things we felt coming away from a game like that [such as], 'we're not there yet [and] we need to improve,''' Payton said. ""It's the runner, it's the scheme. ... We'll have to be ready.''

The Broncos signed Greenlaw to a three-year, $31.5 million contract last March with the hope he would add some physicality to a defense that had some difficulty limiting opponents' explosive runs in the 2024 season. But he missed the offseason program with thigh injuries as well as the Broncos' first six games of the season.

He was also suspended for a game -- the Broncos' Oct. 26 win over the Dallas Cowboys -- because of a postgame confrontation with referee Brad Allen after the Broncos' win over the New York Giants. At the time, the NFL said Greenlaw ""chased after referee Brad Allen and verbally threatened him as he tried to leave the field.''

The Broncos finished No. 2 in run defense overall this season -- 91.1 rushing yards allowed per game -- and had the highest rate of run stops at, or behind, the line of scrimmage this season at 30.3%.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0114%2Fr1600311_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 04:02:19.256899

The Broncos return to practice Tuesday in preparation for their AFC Divisional round playoff game against the Buffalo Bills.

The anticipation is inside linebacker Dre Greenlaw will be out there among ‘em. Still, it would be wise if Justin Strnad keeps his chin strip buckled tight.

Starting with the final week of April, Greenlaw missed six months with a nagging quad injury, returned to play in eight games, then suffered a hamstring injury late in the Broncos’ 11-game-winning streak-snapping loss to Jacksonville on December 21 and missed the final two regular-season games.

The “soft-tissue” injury, as they’re called, has so plagued Greenlaw it wouldn’t be a surprise if he again returns on a limited snap count this week against the Bills. When Greenlaw returned from his quad injury in late-October, he played 21 and 27 snaps in his first two games back while his backup Strnad played 41 and 57 snaps.

The Broncos should also return defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers to practice Tuesday. Franklin-Myers had been recently bothered by a strained hip that caused him to sit out the previous 1 ½ games.

Meanwhile, the Broncos were hoping center Luke Wattenberg could return for next week’s AFC Championship Game providing all goes well Saturday afternoon against the Bills at Empower Field at Mile High.

Then there’s the longer-term injuries to safety Brandon Jones and running back J.K. Dobbins. Jones did have surgery to repair a torn pec muscle, sources tell 9NEWS, with the team keeping open the possibility the safety could return by Super Bowl 60, again if the Broncos make it that far. Dobbins had surgery to repair a Lisfranc injury suffered Nov. 6 in a 10-7 win against the Raiders. Head coach Sean Payton has said he hopes Dobbins returns ""soon.""

Keep in mind, the usual recovery time for those respective injuries – torn pec and Lisfranc -- extends beyond the February 8 Super Bowl date. Jones’ pec injury occurred near the end of the first half of the Broncos’ win against Green Bay on December 14. The Super Bowl would be just seven weeks from his injury.

Asked Tuesday if he thought Jones would make it back, Broncos head coach Sean Payton paused to think about it, thn said, ""I don't think so."" He thought some more and repeated, ""I don't think so.""

Still, Jones obviously hasn't given up. He was working out on the side rehab field during the early portion of practice Tuesday. And again, the Broncos did keep his return window open for longshot chance at Super Bowl.

Dobbins’ Lisfranc issue would be three months from the Super Bowl. Former Broncos All Pro left tackle Ryan Clady suffered a Lisfranc injury in week 2 of the 2013 season and was unable to return in time for Super Bowl 48.

Then again, there may be no better medicine than motivation. Neither Jones or Dobbins, who were 2020 draft class mates – Jones in the third round by Miami and Dobbins in the second round by Baltimore - have played in a Super Bowl as their sixth NFL season winds down.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/e1e56de9-0db2-42ec-bafb-edba8fcaa88a/20260113T192454/e1e56de9-0db2-42ec-bafb-edba8fcaa88a_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 04:02:23.854249

American snowboarder Chloe Kim shared an optimistic update on her status for the Milan Cortina Olympics.

The two-time Olympic gold medalist said she’s ""good to go"" for the competition despite dealing with the effects of a torn labrum in her shoulder. Kim sustained the injury during a recent training run in Switzerland.

The 2026 Games are scheduled to begin in less than a month, giving Kim a short window to recover and pursue her third consecutive gold medal in the halfpipe. Kim won gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang and again in 2022 in Beijing.

In an update posted to Instagram Tuesday, Kim said she wasn’t surprised to learn she had torn her labrum, the lining of the socket that holds the shoulder together. She did not specify which shoulder was injured when she fell while preparing for the upcoming Laax Open.

""There are two ways to do it, and the way I did it is less severe than the other, so I’m really happy about that,"" she said. ""Obviously, I’m really disappointed that I can’t snowboard until right before the Olympics, which is going to be hard. I haven’t gotten nearly the amount of reps that I would have liked, but that’s OK.""

LINDSEY VONN, 41, CONTINUES REMARKABLE COMEBACK WITH WORLD CUP DOWNHILL WIN AHEAD OF OLYMPICS

The women’s Olympic halfpipe contest begins Feb. 11.

The 25-year-old Kim, who has already qualified for the U.S. team, would be the heavy favorite to win in Italy if she’s healthy. She said she won’t compete this weekend in Laax. She didn’t mention the Winter X Games in Aspen later this month, which are the last big contest before the Olympics.

Kim has participated in only one competition this season — last month in Copper Mountain — and while warming up for the final there, she sustained a shoulder injury.

Last week, she posted video of her fall in Switzerland, which showed her skittering across the halfpipe after losing her bearings on the landing of a jump. At that time, she said she dislocated the shoulder and wasn’t in much pain. An MRI from last Friday revealed the labrum tear.

In her video, Kim said she’ll have to wear a ""super-sexy shoulder brace"" that is uncomfortable.

""I went through a bunch of different waves of emotions, but, honestly, I’m really excited for this week,"" she said.

Prior to that game, Cooper told Tampa play-by-play broadcaster Dave Randorf that they avoid the “worst-case scenario” on Point.
“But he is week to week.” Any absence longer than three weeks would jeopardize Point’s availability for the Olympics.
Maybe an injury replacement offers Team Canada a chance for a do-over there and they can rethink roles in other ways.
One way or another, if Point needs replacing, it’s another difficult decision coming for Team Canada and one that won’t please everyone.","Jon Cooper called it “the elephant in the room.”

The Tampa Bay Lightning coach had just watched one of his NHL team’s best forwards, Brayden Point, have to be helped off the ice Monday in Philadelphia, unable to put any weight on his right leg. And, as Team Canada’s coach, Cooper had also watched one of his Olympic team’s more trusted players injured with the start of the Milan Cortina Olympics just around the corner.

“I mean, there’s a big tournament coming up in a month, and he’s a big part of us,” Cooper said. “Let’s just hope everything turns out all right.”

The early indications aren’t encouraging. The Lightning haven’t placed any firm timelines or revealed the nature of the injury to Point’s right knee, but a league source said Tuesday that it’s “not good.”

The injury occurred moments after Point scored a power-play goal for the Lightning. As he stretched out to knock home a rebound, Flyers defenseman Cam York fell awkwardly on his right leg. Point immediately threw off his gloves and grabbed for the knee. Teammate Nikita Kucherov and Lightning head athletic trainer Tom Mulligan then slowly helped him off the ice.

Point traveled with the Lightning to Pittsburgh, where they’re set to face the Penguins on a back-to-back Tuesday. Prior to that game, Cooper told Tampa play-by-play broadcaster Dave Randorf that they avoid the “worst-case scenario” on Point.

“His season is not over,” said Cooper. “But he is week to week.”

Any absence longer than three weeks would jeopardize Point’s availability for the Olympics. NHL players are due to charter to Milan on Feb. 7, and Olympic teams have until the Feb. 11 start of the tournament to make injury replacements. Beyond that date, they are limited to the 25 players on their official roster.

Point was one of six players named to the initial Canadian roster in June. A two-time Stanley Cup winner and former 50-goal scorer, his versatility was on display while helping Canada win the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. Point played both center and right wing at that event, including seeing time beside Connor McDavid during the championship game.

He had a slow start to the season for Tampa Bay, but his game was rounding into much better shape over the past month. Point has scored eight goals and 19 points in 15 games since Dec. 9, helping the Atlantic Division-leading Lightning to a 10-game winning streak in the process.

“The tough part for Pointer is his game had really turned the corner, and it seemed like he was scoring every night for us,” Cooper said.

The Calgary native hasn’t previously represented his country at the Olympics.

In the event that Point’s injury knocks him out of the tournament, Canada general manager Doug Armstrong’s management team has a group of forwards already standing by in reserve to select a replacement from.

Obviously, everyone involved hopes Point recovers in time for Milan. But in the meantime, conversations need to be had in case he ultimately has to be replaced.

On Dec. 31, the day Canada’s roster was announced, Armstrong explained how they would go about assembling the reserve list should an injury occur.

“We’ve worked a (reserve) list that we think checks a lot of different boxes,” Armstrong told The Athletic. “So if this player gets hurt, and he performs a certain role, what replacement do we want?

“We’ll want to make sure we keep as many options available so that we take the player that’s playing the best in the area we need him.”

In other words, there isn’t necessarily one specific player who is the “next man up” should an injury require a roster change. The replacement would depend on two factors: the candidate’s performance at the time of consideration and the skill set and role of the player being replaced.

Sam Bennett, Connor Bedard, Wyatt Johnston, Mark Scheifele, Seth Jarvis and Travis Konecny are among those on the reserve list, according to league sources.

What role would Point have on the Olympic roster, if healthy? One league source said the plan was to play him on the top line alongside McDavid. As mentioned, that’s where Point was in the championship game, but there was some line-blending and line-matching as the game went. He also played some center in that tournament.

Either way, he would be headed for a top-six role in Milan.

There are two ways Team Canada could go about replacing him: Replace him with a player who can directly take over his role or elevate a player already named to the team to that role and backfill at the bottom.

If Team Canada was looking for a player who could play both center and wing and also, like Point, was a right shot, that would bring Bedard and Johnston especially into focus. One can’t discount fellow right-hand shots Scheifele and Jarvis, either.

Probably the closest skillset match for Point is Johnston. But Bedard offers the most offensive ceiling.

And don’t overlook Bennett, for the simple fact that he was the most difficult player for management to leave off the roster in the first place. Maybe an injury replacement offers Team Canada a chance for a do-over there and they can rethink roles in other ways.

One way or another, if Point needs replacing, it’s another difficult decision coming for Team Canada and one that won’t please everyone.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/13165039/GettyImages-2200098923-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-14 01:59:21.029204

The grueling injury often takes about nine months to fully recover from -- placing the 32-year-old’s NFL future in jeopardy as he enters his 10th season.

Teammates such asChristian McCaffrey, Ricky Pearsall, Eddy Pineiro and Demarcus Robinson were among the flood of comments offering support to Kittle, who also seemingly confirmed reports of the bottle of Patrón delivered to the locker room after he was carted off.

Kittle said, ""You know you’re in a special place"" when team owner Jed York is the first person to meet you in the locker room. York was reportedly the one who sent the bottle.

Edwards and offensive tackle Ozzy Trapilo on injured reserve, the team announced on Tuesday. The move effectively ends both of their respective seasons after injuries suffered in Chicago’s Wild Card win over the Packers on Saturday.

As corresponding roster moves, the Bears activated offensive tackle Braxton Jones off the injured reserve list and called up linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin from the practice squad to the active roster. Taking Reeves-Maybin’s spot on the practice squad will be linebacker Nephi Sewell, a four-year NFL veteran who also is Bears linebacker Noah Sewell’s older brother.

Jones, arguably the best value pick from Ryan Poles’ first draft as Chicago’s general manager, was the team’s primary starting left tackle from 2022 to 2024. He started the first three games of the season in 2025 but ultimately got benched in favor of Theo Benedet. He suffered a knee injury afterwards and has been on the Bears’ injured reserve list since October. With 44 career starts, he brings valuable experience to the table with Trapilo out for the rest of the postseason.

Reeves-Maybin, a 2023 Pro Bowler and All-Pro as a special teamer, signed with the Bears in November. He has played in three regular season games for the Bears this year purely as a special teamer, most notably tallying two tackles in Week 15 against the Browns. He took eight defensive snaps on Saturday against Green Bay, finishing with a tackle and a quarterback hurry as a blitzing defender.

Edwards suffered a fractured fibula in the Packers game that will leave him out for the remainder of the postseason. It’s unfortunate timing for the 29-year-old, who missed seven games during the regular season with multiple injuries. Trapilo had been coming into his own as Chicago’s starting left tackle, having held the role since Week 12 when Benedet got hurt and keeping a stranglehold on the role since.

Packers Preparing Contract Talks with Matt LaFleur

ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Packers plan to work on a new deal with Matt LaFleur after the season. Green Bay doesn’t want him entering 2026 on an expiring contract, even if another playoff flameout has turned up the outside noise. The organization has never been one to hand out top-tier coaching salaries, and LaFleur’s 76-41-1 record is now weighed against postseason frustration. Teams with openings are watching closely in case negotiations sour. If LaFleur ever actually hit the market, he’d instantly jump near the top of multiple lists.

Harbaugh Mania Takes Over the Coaching Cycle

The Falcons completed an interview with John Harbaugh, marking the first confirmed conversation after his firing and the clearest sign yet that he’ll be able to pick almost any job he wants. NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo believes the Titans are firmly in the race thanks to a roster reset, enormous cap space and rookie QB Cam Ward. SNY’s Connor Hughes reports many coaching candidates think this comes down to the Giants or Falcons, with the runner-up turning to Kevin Stefanski. Harbaugh is expected to pace himself, interview next week, and let teams come to him. Wherever he lands, it’s going to shape the rest of the carousel.

Mike McDaniel Drawing Heavy Interest

The Falcons completed their interview with Mike McDaniel, who also met with the Browns and has sit-downs scheduled with the Titans and Ravens. He’s one of the more unique candidates in this cycle, with a track record of squeezing strong offensive output out of Miami’s fractured quarterback situation. The Browns also completed their interview with him, viewing him as a real candidate for the top job. While offensive coordinator opportunities will be plentiful, it’s clear there’s still real head-coaching interest in him.

Ravens Coaching Search Expands

The Ravens completed an interview with Kliff Kingsbury and formally requested interviews with Browns DC Jim Schwartz, Rams pass-game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase, Chargers DC Jesse Minter and Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver. Kingsbury continues to float between head-coaching buzz and coordinator options, while Schwartz has drawn strong in-house support in Cleveland. Weaver has already met with Arizona and Atlanta. Minter’s surge continues after a strong defensive showing late in the season. Baltimore appears willing to explore every possible angle to reset around Lamar Jackson.

Browns Request Udinski

Cleveland requested an interview with Jaguars OC Grant Udinski. He’s a fast-rising name after helping Jacksonville settle into one of the league’s better late-season offenses. With Jim Schwartz already interviewing in-house, the Browns seem determined to cover the field before making a call.

Raiders Add Jesse Minter to Their List

The Raiders added Chargers DC Jesse Minter to an already lengthy candidate list featuring Jeff Hafley, Vance Joseph, Klint Kubiak, Matt Nagy, Nate Scheelhaase and Davis Webb. Minter’s defense smothered Drake Maye in the Wild Card Round even in a losing effort, and it’s clear teams noticed. Las Vegas remains one of the trickier landing spots given roster questions and front-office uncertainty, but the volume of interview requests signals they’re determined to reset the identity of the franchise.

Giants Request Chris Shula

New York requested to interview Rams DC Chris Shula, joining the Cardinals and Raiders as teams lining up for a closer look. Shula’s work with a low-budget defense earned him significant league-wide respect this season, and he has quickly become one of the more interesting defensive candidates of the cycle. The Giants continue to cast a wide net as they pursue their next coach.

Dolphins Request Kelvin Sheppard

Miami requested an interview with Lions DC Kelvin Sheppard after completing their interview with Klint Kubiak. Sheppard made an immediate impact in his first year as coordinator, building a tough, aggressive defense that played well above expectations. The Dolphins also have requests out for Jeff Hafley, Robert Saleh, and Chris Shula as they search for the successor to Mike McDaniel.

Injury Ward

Nico Collins (head) exited Houston’s Wild Card win after landing head-first into the turf. Collins showed signs of disorientation and was ultimately carted off. Expect him to be in concussion protocol this week. His status for the Divisional Round is very much up in the air.

Matthew Stafford (finger) is good to go for the Divisional Round, according to Sean McVay. The sprain didn’t keep him off the field last week and shouldn’t limit him as the Rams prep for Chicago.

Dalton Kincaid (foot) wore a boot after the Wild Card win, but Sean McDermott called the move precautionary. His practice participation later in the week will determine whether Dawson Knox is in line for more work.

Gabe Davis (knee) tore his ACL and will miss the rest of the playoffs. It’s a brutal blow for Buffalo, who will turn to Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks, Tyrell Shavers and Keon Coleman to fill the void.

Tucker Kraft (knee) anticipates opening training camp on the PUP list, though he expects to be ready for Week 1. His return timeline remains one of the bigger Packers storylines heading into 2026.

A coaching cycle rarely tilts an entire postseason, but the league is spinning fast and every interview feels like the start of another ripple. Meanwhile, contenders are taping up quarterbacks, shuffling receivers and adjusting game plans on the fly. Buckle up. The Divisional Round is here, and the next domino is never far away.

There are just three weeks of football left in the 2025 season. For most of the league, preparations for 2026 have already begun. This article will break down the biggest team needs that will benefit fantasy managers heading into the 2026 offseason.

AFC Offseason Team Needs

Baltimore Ravens: Add More Pass-Catching Talent

The Baltimore Ravens will enter the 2026 season with a new coaching staff leading the Lamar Jackson offense. Baltimore is also set to return Derrick Henry and four of five offensive linemen (center Tyler Linderbaum will be a free agent) but is set to lose Isaiah Likely and DeAndre Hopkins in free agency.

The Ravens need to explore replacing (or retaining) those big bodies in the passing attack to complement the skill sets of Zay Flowers and Mark Andrews.

Buffalo Bills: Try to Find a WR1 for Josh Allen (Again)

Once again, the Buffalo Bills’ passing attack is being held up by the stellar play of Josh Allen with a mishmash of average talent. Buffalo had just one receiver (Khalil Shakir) with over 600 receiving yards. 11 different players had at least 100 receiving yards.

Keon Coleman hasn’t worked out as the team’s WR1 after being drafted as the 33rd pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, but that shouldn’t discourage Buffalo from going back to the well to find a pass catcher again. The Bills’ offense can unlock another level if they can find a player that defenses must account for in the passing attack.

Cincinnati Bengals: Upgrade the Interior Offensive Line

The Cincinnati Bengals’ offensive line showed growth over the course of the 2025 season. According to StatsHub, the Bengals ranked 17th in pressure rate (29.9%) and tied for 21st in sack rate (5.2%). Both marks were improvements over 2024.

Unfortunately, Cincinnati is set to lose a starting center (Ted Karras), guard (Dalton Risner) and two experienced backups (Cordell Volson and Lucas Patrick). Protecting Joe Burrow is paramount given his injury woes, which means the team needs to invest resources to fortify its interior line this offseason.

Cleveland Browns: Re-Tool the Offensive Line

The Browns have a lot of needs on the offensive side of the ball, but the most glaring issue for 2026 is the offensive line. Right tackle Jack Conklin is the only starter set to return next season on a unit that has struggled with age and injuries in recent seasons.

Cleveland could choose to bring back a couple of veterans like Joel Bitonio and Ethan Pocic on the interior, but it would be wise to use their increased draft capital to infuse some youth into this group.

Denver Broncos: Add a Reliable Complement to RJ Harvey in the Backfield

RJ Harvey had a fantastic rookie season for the Denver Broncos (and fantasy managers), but Denver’s run game took a clear step back when J.K. Dobbins was knocked out with an injury. Among 58 running backs with at least 40 carries since Week 10, Harvey ranked 50th in expected points added (-16.19) and 37th in success rate (39.6%).

Harvey should improve in his second season, but this is still an offense that prefers to utilize multiple backs with varied skill sets, which is set to lose Dobbins, Jaleel McLaughlin and Tyler Badie to free agency.

This is a stellar running back free agent class with plenty of options that can spell Harvey in his second season to give the Broncos a more stable rushing attack.

Houston Texans: Continue to Build up the Offensive Line

The Texans are seemingly set at the skill positions, but they could stand to add talent in the trenches. Houston’s offensive line held up well in the passing game by finishing in the bottom 12 among all offenses in sacks (31) and pressures (177) allowed. However, they were terrible as run blockers.

The Texans had the third-lowest expected points added (-54.44) and success rate (36.8%) in the NFL in 2025. They also had the seventh-highest stuff rate (21.1%) and third-lowest explosive run rate (9.1%). Only guard Ed Ingram is set to hit free agency in 2026, but Houston could stand to upgrade several pieces of this group.

Indianapolis Colts: Figure Out the Quarterback Position

It looked like the Colts had struck gold with Daniel Jones under center the first 10 weeks of 2025. The Colts had one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL and were the top seed in the AFC. Just four weeks later, Jones had suffered a torn Achilles and the season spiraled.

That injury leaves the Colts in a bad position. Jones was starting to regress before suffering a significant lower-body injury but played at a high level before being hurt. Early reports indicate the Colts and Jones are open to agreeing to a long-term deal, but the Colts will need to figure out who is under center until he’s ready to return.

Anthony Richardson Sr. or Riley Leonard could play to start the season, or the team could add a more reliable option out of free agency.

Jacksonville Jaguars: Add to the Backfield

The Jaguars had an excellent season thanks to Travis Etienne Jr.’s ability to keep the offense on schedule as a runner while adding explosive plays. Thankfully for Etienne, his high level of play came during a contract year.

Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen Jr. can have bigger roles in 2026, but Jacksonville will likely look to extend Etienne or dip into the deep free agent running back class to ensure their running game stays a strength next season.

Kansas City Chiefs: Add a Dynamic Running Back

Kansas City’s rushing attack struggled again in 2025. Kareem Hunt (3.7) and Isiah Pacheco (3.9) both averaged fewer than four yards per carry. The issue was more thanks to the talent in the backfield than the offensive line. According to StatsHub, the Chiefs were ninth in both rushing success rate (43.3%) and yards before contact (2.4).

The Chiefs tried (and failed) to trade for Breece Hall at the trade deadline but should use their free agent money to upgrade the backfield now that the season is over. Both Hunt and Pacheco are set to hit free agency.

Las Vegas Raiders: Add the Quarterback of the Future

The Raiders came into 2025 with a new, highly paid coaching staff, an exciting rookie running back (Ashton Jeanty) and a theoretically upgraded quarterback (Geno Smith). Fast forward 18 weeks and the team has fired the coaching staff and will surely replace Smith.

This goal won’t take much to accomplish since the Raiders hold the first pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza is considered the favorite to be selected first overall, but there is plenty of time between now and the draft for things to potentially change.

Regardless, the Raiders need to identify a quarterback to get the most out of their young corps of weapons.

Los Angeles Chargers: Upgrade the Interior Offensive Line

The Chargers once again had brutal play across the offensive line thanks to significant injuries to left tackle Rashawn Slater (knee) and right tackle Joe Alt (ankle). Both players will hopefully be ready for 2026 (Slater’s injury is far less certain).

However, the Chargers also have glaring issues on the interior. Los Angeles has a chance to reset the group this offseason with three contributors at guard (Zion Johnson, Jamaree Salyer, Trevor Penning) set to hit free agency.

Miami Dolphins: Overhaul the Offense

The Dolphins elected to fire head coach Mike McDaniel, meaning a new offensive system will be in place. The team is expected to move on from Tua Tagovailoa as well.

Miami has some solid pieces along the offensive line and two explosive weapons (De’Von Achane and Jaylen Waddle). However, decisions on the coaching staff, and subsequently the quarterback, loom large ahead of 2026.

New England Patriots: Continue to Upgrade the Offensive Line

Drake Maye took a big step in 2025, turning into an MVP candidate in his second season. The Patriots are set to return their entire receiver group (plus Hunter Henry) and both of their running backs next season. One area they need to address is the offensive line.

Garrett Bradbury and rookie left guard Jared Wilson combined to allow four sacks and 48 pressures on the interior this season and could be upgraded. The team could also explore adding a right tackle in the draft with Morgan Moses’ injury history and age.

New York Jets: Find a New Direction at Quarterback

First-year head coach Aaron Glenn hoped that Justin Fields could be his starting quarterback of the future. Unfortunately, his struggles as a passer led the Jets to start Tyrod Taylor and Brady Cook for four games apiece.

The Jets have the second overall pick in the draft, but this quarterback class lacks many NFL-ready options after Fernando Mendoza. The Jets will need to decide if they can develop a young quarterback in the draft or if they can acquire a veteran with multi-year starting potential this offseason.

Pittsburgh Steelers: Figure Out the Quarterback Position

Aaron Rodgers was fine in his (first?) season with the Steelers and has not ruled out returning in 2026. He proved he is still a viable option, but at some point, the Steelers need to try and find a quarterback who can provide multiple years under center.

The Steelers drafted Ohio State’s Will Howard with a Day 3 pick in 2025, but there is no indication that the team views him as more than a developmental option at this point.

Tennessee Titans: Add Receiving Talent to Help Cam Ward Develop

The 2025 Titans had just two players finish with over 500 receiving yards in Cam Ward’s rookie season. Three of their top four pass catchers were drafted in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. The team’s leading receiver, tight end Chig Okonkwo, is set to hit free agency.

The Titans need to hit on their new coach, but more importantly, they have to give Cam Ward more consistent weapons at receiver. The Titans will have plenty of veteran options in free agency like George Pickens, Mike Evans, Rashid Shaheed and Wan’Dale Robinson, if they hit free agency.

Any team can almost win a game. Monday, I counted down the most unlikely losses of the season, the games where a team climbed up around 95% or higher in win probability (per ESPN) only to let the opponent come back and win. It can happen to great teams (the Rams and Eagles have two of the 12 worst losses), it can happen to terrible teams (the Giants had the single least likely loss of the season).

But only really bad teams can have no chance at any point.

There’s an easy explanation of this, of course — the start of the game. The Broncos can come out and lay a total egg and lose 35-10 or something, but because they start out as a good team, their start-of-game win probability isn’t ever going to dip that far below 50%, even if they play terribly the rest of the way.

In other words, what follows below — the most expected losses of the 2025 season, aka the teams that had the lowest “peak” win expectancy in a given game — might not come as a huge surprise. But it’s still a fun look back.

There were nine times this season a team failed to reach a 25% win probability at any point in the game, coming from six different teams. You can probably name them (or at least four of them) pretty easily. Let’s count them down.

The Least Unlikely Losses of the 2025 NFL Season

9. Miami Dolphins vs. New England Patriots, Week 18

Peak win probability: 22.8%

The Patriots entered Week 18 in a situation where a win kept them in contention for the AFC’s No. 1 overall seed. The Dolphins entered Week 18 in a situation where the 2026 season couldn’t come soon enough. That’s why the Miami win probability was only 18.4% at kickoff, and with the Patriots scoring a touchdown inside of the first two minutes, it didn’t climb much. Early in the second half, the Dolphins had it at 17-10 and had the ball just outside the red zone, so they reached up around a 1-in-4 chance … until a Quinn Ewers pass was picked off. That was all she wrote, and the Pats won 38-10.

8. Cincinnati Bengals vs. Detroit Lions, Week 5

Peak win probability: 21.7%

The Bengals were supposed to be contenders, and even by Week 5, they were only 2-2. That said, the two wins came in Joe Burrow’s starts, and 2025 Jake Browning hadn’t looked anything like 2023 Jake Browning Meanwhile, the Lions had looked rough in Week 1 but then turned dominant, beating the Bears, Ravens and Browns by a combined 63 points and scoring 124 points in the three games. So even an offense that had Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Chase Brown wasn’t enough for the win probabilities, and the Bengals never climbed much above a 1-in-5 chance (which they were after one snap of the game). The Lions led 7-0 after 4:10 of the game, and the Bengals never got closer than that in a 37-24 loss.

7. Las Vegas Raiders vs. Philadelphia Eagles, Week 15

Peak win probability: 20.9%

In the end, the Eagles clearly weren’t as good as many of us expected them to be, and entering Week 15 they were on a three-game losing streak. Still, pretty much everyone saw this as a get-right game, with the Raiders bottoming out early this season and never rising much above that. The 20.9% mark was where the game started for the Raiders, and the Eagles ran a long, 13-play drive to score a touchdown. The Raiders responded with a long, 13-play drive of their own, where they … turned it over on downs. They trailed 7-0 after a quarter, 17-0 after a half and never scored en route to a 31-0 loss.

6. Tennessee Titans vs. San Francisco 49ers, Week 15

Peak win probability: 18.4%

The Titans never got anything going this year. Their only wins were over the Cardinals when Arizona shot themselves in the foot enough times that Plaxico Burress was jealous, a win over a Chiefs team that had given up on the season, and an actual win over … Shedeur Sanders and the Browns. So every team was heavily favored over the Titans, but the 49ers — who entered their matchup off a bye and on a three-game winning streak where they had outscored their opponents 87-39 — were perhaps the best for the task. And hey, late in the first half, the Titans had the ball in San Francisco territory with a theoretical chance to tie the game. And even at that moment, their win probability was … 15.2%. They’d go on to lose 37-24.

5. Tennessee Titans vs. Indianapolis Colts, Week 8

Peak win probability: 16.8%

Man, remember when the Colts were good? /wistful Colts fan

Week 8 was probably the peak of the Colts season. They entered at 6-1 and rolling and destroyed their division rivals 38-14 to get to 7-1. They’d go 1-8 the rest of the way. It stunk. But hey, in Week 8, they looked great, and they jumped out to a 10-0 lead. The Titans made it 10-7, but the Colts scored the next 28 points, so it was never really a sweat.

4. New Orleans Saints vs. Los Angeles Rams, Week 9

Peak win probability: 15.6%

Tyler Shough looked pretty good as a rookie! That didn’t really include his first start, back in Week 9, when the Rams took him, and the Saints, to the woodshed. Taysom Hill led the team in rushing. The Rams led 10-0, 20-3 and 34-10 (the final score). The 15.6% mark was the “eh, let’s throw them a bone” win probability as the start of the game. No one ever thought they’d win this one.

3. New York Jets vs. New England Patriots, Week 17

Peak win probability: 15.5%

Notice that team that had this game? Get used to seeing it here.

Turns out, having Brady Cook throwing to Adonai Mitchell and John Metchie III against the possible NFL MVP and a potential No. 1 seed in the AFC means you don’t get a lot of respect from the models. And given the Patriots scored their first touchdown within 5 minutes and their second within 10 en route to leads of 21-0 and 42-3 before winning 42-10, the lack of respect appears to have been warranted.

2. New York Jets vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, Week 15

Peak win probability: 12.5%

Another game, another Jets game started by Brady Cook against a contending team. The Jags entered on a four-game winning streak where they had beaten the Chargers, Cardinals, Titans and Colts by a combined 123-52, and Trevor Lawrence was forcing his way into the MVP conversation. The Jets actually did manage a few points in this one, getting to 20, but with the Jags roaring to 48, it didn’t really matter. (But hey, if you bet “Both teams score in all four quarters” for this one, good for you, because it hit.)

1. New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills, Week 18

Peak win probability: 8.5%

A thing I probably should know but don’t is how much the win probability model takes into account things like “Josh Allen is going to start the game but barely play.” Like, I know it takes players into account — that’s how it knows when a bad team is facing a good one and opens the probability at some impossibly low number. But Allen is determined to keep his consecutive-game streak going, so he wasn’t going to sit; he was going to play a snap and then give way to Mitchell Trubisky. Thus, did the model think Allen was going to play (in which case the Jets never even sniffing 10% makes sense), or did it believe it would be almost entirely Trubisky (in which case the odds still make sense, but man, what an insult)? I don’t know, but given the Jets didn’t even score until the last half of the last quarter when they were down 35-0, whatever the model thought, the odds were very solid.

The Jets were so bad, y’all.

The 2025 NFL season felt extremely weird for any number of reasons, but here’s one more: By ESPN in-game win probably, there were 13 games in the 2024 regular season where a team reached 90% win probably or better and lost. In 2025, there were 24.

Now, obviously, win probability charting is more of a for-fun exercise than hard science. It’s fun to look at, but it doesn’t actually tell you that much. But oh boy, the fun to look at is very fun to look at.

What comes below is about the regular season, but here’s a playoff example: Sunday, the Bears had an incomplete pass on third-and-3 from around midfield when they were down 11 points with 5:41 left. At that moment, win probability had the Packers at 97.8% likely to win the game:

Of course, we know what came next. 27-yard completion to Rome Odunze. Touchdown to Olamide Zaccheaus. Two-point conversion to Colston Loveland. Brandon McManus missed kick. DJ Moore touchdown. Bears win. 2.2% likelihood turned to 100%.

That sort of thing happened with shocking frequency in the 2025 season. So below, I’m counting down the 14 most unlikely losses of the 2025 NFL regular season. These are the 14 times a team reached at least 94.0% win probability only to see if disappear. Remember: Not analysis. Just fun.

The Most Unlikely Losses of the 2025 NFL Season

14. Green Bay Packers vs. Cleveland Browns, Week 3

94.0% win probability

Early in the fourth quarter, Jordan Love completed a 34-yard pass to Matthew Golden on third-and-8. They were up 10-0 on the moribund Browns and were driving to go up 13 or even 17. A minus-1 yard run and two incompletions later, the Packers punted. The Browns dinked-and-dunked down to get a field goal. But it’s a field goal, right? Who really cares? Except … Love threw an interception deep in his own territory on the next drive, the Browns turned it into a one-yard field goal. Tie game. The Packers got a field goal blocked. And ultimately, Andre Szmyt kicked a 55-yard walkoff field goal. Every single thing that could have gone wrong for the Packers in the last 10 minutes of that game did go wrong.

13. Chicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings, Week 1

94.2% win probability

It’s easy to forget this one now, with the Bears marching into a home game in the Divisional Round and the Vikings entering an offseason where they might not even keep their young quarterback as starter. But in Week 1, J.J. McCarthy had a fourth quarter for the ages. The Vikings entered the fourth down 17-6, but McCarthy threw for two touchdowns and ran for another. The Bears scored a late touchdown, but it wasn’t enough. Week 1 ended with the Vikings 1-0 and excited, the Bears 0-1 and deflated, and the NFC North looking like a Green Bay/Minnesota matchup. Oh, how things changed.

12. Los Angeles Rams vs. Philadelphia Eagles, Week 3

94.4% win probability

It’s rare to reach elite win probability super early in the second half, because it’s hard to run away that much. But only a couple minutes into the third quarter in Week 3, the Rams were beating the Eagles 26-7 and got the Eagles to second-and-13 after a holding penalty. Only … Jalen Hurts completed a 38-yarder to A.J. Brown on the next play. Believe it or not, the Rams were done scoring in the game, while the Eagles went touchdown (33 yards, Dallas Goedert), touchdown (9 yards, Brown), touchdown (4 yards, DeVonta Smith) and for good measure, they blocked a potential game-winning Rams field goal with no time left, and Jordan Davis returned that for a touchdown. The Eagles scored 26 unanswered points to stay undefeated.

11. Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Atlanta Falcons, Week 15

95.1% win probability

Tampa was probably never going to win the Super Bowl, but there are still going to be some major regrets from the 2025 season. The team was 3-0, 5-1 and 6-2. Baker Mayfield was an MVP candidate. Instead, they lost four of their last five, seven of their last nine and eight of their last 11. And none was worse than this one, when the Bucs led the all-over-but-the-shouting Falcons 28-14 in the fourth quarter before letting Kirk Cousins lead two touchdowns drives and a field goal. The Falcons beat the Bucs, didn’t lose again, and because they tied the Bucs and Panthers at 8-9, tiebreakers sent the Panthers into the playoffs and sent the Bucs home.

10. Philadelphia Eagles vs. Denver Broncos, Week 5

95.4% win probability

There were several times this season where everyone basically concluded that the Broncos were a smoke-and-mirrors affair. This was one of them, trailing 17-3 late in the third quarter and at risk of falling to 2-3. They punted here, and the Eagles spent more than a full quarter of game time (from 13:18 of the third quarter to 13:11 of the fourth) at 80% win probability or above. But the Broncos woke up in the fourth quarter, getting touchdowns from J.K. Dobbins and Evan Engram and a 36-yard Wil Lutz field goal with 1:11 left to beat the Eagles 21-17. They only lost one time the rest of the season.

9. Philadelphia Eagles vs. Dallas Cowboys, Week 12

96.3% win probability

Back-to-back Eagles! And this one came early, with the Eagles up 21-0 in the second quarter and driving. It looked not only like a victory over their rival, but a demolition that would have all but ended the Cowboys season. Instead, they punted. The Cowboys scored a touchdown before halftime and two more in the second half, then kicking a game-winning field goal as time expired. The Eagles missed a field goal and lost a fumble in the fourth quarter, and in the second half they 30 plays for 108 yards. “The offense falls apart in the second half” was kind of a theme of the 2025 Eagles.

8. New York Giants vs. Chicago Bears, Week 10

96.9% win probability

Under 6 minutes left, and the Bears trailed by 10 points. The win probability for the Bears was 3.1%, but given how Chicago’s season has gone, it was probably like 94%, as the Cardiac Bears had comebacks galore. They scored a touchdown on the drive they were on. The rest of the game, the Giants had nine plays on offense — a three-and-out for minus-8 yards, and a turnover on downs on a six-play, 11-yard drive. The Bears followed up one touchdown with another, and within five minutes they managed to go from “under 5% to win” to “comfortably kneeling the ball to finish off a victory.”

7. Arizona Cardinals vs. Tennessee Titans, Week 5

97.4% win probability

Hands down the funniest game of the year. The Cardinals led 21-6 with 12 minutes left looking to get to 3-2. Instead, they had a whole comedy of errors in the game. The snap off Kyler Murray’s face that became a turnover had happened earlier, but they also added in a massive Emari Demercado run into a goal-line fumble and touchback and somehow turned a Cardinals interception into a Titans touchdown, when Dadrion Taylor-Demerson picked off a pass and fumbled it into the end zone for Tyler Lockett to recover. Podcasts did entire episodes just about the Cardinals’ comedy in that second half.

6. Cincinnati Bengals vs. New York Jets, Week 8

97.5% win probability

It was Week 8. The Jets were winless. The Bengals were struggling, but they were expected to compete, especially if they could just tread water until Joe Burrow got back. And with 9:28 left, the Bengals were up 14 and the Jets had third-and-6 in their own territory. Even the most nihilistic of Bengals fans had to feel very secure. But the Jets scored a touchdown and got the two-point conversion (doing the “go for 2 when a touchdown gets you within 8” thing that draws so much conversation), the Bengals had a three-and-out, the Jets scored again, the Bengals turned it over on downs, and the Jets had their first win of the season. Absolutely no one saw it coming.

5. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Houston Texans, Week 10

98.4% win probability

This one peaked at 98.4% early in the fourth quarter, but it was really a whole-game thing. The Jags were up 3-0 after 4 minutes, up 10-0 after 7 minutes, up 17-0 after 16 minutes. But yes, with 13:09 left, the Texans had an incompletion on third down to get to fourth-and-2 down 29-10. It seemed over, especially with C.J. Stroud hurt and Davis Mills under center. Instead, Mills led not one, not two, but three touchdown drives, including a 14-yard running score to take the lead that was the second-longest run of his career. And for good measure, the Jags forced a fumble on the Texans’ desperation play to end the game and returned that for a touchdown too. A 26-0 fourth quarter really set the Texans’ season in the right direction, as they didn’t lose again. But it was OK — the Jags didn’t have another loss in the regular season either.

4. Los Angeles Rams vs. Seattle Seahawks, Week 16

98.8% win probability

This was the game of the year, unless one our No. 2 finishers is it. Thursday night, DVOA Bowl, division rivals. Only … the Rams led 30-14 in the fourth quarter. The Seahawks passing game couldn’t get going. Outside of a single 55-yard Kenneth Walker III run, neither could the running game. Kind of a letdown. And when Sam Darnold threw a pick at the goal line with 9:48 left, it certainly seemed all over. But the Seattle defense forced a three-and-out and Rashid Shaheed returned the ensuing punt for a touchdown, and … the Seahawks came alive. Touchdown, another touchdown, the craziest two-point conversion you’ll ever see, missed Rams field goal, overtime. The Rams scored a touchdown in overtime (Puka Nacua with an all-time game), but the Seahawks answered with a touchdown and another two-pointer. Ballgame, 1 seed all but locked up.

T2. Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears, Week 16

99.1% win probability

So Week 16 was wild, huh? And it certainly foretold of a crazy postseason. With 3:27 left, the Packers led the Bears 16-6. The Chicago offense had nothing going on. Caleb Williams had just run for 11 yards on third-and-10, but a holding brought it back and forced third-and-20. But a face mask on the next play gave the Bears life. They notched a field goal on that drive, recovered an onside kick (who knew that was still possible?) and scored a touchdown with 24 seconds left (Jahdae Walker’s second career reception), before winning in overtime. The Packers had been in line for maybe the NFC’s 1 seed, the Bears were facing fraud allegations. Instead, the Packers never won again, and the Bears are hosting a game in the Divisional Round.

T2. Baltimore Ravens vs. Buffalo Bills, Week 1

99.1% win probability

If that Week 16 Seahawks/Rams game wasn’t the game of the year, this one was. The first Sunday of the NFL season had been fine, but it didn’t have a signature game until the prime-time battle between AFC favorites Buffalo and Baltimore. The Ravens got to 99.1% when they were up 40-25 with 4:48 left in the fourth quarter, but they spent most of the fourth quarter above 90%. It looked like the Ravens were on their way to having their finally-breaking-through season in 2025, even if it was only Week 1. And then all of a sudden, it wasn’t. Keon Coleman caught a touchdown on a scramble play. Derrick Henry, who had 169 yards and 2 touchdowns in the game, fumbled. The Bills scored again. The Ravens had a three-and-out. And then Matt Prater, who was 41 and had been on the team for three days, kicked a walkoff field goal. It was all anyone could ask for out of the season opener … unless you were a Ravens fan.

1. New York Giants vs. Denver Broncos, Week 7

99.8% win probability

The Giants led 19-0 entering the fourth quarter. The Broncos had gained all of 111 yards through their first eight drives — six punts, a turnover on downs and the end of the first half. It wasn’t just an upset, it was a beatdown. And that wasn’t even the 99.8% part! The Giants were overwhelming favorites as the fourth quarter started, 92.5%, but then they answered the Broncos’ first score with a touchdown of their own to go up 26-8. Surely the game was iced, right? Nope, the Broncos scored with 5:01 left. The Giants threw an interception. The Broncos scored again. The Giants punted. The Broncos scored again. They were up 30-26. OK, you lose. But then! The Giants scored, just to make it interesting. Unfortunately, Jude McAtamney missed the extra point (his second of the game, so when the Broncos kicked a 39-yard field goal as time expired, it wasn’t to tie the game (or even to lose by one) … it was the game winner. The Giants lost a game that should have been impossible to lose.",https://dmxvtdt4jwgem.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/John-Harbaugh.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 01:59:31.937079

The Seahawks kicked off their practice week on Tuesday in preparation for their divisional round game against the 49ers, and did so with nearly everyone on their 53-man roster, as well as two players designated to return from injured reserve, taking part in the practice.

Only two players did not practice, linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) and tackle Josh Jones (knee), who started at left tackle in place of an injured Charles Cross for the final three games of the regular season, playing through knee and ankle injuries in Week 18.

Cross, meanwhile, was listed as a full participant after missing three games with a hamstring injury, as was safety Coby Bryant, who missed the previous two games with a knee injury. Their statuses lines up with what Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said about those two players heading into Week 18, which was that both Cross and Bryant would likely make it back for the playoffs.

Two new names to the injury report were cornerback Riq Woolen (oblique) and outside linebacker DeMarcus Lawrence (Achilles), who were both limited participants.

Tight end Elijah Arroyo, who was designated to return to practice last week, was listed as a full participant, while linebacker Chazz Surratt, who was designated to return on Tuesday, was limited.

The 49ers, coming off a wild card win over the Eagles on Sunday, held a walkthrough, meaning their report was an estimation of participation had they practice. Receiver Ricky Pearsall, who missed the last two games with a knee injury, was listed as limited, as was left tackle Trent Williams, who returned for Sunday's game after missing the Week 18 game against Seattle due to a hamstring injury.

""What that looks like at a pretty impactful position on your salary cap, when you're able to possibly plan for your depth chart looking in a way where you can be competitive no matter what.""

McCarthy entered the season with massive questions after suffering a preseason knee injury in 2024 that caused him to miss the entire season. It was a roller-coaster for the Michigan product, who flashed at times late in games but was inconsistent, missing passes badly for long stretches. Injuries also plagued the QB, who missed time with ankle, hand and concussion issues.

""J.J., I was really encouraged by the type of football he started to play towards the second half of the season and finishing the way he did,"" O'Connell said. ""We spend a lot of time talking about what the layers of change really were, and I think we all just tried to have a mindset on completions and however we could generate them, we started to see a little bit of that show up. We saw some explosives show up. We saw the ability to kind of balance that with what I thought at many points this year, our run game was productive enough for us to move the football and stay in a lot of games.""

There is little question that the Vikings need a reliable veteran to buffer McCarthy.

Late in the third quarter, the 26-year-old caught a pass from quarterback C.J. Stroud but had a hard fall where he fell on his face and was in enough pain that he needed to be taken to the blue medical tent. After being carted to the locker room, he was ruled out with a concussion. And now Texans fans are worried that Collins might not be able to play when the team faces the New England Patriots on Sunday, January 18 in the NFL Divisional Round.

The doctor, who specializes in assessing football injuries, gives him a “30% chance” of clearing the sport’s concussion protocol within six days.

Morse notes that this is the second concussion that Collins has apparently received in his career, with his first being sustained earlier this season against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7. That injury forced him to miss one game. That said, he suggests that this second concussion could take longer for him to recover from.

He explained, “The fact that he required help off the field, that this is his 2nd concussion in less than 3 months (sometimes repeat concussions cause lingering symptoms) and that this game was played on a Monday (short week), will make him clearing the protocol very difficult.”

The NFL concussion protocol, which Patriots’ Christian Gonzalez is also going through, has five steps and each step requires a minimum of one day to clear. So the earliest that Collins could return to the field is Saturday, with him needing to be in limited practice on Thursday for him to have a shot to return in time.

Bills coach Sean McDermott said Tuesday that Shavers played the second half Sunday on his torn ACL, which he suffered in the second quarter on a punt return. As he came off a block, Shavers immediately pulled up and began limping and then was looked at by athletic trainers on the field. Shavers came back to play 21 offensive snaps in the final two quarters but did not return to special teams.

""He embodies what we're all about,"" McDermott said. ""... For him to then come back into the game, and then for it to turn out to be what it was is remarkable. Remarkable toughness, remarkable commitment to the team.""

The Bills also lost Gabe Davis to a torn left ACL in the game, and fellow wide receiver Joshua Palmer was placed on injured reserve last week with a lingering ankle injury.

That leaves Buffalo with only three available receivers on the active roster -- veteran Brandin Cooks, Khalil Shakir and Keon Coleman -- as it prepares to play in Denver on Saturday against the top-seeded Denver Broncos. Curtis Samuel (elbow) had his practice window opened from injured reserve Tuesday and was listed as a full participant in the team's walk-through practice. The practice squad includes receivers Mecole Hardman Jr., Stephen Gosnell and Kristian Wilkerson.

""Another guy's got to step up. That's point-blank what it means,"" McDermott said. ""And I don't mean to be short. It's just right now, it's full confidence in the guys in that room, and we brought back Kristian Wilkerson, and he'll be a good addition back to us on the practice squad, and we go from there.""

Quarterback Josh Allen was listed as limited on the injury report with his same foot injury and two others from the game against the Jaguars -- a knee injury and right finger injury.

""I feel good. I feel good,"" Allen said. ""Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks on a ... I know it's a Tuesday for us, but on a Wednesday-type mindset.

Beal, who played for the New York Giants, was last seen near Virginia Beach in Virginia on July 12, 2025. He was 28 years old at the time he was reported missing but would now be 29.

According to details provided by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, which is a federal system for tracking people who have disappeared in the U.S., Beal's girlfriend was the last person to see him.

Beal's girlfriend reported that he borrowed her car and was supposed to head to work. Instead, she got a call from him a day later, with Beal reportedly saying that he was in Virginia Beach, but was headed home.

""Samuel has not been heard from or seen since the phone call,"" the NMUPS alert for him said.

Federal officials said they don't believe he brought anything with him to Virginia Beach other than the clothes he was wearing, some extra shoes and a wallet containing his credit card and driver's license.

When the vehicle was recovered in Virginia Beach by one of the girlfriend's family members, officials say, the family member found Beal's shoes and socks on the floor of the car along with some sand.

Virginia Beach is an oceanfront city in Virginia just north of the North Carolina border. It's unclear how far Beal drove to get to Virginia Beach, or how far it was from his work.

Beal's sister, Essence Zhane, shared a post on Facebook on Jan. 12 that included additional details about the case, urging anybody with info about the NFL player's disappearance to come forward.

In her post, Zhane included photos of a paid parking ticket for a beachfront lot in Virginia Beach with a timestamp from just before 6 p.m. on July 13.

""Tomorrow makes it 7 months since we’ve last heard from or seen my brother,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""We’ve done everything we could on our end to piece things together and at this point we’re in desperate need of support on all ends.""

Beal was selected by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2018 supplemental draft, and appeared in six games as a cornerback for the team.

His career with the NFL was cut short in the 2020 season when he opted out of playing because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to court documents, Beal was arrested in July 2020 during a traffic stop in Ohio, where he was charged with improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of marijuana. He was indicted a month later on the two weapons charges and initially entered a plea of not guilty. Beal eventually changed his plea to guilty in June 2021 and was placed on probation for a year.

This is the second time in as many years that Bland has had surgery on his foot. Todd Archer of ESPN said that Bland should be ready for the Cowboys’ offseason program, but the veteran cornerback’s focus is on training camp.

DaRon Bland played in 12 games this season, posting 73 tackles, three tackles for loss, and one interception. Before the start of the season, Bland signed a four-year, $92 million contract extension with the Cowboys. He was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 20 due to an injured foot.

In 2024, Bland played in just seven games because he suffered a stress fracture and began the season on injured reserve. He played in the team’s final seven games of the year and notched 41 tackles, five passes defended, one forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.

The Cowboys selected Brand in the fifth round of the 2022 NFL Draft. He had a breakout season in 2023, leading the NFL in interceptions (nine) and tying the NFL record for most interceptions returned for a touchdown in a season (five).

DaRon Bland reacts to signing a new contract with the Cowboys

Before the start of this season, Bland shared his reaction to getting a new contract with the Cowboys. “Kind of surprised, kind of a little bit dumbfounded,” Bland said, per Tommy Yarrish of DallasCowboys.com. “Couldn’t believe it, that I’m making that much and doing what I do.”

Bland also discussed finding a role with the Cowboys after joining the team in 2022. “Being patient and learning to grow, having that mindset that where I was at that point was not the end point, so just keep driving each day, take it day by day…” Bland said. Not many fifth-rounders get the opportunities that I had and be in this league and be able to do what I do, and I’m just thankful for the opportunity to keep being out here.”

Before joining the Cowboys, Bland played one season at Fresno State. In that season (2021), the 26-year-old tallied 45 tackles, two interceptions, and five passes defended.",https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2026/01/13155804/DaRon-Bland-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:13:19.488136

The number six linebacker, Eric Kendricks, had ten and the game-sealing pass defensed.
This team can do what no one thinks they can, and let's hope they prove everyone wrong for another three games.","A few weeks ago, I wrote that the Niners are the grittiest team in the NFL. That could not have been truer on Sunday night.

Down their number one, number two, number three, and number four linebackers? Who cares? The number seven linebacker, Garret Wallow, had eleven tackles and a pass defensed. The number six linebacker, Eric Kendricks, had ten and the game-sealing pass defensed.

Though the defensive line produced little pressure, it forced numerous three-and-outs and held the Eagles to field goals, keeping the game close throughout.

Quarterback Brock Purdy, whom so many have disparaged over the years, made a few mistakes, one of them costly, but was lights out in the most important moment, avoiding sacks and rushing for a key first down on the game-winning drive.

I have written before that the way to tell a great player from an average player is by when they make mistakes. Purdy threw an interception at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Then he went 5-for-6 and threw a touchdown (and scrambled for a first down) when the game was on the line. Give me the interception early and the game-winner late over no interceptions and a string of incompletions when it matters.

The worst news of the game was the injury to star tight end George Kittle, who suffered a torn Achilles. This late in the year, it will likely keep him off the field for most of next season.

But faced with that loss, Kyle Shanahan did something unusual. Rather than simply shift to backup tight end Jake Tonges, who has been effective this year, he also used fullback Kyle Juszczyk the way he uses Kittle.

Philadelphia had never seen Juszczyk used in the passing game that extensively, and he made several key plays down the stretch, catching three passes on the last two touchdown drives.

The team also rallied around Kittle. McCaffrey was not alone in calling him the ""heart and soul of the team"" and told reporters the squad is ""going to play for him the rest of the way."" This is the attitude of a team that has faced adversity on a nearly weekly basis.

Perhaps Kendricks said it best when he related that when he got to the Niners in November, ""It was easy [to adjust to his supporting role] because everybody on this team is so unselfish. So it was just easy to come in and check [his] ego at the door and just get it done for the team to win.""

Before Kittle went down, the 49ers entered the game shorthanded on playmakers, but Demarcus Robinson played like a number one receiver, catching six balls for 111 yards and a touchdown. Jauan Jennings reprised his Super Bowl throw two years ago to hit McCaffrey for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.

Overall, the victory might not be on par with one of The Catch epics, but given all that this team has had to overcome, it was a memorable accomplishment. It was a game they had to win, and a performance they can take not only into the upcoming matchup with the Seahawks but even into next year.

This team can do what no one thinks they can, and let's hope they prove everyone wrong for another three games.",https://static.49erswebzone.com/v/bMmZxV/content/media/article/01b13d8efdb8fca4429cbd1d7c9fc7f2.jpg?social=true,N,,2026-01-14 02:00:10.034012
