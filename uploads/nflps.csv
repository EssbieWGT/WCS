This is the first major injury of Mahomes' NFL career, and he faces a rehab that will take up the entire offseason.
In fact, Mahomes and Brady both tore the ACL in their left knee during their ninth NFL season.
I think you gotta get through rehab mode as fast as possible and then you get back to training mode.
When you go through the rehab process, you need that same level of focus and determination.""","Week 15 was disastrous for the Kansas City Chiefs. Not only were the reigning AFC champions officially eliminated from playoff contention, but star quarterback Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL. This is the first major injury of Mahomes' NFL career, and he faces a rehab that will take up the entire offseason.

Mahomes is hardly the first quarterback to tear his ACL. Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray tore his ACL in 2022, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow tore his as a rookie back in 2020, and Tom Brady tore his in the 2008 season opener. In fact, Mahomes and Brady both tore the ACL in their left knee during their ninth NFL season.

During a recent taping of the ""Let's Go!"" podcast, Brady spoke about the rehab process and why it's ""a hard psychological thing to battle.""

""It's a tough rehab,"" Brady said. ""It's one of the toughest rehabs. I just remember every day pushing myself. And it's always the same amount of pain and discomfort except you're making progress through that pain and discomfort, which is a hard psychological thing to battle. You feel like, God, every day, it doesn't feel right. Except you're gaining range of motion and you're gaining strength and you are on the road to recovery. So I wish him the very best.""

The host of the podcast, Jim Gray, then asked Brady what he would tell Mahomes if he could offer any advice about coming back from a torn ACL. The NFL legend said it's all about attacking the process.

""The only thing you can do is focus on what's ahead of you and not look back,"" Brady said. ""And just say, 'OK, this is part of what my career is going to be and a lot of people have gone through it and a lot of people have overcome it.' You've just got to put as much diligence into the rehab process. And I always feel like the faster you rehab, the faster you can get back to practicing the sport that you love.

""I think sometimes people will pace themselves. Instead of training mode, they're in rehab mode. I think you gotta get through rehab mode as fast as possible and then you get back to training mode. But that requires an all-out commitment and it's the same commitment that the great professional athletes make to be great at their profession. When you go through the rehab process, you need that same level of focus and determination.""

When Brady returned to the field in 2009, he led the New England Patriots to the playoffs with a 10-6 record, and won Comeback Player of the Year. It's safe to say the 2008 knee injury didn't hold him back, as Brady would go on to win four more Super Bowls and play until he was 45 years old.

As two of the best quarterbacks of this generation, Mahomes and Brady have been compared every which way over the last nine years, and how both successfully recovered from torn ACLs could be another bullet point in the conversation. Mahomes has already publicly vowed to attack each day ""over and over again.""",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/16/3923a513-9a73-4ee4-ad1a-aebff6412f73/thumbnail/1200x675/24843f4e7db852e892f9977609e7f6a2/tom.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 01:58:48.736488

If there’s even a 1% percent that Mahomes will makes it, he and the Chiefs will do everything in their power to make it by the Season starts.

9 months is the minimum recovery time to return to sport but every month after that you wait (up to 1 year) significantly decreases injury risk.

Washington had emphasized the need for Daniels to play more this season to continue developing.","Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels won't play the rest of the season, a decision made by the team one week after he aggravated his dislocated left elbow.

Coach Dan Quinn said Daniels still hasn't been cleared for contact and was unlikely to play Saturday vs. the Philadelphia Eagles.

Washington then has a short week before playing on Christmas Day, and Quinn said that wasn't ideal for Daniels' return. But he will continue to practice with the team.

""He is not happy that he is going to be out, but that's where we're at,"" Quinn said.

Daniels had missed six games with multiple injuries, including the dislocated elbow suffered Nov. 9. He returned to the lineup for a Dec. 7 game at Minnesota, but exited in the third quarter after falling on his elbow -- getting pushed to the ground following an interception.

After the game, Quinn said Daniels could have returned, but he said three days later that further tests showed the player had aggravated the injury.

""We thought we had a good plan for the next five [games], and I would say, 'Man plans and God laughs.'"" Quinn said. ""And so you've got a good plan and then you have a way to adjust it.""

Veteran Marcus Mariota will start the final three games for Washington (4-10), which snapped its eight-game losing streak Sunday.

Daniels has played only seven games this season, leaving each of the last three with an injury -- or, as was the case at Minnesota in Week 14, aggravating his non-throwing elbow.

The Commanders will finish the season having nine starters from their projected lineup in camp miss at least seven games. Only one starter in 2024 missed that many games.

Quinn informed Daniels of the decision Monday afternoon, saying Daniels was ""disappointed but understood."" General manager Adam Peters also spoke with Daniels on Monday. Quinn also said they discussed the decision with owner Josh Harris.

Quinn said the fact Daniels had left his last three games with an injury did not factor into the decision. And he declined to say whether Daniels would play if they were 10-4.

""We're not, so we didn't have that discussion,"" Quinn said.

Washington had emphasized the need for Daniels to play more this season to continue developing. While that's still the preferred route, Quinn said Daniels did not want to go on injured reserve so he could practice.

""The best place to do it is in a game to grow,"" Quinn said. ""But that doesn't mean you can't squeeze every ounce of energy into the practice and working through some of the specific things that we want to do. We're always going to make the best decisions for the team and the player, but it doesn't mean we can't take advantage of this time. And like I said, I hope when you talk to him a year from now, 'Man, that gave me a different vantage point.' I want him to gain something from this time, and that's what we hope to accomplish from that.""

Daniels finishes his second season with 1,262 yards, 8 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He also rushed for 278 yards and two touchdowns.

In 2024, Daniels was named the NFL's offensive rookie of the year after throwing for 3,568 yards, 25 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He also rushed for 891 yards and six scores.

But injuries defined his second season. He sprained his left knee in Week 2 when, at the end of a scramble, he was hit by a helmet. Daniels missed two games. Then, in his third game back he injured his right hamstring when a blitzing defender tackled him in the pocket, causing him to miss one start.

He dislocated his left elbow in a Nov. 9 game vs. Seattle when he tried to score on a scramble with 7 minutes, 39 seconds left and the Commanders trailing 38-7.

Quinn said they want Daniels to improve by remaining a passer when on the move and keeping his eyes downfield.

""That's going to be a big part of what we're doing,"" Quinn said, ""knowing how important he is.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589807_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 01:58:53.564135

Story update II: Denver's concerned Justin Strnad may have suffered a serious right ankle injury, according to KUSA-TV's Mike Klis. See our original post below.

The Denver Broncos might be missing safety Brandon Jones down the stretch.

Jones played 34 snaps before being ruled out of Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers with a pectoral injury. P.J. Locke finished the game across from Talanoa Hufanga, playing 32 snaps on defense.

After an eventual 34-26 win, Locke provided a concerning update on his teammate.

""It's a tough situation, and I really pray it's not as bad as what it sounds like,"" Locke told the Denver Post's Parker Garbiel. ""Hopefully, he gets some good news in the morning. He's an awesome player. It's hard to replace him.""

Jones is undergoing an MRI today, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. How much time Jones could miss depends on the severity of the injury. A worst-case scenario pec injury could be season-ending, but we don't yet know the full details of the Jones injury.

Elsewhere on the injury front, Denver running back RJ Harvey left Sunday's game with a rib injury and linebacker Justin Strnad left with an ankle injury (it appeared to happen on this play). There's been no official word yet on the statuses of Jones, Harvey and Strnad, but we'll track any upcoming updates on Broncos Wire.

Adams, after receiving a minute of medical treatment on the pitch, ultimately walked off under his own power but did not attempt to continue. He was replaced by Alex Scott.

Adams suffered the injury while blocking a Matheus Cunha shot less than two minutes into the match. After he and Cunha made contact with the ball simultaneously, Adams immediately fell to the ground and raised his right arm, in an apparent call for the medical staff, and in pain. He then grimaced while the athletic trainers performed manual tests on his knee. At one point, he made a twisting motion with his left hand.

He was then helped to his feet and walked toward the sideline with a limp. At one point, he broke into a brief jog, but then shook his head.

“I think its the worst news from the game, definitely,” Iraola said in his post-match press conference. “He twisted the knee. I think it’s just MCL, but we have to check and see if it is just a small sprain or something bigger.

“Obviously, it is not what we want. To lose a player like Tyler for us is massive, especially when you don’t have Lewis Cook. Alex has to play in that holding midfield position and he has done it really well, but it’s bad news for us because Tyler is massive for us.”

Adams, who captained the U.S. men’s national team at the 2022 World Cup as a 23-year-old, has been a key player for the USMNT ever since he was a teen. He has started regularly in a defensive midfield position when healthy. He has battled multiple injuries throughout his career – including going over a year between Premier League games in 2023-24 – but had established himself as a midfield force for Bournemouth this season, starting all but one Premier League match. He’d even scored two goals, including one from 47 yards out that earned him the league’s November goal of the month award.

Adams’ next games for the U.S. national team would not be until March, but those are just friendlies (against Belgium and Portugal). The main concern is his status for the 2026 World Cup, which begins June 11. The USMNT’s first group game is June 12 against Paraguay.

Bournemouth drew the game 4-4 against Manchester United, leaving them 13th in the Premier League. Their next game comes on Saturday at home against Burnley, with Iraola expected to hold a press conference and update on Adams’ condition ahead of that fixture.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/15160542/GettyImages-2252079949-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-16 01:59:01.929267

NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported that Warren woke up feeling sick. He’s receiving fluids and hopes to play.

Assuming a featured role in place of Najee Harris, Warren has tallied 929 scrimmage yards and six touchdowns in 12 games this season. The 27-year-old has found the end zone in three straight games, scoring a key 38-yard touchdown reception in Pittsburgh’s crucial Week 14 win over the Baltimore Ravens.

If he’s able to play, Warren could have a huge primetime opportunity against a Dolphins defense that has allowed 4.8 yards per carry this season. But Miami has turned the corner from a disastrous start, allowing 53 combined points over an ongoing four-game winning streak.

The Steelers won’t want to lose a vital playmaker ahead of another game with massive AFC North implications. Warren’s absence would likely create more opportunities for Kenneth Gainwell, who has garnered 657 scrimmage yards and six touchdowns this season.

An inactive Warren may also lead Mike Tomlin to give more reps to Kaleb Johnson. The rookie has played just three snaps in each of the last two games and has 65 rushing yards on 26 attempts this season.

Monday’s game starts at 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN.

Parsons, the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history, will be out for the rest of this season, and his status for the start of the 2026 season is uncertain.

Growing List

The injury to the standout Parsons adds to a similar injury on Sunday for Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is also out for the rest of the season, and Rams receiver Davante Adams, who sustained a hamstring injury against the Lions. Parsons tore the ligament while in pursuit of Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, but it was a noncontact injury.

Mahomes is also facing an extended recovery.

“[It] would be extremely fast for Mahomes to play in Week 1 next year,” said Tom Christ of Motion Stability Physical Therapy Group. “Some players have returned that fast, so not impossible, but fast.”

Will Ratings Be Hurt, Too?

Like the Chiefs, the Packers are one of the most popular NFL teams, including among TV viewers, and the loss of Parsons could impact viewership for the rest of the season. The Packers, however, remain in the mix for the 2025 playoffs, unlike Kansas City, which was eliminated on Sunday. Green Bay, with a 9-4-1 record, currently holds the final playoff slot in the National Football Conference and still has an 88% probability of reaching the postseason.

“I may be sidelined, but I am not defeated,” Parsons said in a social media post. “I will rise again.”

The injury to Adams is not as severe as Parsons’s and Mahomes’s, but the Rams are the first NFC team to clinch a playoff spot and have serious aspirations of a return to the Super Bowl.

Trade Factors

The Packers acquired Parsons just before the start of the regular season in a blockbuster trade with the Cowboys. After that deal, Parsons signed a four-year, $188 million contract with Green Bay, including $136 million in guaranteed money and representing the type of deal he unsuccessfully sought from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.

The pact is the largest for a non-quarterback in league history.

The 12.5 sacks that Parsons registered this season are tied for third in the league, and beyond that statistic, he has been a fixture in a Green Bay defense that ranks sixth in the NFL—showing the immediate payoff from the deal.

Steve Cohen’s $8 billion New York casino, at long last, is officially happening.

The Mets owner and his Metropolitan Park received full approval Monday from the New York State Gaming Commission for a gaming license. The decision paves the way for a large-scale project to be built with Hard Rock International adjacent to Citi Field, with plans including a casino and hotel, 5 acres of green space, playgrounds, a 5,000-seat indoor music venue, a rebuilt transit hub, and a locally inspired food hall, among other amenities.

This last and final regulatory decision was widely expected after the gaming commission’s facility location board formally and unanimously recommended the Metropolitan Park project, along with two other proposals, on Dec. 1.

That board holds significant sway on the final decision, and indeed, the gaming licenses were formally granted to Metropolitan Park, along with Bally’s, which plans a $4 billion resort complex at Ferry Point in the Bronx, and to Resorts World New York City, which proposes to build at the site of the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens.

More directly, though, the Metropolitan Park project aims to convert a sea of asphalt surrounding the Mets’ home ballpark with something far more impactful and vibrant. Cohen, Hard Rock, and their partners have been in active pursuit of the gaming license for several years.

“Since the day I bought the team, the community and Mets fans have made it clear to me that we can and should do better with the area around the ballpark,” Cohen said. “Now, we are going to be able to deliver the sports and entertainment district that our fans have been asking for.”

Construction is expected to begin early next year in anticipation of a June 2030 opening.

Each of the three recipients of the gaming licenses will need to pay an upfront licensing fee of $500 million, commit to another $500 million in capital improvements, and pay annual taxes on the gaming revenue.

Scotland is in the midst of “World Cup fever” after claiming its first berth to the tournament since 1998, and following FIFA’s recent event draw, the country knows its men’s team will start group play in June against Haiti. The Scottish national team, however, has a stark warning for fans: Don’t overextend yourself financially to see us.

In the wake of World Cup ticket prices that soared roughly fivefold compared to the 2022 tournament in Qatar, Scotland team manager Steve Clarke implored fans to watch their wallets as they consider traveling to North America for matches.

“One of my biggest wishes is that people don’t put themselves too much into debt trying to buy tickets,” Clarke said. “Even the cheapest ones look to be pretty pricey.”

FIFA said Scotland is one of the top countries making ticket requests for the upcoming World Cup, beyond the host countries of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico—further signifying the upstart nature of the country’s appearance amid global powers such as neighboring England, 2022 World Cup winner Argentina, France, Brazil, and Germany.

Football Supporters Europe, however, estimated it would cost at least $6,900 for a single fan to follow their team from the start of group-stage play to the final. That fan advocacy group, along with many others around the world, has decried what they describe as “extortionate” practices by FIFA. Compounding the sticker shock is FIFA’s use of dynamic prices for much of its World Cup ticketing.

“Some of the figures are eye-watering, if you look at them,” Clarke said.

Clarke’s comments followed those of Scottish fan group the Association of Tartan Army Clubs, which said that “FIFA has killed the dream of our young fans, desperate to get to a World Cup.”

Robust Demand

Despite the continued global pushback on FIFA’s World Cup ticket pricing, sales continue to be strong. The governing body said it received 5 million ticket requests during its third phase of ticket sales, adding to the nearly 2 million tickets sold during the two prior phases.

For Scotland specifically, the Scottish Football Association has claimed the maximum ticket allocation it can for its matches, amounting to 8% of the available inventory, and it will be distributing those tickets to its member supporter groups. That 8% allocation matches what is happening for all 48 participating countries.

“Tickets are going to be tight,” Clarke said. “The Scottish FA have taken the full allocation. I’m sure it’ll be used.”

With three games left in the 2025 NFL regular season, the Jaguars have already matched their highest win total since 2017, as the franchise rolls toward a likely playoff berth after high-priced leadership changes this offseason.

Jacksonville blew out the Jets 48–20 on Sunday to improve to 10–4 this season, and retain a one-game lead over the Texans in the AFC South. That guarantees the Jaguars their first double-digit win total since 2017, when they went 10–6 and reached the AFC championship game. Before that, the team’s previous best record was an 11–5 mark in 2007.

The improved play on the field comes following a major overhaul of the front office and coaching staff after missing the playoffs the previous two seasons.

First-year head coach Liam Coen is also Jacksonville’s offensive play-caller; he signed a five-year contract in January worth an estimated $12 million annually after turning down an offer to remain with the Buccaneers as the highest-paid offensive coordinator in the NFL.

The pursuit of Coen led the Jaguars to also fire former GM Trent Baalke, who owner Shad Khan originally intended to keep in place despite moving on from former coach Doug Pederson.

Jacksonville then hired former Rams executive James Gladstone, 35, making him the youngest GM in the NFL (and second youngest in league history when he was hired at 34). To complement the youth strategy, the Jaguars also brought in franchise legend Tony Boselli, the team’s only Pro Football Hall of Famer, to serve in the newly created role of EVP of football operations.

The new-look front office made an aggressive move in the 2025 NFL Draft to trade up to the No. 2 pick to select two-way star and Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter, who sustained a season-ending knee injury in October. Despite that injury, Jacksonville has found success under quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 draft, whose five-year, $275 million contract extension kicks in next year.

Home Field Advantage?

Any potential postseason run will come as the Jaguars prepare for extensive renovations at EverBank Stadium that will lower the venue’s capacity in 2026 and reportedly see the team play home games in Orlando in 2027.

The project is expected to cost $1.4 billion and add a roof to the facility, which originally opened in 1995, and underwent a major renovation in 2003 and 2004 that led to Jacksonville hosting Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005.",https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/USATSI_27817753_168416383_lowres-scaled-e1765825592531.jpg?quality=100,N,,2025-12-15 22:59:49.885221

""I mean, it was dark for me at first,"" said McMillan, speaking publicly for the first time since sustaining the injury Aug. 16.
McMillan had to wear a neck brace morning and night -- even while sleeping -- for 3½ months, only taking it off to bathe.
""You want to learn something every day,"" McMillan said.
For weeks and weeks, it was the stair climber and the Peloton bike, before he could even think about running.","TAMPA, Fla. -- Buccaneers wide receiver Jalen McMillan, who returned last week for the first time since suffering three fractured vertebrae in his neck, said Monday that his doctor told him he was almost paralyzed.

""I mean, it was dark for me at first,"" said McMillan, speaking publicly for the first time since sustaining the injury Aug. 16. ""First I felt good and I thought it was just a minor injury and then the doctor said I almost got paralyzed, so it kind of scared me a little bit. And then there was doubt too because I didn't know if I was going to be playing again.""

It happened in the second preseason game at the Pittsburgh Steelers. McMillan leapt up to catch a pass from backup quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and fell awkwardly on the back of his head with his body folded in half. He was able to somehow walk off the field under his own power. He even joked with teammate Sterling Shepard. But that didn't reveal the full extent of his injuries, which coach Todd Bowles originally described as a ""severe neck sprain.""

McMillan had to wear a neck brace morning and night -- even while sleeping -- for 3½ months, only taking it off to bathe. He needed help to perform basic tasks for himself, which went against his natural inclination to be self-sufficient, but he learned to lean on his support system. When he was able to finally leave the house, the stares from people made him uncomfortable.

""I kept having to try to wake up with a positive attitude. At first, I didn't for like a week, two weeks, and I was just sad and depressed,"" said McMillan, whose family lives in California. ""But then the mode switched, I was to wake up, do positive things, find small wins, celebrate small wins throughout the day. It took a lot. And just to get back to that moment, and to just vision and just to see what I could potentially do if I come back -- that's what I was thriving off of and just kept motivating myself off of.""

""It's about embracing your journey really,"" McMillan said. ""It sucked for me because people would tell me like, 'Oh, you're going to be back. Don't worry, you'll be fine.' But then again, in the back of my head it's like, 'I'm not sure if I'll be back, but I'm going to try to approach every day as if I am.' So it just took everything in me. It took waking up reading, finding new hobbies of mine, trying to explore different aspects of my life just so I could try to level up outside of football.""

He went to a bookstore daily to read a new book. His favorites? ""Billy Summers"" by Stephen King, and ""Dark Matter,"" by Blake Crouch. He also took up chess but didn't take too kindly to teammate Mike Evans beating him, so he switched to learning how to cook. And his family came to visit him when they could, doing activities like sunset boat rides.

""You want to learn something every day,"" McMillan said. ""That's what I try to do just to feel brand-new when it came to just waking up, not sitting in my depressed mood, not being sad.""

For weeks and weeks, it was the stair climber and the Peloton bike, before he could even think about running. Then he was cleared to return to practice Dec. 3, along with Evans, who sustained a broken collarbone in Week 7. Both players were activated off of injured reserve Dec. 10.

""When they cleared me, I was really, really emotional,"" McMillan said. ""But during the game, I had seen the vision so many times that the ball -- just seeing the ball came natural just because I dreamed of it back. It feels normal. It felt like I didn't really miss a beat, just my head being in football and just every day being consistent in practice habits, I kind of approached every week like that as if I were playing so that when I came back it didn't feel different or alien.""

In his first catch, he hauled in a 19-yard reception going across the field, which was initially ruled a touchdown before officials overturned it and determined he was down at the 1-yard line. But it set up a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Sean Tucker.

""I wanted it to be known that I'm still the same guy and I didn't really change. If anything, I got better and I'm back now,"" the 2024 third-round draft pick said.

Shepard said it speaks to McMillan's mental strength.

""You go through an injury like that, a lot of times, guys will come back and be hesitant to do things,"" Shepard said. ""J-Mac picked up right where he left off and was able to go in there and make big plays for us the two times that he got the ball. We look forward to seeing what else he's able to do and how he's able to help this offense.""

McMillan said he trusted his doctors when they told him he was fine, and he gained even more trust in his body after his first time going over the middle, which is a vulnerable place for receivers. Still, he recognizes his extraordinarily good fortune, and that things could have been much different. And for that, he's grateful.

""[The doctor] said, 'I have God on my side.' I'm just blessed,"" McMillan said. ""I grew as a person, and I'm just honored to play this game. I want to give everything to this game.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589797_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 22:59:54.452348

A 49ers win in Week 16 vs. the Bears would also mean no other NFC team can get to 13 wins.","You wouldn't think the Super Bowl race could get any more wide open than it already was … then Week 15 happened.

The Chiefs and Bengals were both eliminated, meaning the AFC won't have to go through Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow. That was looking like a formality but I'm sure the rest of the conference is still relieved and believing that anyone can make the Super Bowl now.

Then, just when it looked like two teams (Rams and Packers) were starting to separate themselves in the NFC, they lose two of their star players. Micah Parsons' season is over with a torn ACL, while Davante Adams aggravated a hamstring injury that puts his status in doubt for a crucial matchup vs. the Seahawks on Thursday that could ultimately decide the No. 1 seed in the NFC.

Rams still the favorite, but NFC just got really interesting

I still like the Rams to win the NFC but if anything was going to throw them off it'd be an injury to one of their stars on offense. Adams' injury doesn't look to be season ending and he was optimistic after the game, but the severity is still unknown. Even missing one game could be detrimental to the Rams' Super Bowl hopes, and it's hard to imagine him being ready on a short week after how he went down on Sunday.

The Rams face the Seahawks on Thursday in Seattle and the winner of that game will be in the driver's seat for the top seed in the NFC. The Rams may have beaten the Seahawks earlier this season, but Adams scored a touchdown in that game and they only won by two despite Sam Darnold's horrific four-interception performance.

Adams may not be a WR1 anymore but he's helped elevate Matthew Stafford to an MVP level and he's been a major nightmare for opposing defenses in the red zone. The Rams lead the NFL in offensive efficiency (+8.4 offensive EPA per game) and are third in the NFL in red zone touchdown percentage this season (67%) after ranking 13th and 25th, respectively, in those categories last season.

Adams deserves a lot of credit. He has 11 touchdown catches since Week 7, and nine of them have been on plays inside the opponent's five yard line. He's caught nine of 12 targets for nine touchdowns inside the five in that span. Somehow Stafford to Adams has become as reliable as the Tush Push in short-yardage spots. No other NFL player has more than four catches in that area since Week 7.

With Stafford's ball placement and Adam's combination of size and footwork he's helped the Rams cash in on their scoring opportunities. He put Riq Woolen on skates with this slant route for a 1-yard score vs. Seattle earlier this year.

He caught a fade here vs. the Buccaneers. Adams' nine touchdowns in goal-to-go situations are only surpassed by one other player since 2000. It was Adams in 2020 when he had 12.

While Adams could miss an extended period of time and the injury is obviously not ideal, there's several reasons to believe they could weather the storm. The Rams beat the Jaguars 35-7 in Week 7, their only game without Puka Nacua this season. They are extremely balanced and the only team that ranks top five in the NFL in offensive and defensive efficiency.

The Rams have used 13 personnel (one running, three tight ends) more than twice as much as any other team in the NFL since Nacua was hurt in Week 7 (41%). The recent switch to this personnel is another reason to believe they can manage without Adams for now. The Rams are averaging an NFL-high 35.0 PPG since they started using this heavy personnel in Week 7. They are still averaging a ridiculous 6.3 yards per play in those groups. They rank second in the NFL pass success rate (63%) and rush success rate (50%) vs. base defenses in that span so that personnel is allowing Stafford to pick apart mismatches while they are still running the ball effectively.

The Rams run game looks poised to carry more of that burden, too. They rank top four in the NFL in rushing (186.7 yards per game) and yards per rush (6.5) in the past three weeks with the emergence of Blake Corum in the backfield with Kyren Williams. They are the only duo in at least the last 90 seasons with 70+ rushing yards and a rushing touchdown a piece in three straight games.

Of course, the door is more open for almost everyone else in the NFC should this slow the Rams down. The Seahawks are the biggest beneficiary. They control their own destiny in the NFC and they'll take any edge they can get when they host the Rams in three days.

The Eagles, Bears and 49ers have to feel like they have a chance, too.

NFL Week 15 overreactions: Micah Parsons injury ends Packers' Super Bowl hopes? Josh Allen for MVP?

Tyler Sullivan

Parsons injury crushes Packers' Super Bowl hopes; NFC North up for grabs

Those teams all benefit from the Packers' misfortune, too. I would argue they were the second best team in the NFC, until they weren't. Everything was looking up for the Packers midway through Sunday's game until all of the air came out of the balloon and a potential dream season turned to a nightmare.

The Packers were up 23-14 in the third quarter when Jordan Love's interception cost Green Bay the ball and his top weapon as Christian Watson left the game with a chest injury and did not return. Later in the quarter Parsons suffered his season-ending torn ACL. The Packers got dominated the rest of the way and fell from the No. 2 seed to the No. 7 seed in the NFC. They were on the verge of beating a playoff-caliber team in three straight games (Lions, Bears, Broncos) and looking like they had as good of a case as anyone to win Super Bowl LX.

Now, Green Bay looks destined to go one-and-done again. This was a team that was 0-7 vs. 11+ win teams in 2024 when they did not have Parsons. They made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history and traded two first-round picks for the generational talent to put them over the top in the postseason and in games like Sunday's. Then, in the blink of an eye, those hopes evaporated. You could argue they could bounce back from this. The 49ers have grinded out wins without Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, after all. That's also a highly motivated team coming off a Super Bowl hangover season with an easy schedule. The 49ers have also gone from 13th to last in the NFL in pressure rate since Bosa's injury. I don't see how the Packers rebound from this crushing loss in the stretch run of the season.

That's the task though and they'll barely have time to lick their wounds as they play the Bears at Soldier Field on Saturday night with the NFC North on the line. The Bears now have the edge in the division given these injuries and how they just played the Packers in Green Bay. Parsons may have gotten off a slow start with the Packers after his contract dispute with Dallas and a back injury this offseason but he was still having a dominant season. He became the first player in NFL history with 12+ sacks in each of his first five seasons. He ranks second in the NFL in pressure rate this year (20%) and he led the NFL in that category since Week 10 (23%), which included a game with seven pressures vs. the Bears in Week 14. His absence could help put Chicago over the top. Caleb Williams has the lowest completion percentage (38%) in the NFL vs. pressure this season. Just as the Cowboys defense has struggled all season without Parsons, it's hard to imagine Green Bay won't take a step back here, too.

Don't overlook Watson's injury, either. The Packers reportedly got some good news on his injury but it's unclear whether he will miss time. His reemergence elevated Green Bay to a top-flight offense as he ranked sixth in the NFL in yards per route (2.64) in the past five weeks behind Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, CeeDee Lamb, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Nico Collins (minimum 100 routes). He's added an element of explosiveness back into the passing game evidenced by two touchdowns vs. the Bears in Week 14. All of a sudden, Green Bay could be without two of its most important players in a game that will probably decide the division in Week 16.

The 49ers have a path to the one seed in the NFC

The biggest winner in the NFC besides the Seahawks is the 49ers. Besides finally having another NFC contender share in their injury misery, San Francisco's surprising path to the top seed in the NFC just got intriguing. The 49ers are 10-4 and will be the top seed in the conference if they win out and the Seahawks beat the Rams on Thursday.

The 49ers final three games are at the Colts and then at home vs. the Bears and Seahawks. If they win out they'll finish the year 13-4 with a 5-1 division record, including 3-1 vs. the Rams and Seahawks. That would give them any tiebreaker over their NFC West rivals if Seattle beats Los Angeles on Thursday. A 49ers win in Week 16 vs. the Bears would also mean no other NFC team can get to 13 wins.

The 49ers have been flying under the radar all season as they've played the second-easiest schedule in the NFC (only the Bears is easier). I've written them of myself after Brock Purdy threw three interceptions on Monday night vs. the Panthers. Especially since they already have a defense that's last in the NFL in sacks and without Bosa and Warner. But, this is a very well coached team with Robert Saleh back in the fold and Christian McCaffrey is having a spectacular season. If they can beat the odds and steal the top seed after Rams and Packers losses, who's to say they couldn't ride home-field advantage to Super Bowl LX, which will be at their home stadium.

That would be an incredible story that went from impossible to improbable after these injuries. There's also speculation that Warner could be aiming to make a return should the 49ers make a deep playoff run, although that still seems unlikely.

“He lost the game in heartbreaking fashion, and then did not win a playoff game — one game — the next three years.","There is no bigger Chiefs fan among the national TV sports talk-show hosts than Nick Wright.

After the Chiefs’ playoff hopes were extinguished in a 16-13 loss to the Chargers, Wright wrote in an X post about KC’s dynastic run.

“It’s been a totally surreal 7 year run,” Wright wrote. “5 Super Bowl trips, 3 Rings, played in the Conference Championship game every single year. Everything caught up with them this year & they just didn’t have it. No shame in that, just is what it is. Now we just pray Patrick is OK.”

Unfortunately for the Chiefs, quarterback Patrick Mahomes is not OK. He has a torn ACL in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season.

Mahomes’ ninth season will end with him watching the Chiefs missing the playoffs. In an odd coincidence, NFL legend Tom Brady suffered a torn ACL in his knee during his ninth season. That came in the Patriots’ opener, which was against the Chiefs.

New England missed the playoffs that season.

But the career trajectories of Mahomes and Brady aren’t similar just because of the knee injury.

Wright had talked with Bill Simmons about the parallel trajectory of the careers of Brady and Mahomes in a podcast episode that was released Thursday.

“Some very odd and scary, for me at least, similarities. Tom Brady in his seventh year as a starter, stepped on the field in the Super Bowl, trying to win his fourth ring, knowing if we win this game, I am considered the undisputed goat, and this is considered the greatest team of all-time,” Wright said. “He lost the game in heartbreaking fashion, and then did not win a playoff game — one game — the next three years. Now, first year of that was tragic, Week 1, he gets his knee blown out ...

“Patrick in year seven, was playing for ring four, trying to become the undisputed greatest team ever if they pull off the three-peat, they lose that Super Bowl in very different fashion. He doesn’t get hurt the next year, but it looks like they’re going to be out of the tournament in year eight, and that scares me.”

Wright couldn’t have guessed that Mahomes would face a similar injury to Brady, who missed nearly the entire 2008 season. But that’s what happened just days after Wright talked about the Mahomes-Brady connection.

That strange connection between the careers of Mahomes and Brady wasn’t only noted by Wright. Others on social media made similar comparisons.

He provided several key injury updates.

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall aggravated his PCL injury and is also dealing with an ankle injury. His practice availability this week remains unclear.

Left guard Spencer Burford received encouraging test results after suffering an ankle injury against the Titans. Shanahan confirmed it was not a high-ankle sprain, and Burford is expected to return to practice this week.

Linebacker Nick Martin remains in the NFL concussion protocol.

What's the 49ers' level of concern with Pearsall's injury?

""There is a concern, I think, just seeing kind of how those have gone this year,"" Shanahan admitted. ""The ankle, it was a tough ankle injury, but it checked out. That it wasn't a high and he was able to get through the game is somewhat encouraging. That shouldn't rule him out for this week. But that combined with the knee, I mean, he aggravated it, which is something.""

Shanahan noted that Pearsall landed on his knee, causing some pain and lasting discomfort.

""So, hopefully, it's not at all like it was when he first did it, but it does take time for that pain to go away, and hopefully, that'll be sooner than later over these next eight days,"" Shanahan added.

Other injury updates

Shanahan also said the 49ers expect several players to return to practice this week, including defensive end Sam Okuayinonu (ankle), defensive tackle Jordan Elliott (knee), and linebackers Tatum Bethune (ankle) and Eric Kendricks (calf). Okuayinonu, Elliott, and Bethune were inactive against the Titans, while Kendricks has been sidelined with calf tightness.

Shanahan was asked if Kendricks has a chance to be elevated from the practice squad and contribute in the game against the Indianapolis Colts.

""Yeah, if he was totally healthy,"" Shanahan said. ""But that's with all of them. Same with Tatum, coming back from his high-ankle, we're not sure how they're going to look. So we'll get him in there, see how it goes. We should get two full-speed practices in, which should give us a good idea.

""But we've been short these last couple of weeks, especially losing these guys, with Nick Martin. That's why we had to take guys off other teams to get them up last week. So, they've got to get back into practice first, show us where they're at and stuff, and how it's going. And that'll give us a chance to make some decisions ... come Saturday.""

Growing List

The injury to the standout Parsons adds to a similar injury on Sunday for Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is also out for the rest of the season, and Rams receiver Davante Adams, who sustained a hamstring injury against the Lions. Parsons tore the ligament while in pursuit of Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, but it was a noncontact injury.

Mahomes is also facing an extended recovery.

“[It] would be extremely fast for Mahomes to play in Week 1 next year,” said Tom Christ of Motion Stability Physical Therapy Group. “Some players have returned that fast, so not impossible, but fast.”

Will Ratings Be Hurt, Too?

Like the Chiefs, the Packers are one of the most popular NFL teams, including among TV viewers, and the loss of Parsons could impact viewership for the rest of the season. The Packers, however, remain in the mix for the 2025 playoffs, unlike Kansas City, which was eliminated on Sunday. Green Bay, with a 9-4-1 record, currently holds the final playoff slot in the National Football Conference and still has an 88% probability of reaching the postseason.

“I may be sidelined, but I am not defeated,” Parsons said in a social media post. “I will rise again.”

The injury to Adams is not as severe as Parsons’s and Mahomes’s, but the Rams are the first NFC team to clinch a playoff spot and have serious aspirations of a return to the Super Bowl.

Trade Factors

The Packers acquired Parsons just before the start of the regular season in a blockbuster trade with the Cowboys. After that deal, Parsons signed a four-year, $188 million contract with Green Bay, including $136 million in guaranteed money and representing the type of deal he unsuccessfully sought from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.

Chargers played dirty, and bad officiating encouraged dirty play.

2. Pat’s injury was unrelated to the dirty play.

That said, if his injury starts a conversation on how bad officiating is encouraging dirty play, I’d be ok with that. Refs really need to do better.

The NFL is and has been actively proving they don’t favor the Chiefs by ignoring most penalties against them the whole season.

Nothing is going to change. They have a point to prove and they’re going to stick to it.

People thought this was due to a dirty play? News to me.

The only dirty mother fucker, Jefferson, got ejected earlier in the game. We don't need a Burfict 2.0 in the league. Dude's bad for the NFL.

The contact on that play had nothing to do with Mahomes’ injury and it wasn’t “dirty” either. Anyone who thinks it was a dirty play either really needs to go and rewatch the play or get a grip.

That said, Chargers were out there looking to cause some pain. Was pretty surprised by Jefferson’s ejection, but he was running around like a missile out there, and guessing the refs were telling him to slow it down a bit beforehand hit on Thornton.

I actually do think that was a dirty play by the defender. I get all the ""he's just playing hard, it's part of the game"" arguments. The fact is the dude dove at Patrick's legs after the ball was out of his hand. That's a dirty play.

i'm guessing dude wrote a whole article off of ONE tweet. Because nowhere in my mind did i think that specific play was dirty.

With that said...other plays in that game were dirty and i do think the refs sort of gave the Chargers a greenlight to light our receivers up. Then eventually when Thornton got laid out, the refs had to kind of clean up their own mistakes and eject that player.

Never see our players do shit when Mahomes takes a late hit. Every other teams OL gets in the opposing players ass immediately following a play. This team of players doesn’t protect Patrick. They just allow teams to tee off on him and half the time it’s the OL’s absolute shit blocking that causes the biggest hits. Andy is too lenient with the players. And it shows in the penalties and discipline the last two seasons.",,N,,2025-12-15 21:00:16.842096

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead.

The Packers are still in the hunt for the NFC North, and even if the Bears end up nabbing the division title, Green Bay is still in the mix for a wild card spot at 9-4-1. Unfortunately, they’ll likely have to go on that run without their top defender, Micah Parsons. The former Cowboys defender was closing in on Broncos Bo Nix when he suffered a non-contact knee injury and immediately fell to the ground. Initial concerns were that Parsons tore his ACL, and that turned out to be the base, and will keep him out for a long time.

Parson’s teammates stayed positive after their Week 15 loss to the Broncos, and said they still feel confident that the team has all the pieces for a Super Bowl run.

One of the league’s top edge rushers wasn’t the only one with a crushing injury, Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL just minutes before Kansas City was officially eliminated from playoff contention. It will be the first time in Mahomes career that he’ll miss the postseason, and now he has a long recovery ahead of him while he and the organization figure out what’s next for a dying dynasty.

Additional testing is still needed, but Ravens LB Teddye Buchanan, the team’s second-leading tackler, is also thought to have torn his ACL, and Rams WR Davante Adams suffered what is being called a significant hamstring injury.

It’s late in the season, and football is a sport in which players get injured at any point, but as the playoffs approach, the injuries are certainly more impactful.

The last time the Browns allowed consecutive 100-plus rushing yard games this season was in Week 10 against the Jets and Week 11 against the Ravens. On the season, the Browns allow 110.1 rushing yards per game – the 14th-fewest rushing yards in the NFL. Cleveland has allowed 131.3 rushing yards per game since Week 10. The Browns gave up just 94.3 rushing yards per game in the eight games before Week 10, playing tight defense against the run.

The Browns have allowed three special teams touchdowns this season and gave a blocked punt in Week 14 against the Titans.

NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported that Warren would receive fluids and was optimistic he'd play, and now, he’s officially active for the primetime contest. Warren’s averaging a career-best 77.4 scrimmage yards per game in his first year as the team’s full-time starter following the departure of Najee Harris in the offseason. Should he be limited in any capacity, Kenneth Gainwell should see an increase in work, quietly having a career year with the black and gold as a complement to Warren.

The rest of Week 15 was headlined by injuries to star players, comebacks, and clarity on playoff positioning. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes left Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers with a torn ACL, and his team was eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in his career.

On the NFC side, Green Bay Packers trade acquisition Micah Parsons suffered what is feared to be a torn ACL in Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos. Parsons has totaled 12.5 sacks, 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble in his first season with the Packers.

The Bills and Rams both had second-half comebacks on the road, both of which could have massive playoff implications down the line. The Bills' 21-point comeback gave them a 35-31 win over the Patriots, ending New England’s 10-game winning streak and a 120-game winning streak when leading by 17+ points at home. The Rams cut a 10-point deficit to beat the Lions 41-34.

The playoff chances for the Lions, Panthers and Colts took a huge hit after each suffered tough losses on Sunday. The Lions stumbled in the second half against the Rams in Jared Goff's return to LA, while the Panthers were stunned by the Saints. Forty-four-year-old Philip Rivers' return after a five-year absence was spoiled when a costly interception sealed a win for the Seahawks.

The Rams and Broncos both clinched their spots in the playoffs with their respective wins on Sunday, currently sitting as the No. 1 seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively.

The Washington Commanders will shut down the quarterback for the rest of the 2025 season, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Monday, per sources informed of the situation.

Rapoport added that Daniels was re-evaluated on Monday and is not yet cleared after he aggravated an elbow injury in Week 14.

Commanders head coach Dan Quinn later confirmed that Daniels will miss the final three games, adding the decision to shut him down was ""part medical, part team."" Quinn told reporters, however, that Daniels would continue to participate in practice this year.

The 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year has suffered through an injury-riddled second season.

Daniels suffered a knee sprain in Week 2, forcing him to miss two contests. He returned in Week 5 but made it through just two tilts before a hamstring strain in Week 7 caused him to miss one game.

The QB returned in Week 9 and suffered a gruesome elbow injury late in a blowout loss. Daniels missed three tilts with the elbow injury. In Week 14, he exited early in a shutout loss after falling on his elbow after an interception. Daniels did not play in the Commanders' 29-21 win on Sunday against the New York Giants.

There will be no fourth return in 2025.

After a sensational 12-5 rookie campaign, Daniels saw his numbers fall across the board, even when on the field.

He completed 60.9 percent of his passes for 1,262 yards with eight touchdowns and three interceptions in seven games. The quarterback added 58 rush attempts for 278 yards and two scores. The Commanders went 2-5 in Daniels' seven starts.

The decision to shut down Daniels makes sense for a Washington club that was eliminated from postseason contention earlier this month.

The hope is that the rest will allow the dynamic QB to get fully healthy heading into the 2026 campaign.

Marcus Mariota, who started Sunday's win, which broke an eight-game losing skid, will remain the starter. Veteran Josh Johnson is also on the roster, with Sam Hartman on the practice squad.

Washington's medical staff re-evaluated Daniels today, but he did not receive clearance to return, NFL Media reports. If he was not cleared for the Week 16 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles, Daniels' next opportunity to play would have come on a short week against the Dallas Cowboys. Ultimately, the Commanders just shut him down.

Less than one month ago, Commanders coach Dan Quinn said he wanted Daniels to play when healthy in order to develop -- no matter if Washington was in playoff contention or not.

""I think it's important as Jayden's ... learning to play this position at the highest level competitively, also doing it safely, and those are reps, you know, that you develop as well,"" Quinn said.. ""It's a skill, just like throwing and processing. And so, all those things are important.""

During the New York Giants' 29–21 loss to the Washington Commanders, the rookie quarterback left the game early in the fourth quarter to be examined under the NFL's concussion protocol. He missed two snaps before being cleared to return to action.

It marked the fifth time in just 10 games (including preseason) that Dart has been checked for a possible concussion.

After the game, Dart made it clear he didn't think the evaluation was necessary. ""Definitely feel there is a sensitivity for some reason,"" he said.

On the play in question, the Giants had first-and-goal from the 1-yard line when Dart faked a pitch and ran straight up the middle, where he was sandwiched by Commanders defensive linemen Eddie Goldman and Javon Kinlaw. His neck bent awkwardly on contact, and officials immediately signaled for the Giants' medical staff.

""Definitely wasn't the first time I was surprised I had to come out,"" he said. ""But I was definitely surprised. It didn't feel like it was that big of a hit at all.""

While it's easy to understand why a quarterback would be frustrated about being removed from the game — especially in a red zone situation — the league has good reason to be abundantly cautious.

The NFL has faced intense scrutiny in recent years over how it handles head injuries, particularly after high-profile concussion situations involving Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Those incidents sparked league-wide backlash, protocol changes and renewed pressure on teams and officials to err on the side of caution.

Dart himself missed two games earlier this season after suffering a concussion against the Chicago Bears.

Whether Dart agrees with every evaluation or not, he's at risk if he keeps taking heavy contact, and learning to better protect himself has to be a priority. Lest he become another cautionary tale.

All of this is unfolding during a rough season for the Giants. They sit at 2–12, last place in the NFC East, and have lost eight straight games.",https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/12/display-media-36.png,N,,2025-12-15 18:02:35.484547

Parsons went immediately to the locker room and was ruled out of the game in the fourth quarter.
There's obvious disappointment that accompanies Parsons' injury, but both McKinney and Gary acknowledge this remains a Green Bay defense that had lofty goals even before trading for the four-time Pro Bowl pass rusher.","DENVER – On a day in which injuries seemed to come in an endless wave for the Packers, the loss of Micah Parsons weighed heavily on the mind of Green Bay's team on Sunday evening.

In the aftermath of a 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos, Rashan Gary immediately went to check on his fellow defensive linemen after Parsons suffered a non-contact knee injury late in the third quarter at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium.

The disappointment of the defeat paled in comparison to Parsons' departure. When first asked about Parsons' injury, Gary paused for 12 seconds while holding back emotions.

""When I came in, I told him to keep his head up and we're gonna finish strong for him,"" Gary said. ""That's what I told him. I'm gonna keep in contact with him throughout what he's doing. That was my first message to him. It hurt. It hurt.""

Acquired in a blockbuster trade back with Dallas in August, Parsons has had an immeasurable impact on defense since his arrival.

Heading into Sunday's game, Parsons was in the conversation for NFL Defensive Player of the Year with 39 tackles, 26 quarterback hits and 12½ sacks in 13 games.

Everything came to a crashing halt with the Packers clinging to a 23-21 lead late in the third quarter. Parsons had just disengaged with right tackle Mike McGlinchey in pursuit of Broncos quarterback Bo Nix when he awkwardly planted his foot and fell to the ground.

Parsons went immediately to the locker room and was ruled out of the game in the fourth quarter. Asked whether the team fears an ACL tear, Head Coach Matt LaFleur told reporters after the game: ""It doesn't look good.""

""Obviously it sucks when anybody gets injured,"" safety Xavier McKinney said. ""It's a big loss for our defense, for our team, but the next guy got to step up, so, it is what it is, but I'm praying that … it's not like too, too crazy.""

Parsons was in midst of yet another strong game. He had two tackles, drew a holding penalty, deflected a pass and forced a fumble in the first quarter that Edgerrin Cooper recovered, resulting in a 53-yard Brandon McManus field goal that put Green Bay on the board.

The Packers led 23-14 early in the third quarter before things quickly unraveled, beginning with Patrick Surtain's interception of Jordan Love on a deep ball on first down. Christian Watson, the intended target, left the game with a chest injury and didn't return.

Denver's second-year quarterback Bo Nix kept building momentum throughout the second half and drove the Broncos into Packers' territory, completing an 11-yard pass to Marvin Mims on the same play Parsons was injured.

Denver pulled ahead, 27-23, three plays after Parsons' exit on a 23-yard touchdown pass to Troy Franklin. Green Bay never led again in the game.

Nix completed 23 of 34 passes for 304 yards and four touchdowns (134.7 passer rating) while the Broncos went 4-for-4 in the red zone compared to Green Bay's 1-for-4.

""Obviously, we probably wish we could've gotten some plays back … but at the end of the day, that's a good team,"" McKinney said. ""They've got good coaches and we'll run into them again. They're on the other side obviously but hopefully we see them in the Super Bowl, but just keep going, keep fighting and it's not over yet.""

There's obvious disappointment that accompanies Parsons' injury, but both McKinney and Gary acknowledge this remains a Green Bay defense that had lofty goals even before trading for the four-time Pro Bowl pass rusher.

The Packers also got 2023 first-round pick Lukas Van Ness back from a foot injury on Sunday while Brenton Cox Jr. nears a return from the groin injury that sidelined him since September.

After talking with Parsons, Gary said he pulled the defense together and to remind the unit what would be required for one of the NFL's top defenses to overcome the potential loss of one of the league's best players.

As much as the potential loss of Parsons hurts, Green Bay has a key NFC North matchup in six days against the Chicago Bears, who jumped back atop the division with a dominant win over Cleveland on Sunday.

""For the rest of the season, what we got? Three more opportunities? Watch how the front play,"" Gary said. ""We had a meeting at the end, brought all the guys up, understanding that there's gonna be a lot of opportunities the next three weeks and we gotta take advantage of it, so you gonna see how we play.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/napflsww5ojyutt0zfuz,N,,2025-12-15 22:01:59.689350

Let’s dive in.

NFL Week 15 Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs

Patrick Mahomes unfortunately suffered a torn ACL this weekend, ending his season and putting the start of the 2026 season in doubt. Kansas City was also eliminated from playoff contention. This is a huge hit, as Mahomes returned to being an elite fantasy asset in 2025.

Geno Smith, Las Vegas Raiders

Pete Carroll declined to give any major update on Smith on Monday, leading me to believe it’s more likely than not that he’s inactive this weekend against the Texans. Practice reports will likely tell most of the story here, but I’m expecting Kenny Pickett to get another start.

Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders

Dan Quinn confirmed today that Daniels will be shut down for the remainder of the season. Daniels had a tough sophomore campaign in the NFL, and this unceremonious end to the season means Marcus Mariota will likely be the starter the rest of the way.

NFL Week 15 Injury Report: Running Backs

Woody Marks, Houston Texans

In his first chance to be the true workhorse, Marks ultimately left the contest with an ankle injury and did not return, though head coach DeMeco Ryans said he could’ve returned, but they were already down heavily. Jahwar Jordan had 100 yards in relief of Marks, and may be the best option should Chubb and Marks not be able to return this weekend.

Devin Neal, New Orleans Saints

Neal suffered a hamstring injury and left Sunday’s game against the Panthers. With Kamara and Neal both injured, the Saints may turn to Evan Hull and Audric Estime next week, and maybe some increased work for Taysom Hill.

NFL Week 15 Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Rome Odunze, Chicago Bears

Rome was expected to play, but aggravated his heel injury in pre-game warmups and was ultimately inactive. Chicago faces Green Bay this week, with a chance to separate at the top of the NFC North, so Rome’s absence will certainly be felt. Head coach Ben Johnson has stated that all options are on the table at this point.

Luther Burden, Chicago Bears

Burden suffered an ankle injury Sunday and is day-to-day, per head coach Ben Johnson. This would be a major hit to the offense, with Rome also likely being out this Saturday. DJ Moore becomes a fringe WR2 if both are out.

Christian Watson, Green Bay Packers

Watson suffered a chest/shoulder injury and had to be taken to the hospital as a result. He has since been released and is returning to Green Bay, but his status for Saturday is up in the air.

Quentin Johnston, Los Angeles Chargers

Johnston was inactive this weekend with a groin injury, and his status for this coming weekend is also in the air. The Chargers struggled to move the ball, but also eliminated the Chiefs from playoff contention in their win. Johnston’s return to the lineup makes the offense more dynamic, so they’re likely hoping he can return this weekend.

Davante Adams, Los Angeles Rams

Adams aggravated the hamstring injury he was dealing with, and as a result, left the contest. He’s also unlikely to play Thursday, but has not been ruled out at this time. Monitor reports here throughout the week.

Drake London, Atlanta Falcons

After missing time with his knee injury, London is currently expected to return to action this weekend. We will need to keep an eye on injury reports throughout the week, but the team is very hopeful that he’ll return to action.",https://d29m18w01sxjzp.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/source/fatest/patrick_mahomes_nfl_injury_report_week_16-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 18:02:39.790427

The move marks the second starter the Buccaneers have placed on injured reserve in as many weeks, after losing guard Ben Bredeson to a knee injury in Week 15.
McCollum started 13 of the first 14 games of the season, missing one game in Week Six after undergoing surgery on his thumb.
The Buccaneers signed McCollum to a three-year contract extension just before the start of the 2025 regular season.
He has also played in and started three postseason games, all with Indianapolis, adding 12 tackles and a tackle for loss.","Facing a three-week stretch that will determine the 2025 champion of the NFC South, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers opened Week 16 with a round of roster moves, including the move of starting cornerback Zyon McCollum to injured reserve.

McCollum sustained a hip injury in last Thursday's loss to the Atlanta Falcons. He now must miss a minimum of four games before returning to the active roster, which means he will sidelined for at least the rest of the regular season. The move marks the second starter the Buccaneers have placed on injured reserve in as many weeks, after losing guard Ben Bredeson to a knee injury in Week 15.

The Buccaneers used the open spot on their 53-man roster to bring back linebacker Anthony Walker, signing him off the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad. Walker signed with the Bucs as an unrestricted free agent in March but was unable to participate in training camp due to a non-football injury and was released in the final roster cuts to 53 players on August 26.

Tampa Bay also made a change to its practice squad, signing defensive lineman C.J. Brewer and releasing wide receiver Brandon Johnson. Brewer had been on the Bucs' active roster until he was released last Wednesday when the team activated wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan off injured reserve.

McCollum started 13 of the first 14 games of the season, missing one game in Week Six after undergoing surgery on his thumb. He ranks fifth on the team with 65 tackles and has added one tackle for loss, one interception and six passes defensed. In his career, the 2022 fifth-round pick has played in 60 games with 42 starts and has recorded three interceptions, 33 passes defensed, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery to go with 239 tackles. The Buccaneers signed McCollum to a three-year contract extension just before the start of the 2025 regular season.

Walker is in his ninth season after being drafted in the fifth round by the Colts in 2017. He played four seasons in Indianapolis, three as a full-time starter, before signing with the Browns as an unrestricted free agent in 2021. After three seasons in Cleveland, in which he started 27 of the 28 games he played, he once again became an unrestricted free agent and moved on to Miami Dolphins for one season in 2024. He has logged a total of 99 games and 83 starts over eight seasons has amassed 581 tackles, 5.5 sacks, 26 tackles for loss, four interceptions, 21 passes defensed, two forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries in regular-season play.

Mahomes was scrambling to complete a pass down the right sideline with the Chiefs needing to beat the Los Angeles Chargers to keep their slim postseason hopes alive.

The Chiefs quarterback was taken from behind in a fairly innocuous tackle but was in immediate pain as he clutched at his left knee.

Mahomes went for an MRI after the game where it was confirmed that he had torn his ACL.

It was the same knee that had been giving Mahomes problems all week, with the superstar quarterback spotted putting a heating pad on it during last week’s game against Houston.

During his weekly interview on 96.5 The Fan, Mahomes was asked about the injury and tried to play it down.

“I feel like I’ve played a football season,” Mahomes said.

“You know, everybody’s kind of banged up and has his things here and there, but I’ll be ready to go, and I’m excited to get back out there on the football field and try to do whatever I can to get back in a better mindset of winning.”

The Chiefs entered Monday’s game still a chance of qualifying for the postseason, but they needed to beat the Chargers while also requiring the Bills to either lose to or tie with the Patriots, the Jets to beat the Jaguars and the Cardinals to defeat the Texans.

Buffalo, however, rallied from an early 14-0 deficit to topple New England 35-31 while both Houston and Jacksonville breezed to big wins.

While the immediate concern is Mahomes’ injury, attention will soon turn to what offseason changes may be necessary for an AFC heavyweight that had usually been an automatic staple of the NFL postseason.

In fact, the Chiefs had made three straight Super Bowl appearances despite the roster being far from perfect in all of those seasons, with the defence playing at a high enough level last year to make up for an offence that struggled to create many explosives.

This year, however, there were just far too many problems for Mahomes to overcome.

Specifically, injuries decimated the offensive line while the passing attack also lacked a consistent man-beater to really test defences.

The run game was also uninspiring, with both Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco struggling to produce much more than what was blocked for them.

Of course, the Chiefs could also be down one of Mahomes’ most trustworthy weapons next season with uncertainty surrounding veteran tight end Travis Kelce’s playing future.

SUPER BOWL CONTENDERS SWEAT ON MAJOR INJURIES

While Kansas City’s season is over, the Los Angeles Rams and Green Bay Packers are top Super Bowl contenders but both teams potentially suffered serious injury setbacks in Week 15.

The Packers, riding high off the back of four-straight wins, fell 34-26 to the Denver Broncos, who improved to 12-2 with an 11th-straight victory — the longest active streak in the NFL.

Only compounding the loss for Green Bay, star pass rusher Micah Parsons — who the Packers landed in a blockbuster trade before the season — went down with a non-contact injury.

While an MRI will be needed to determine the full extent of the injury, there are fears Parson suffered a torn ACL.

The Packers also lost top receiver Christian Watson, who was playing the best football of his career after returning from a torn ACL, to a chest injury.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Rams beat the Detroit Lions 41-34 in a thriller but it came at a cost with veteran receiver Davante Adams appearing to suffer a serious hamstring injury.

Adams came up lame when tracking down a Matthew Stafford pass in the third quarter and limped off the field, having already been on the injury report throughout the week with a hamstring issue.

It would be a big loss for Los Angeles ahead of a crucial NFC match-up next week against Seattle, who survived a massive scare in a 18-16 win over the Indianapolis Colts.

The Colts, quarterbacked by 44-year-old Hall of Fame candidate Philip Rivers, looked on the verge of an unlikely win against one of the NFL’s most fearsome defences.

But in the end it was the boot of Jason Myers that proved the difference, with the Seahawks kicker slotting six field goals in the win.

BILLS STUN PATRIOTS IN BIG COMEBACK TO KEEP AFC EAST HOPES ALIVE

Elsewhere, Josh Allen fired the Buffalo Bills to a stunning comeback win against the Patriots.

The Bills’ 35-31 victory -- after having trailed 21-0 -- in sub-freezing conditions ended high-flying New England’s 10-game winning streak and kept the AFC East division title race alive.

“What makes this team this team -- we’re not out of it, we’re going to continue to fight one play at a time, no matter what the score is,” said Allen.

Reigning NFL Most Valuable Player Allen orchestrated five consecutive drives with touchdowns, at least temporarily thwarting the Patriots’ bid to reclaim the division title from Buffalo for the first time in five years.

The result underlined Buffalo’s status as a strong Super Bowl favorite despite inconsistent form this season.

“Obviously, the last five-ish years, we’ve found sustained success, but never been able to punch our ticket to the Super Bowl,” said Allen.

“And the end of the goal, that’s every team’s dream.”

The Patriots had been utterly dominant in the first quarter, with quarterback Drake Maye rushing for two touchdowns in the snow and rookie TreVeyon Henderson running 52 yards for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead.

The Bills battled back. Allen found James Cook and Dawson Knox with touchdown passes on either side of half-time.

Cook then barely kept the ball airborne as he stretched across the line for a third Buffalo touchdown that was initially ruled out by officials, before Allen seized the lead with a powerful 14-yard sling to Knox.

Henderson briefly reclaimed the advantage for New England with a stunning 65-yard sprint for a touchdown. But Cook barged through the Patriots line for the game-winning touchdown score.

New England -- who dominated the NFL in the Tom Brady era of the 2000s and 2010s but have faced a difficult rebuild -- still have three more regular season games to claim the AFC East, which they lead over the Bills by a single game.

Elsewhere, the Baltimore Ravens ended Cincinnati’s slim playoff hopes with a dominant 24-0 win, their defense shutting out Bengals star quarterback Joe Burrow.

And Jacksonville quarterback Trevor Lawrence managed five passing touchdowns and one rushing score as the Jaguars demolished the New York Jets 48-20.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a0fd7ca44a6a3d937078de380b685a7f,N,,2025-12-15 22:02:04.026192

The Packers also saw wideout Christian Watson go down with a chest or shoulder injury during the Week 15 loss to the Denver Broncos, but it appears he will be OK.

Watson avoided major injury, but it is unclear if he will miss any time, NFL Media reports. Watson, who caught three passes for 29 yards before exiting the matchup, suffered an injury in the third quarter while attempting to haul in a deep pass from Jordan Love.

The Packers offense struggled in crunch time in Denver, scoring just three points on their final six drives after racking up 23 points on the first five possessions. The play in which Watson was injured was the turning point, as the Broncos went on to out-score the Packers, 20-3, following Patrick Surtain II's interception.

The loss of Parsons is a massive one for the Packers defense, but it appears the offense avoided catastrophe on the Watson front.

Bam Knight, RB, Cardinals (ankle): Knight was carted off the field on Sunday after suffering a ""bad"" ankle sprain.
Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, Knight is unlikely to play in Week 16 against the Falcons.

Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in Week 15's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. The Chiefs were also eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since 2014 with the loss. You're likely navigating your fantasy football playoffs after advancing from Week 15. Below we're going to go over the NFL injury report for Week 16 with the latest on all the key injuries, plus fantasy football analysis.

Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs (knee): With Mahomes done for the season, Gardner Minshew will man the offense the next two weeks against the Titans and Broncos before Week 18 vs. the Raiders. It's a downgrade for a passing game that was already wildly inconsistent most of the season. Rashee Rice and Travis Kelce will lose some ceiling but we've seen Minshew Mania sustain an offense as recently as 2023 with the Colts. Perhaps with the season done, Andy Reid and the offense will give rookies Brashard Smith and Jalen Royals some run.

Bhayshul Tuten, RB, Jaguars (finger): This isn't all that impactful given what we've seen from Jaguars RB Travis Etienne Jr. this season. But Tuten left in Week 15 and was unable to return in a blowout win over the Jets. Jacksonville may have just been proceeding with caution on the rookie RB's injury. Tuten had only two touches for 23 yards but one was a 16-yard TD catch. If Tuten is out, Etienne becomes an even stronger RB1/2 option, though he faces a tough task in Week 16 vs. the Broncos.

Devin Neal, RB, Saints (hamstring): The Saints can't really catch a break at RB this season. Alvin Kamara has missed the past three weeks with a knee injury. Now, the rookie Neal could miss time after exiting early against the Panthers. He did make due for managers with eight touches for 32 yards and a score before leaving. If Neal ends up missing time, the Saints are down to Audric Estime and Evan Hull as options in the run game unless Kamara can get healthy. New Orleans also has winnable matchups the next two weeks vs. the Jets and Titans.

Bam Knight, RB, Cardinals (ankle): Knight was carted off the field on Sunday after suffering a ""bad"" ankle sprain. Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, Knight is unlikely to play in Week 16 against the Falcons. As a result, Michael Carter got most of the work in the backfield, finishing with 94 total yards on 18 touches. He'll be a top waiver wire add this week while Emari Demercado isn't a bad stash in deeper formats.

Davante Adams, WR, Rams (hamstring): Adams was forced to leave Week 15 after pulling up short on a route with a hamstring injury. Head coach Sean McVay said after the game ""it didn't look good"" but wouldn't speculate on the severity of the injury. The Rams went on to beat the Lions and clinch a playoff berth, so don't expect Adams to be rushed back. He finished the game with four catches for 71 yards on nine targets. For the second straight week, Adams failed to find the end zone after scoring 11 times over the previous six games. If Adams is out, TE Colby Parkinson needs to be rostered in most formats. He has six TDs over the past six games.

Luther Burden III, WR, Bears (ankle): Burden exited in the Bears' win over the Browns but had six catches for 84 yards. He's been Chicago's more consistent pass-catching option the past two weeks with Rome Odunze sidelined. If Burden can shake off this injury and is good for Week 16 against the Packers, he'll be in a good spot as a WR3/flex option if Odunze, who initially was set to return on Sunday but was a late scratch after aggravating his foot injury, remains out. Keep in mind that game is Saturday night in what would likely be your fantasy playoff semifinals.

Christian Watson, WR, Packers (chest): Watson lost a 1-on-1 battle with Pat Surtain II on a deep ball from Jordan Love and landed hard on his chest/shoulder area. He was unable to return in the second half. Watson had just three catches for 29 yards prior to exiting. Prior to Week 15, Watson had over 18 fantasy points in three of four games, scoring five times in that span. Now, his status is likely up in the air for Week 16 against the Bears, a team he went off for a 4-89-2 line against a few weeks prior.

Head coach DeMeco Ryans also added updates on rookie running back Woody Marks (ankle) and cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. (oblique), who both left Sunday's game early with injuries. Ryans said both players should be fine, but it is something they are monitoring.

The New York Jets have fired defensive coordinator Steve Wilks after the team's 48-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 15. The Jets are the third-worst scoring defense in the league, allowing 28.4 points per game.

To cap it off, the Jets gave up six touchdowns to Trevor Lawrence on Sunday, five passing and one on the ground. Wilks was brought onto the staff by head coach Aaron Glenn after he was hired during the 2025 offseason.

Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka confirmed that rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was evaluated for a concussion again in Week 15, ESPN's Jordan Raanan reported Sunday.

He missed just two plays before returning to the game, but his evaluation for a potential concussion speaks to a larger concern. As Raanan notes, Dart's evaluation in Week 15 marked his fifth such exam to check for a concussion so far in his pro career.

Just over a month ago, it was reported that the team wanted Dart to adjust his rushing style to err on the side of caution, presumably hoping he'd avoid taking the big hits that could put him at greater risk for a concussion. Dart had missed Weeks 11 and 12 with a diagnosed concussion — and no doubt, the Giants will want him to remain healthy moving forward, showing flashes of a potential franchise quarterback in the making.

Dart has rushed for 400 yards and seven touchdowns this year while completing 62.5% of pass attempts for 1,802 yards, 13 passing touchdowns and 4 interceptions.

The bad luck continues for Packers WR Christian Watson, who's battled a myriad of injuries through his NFL career.

This time, it was labeled a chest injury, as he went down in pain against the Broncos. He was ruled out with the injury and reportedly left the stadium in an ambulance, The Athletic's James Palmer reported.

Watson entered the 2025 rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in the playoffs last season and has dealt with hamstring issues throughout his career since he was selected in the second round of the 2022 NFL draft. Prior to Week 15, Watson had logged back-to-back games with 80-plus yards and a score.

ESPN's Rob Demovsky reported that Watson did travel home with the team after the game, following his evaluation at a local hospital.

The Green Bay Packers may have lost star pass rusher Micah Parsons for the rest of the season. Parsons is feared to have a torn ACL, and will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the injury Monday, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Parsons, 26, went down with a non-contact injury during the team's loss to the Denver Broncos in Week 15. It didn't look good in the moment, and there's ""not a lot of hope"" that the MRI will provide a more optimistic result, per Rapoport.

Losing Parsons would be a crushing blow for the Packers, who gave up two first-round picks and Kenny Clark to acquire Parsons in August.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are looking for linebacker help down the stretch. The team reportedly found that Monday, signing Anthony Walker Jr. off the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Walker, 30, is an eight-year NFL veteran who started eight games with the Miami Dolphins last season.

Walker has not played in an NFL game this season. Over his career, he has 581 tackles and 5.5 sacks.

49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan didn't mince words when asked about the team's decision to place WR Brandon Aiyuk on the reserve/left squad list earlier this week.

""We haven't seen him in forever,"" Shanahan told reporters in his post-game presser on Sunday.

That statement comes just weeks after it was announced that the team had reportedly voided approximately $27 million in guarantees in Aiyuk's contract for the 2026 season.

Aiyuk hasn't played since Week 7 of the 2024 season, when he suffered a torn ACL that he's rehabbed to this point in the season. He started the year on the active/PUP list; Shanahan then noted back in August that the team didn't expect Aiyuk to return until October at the earliest.

Time will tell how Aiyuk's latest chapter in his saga with the 49ers will play out, but signs certainly do continue to ""point toward divorce"" for the two sides as San Francisco keeps rolling without him, currently just one game behind the No. 1-seeded Los Angeles Rams.

The first-place Los Angeles Rams (11-3) enter Week 16 on a short turnaround, set to face the 11-3 Seattle Seahawks in a must-win divisional matchup on ""Thursday Night Football.""

They may have to do so without star wideout Davante Adams, however; Adams aggravated a previous hamstring injury in Sunday's win over the Lions.

The Broncos and Rams punched their post-season tickets but the play-off picture is far from clear.

The Green Bay Packers could be in trouble after a big injury of their own, while the Buffalo Bills stunned the Patriots with a comeback win that keeps alive their divisional fight.

Here's the pick of week 15 in the NFL.

The first play-off miss of his career and a torn ACL - it was a true nightmare for Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs as their run of 10 straight post-seasons came to a shuddering end.

With nine straight division titles, seven straight AFC Championship games and five Super Bowls, three of them won, it's been an incredible run for Mahomes - who has never previously ended a season before overtime in the AFC title game.

And so the Chiefs' inquest begins, starting with questions of when Mahomes will be fit to return and whether 36-year-old tight end Travis Kelce or head coach Andy Reid, 67, will return at all amid retirement rumours.

But where did it all go wrong?

Firstly their big strength has become their biggest weakness - winning tight games. After an NFL-record 11 one-score wins last year, the Chiefs have won one and lost seven that way this season.

And everybody has been at fault, including Mahomes for throwing some costly red zone interceptions. Reid has made some bad calls and Kelce and his fellow receivers have literally dropped the ball.

Fatigue could be a factor. Since Mahomes became starter, the Chiefs have played just two games under the maximum, and the constant deep play-off runs and Super Bowls can take its toll.

The defence has been excellent again, but the offence has been guilty of making the wrong play at the wrong time.

The other main issue has been protecting Mahomes, with offensive line issues a theme over the past few seasons.

Mahomes has taken the most quarterback hits in the NFL this season with 65, has been forced to attempt the joint-most scrambles with 52 and been pressured the third-highest number of times with 135.

In short, Mahomes just hasn't had the protection, and even when he gets his throws off, he's had the second-highest number of dropped catches with 26. For his own part, he's second on the list for bad throws with 81.

The two-time league MVP is the best quarterback of his generation, but while he's made mistakes, the team just haven't helped him.

The Chiefs' main priority once he returns is to protect their star man better and give him more reliable pass catches to let him do what he does best.

Green Bay also suffered a huge injury blow as defensive giant Micah Parsons went down with a suspected ACL injury during their damaging defeat in Denver.

The Broncos booked a play-off spot with the win and look the team to beat from the AFC. The Packers held that title in the NFC after four straight wins - but Parsons' injury could severely damage their Super Bowl hopes.

Green Bay handed two first-round draft picks to Dallas to sign Parsons in a blockbuster trade - and he's responded with 12.5 sacks in 14 games and a league leading 83 quarterback pressures.

He's often double-teamed to allow his team-mates more freedom to attack, and the Packers' defence drops from 10th to 22nd in quarterback rating allowed when he's not on the field.

More importantly, Parsons is one of those big-moment players who pops up with the big play at the right time, which can win you games when it matters most.

At one point Sunday, the Packers were heading to the NFC top seed, but they ended it down in the seventh and final play-off spot. Without Parsons, one of the big Super Bowl favourites could be in big trouble.

The Seattle Seahawks won a game for just the fourth time in their history without scoring a touchdown - Jason Myers kicking six field goals as they edged the Indianapolis Colts at home.

It was a Colts team led by 44-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers, who performed admirably less than a week after ending his five-year retirement as he nosed his side in front inside the final minute, before the Seahawks won it.

""It was exciting,"" said Rivers. ""Shoot, it was exciting to take a 13-3 lead. Obviously, you throw in the fact that it's been 1,800 days since throwing a touchdown or interception for that matter. So, yeah, both of those boxes were checked.""

Baltimore stayed alive in the play-off race with a 24-0 shutout of the Bengals in Cincinnati - their first shutout loss since 2017 (also against Baltimore) and the first of Joe Burrow's career.

Bengals head coach Zac Taylor could be in trouble after being eliminated from the play-offs for the third straight year.

Brock Purdy had a 140.3 quarterback rating as the 49ers beat the Titans to move to 10-3 ahead of one of the toughest finishes in the league.

“Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers.","Los Angeles Chargers which ended their playoffs hopes.

Mahomes and the Chiefs have been the dominant force in the NFL since he entered the league, but for the first time their future suddenly looks clouded with the three-time Super Bowl winner now facing a lengthy recovery on the sidelines.

The two-time MVP award winner scrambled to his right in the final two minutes of Kansas City’s 16-13 loss to the Chargers as he looked to keep the play alive before he was tackled from behind.

Mahomes had to be helped from the field, with the Chiefs posting a short statement to confirm the horrific injury news.

“An MRI has confirmed that Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in his left knee in today’s game,” the statement read.

“Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.”

The Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention following the loss – their third in a row – which leaves them with a 6-8 record to sit third in the AFC West standings.

It’s a stunning fall from grace for a team that has made the past seven AFC title games, with the Chiefs making it through to five Super Bowls in that run.

But there are now questions over veteran tight end Travis Kelce and whether he retires, while Mahomes is likely to miss the start of the next NFL season which begins in September.

The Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills and the New England Patriots are the favourites to win the AFC this season, while NFC hopefuls the Los Angeles Rams and Green Bay Packers are also dealing with fresh injury concerns for star receivers Davante Adams and Christian Watson.

“Don’t know why this had to happen,” Mahomes posted on X, with Gardner Minshew expected to finish the season for them at QB.

“And not going to lie it hurts.

“But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.

“Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/bd12a9818e25383c26edbc1b324851f2,N,,2025-12-15 15:02:29.752016

Giants Can’t Change Star Quarterback Eliminating opportunities for Dart to run would change the player he is and risk limiting his effectiveness.","He’s already become a frequent visitor to the blue tent for concussion-related checks during his first season in the NFL, but Jaxson Dart blasted the process and how he’s being treated by referees and spotters after the New York Giants‘ rookie quarterback was called off the field for two plays against the Washington Commanders in Week 15.

Dart was asked to visit the tent at a crucial moment of what turned out to be a 29-21 win for the Commanders. The Giants were at the one-yard line, but Dart was forced off after a collision with Washington defensive tackles Javon Kinlaw and Eddie Goldman.

It was a collision Dart revealed he didn’t view as a big hit when speaking to reporters post-game. Instead, the first-round pick in the 2025 NFL draft was “definitely surprised” about being sent for evaluation, per ESPN’s Jordan Raanan.

Dart put it candidly when he said, “(I) Definitely feel there is a sensitivity for some reason.”

Frustration was understandable after the Giants lost two yards on a run, before backup QB Jameis Winston threw incomplete, without Dart in the lineup. Another incompletion followed and the Giants turned the ball over on downs.

Dart has been defiant about running and taking big hits, but it appears officials and medical personnel are going to be more hands on about protecting the 25-year-old after four stints in concussion protocol.

Jaxson Dart Frustrated With Concussion Rules

An already lengthy history of concussion fears means Dart should expect some precaution around his health. Yet, he still “‘absolutely’ thinks he’s treated different than other players and doesn’t understand the increased sensitivity toward him,” according to Dan Duggan of The Athletic.

What’s ironic here is this wasn’t one of the designed runs that had subjected Dart to punishment. Instead, interim head coach Mike Kafka revealed the play was a pass, but “Dart didn’t like the look so he just tried to get back to the line,” per Duggan.

Dart did run nine times against the Giants’ NFC East rivals, but Kafka was noticeably light on calling designed runs for his battle-weary prized asset. This is the dilemma facing Dart and whoever replaces Kafka.

Giants Can’t Change Star Quarterback

Eliminating opportunities for Dart to run would change the player he is and risk limiting his effectiveness. The former Ole Miss stud is never going to stay static in the pocket, but he still needs to be smarter and more selective about unleashing his mobility.

It’s a difficult balancing act, but the Giants have to get it right if they’re going to count on Dart to inspire a rebuild beyond what’s been yet another miserable season. Dart boasts enough potential to be optimistic about the future, potential showcased by his 16-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wan’Dale Robinson on 4th-and-5.

This was the second of Dart’s scoring strikes as part of a 246-yard output through the air. He’s a natural playmaker the Giants can build around, particularly with skill players like Robinson, fellow wideout Malik Nabers once he’s healthy, and versatile running back Tyrone Tracy Jr.

It’s an exciting nucleus, but the Giants must be able to count on their star signal-caller to stay on the field in clutch moments. That won’t happen unless Dart changes the narrative about the risks and hits he’s prepared to take as a runner.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2251905666-e1765752954135.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-15 15:02:37.699255

Brady tore his ACL in the first game of the 2008 season.

When Brady had his season-ending injury, it was his ninth NFL season and he had three Super Bowl rings.

Brady, because the injury was right off the bat, missed the rest of the season but then was good for the following year.

Mahomes' Week 1 status will be less certain.

Brady obviously did well for himself after the injury, winning four more rings. Mahomes would love to do the same.

On a first-and-goal play, Dart tried to run for a touchdown when he was met by Javon Kinlaw and Eddie Goldman, who make up a combined 639 pounds of defensive lineman. Dart left the field and took the well-trodden path to the blue injury tent.

Fortunately for the Giants, Dart was able to return for the fourth-down play, but the rookie quarterback has taken too many hits like that throughout the season. In November, Dart missed two games due to a concussion. Despite that -- and today's scare -- Kafka said the team won't change much about its offensive game plan.

Of course we have his health, and everyone's health, in mind when we call plays.""

Kafka added that Dart's mobility is one of his ""great strengths, and there's no denying that. Dart ran six times for 63 yards against the Commanders. It's just a matter of Dart recognizing when to protect himself.

He missed just two plays before returning to the game, but his evaluation for a potential concussion speaks to a larger concern. As Raanan notes, Dart's evaluation in Week 15 marked his fifth such exam to check for a concussion so far in his pro career.

Just over a month ago, it was reported that the team wanted Dart to adjust his rushing style to err on the side of caution, presumably hoping he'd avoid taking the big hits that could put him at greater risk for a concussion. Dart had missed Weeks 11 and 12 with a diagnosed concussion — and no doubt, the Giants will want him to remain healthy moving forward, showing flashes of a potential franchise quarterback in the making.

Dart has rushed for 400 yards and seven touchdowns this year while completing 62.5% of pass attempts for 1,802 yards, 13 passing touchdowns and 4 interceptions.

The bad luck continues for Packers WR Christian Watson, who's battled a myriad of injuries through his NFL career.

This time, it was labeled a chest injury, as he went down in pain against the Broncos. He was ruled out with the injury and reportedly left the stadium in an ambulance, The Athletic's James Palmer reported.

Watson entered the 2025 rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in the playoffs last season and has dealt with hamstring issues throughout his career since he was selected in the second round of the 2022 NFL draft. Prior to Week 15, Watson had logged back-to-back games with 80-plus yards and a score.

ESPN's Rob Demovsky reported that Watson did travel home with the team after the game, following his evaluation at a local hospital.

The Green Bay Packers may have lost star pass rusher Micah Parsons for the rest of the season. Parsons is feared to have a torn ACL, and will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the injury Monday, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Parsons, 26, went down with a non-contact injury during the team's loss to the Denver Broncos in Week 15. It didn't look good in the moment, and there's ""not a lot of hope"" that the MRI will provide a more optimistic result, per Rapoport.

Losing Parsons would be a crushing blow for the Packers, who gave up two first-round picks and Kenny Clark to acquire Parsons in August.

49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan didn't mince words when asked about the team's decision to place WR Brandon Aiyuk on the reserve/left squad list earlier this week.

""We haven't seen him in forever,"" Shanahan told reporters in his post-game presser on Sunday.

That statement comes just weeks after it was announced that the team had reportedly voided approximately $27 million in guarantees in Aiyuk's contract for the 2026 season.

Aiyuk hasn't played since Week 7 of the 2024 season, when he suffered a torn ACL that he's rehabbed to this point in the season. He started the year on the active/PUP list; Shanahan then noted back in August that the team didn't expect Aiyuk to return until October at the earliest.

Time will tell how Aiyuk's latest chapter in his saga with the 49ers will play out, but signs certainly do continue to ""point toward divorce"" for the two sides as San Francisco keeps rolling without him, currently just one game behind the No. 1-seeded Los Angeles Rams.

The first-place Los Angeles Rams (11-3) enter Week 16 on a short turnaround, set to face the 11-3 Seattle Seahawks in a must-win divisional matchup on ""Thursday Night Football.""

They may have to do so without star wideout Davante Adams, however; Adams aggravated a previous hamstring injury in Sunday's win over the Lions.

What Mahomes' injury means for the Chiefs

What already felt like rock bottom for Chiefs fans hit a new low Sunday afternoon. Having lost four of their prior five games and needing a late comeback to claim their only victory since the start of November, the Chiefs were trailing in the latest of their must-win games, with the Chargers holding a 16-13 lead. The Chiefs had scored an early touchdown before spending the rest of the game struggling to move the football, but Mahomes had gotten the offense past midfield and within striking distance of a potential game-tying field goal. The air of invincibility was long gone, but the hope that Mahomes would conjure something out of nothing and keep the Chiefs alive for another quarter or another week until the old Chiefs somehow appeared hadn't been extinguished.

And then, suddenly, even that was gone when Mahomes left the game with his knee injury. While backup Gardner Minshew managed to turn a first-and-20 into a new set of downs, he threw an interception to Derwin James Jr., ending the game. But even if Minshew had been able to lead a late comeback, the season was essentially over when Mahomes went down injured.

And even if Mahomes had stayed healthy and played through the end of the season, this version of the Chiefs seemed broken on offense. Advanced metrics were more optimistic about the Chiefs than their record indicated, but Kansas City had pieced together just one above-average offensive performance over the past six games -- a loss to a Cowboys team whose defensive turnaround has been greatly overstated. There was no clear-cut culprit like the historically bad drop rate at wide receiver in 2023. The offense just wasn't getting better; if anything, after a brief burst at midseason, it was getting worse.

Two things came to mind immediately after the injury. One was the nature of how the Chiefs had survived when the offense had struggled, both early in the season and as recently as the first quarter of this game against the Chargers. Mahomes had always been an excellent scrambler, but he had typically leaned into scrambling in the postseason, when the games were more meaningful and there was simply less football ahead before the opportunity to rest during the offseason.

Before 2025, Mahomes averaged 2.5 scrambles per game during the regular season, and that figure rose to 3.3 during the postseason. They were high-value plays for the Chiefs, especially in the playoffs, where huge scrambles by Mahomes at the right time had played significant roles in dramatic wins over the Titans and Eagles.

Through Sunday, Mahomes had averaged 3.8 scrambles per game in 2025, including the 12-yard touchdown run that gave the Chiefs their only touchdown Sunday. And while that might not seem like an enormous difference, all scrambles aren't created equal. Scrambling into wide-open spaces only when they're available and sliding down without being touched is one thing, but Mahomes was often scrambling out of necessity this season, trying to move the ball in tight quarters. He was taking hits at the end of his runs, often because the Chiefs needed every one of those yards to pick up first downs or touchdowns when the offense was struggling.

Including sacks and quarterback knockdowns, Mahomes had been hit 153 times this season, a figure topped only by Justin Herbert, the quarterback on the other side of the field Sunday. That was a career-high through 14 games. A year ago -- with an offense that also needed to be jolted back to life amid a lack of playmaking talent and dismal left tackle play -- Mahomes was hit 147 times through his first 14 games. But across his six prior seasons as a starter, Mahomes took an average of 117.6 hits in his first 14 games of each season.

The 30-year-old has been hit 27% more often over the past two years than he had over his first six seasons as an NFL starter. Throw 40 more hits across three games in the 2024 postseason, and you get the idea. It's impossible to prove that correlation is causation here, and quarterbacks can suffer traumatic injuries without taking loads of hits, but Mahomes had essentially been playing all of 2025 like it was a playoff game. We can't fault the legendary quarterback for trying to win, of course, but it's just incredibly difficult to get hit the way he has for two years without missing time or suffering injuries.

The other thing I noticed was the name that came out over the PA as the cameras zoomed in on Mahomes. As the crowd came to a hush in Kansas City, I'm not sure anyone paid attention to the referees announcing a holding call on No. 72. That's Chukwuebuka Godrick, a 25-year-old rookie recruited through the league's international pathway program who was making his NFL debut. Godrick was forced onto the field after offensive tackle Jaylon Moore suffered a knee injury on the second snap of the game. (Moore attempted to return to the game but reinjured the knee in the second quarter and didn't appear after halftime.)

Chargers fans won't have much sympathy given what they've gone through at offensive tackle, but for the second year in a row, the Chiefs were stuck in December with tackles they couldn't possibly have wanted to play meaningful football this season. Last year, they rotated through Kingsley Suamataia, Wanya Morris and D.J. Humphries at left tackle before pushing Joe Thuney outside, which led to a disastrous appearance in the Super Bowl.

By the time Mahomes got hurt Sunday, the Chiefs had lost their top four tackles in Josh Simmons, Jawaan Taylor, Moore and Morris. Godrick was playing right tackle in his NFL debut, while the left tackle was Esa Pole -- who made his first appearance as a pro last week after Morris went down injured on the opening snap against the Texans.

For GM Brett Veach, this was the nightmare scenario that his 2025 offseason had attempted to avoid. Left tackle has been a revolving door for the Chiefs since Eric Fisher's departure, as they cycled through Orlando Brown Jr., Donovan Smith and then the 2024 cast before turning things over to Simmons, their first-round pick in the 2025 draft. Moore was the most expensive swing tackle in the NFL, a two-year, $30 million insurance policy in case Simmons or Taylor was unable to go. In a pinch, the Chiefs still had Morris, whom the organization trotted out for most of 2024 at left tackle, but they wouldn't actually need to call upon their fourth option at tackle, right?

Well, that plan didn't work. Nobody could have anticipated that Morris and Moore would go down on the opening series of games in consecutive weeks. Simmons dislocated his wrist against the Cowboys. Taylor hadn't missed a single game due to injury as a pro before going down with triceps and knee issues several weeks ago. Veach planned for what he thought could be the worst, and the 2025 season just laughed.

Devoting meaningful resources to even further depth at OT wouldn't have been a realistic or thoughtful use of assets. But the Chiefs didn't address some of the fundamental issues with their offensive infrastructure after the 2024 season. Those concerns have to be resolved by the time Mahomes returns to the lineup, because there are no guarantees they'll be getting the same Mahomes back, especially at first.

Mahomes' timetable for returning in 2026 will be unclear until he undergoes surgery. It's entirely possible that he's not ready to start next season on the active roster, which would force the Chiefs to begin with another quarterback under center and prioritize the backup role this offseason as a result. Since Chad Henne's retirement in 2022, the Chiefs have cycled through Blaine Gabbert, Carson Wentz and most recently Minshew as veteran options. Andy Reid prioritized adding a developmental backup in the draft during his time with the Eagles and eventually landed meaningful value in trades for QBs like Kevin Kolb and A.J. Feeley, but the Chiefs haven't drafted a quarterback since selecting Mahomes in 2017.

Regardless of when Mahomes returns, quarterbacks respond to knee injuries differently, and just about everybody takes some time to settle in. Tom Brady tore his ACL in Week 1 of the 2008 season, giving him three extra months to heal relative to Mahomes, and still didn't look like his usual self in 2009, posting what would be his worst interception rate in a single season. It's entirely possible that Mahomes, who relies far more on movement and extending plays than Brady did, struggles with his footwork and consistency even more acutely, which could lead to accuracy issues.

Will Mahomes come back with the same style of play? At 30, he might have already been slowing down and leaning less into the extended plays and out-of-structure creativity that served as his calling card as he ascended to the top of the NFL hierarchy. Mahomes' scrambles in 2025 were more north-south in nature, designed to pick up yardage as opposed to moving laterally and extending plays while hoping for someone to get open.

Will the Chiefs strongly discourage Mahomes from playing that way? Quarterbacks are going to do their own thing once they get on the field, but do you remember the last time Mahomes suffered a knee injury? In 2019, Reid called for a Mahomes sneak near the goal line, only for his third-year quarterback to suffer a dislocated kneecap. Mahomes came back after two games, but Reid was so scarred by the injury that he has refused to call a Mahomes sneak again, even in the highest-profile situations.

The Chiefs have still used Mahomes on speed options, even after he suffered a concussion running parallel to the line in the postseason against the Browns, and I'm not sure Reid is going to be able to fully discourage Mahomes from scrambling. But the balance has to shift. It would be a real shock if we saw the Mahomes who was scrambling as a necessity throughout the 2025 season again, at least during the regular season.

Kansas City simply can't ask Mahomes to do as much as he has over the past two seasons, particularly when it comes to absorbing hits and putting his body on the line. It hasn't produced consistently effective offenses and might have led to this. The only way to protect Mahomes is to build the rest of the offense up and ensure that the Chiefs don't need to rely on him putting himself in harm's way to win, at least on a weekly basis.

The Chiefs were already going to be thinking about the evolution of this offense during the offseason, where they were facing a series of important decisions. Now, with Mahomes suffering a serious injury, the Chiefs both need to take backup quarterback more seriously and will feel even more pressure to nail their next steps around the QB. Here's what's coming up for Kansas City and how the Mahomes injury affects them:

1. What does the end of the Travis Kelce era mean for reimagining the tight end room? The offense hasn't found consistency since Kelce faded after the 2023 season. He was incredible in 2022, when the Chiefs were able to build their post-Tyreek Hill offense around his mind meld with Mahomes and ability to beat both zone (by identifying and exploiting space in coverages) and man (by running away from linebackers or outmuscling defensive backs) coverages alike.

Kelce was still very good on a per-route basis in 2023, but he declined as the season went along. He was 18th in yards per route run among tight ends in 2024, and while that has jumped up to eighth in 2025, Kelce has also dropped a league-high nine passes -- three of which led to Mahomes interceptions. And while Kelce was never going to the Hall of Fame for his blocking, there have been more notable rough patches for him there, most notably in the Super Bowl loss to the Eagles.

For that production, the Chiefs have paid Kelce just over $17 million per year between 2024 and 2025, a figure that would be out of line if the guy receiving it wasn't a franchise icon and a surefire Hall of Famer. Any other player would have been released or asked to take a significant pay cut heading into 2025. But given that Kelce was already considering retiring before returning for this season, I'm not sure there was ever a realistic scenario where the Chiefs could have asked or expected their legendary tight end to come back for a fraction of what he was owed.

Kelce's contract expires after the season, though, and if he does return for one more go-around, it won't be at that price tag. Noah Gray has struggled with drops recently, but on a three-year, $18 million deal, the Chiefs would probably keep their 2021 fifth-round pick around for another season as the second tight end. Jared Wiley, selected in the fourth round of the 2024 draft, has two catches in nine games over two pro campaigns.

So whom do the Chiefs replace Kelce with as their primary tight end? And what does that mean for their offense? It's tempting to try to find a like-for-like replacement, but Kelce's one of the most unique players in recent league history. The Chiefs aren't going to be able to acquire someone like Brock Bowers or Trey McBride. Kyle Pitts Sr. is a pending free agent, but he's not the same sort of improviser as Kelce, and his blocking isn't up to even Kelce's standards. If he keeps having three-touchdown games down the stretch, the Falcons might even choose to franchise him.

This has been the year of offenses leaning into bigger personnel groupings, and progressive units are playing 13 personnel (1 RB, 3 TEs, 1 WR) and/or six offensive lineman sets more often than they have in years. Reid didn't invent going bigger, but leaning heavily into 12 personnel (1 RB, 2 TEs, 2 WRs) was one of the ways the Chiefs survived after trading away Hill, using the larger groupings to manipulate defensive personnel, reduce the scope of the defensive playbook and create checks they could exploit with Kelce.

Could the Chiefs lean into that and go with quantity over quality? Going after two or even three tight ends this offseason might be a way for them to replace Kelce in the lineup, if not necessarily his role in the offense. Veach could pursue tight end help earlier than he typically would in the draft, although the league's thirst for tight ends during the aforementioned personnel shift might cause players at a perennially underrated position to get pushed up the board.

The other option would be to evolve the offense away from a Kelce-like presence at tight end and spread the field more consistently, which would either be behind the curve or ahead of it, depending on whether you think those shifts to bigger personnel groupings have peaked. It's telling that the Chiefs left Simmons on an island more often than any other left tackle in the NFL this season while he was in the lineup, per NFL Next Gen Stats. If the Chiefs have two tackles they trust in pass protection and don't need to chip or keep a sixth player in to block, that would allow Reid to consistently get five eligibles out into routes. That hasn't always been the case over the past few years when the line hasn't been right.

2. What do the Chiefs do at right tackle? The Chiefs are $34 million over the projected cap in 2026. They'll get under that figure by restructuring contracts, most notably with Mahomes, who has a whopping $78.2 million cap hit on the books next year. I've expected the Chiefs would use 2026 as the year to renegotiate Mahomes' record-setting 10-year, $450 million deal, and while the ACL tear will create some uncertainty, I would be shocked if it changed the long-term plans in Kansas City. The Chiefs will work off Josh Allen's six-year, $330 million contract with the Bills as a baseline for Mahomes' new pact when it happens.

The Chiefs will have to decide whether they want to give cornerback Trent McDuffie a new contract, and they'll likely move on from Kristian Fulton after a disappointing stint. But the one big contract that might come up for discussion is at right tackle. Taylor is owed $20 million in the final year of his deal, none of which is guaranteed. That's top-tier right tackle money, and given his penalty issues, Taylor is more like a solid starter than someone challenging for Pro Bowl honors.

Cutting Taylor would free up $20 million and open up a spot in the starting lineup for Moore, who would take over at right tackle in the second year of his two-year contract. It would create a hole at swing tackle, but Veach would address that with some of the savings by moving on from Taylor. Suamataia could also move to right tackle, but that would just open up a different hole in the starting lineup at left guard.

3. Can Reid piece together a running game? The other way the Chiefs thrived after losing Hill was by working their way into a more physical rushing attack. Veach built a strong interior line through Joe Thuney and hit on draftees Creed Humphrey and Trey Smith. And while Clyde Edwards-Helaire was a bust as the team's 2020 first-round pick at running back, Isiah Pacheco's vicious running style quickly gave teams who defended the Chiefs with light boxes and two deep safeties something to worry about.

Pacheco played a valuable role on the 2022 and 2023 teams, but after fracturing his fibula in 2024, he hasn't been the same caliber of player. Reid briefly turned to Carson Steele before in 2024 bringing back Kareem Hunt, who had been cut by the organization in 2018 after kicking and shoving a woman. Hunt has been excellent in short-yardage situations over the past two seasons, but he has shown virtually no explosiveness and has just one run over 20 yards across 348 attempts in Kansas City.

While the Chiefs rank eighth in success rate on early-down designed runs over that timeframe, they're 20th in EPA per play on those carries. The threat of Mahomes has the Chiefs running into very friendly boxes, which should make life easier for their backs. They've also had at least two Pro Bowl-caliber linemen on the interior for most of that stretch in Humphrey and Smith. Frankly, the Chiefs have settled for mediocre running back play for too long, perhaps in part because they were burned by the attempt to make a more significant investment at the position in Edwards-Helaire, who ended up being a replacement-level back.

Veach wasn't naive to those concerns, as the Chiefs reportedly negotiated with the Jets to acquire running back Breece Hall at the deadline. The deal didn't come to fruition after Kansas City refused to send a third-round pick to acquire the pending free agent, which would have been a disaster given what has happened with Mahomes.

The Chiefs can go after Hall if he hits free agency this offseason, and backs like Rico Dowdle, Travis Etienne Jr. and Javonte Williams currently project to be on the market after impressive 2025 campaigns. No matter what the Chiefs do, this isn't a place where Veach can run things back with the same names and faces in 2026. Pacheco and Hunt will both be free agents, and a fresh start atop the depth chart would make sense for the Chiefs.

4. Do the Chiefs evolve schematically and stylistically? As the Chiefs have struggled in 2025, more of the fan base has criticized Reid's offense for being behind the cutting edge or remaining more stagnant than others around the NFL. Fans are always going to criticize offenses that aren't racking up 30 points per game, especially when they have a generational player at quarterback, so I'm a little hesitant to lean into those complaints myself. Everybody is going to have a bad playcall or two at the wrong time; that's just the reality of the NFL.

Is Reid's offense really behind the times? I'm not sure. Reid's a world-class game planner and has an incredible aptitude for picking apart opposing defensive rules with motions, shifts and other schematic choices. The offense had seemingly reduced itself in scope and turned into a quick game-intensive attack between 2023 and 2024, but that was partly a product of losing Hill and then having a sieve at left tackle. The Chiefs have had plenty of deep opportunities in 2025, but frankly, the offense just hasn't done a great job of executing in those spots, with Mahomes, the receivers and the pass protection each to blame at different times.

I'd love to see the Chiefs evolve their offensive philosophy a bit. We've seen teams lean into going under center, where there's more of a threat of hard play-action, and it's easier to get into more of the gap scheme runs that have flourished around the league in recent years. The Chiefs have generally resisted that trend and stuck in the shotgun, where they typically lean into zone runs and RPOs. They have seemingly been less effective over the past couple of years, and that approach will be harder with Mahomes recovering from a knee injury.

I've seen calls for Reid's job from the most virulent of Chiefs fans on social media, and while there are about 25 fan bases who want to fire their coaches on any given week, the Chiefs aren't firing Reid. They shouldn't, either. Even if we reframe this around the possibility of the legendary coach retiring, which great offensive mind would the Chiefs hire to replace Reid? The top offensive assistant on Dan Graziano's list of potential coaching candidates is Matt Nagy, who happens to be Reid's assistant. Guys like Joe Brady, Klint Kubiak and Arthur Smith are either unproven or have had their own issues in stops around the league. Mike McCarthy? Doug Pederson? Are they really going to be upgrades on Reid?

Any coach would want to work with Mahomes, but team owners aren't going to let their coaches go to Kansas City out of the kindness of their hearts. Acquiring someone like Mike Tomlin or John Harbaugh would cost draft capital, and those organizations aren't going to want to make life easier for the Chiefs if Reid retires. The Chiefs probably aren't in position to deal a Jon Gruden-sized haul to acquire a coach, even if the right one became available.

What's more realistic, perhaps, is Reid bringing somebody into the organization to serve as a fresh voice as an offensive assistant. The Chiefs don't need wholesale changes. They're not starting over. They're seventh in EPA per play over the past two seasons, which would be great for any team that doesn't have the best quarterback of his generation in the prime of his career. Mahomes has carried the Chiefs over the past two years, and we saw the diminishing returns of those efforts throughout a frustrating 2025 season. Now, it's time for the Chiefs to ensure that Mahomes won't need to put his body on the line as often when he returns in 2026.

What Parsons' injury means for the Packers

As they flew home from Denver on Sunday night, the Packers might have felt like a Super Bowl was slipping through their fingers. Just as Green Bay was getting healthier late in the season, injuries collapsed one of the league's most complete teams. Parsons is likely done for the year with a torn ACL. Christian Watson, who has looked like a star receiver for stretches since returning from his own ACL injury, went down with a chest injury on a Jordan Love interception and did not return. Right tackle Zach Tom was injured in the second quarter and didn't play in the second half, while safety Evan Williams wasn't able to play in the fourth quarter after suffering a knee injury.

With the likes of Tucker Kraft, Elgton Jenkins and Devonte Wyatt already on injured reserve, the Packers are staring down the threat of another postseason without multiple starters on both sides of the football. GM Brian Gutekunst's draft-and-develop philosophy generally leads the Packers to one of the deepest rosters in the league, but as we saw in last season's playoff loss to the Eagles, even that depth has its limits.

Gutekunst's stunning move to trade two first-round picks and Kenny Clark to acquire Parsons before the season both went against type and served as an announcement that the Packers weren't just accumulating talent. Factoring in a record-setting contract as part of the trade, Gutekunst was making an enormous bet that Parsons was going to be among the very best players in football over the next few seasons.

As teams trading for players like Khalil Mack and Jamal Adams have shown in years past, it's difficult for that bet to pay off. Trading unknown future picks for known superstars is great on paper, and there have been times (mostly involving the Rams) where it has worked, but the bar for success is extremely high. With the implied value of the draft picks sent to the Cowboys included, the Packers are paying Parsons the equivalent of $65 million per season over the next four years.

There's nothing inherently wrong with making that sort of move, but anything short of being the best player in the NFL is going to make that contract difficult to swallow. It's also putting a dramatic amount of the budget -- between actual cash and draft capital -- into one player staying both healthy and productive. Spreading the money and draft capital around throughout the roster means a team is less susceptible to one big injury than by concentrating so many resources into one player. Parsons' upside is such that I can (and still do) understand why the tradeoff would be worth it, but this is the football equivalent of putting a lot of your eggs in one basket.

To the extent that any non-quarterback can live up to that sort of price tag, Parsons was holding his own in Green Bay. He had 12.5 sacks in 14 games with the Packers, an even more impressive number when we consider that he was playing only in a part-time role early in the season after joining the Packers in August. Parsons led the league with 83 pressures, and his 34 quick pressures were second in the NFL behind Nik Bonitto. He wasn't going to win Defensive Player of the Year, given that Myles Garrett is currently producing one of the great defensive seasons in NFL history, but Parsons would have been competing with Will Anderson Jr. for the second edge rusher spot on the All-Pro team.

While the splits with and without Parsons weren't quite as significant as they were during his time with the Cowboys, we also saw a pretty significant split in Green Bay's pass defense with their star edge rusher on and off the field. With him in the lineup, the Packers allowed the league's 10th-lowest QBR to opposing quarterbacks. Across 109 dropbacks without him this season, the Packers fell to 22nd by that same metric.

What Parsons gave coordinator Jeff Hafley and the defense, really, was protection. The weak link on the Green Bay defense is at cornerback, where Nate Hobbs has been alternately injured and disappointing as the team's biggest free agent addition on defense. Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine struggle with consistency, and while Javon Bullard has had a very good second season working in the slot, the roughest games for the Packers defense have typically come when their corners have been exposed.

The Packers defense ranks 26th in the league in Total QBR when it doesn't get home with pressure on the opposing quarterback. Now, without Parsons, the pressure rate will inevitably drop. Players like Lukas Van Ness and Kingsley Enagbare have looked imposing at times across from Parsons, but they'll see more attention without Green Bay's best defender in the lineup.

One way to respond to those pressure concerns would be to send more bodies, something Hafley has been able to mostly avoid this season because of Parsons. The Packers send four or fewer rushers on nearly 80% of opposing dropbacks, the fifth-highest rate in the NFL. Despite dropping seven or more into coverage on the vast majority of snaps, the Packers still manage to get pressure on just under 35% of dropbacks, which is the eighth-best rate in the league. Every one of the teams ahead of the Packers in pressure rate also blitz more often than Green Bay.

When the Packers do blitz, their 53.8% pressure rate is second best, trailing only the Seahawks. Parsons plays a huge role in these pressures and creating opportunities for his teammates. Hafley knows that teams are terrified of what Parsons is going to do on every snap, and his presence can essentially serve as an indicator for what offenses will do in pass protection and what the Packers can do to break those rules. I'm skeptical that their blitz pressure rate will keep up without Parsons if the Packers lean further into sending extra pressure.

Hafley's sim pressures (which aren't technically always blitzes) have gotten more imposing as the season has wore on, and Parsons has created havoc on stunts and twists, with offensive linemen worried about letting him through and in turn allowing Green Bay's other rushers to run free in the process. Hafley didn't have the sort of time a coordinator would want to build the game plan around Parsons, given that the Packers acquired their new star only days before the season began. The Packers were getting better at maximizing Parsons, though. Now, all of that comes to a halt.

Parsons and the increased pressure rate were also covering for an issue the Packers have dealt with throughout the season: a lack of turnovers. Led by Xavier McKinney's eight interceptions, the Pack forced 31 turnovers in 2024, the fourth most of any team. On a drive-by-drive basis, only the Bills and Vikings forced more turnovers than the Packers, who turned 16.4% of opposing possessions into takeaways.

Turnover rates can fluctuate from year to year, though, and the Packers have forced only 13 in 14 games this season. They're ending just 9.1% of drives in turnovers, which has the Pack all the way down in 23rd, right ahead of the Vikings (who are dealing with the same year-to-year variance). The defense is recovering fumbles at about the same rate, but it is forcing fumbles about half as often as it did a year ago.

The bigger problem is that Green Bay has only seven interceptions in 14 games. One of those was Nixon's interception to seal up last week's win over the Bears, which was obviously a huge play, but Hafley's unit felt those missing picks in the loss to the Broncos. Bo Nix had his best game as a pro, going 23-of-34 for 302 yards with four touchdowns, but he also left a few balls in dangerous areas for the Packers. He threw two near-interceptions on the drive in which Parsons suffered his ACL injury, and Carrington Valentine dropped a third with 5:47 to go. When things are going well -- as they were in 2024 -- those throws turn into interceptions. When they aren't -- as has been the case for this secondary in 2025 -- they fall harmlessly to the ground.

The Packers have dropped from third in interception rate in 2024 to 26th this season. If there's a way they're going to overcome the Parsons injury, it's probably going to be through that turnover rate spiking back toward where it was in 2024. We've already seen much of the same key personnel produce an excellent takeaway rate in 2024, and the randomness of turnover rates is such that a team could go three months with a middling figure and then suddenly jump over the final few games of the season. The Eagles had 16 takeaways through their first 14 games a year ago and then racked up 23 over their final seven matchups, including 13 across their four-game run to the Super Bowl. The Packers could have that sort of late-season spree in them.

Parsons and his pressure should have made it easier to force those turnovers, though, so it'll be tougher to create takeaways without the superstar on the field. The combination of a Parsons-led rush and a turnover spike would have given the Packers a truly terrifying defense the rest of the way. And while Parsons is young enough at 26 to make an impact for years to come even after returning from the ACL tear, the Packers were least likely to feel the pain of missing out on those picks in 2025, given that the selections don't come off their books and won't be missing from the roster until 2026 and beyond.

This wasn't a one-year, all-in trade by any means, but the Packers were a Super Bowl-caliber team with Parsons in the mix. Now, suddenly, things are much tougher for the Packers in the NFC.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589489_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:00:08.480468

It has been some time since injuries have hit so many stars throughout the league on the same day, with Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament and Green Bay Packers edge rusher Micah Parsons feared to have met the same fate. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay also said the outlook wasn't promising for wide receiver Davante Adams, whose status is uncertain after he suffered a non-contact hamstring injury.

And along with the personnel hits came a significant reshaping of the playoff picture, complete with two teams becoming the first to seal their postseason spots in the Rams and Denver Broncos.

Here are the biggest winners and losers of Week 15 in the NFL:

NFL Week 15 winners

Josh Allen

Only the reigning NFL MVP could shrug off being caught on camera vomiting on the sideline. While no one could have blamed Allen if his fourth-quarter act had been in response to the Buffalo Bills' porous run defense, which gave up 246 yards and four touchdowns on the ground, the quarterback assured it was a common occurrence for him. Despite that, he once again harnessed his distinct cool and singular playmaking streak to propel Buffalo to a wild 35-31 win over the New England Patriots, who saw their hopes of clinching the AFC East this week evaporate as quickly as their 21-0 lead did. Initially boxed in by some schematic and personnel restraints, Allen once again started off by working the underneath area almost exclusively in the first half as the Bills' deficit grew. But the aggressiveness of yesteryear kicked in for the quarterback once the team's moment of desperation arrived, and his knack for extending plays, operating out of structure and attacking downfield sparkled in the furious rally. In all likelihood, he'll need to revert to this mode a few more times to rescue a group that looks bound to get roped into more shootouts, particularly in the postseason. With this outing, Buffalo established that it is far from the most trustworthy team likely to make the playoff field, but it might be the most dangerous.

Bo Nix

The Denver Broncos quarterback has been decried as the weak link in an otherwise Super Bowl-ready roster. Yet in a matchup that many expected to be defined by the Packers offense taking on the Broncos defense, it was Nix who might have been the deciding factor.

The second-year signal-caller strung together arguably the most impressive outing of his career, repeatedly dicing apart zone coverage for 302 yards and four touchdowns on the day in Denver's 34-26 triumph. Nix helped the Broncos unlock an explosive streak that has been missing in action for large stretches, with six of his completions coming more than 15 yards downfield. He also weaponized his mobility, extending plays to give his receivers more time to get open. If this version of Nix shows up in the playoffs, Denver stands out from the rest of the pack as the AFC's clear front-runner.

Jim and John Harbaugh

It was a decidedly good day for the brotherly coaching duo. Jim Harbaugh managed to solidify the Los Angeles Chargers' standing while dashing the Chiefs' playoff hopes with a 16-13 win at Arrowhead Stadium. That outcome once seemed unfathomable for a franchise that for so long stood in the Chiefs' shadow in the AFC West – and it might earn the Bolts a thank-you card from the rest of the conference, which undoubtedly is relishing the first postseason field without Kansas City since 2014. Meanwhile, John Harbaugh helped calm the Baltimore Ravens' bubbling bad vibes with a 24-0 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, who posed a major threat to send the team reeling with another loss. If the Pittsburgh Steelers falter on Monday against the Miami Dolphins, there will be another tie atop the AFC North. More importantly, though, Baltimore rediscovered its mojo somewhat and displayed some resilience. It's a far cry from the title-contender form the franchise has known in recent years, but any progress is welcome for an outfit that looked poised to fall off in the AFC playoff picture just a week ago.

Trevor Lawrence

Getting to face the New York Jets in mid-December feels akin to a Southeastern Conference team scheduling a Football Championship Subdivision patsy in between late-season rivalry games. Nevertheless, Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars didn't let up against Gang Green, with the quarterback notching six total touchdowns – five passing, one rushing – to power a 48-20 rout. The signal-caller has quietly come on strong as of late, exhibiting impressive command and precision Sunday when working the intermediate levels of the field. He completed nine of 12 attempts that went for 10-19 air yards, with three of his scoring strikes coming from that distance. There will be some whiplash in going up against the Broncos' defense in Week 16 after facing the Jets' undermanned group, but there are signs that the passing game is starting to catch up to the rest of the operation.

NFL Week 15 losers

Patrick Mahomes

As their season unraveled in recent weeks, the Chiefs faced repeated questioning of whether they were facing an imminent end: to their playoff hopes, to their dynasty, and to the approach that got them to this rare position. At least one of those elements has now been answered with Sunday definitively wrapping up the team's 10-year run of postseason berths.

This was always bound to be difficult territory for Mahomes, who had never fallen short of the playoffs as a pro. But the three-time Super Bowl MVP will be navigating an even more difficult challenge than a different mental approach this offseason after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the closing moments of the Chiefs' loss to the Chargers.

Now, Kansas City needs to embrace the change that's been forced upon it. The franchise tried to run things back after its Super Bowl 59 setback, with the largest area of change coming in its repeated insistence on reclaiming the explosiveness of the early Mahomes offenses. But with the injury essentially bringing a closer to this era, the Chiefs should be focused on reinvention rather than replication.

That might be a stretch for Andy Reid, who clung to his group's identity even as it proved untenable for competing with the league's elite. But Mahomes was frequently left to compensate for a woefully ineffective run game, receivers who couldn't get open with any regularity and protection that broke down all too frequently, with the quarterback being pressured on 48.6% of his dropbacks against the Chargers, according to Next Gen Stats. Without some fundamental change to both the scheme – particularly in the willingness to run from under center – and personnel, Mahomes will likely land in the same spot he found himself this season, all while attempting to recover from major surgery and begin a new chapter as he embarks on his post-30 playing career.

Indianapolis Colts

Philip Rivers' teammates must be emulating their quarterback by saying ""dadgummit."" The 44-year-old's incredible comeback looked as though it was headed for an incredible outcome when Blake Grupe booted a 60-yard field goal in the final minute to give Indianapolis a one-point lead over the Seattle Seahawks. But in less than 30 seconds, Seattle reclaimed the lead by getting in position for a Jason Myers field goal. Rivers' ensuing heave over the middle was tipped and intercepted by Coby Bryant to seal Seattle's 18-16 win.

Like the old timer's famous delivery, his performance Sunday was hardly pretty but still sufficient - at least relative to what the team could expect from a retiree who last played five years ago. Rivers' 120 yards on 18-of-27 passing won't wow anyone, but he gave the rapidly sinking Colts a legitimate chance to stand up to one of the league's most formidable defenses in an extremely difficult road setting. Defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo and the defense deserve plenty of credit for holding Seattle to six field goals, but this result laid bare Indianapolis' undeniable reality: There's not enough left in the tank to regroup for a postseason run, and things don't look much better in 2026 and beyond given the myriad missteps made by Shane Steichen and Chris Ballard that got the team to this point.

Green Bay Packers

Arguably no team had a worse day than Green Bay, which not only now must prepare for a playoff push without Parsons but also lost big-play wide receiver Christian Watson, standout right tackle Zach Tom and promising safety Evan Williams. Losing any for a substantial amount of time could deal a substantial blow to the Packers' playoff hopes after the team slid all the way to the NFC's No. 7 seed with the loss to the Broncos.

But the most consequential development was clearly Parsons' knee injury. The marquee trade acquisition had more than lived up to his lofty billing and price tag, racking up 12 ½ sacks while entering the week with a league-high 60 pressures. But his contributions can't be fully captured by individual statistics, as his mere presence forced opposing offenses to account for his game-wrecking capabilities. Without him, the Packers' defense looks ill-equipped to create any disruption after failing in recent weeks to capitalize on all the advantages he conferred. Green Bay is now without two players who set the tone on both offense (tight end Tucker Kraft, who suffered a torn ACL in November) and defense (Parsons). If the later unit regresses amid Parsons' absence, as is to be expected, the Packers could have serious trouble maintaining their place as one of the NFC's top Super Bowl threats.

Carolina Panthers

They've kept stride down the stretch with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. On Sunday, they did so in a highly undesirable manner, stumbling to a 20-17 loss to the New Orleans and returning the NFC South lead just three days after the Buccaneers had gifted it with a face-plant against the Atlanta Falcons. Had Carolina managed to eke out a win, it would have been able to wrap up a division title – and the franchise's first playoff berth since 2017 – with a win over Tampa Bay next weekend. Instead, the Panthers' hopes very well could come down to the Week 18 finale and rematch against the Buccaneers. There's plenty for Dave Canales and Co. to rue here, from the 10-point lead they squandered to Lathan Ransom's unnecessary roughness penalty that set Charlie Smyth up for the game-winning 47-yard field goal. And while Carolina still has a chance to set things straight with its pair of matchups against the Buccaneers, the sweep by New Orleans will surely haunt the organization if it falls short of the postseason yet again.

New England Patriots

By Week 15, teams deserve to be judged on their full body of work rather than an isolated outcome. The problem for the Patriots, however, is that a soft schedule left many doubting the legitimacy of the AFC East leader's resurgence. New England at first looked like it was ready to turn its divisional showdown with Buffalo into a coronation, but the defense came undone in the second half and gave the doubters more fodder. Getting Milton Williams back by the playoffs should aid an ailing front susceptible to giving up big plays on the ground, and a run at the conference's No. 1 seed is still realistic. But this served as a reminder that a young and unproven squad might be unreliable come January.

Joe Burrow

Are we having fun yet? The Bengals quarterback created a buzz last week with his frank comments about his discontent with another lost season, though he clarified after he game that he wasn't taking aim at the organization. But an admitted bummer of a campaign plunged to new depths with the shutout loss to the Ravens. Not only were Cincinnati's extreme long-shot playoff hopes officially dashed, but Burrow threw a pick-six for the second consecutive week. Unlike last week's snow-blasted battle with the Bills, however, there was nothing for the offense to hang its hat on as the unit was blanked for the first time in a start by Burrow. Miscues piled up and pressure was unrelenting, but the passer himself was also responsible for a fair number of slip-ups on a day when he finished with the second-worst quarterback rating of his career (58.2). A lot of reflection will be required in Cincinnati this offseason, but it's difficult to see how a franchise that has remained so stubbornly committed to its vision will reinvent itself after missing the playoffs for a third consecutive year.

With only three weeks left in the regular season — and with the start of the playoffs less than a month away — the importance of each game is only increasing. And that means the serious injuries multiple star players sustained in Week 15 could be major factors down the homestretch.

Here are some of the players who went down Sunday — and the fallout from their injuries.

Patrick Mahomes

Instead of pulling off yet another signature comeback, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes finished his season prematurely with a torn ACL during the Chiefs’ 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.

Mahomes was driving into Chargers territory with under two minutes to go when he hurt his left knee. Five plays later, his backup, Gardner Minshew, threw an interception that sealed the loss — which eliminated Kansas City from playoff contention.

“Don’t know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it’s hurts,” Mahomes wrote on X. “But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.”

The immediate aftermath of the injury is obvious. Instead of Mahomes keeping the team’s season alive, the Chiefs will now miss the playoffs for the first time in his career. And now, in part depending on how soon he can undergo surgery, his status for the start of next season is also unclear.

One more player to keep an eye on: Travis Kelce, the legendary tight end who is close with Mahomes. Kelce, 36, is in the final year of his contract, and while he has bounced back from a subpar 2024 season, he is still a lesser player than when he was a consistent 1,000-yard receiving option. Will Kelce be tempted to play another year to go out on a higher note with Mahomes?

Micah Parsons

Green Bay Packers star pass rusher Micah Parsons is feared to have torn an ACL, as well, a source told NBC Sports’s Mike Florio.

Parsons sustained the injury late in the third quarter of the Packers’ 34-26 defeat at the hands of the Denver Broncos. As Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur put it after the game, the Parsons injury is a “double whammy.”

The Packers are 9-4-1 and in the seventh and final playoff spot in the NFC. They will travel to Chicago next week to play the Bears, a game that will have massive implications in the playoff race. With a win, Green Bay could win the division and host a playoff game. With a loss, the Packers could be in danger of falling out of the postseason field entirely.

A plus for Green Bay? It holds a tiebreaker over the eighth-place Detroit Lions, who also lost Sunday. A minus? The Packers will also have to play a desperate Baltimore Ravens team in Week 17 and go on the road to play the Minnesota Vikings to end the regular season.

“It’s obviously tough,” LaFleur said about Parsons. “We all know what kind of player he is and the impact he’s had on our football team. To lose someone like that, it’s tough. But no one is going to feel sorry for us. We need to find a way. Guys have to rally around each other.”

Davante Adams

Don’t worry, Los Angeles Rams receiver Davante Adams didn’t tear an ACL. But he did pull up lame with a hamstring injury in the second half of the Rams’ 41-34 win over the Lions, and the timing is brutal.

Adams has been a major part of Los Angeles’ offense this season, catching 60 passes for 789 yards and a whopping 14 touchdowns. The team seems doubtful he will be able to suit up for its next game, as the Rams have a short turnaround before a Thursday night showdown on the road against the Seattle Seahawks.

“I can’t imagine that’s good for Thursday with just the short amount of time, but I certainly wouldn’t rule him out quite yet,” Los Angeles head coach Sean McVay said after the game. “But it didn’t look good.”

Thursday’s game is another one with big consequences. The winner will take the lead in the NFC West, while the loser will fall into a wild-card spot. A Rams win would put them in the driver’s seat for the division crown, as Los Angeles would then also own the tiebreaker over the Seahawks.

If the Rams lose, they could still win the division and host a playoff game, but they would need help from others in that scenario. A loss Thursday could ultimately be the difference between the second seed or the five seed for either Los Angeles or Seattle.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251214-MicahParsons-1047-GR-582ef1.jpg",N,,2025-12-15 09:00:17.268135

“Hurt to see,” Gary finally mustered amid a quiet visitors’ locker room. “Will be missed on this defense.”

Parsons, one of the two best defensive players in the NFL this season alongside Cleveland Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett, is likely done for the season with a torn ACL, according to multiple media reports, suffered on Sunday against the Denver Broncos. Further testing will determine the official diagnosis, but Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur and everyone else knows what those scans will reveal.

“It doesn’t look good,” LaFleur said when asked if the fear was a torn ACL for Parsons. “I’ll leave it at that.”

In a cruel twist of fate, Parsons was — you guessed it — pressuring quarterback Bo Nix when his left leg planted in the ground before he heard a pop late in the third quarter of Green Bay’s eventual 34-26 loss. That’s what Parsons told his good friend and Broncos cornerback Patrick Surtain II, one of several Broncos players who checked on Parsons before two trainers helped him limp off the field and into the tunnel, according to the “Scoop City” podcast’s James Palmer.

The grimace on Parsons’ face, the clutching of his left knee, the visible pop when no other player contacted him and the teammates on a knee told the only story you needed to see. The solemn words after the game from those who now must pick up the pieces only compounded the crushing blow that Parsons’ likely season-ending injury dealt to a team that was a legitimate Super Bowl contender.

Another dominant season from a future first-ballot Hall of Famer, likely over just like that. Along with it, the Packers’ realistic championship hopes, too. Sunday offered yet another reminder of just how cruel a game this can be.

“The season ain’t over,” team captain and safety Xavier McKinney said. “So, s—, we’ve still got work to do. … It’s a big loss, but we’ve got good players. So that would just (be) saying everybody else, all the other D-linemen that we have, aren’t worth a s—, but they are. They’re really good players. They were good players before he came in. Obviously, he elevated those guys a lot in a lot of ways, and I think even with him being out, he’s one of them guys where he’s still going to help the other guys when they go in there, as far as what moves to use and stuff like that. Yeah, we’re going to miss him out there on the field, but I think mentally, he’s still going to be there for us, and that’s what we’re expecting from him.”

Players can say the season isn’t over all they want, and McKinney wasn’t the only one to do so. Technically, they’re correct. But it will take a Herculean effort, starting with Gary and trickling down to others on both sides of the ball, to keep afloat those Super Bowl visions that seemed ever so realistic not long before they came crashing down as Parsons fell to the grass in agony.

The work that’s left to do began with Gary, a fellow captain and Parsons’ No. 2 at defensive end, gathering everyone on the defensive front for a meeting in the locker room after the game.

“Just stating the obvious,” defensive tackle Karl Brooks said of Gary’s message. “We gotta step up. … We just gotta be on top of our s—. That’s all.”

It sounds simple, but replacing Parsons is anything but. When the Packers executed one of the sport’s most seismic trades ever on the eve of the regular season in sending their next two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to the Cowboys, Parsons’ arrival injected life both inside and outside the walls of 1265 Lombardi Ave. A generational pass rusher was now wearing green and gold, perhaps the missing piece that could help return the Lombardi Trophy home. The ovation inside Lambeau Field as No. 1 emerged last from the tunnel during Week 1 pregame player introductions was enough to cause vibrations from Green Bay to Appleton and beyond.

Parsons had been everything the Packers bargained for. Through the season’s first 14 weeks, he was the second-favorite behind Garrett to win NFL Defensive Player of the Year and well on his way to a third first-team All-Pro honor in five seasons. His 12.5 sacks, achieved on Thanksgiving with 2.5 in a statement win over the Lions, made Parsons the first player since sacks became a stat in 1982 with 12 or more in each of his first five years. The comparisons to Reggie White, one of six players with their numbers emblazoned on the Lambeau Field facade, were warranted.

Entering Week 15, Parsons ranked third in the NFL in sacks, third in total pressures and second in pressure percentage, according to TruMedia. He began Sunday’s game in Denver by forcing a fumble that linebacker Edgerrin Cooper recovered on a rush by R.J. Harvey, another instance in a long line of them disproving Cowboys owner Jerry Jones’ belief that Parsons isn’t a stout run defender. Teams devoted their offensive linemen, tight ends, running backs, equipment managers and parking attendants to blocking Parsons, but that didn’t stop him. He couldn’t buy a holding call, but he persevered while proving exactly why general manager Brian Gutekunst pushed all his chips to the middle of the table ahead of a season in which his own job might’ve been on the line.

“We all know what type of player he is and the impact he’s had on our football team,” LaFleur said. “To lose somebody like that, it’s tough.”

All eyes are on Gary now to shoulder the brunt of the pass-rush workload left behind by Parsons, even if Gary wouldn’t publicly admit Sunday night that he feels that weight. He’s making $24 million annually but doesn’t have a sack in the last seven games after having 7.5 in the first seven. As of Sunday night, he also ranked 41st in pressure percentage among players with at least 200 pass-rush snaps this season, according to TruMedia. Those numbers shouldn’t be synonymous with someone making as much as he is.

Even so, defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley issued an adamant defense of one of his most important players last week by highlighting Gary’s prowess defending the run and how opposing offenses scheme to neutralize him. Hafley even said he thinks Gary is “playing really well,” so all the box score watchers might have to take him at his word and trust that Gary can fill the Shaq-sized shoes left by Parsons for the Packers to stay afloat on defense.

Gary spoke with Parsons after Sunday’s loss. He told him to keep his head up and that they’d finish strong for him. Gary and all his teammates on both offense and defense must back up that promise with action, so those Super Bowl hopes become more reality than fantasy.

“This what I (will) say,” Gary said. “For the rest of the season, what we got? Three more opportunities? Watch how the front play … there’s gonna be a lot of opportunities the next three weeks, and we gotta take advantage of it, so you gon’ see how we play.”

Sunday’s shock will dissipate, however long it takes, and the 9-4-1 Packers will fly to Chicago for a Saturday night tilt with the division-leading, 10-4 Bears. The Packers will once again have an opportunity to seize the NFC North’s perch from their rivals, which they already did just seven days before the disaster in Denver, this time in enemy territory.

Green Bay went from No. 2 in the NFC to No. 7 after blowing a nine-point lead against the Broncos, however, and they’re not yet a playoff lock. The Packers sit 1.5 games ahead of the Lions for the final wild-card spot with a season sweep of Detroit already secured and three games remaining. Will the Packers reach the postseason? Probably. But that task — forget a Super Bowl run for now — became arduous with the Bears, Baltimore Ravens and Minnesota Vikings remaining. Not only because of the loss of Parsons, but also because the Packers lost three other key players to injury in Denver, too.

Wide receiver Christian Watson, one of the NFL’s best at his position since returning from ACL rehab in Week 8, suffered a chest injury early in the third quarter when Surtain landed on him while intercepting a deep ball from quarterback Jordan Love. The Packers led 23-14 at the time before everything fell apart. Watson was taken to a local hospital for imaging, but he flew home with the team on Sunday night. His return timetable is unclear.

Franchise right tackle Zach Tom and starting safety Evan Williams also left the game with knee injuries and didn’t return. The Packers await official diagnoses on two players who aren’t believed to be out long term, according to LaFleur, but could miss several weeks. Not to mention the season-ending ACL tear for star tight end Tucker Kraft in Week 9 and the season-ending lower-leg injuries earlier this season to No. 1 defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt and starting center Elgton Jenkins.

The Packers are the walking wounded at this point, but as LaFleur made clear at the podium in Denver, nobody will feel sorry for them.

Sunday's 16-13 loss at home to the Los Angeles Chargers means that, despite having three regular season games remaining, the Chiefs have already been eliminated from play-off contention.

Mahomes, 30, was forced off with less than two minutes left and his team later confirmed the three-time Super Bowl winner has torn the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee.

""Don't know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it's hurts,"" he said on X., external

""But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.

""Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.""

Kansas City's third loss in a row - and fifth in six games - left them with a 6-8 record this season and could mark the end of an NFL dynasty.

Head coach Andy Reid has led Kansas City to the play-offs in each of the past 10 seasons and to the Super Bowl in five of the past six.

The Chiefs won the NFL's championship game in 2020, 2023 and 2024, and were denied the first Super Bowl three-peat last February.

Mahomes became their starting quarterback in 2018 and has reached at least the AFC Championship game in each of the past seven seasons, a run bettered only by Tom Brady's New England Patriots (2011-2018)

The Chiefs have also produced the second-longest post-season run in NFL history behind the Patriots (2009-2019).",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/ae45/live/58cd9240-d94a-11f0-aba3-ad58b9c09695.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:00:21.101460

Cockcroft",,,,,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47309683/nfl-green-bay-packers-micah-parsons-acl-christian-watson,"Even after that, however, Gary struggled to find the right words to describe the effect of Parsons' injury.
Parsons was just starting to get rolling Sunday before he left the game in the third quarter following the noncontact injury to his left knee.
While his production spiked early on after Parsons' arrival, Gary has been stuck at 7.5 sacks for nearly two months.
On the other side of the locker room, the offensive players weren't sure what was going on with Watson.
The Packers know they're not getting back Parsons, Wyatt, Kraft or center Elgton Jenkins.","DENVER -- When the Green Bay Packers opened training camp on July 23, no one had any inkling they would trade for defensive end Micah Parsons shortly before the regular season or if receiver Christian Watson would return to his old form following last season's knee injury.

At that point, All-Pro safety Xavier McKinney believed his team could be a Super Bowl contender.

So in his mind, why would anything change after the Packers lost Parsons on Sunday to an apparent season-ending ACL injury and could be without Watson because of a chest injury that required a hospital visit before he could travel home with the team?

Perhaps he was just trying to be an optimist after all that happened Sunday -- including a 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos -- but McKinney refused to believe the Packers don't have a Super Bowl run in them.

""I mean, the season ain't over,"" McKinney said. ""So s---, we've still got work to do. And obviously with this loss, it puts us in a different spot, but we've still got a chance to do what we want to do: win the division and make a big run in the playoffs.

""Obviously, guys got hurt today, but that don't mean the season's just over. We've just got to keep working, keep finding ways where we can get better, we've got to try to be as healthy as possible and that's just what it is.""

The injuries, however, weren't just to any players. They were to their best defensive player and the most explosive offensive performer. This after they previously lost defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt to a season-ending ankle injury and budding star tight end Tucker Kraft to a torn ACL earlier this season.

In one corner of the visitors' locker room inside Empower Field at Mile High, Rashan Gary gathered his fellow defensive linemen and tried to send the message to their group that their season wasn't over, and it was on them to make up for Parsons' absence.

Even after that, however, Gary struggled to find the right words to describe the effect of Parsons' injury. He paused for a full 12 seconds -- an eternity when more than a dozen reporters were waiting on his first word -- before he could come up with an answer to the first question about Parsons.

""Hurt to see,"" Gary said. ""Will be missed on this defense. All I know is -- that gives us more guys up front, more opportunities when they come to rush to cause havoc. With his absence, we got to step up front.""

Parsons was just starting to get rolling Sunday before he left the game in the third quarter following the noncontact injury to his left knee. After failing to successfully pressure Broncos quarterback Bo Nix in the first half, the Packers got to him on eight of his 13 dropbacks in the third quarter. Parsons had four of those -- including three on the drive in which he was injured. Parsons led the NFL with 64 pressures this season before he left Sunday's game.

""Just an accountability thing,"" defensive lineman Karl Brooks said of Gary's message. ""Essentially just saying, just stating the obvious, bro. Just we got to step up, we got to make plays when presented and we just got to be on top of our s---. That's all.""

Gary, however, hasn't produced like the Packers had hoped. While his production spiked early on after Parsons' arrival, Gary has been stuck at 7.5 sacks for nearly two months. His last sack came Oct. 26. In terms of pressures, Gary ranks a distant second to Parsons with 28. The difference of 36 pressures represents the largest gap between any team's top-two leaders this season, according to ESPN Research.

""It's a big loss, but we've got good players,"" McKinney said. ""That would be just saying everybody else -- all the other D-linemen that we have -- aren't worth a s---, but they are. They're really good players. They were good players before he came in. Obviously, he elevated those guys a lot in a lot of ways, and I think even with him being out, he's one of them guys where he's still going to help the other guys ...

""Yeah, we're going to miss him out there on the field, but I think mentally he's still going to be there for us and that's what we're expecting from him. We've got players all around, we've got good depth.""

On the other side of the locker room, the offensive players weren't sure what was going on with Watson. Few, if any, got the chance to speak with him before he left for the hospital. The fact that he was released in time to go back to Green Bay on Sunday night was a good sign that perhaps it's not a season-ending injury.

Watson's injury seemed to change the whole tone of the game. The Packers led 23-14 and had the ball when quarterback Jordan Love took a deep shot to Watson, whose return to action Oct. 26 expanded the deep-ball dynamic in the offense. When Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II made a leaping interception, he landed on Watson, who appeared to reach for his shoulder or collarbone.

""We'll see what the injury is, but I think since Christian's been back from his rehab, he's done some great things and been that explosive playmaker that we needed,"" Love said. ""With him going out, I think we still got plenty of depth in that receiver room and other guys that played plenty of ball and can step up and make plays.

""I think we'll have no problem filling that void if he's got to miss time. ... I think we've got plenty of depth in that room and plenty of guys that are playmakers, as well, that we'll have no problem if he is out.""

There was more: Right tackle Zach Tom and safety Evan Williams couldn't finish the game because of knee injuries, tight end Josh Whyle left with a concussion and receiver Jayden Reed hobbled off the field on the final drive.

At some point, injuries can ruin a season. The Packers know they're not getting back Parsons, Wyatt, Kraft or center Elgton Jenkins. So the question now is do they still have enough to make a run. They're 9-4-1 and left Denver clinging to the final NFC wild-card playoff spot. A win at Chicago (10-4) on Saturday will put the Packers right back on top of the North Division and give them the tiebreaker over the Bears.

""It's not going to be one individual that can do that,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. ""I think it's the collective, it's everybody playing to the best of their ability. And, you know, like I said before, they're going to have to feed off one another and rally around each other, and it's going to be opportunities for other guys to get in there, and they're going to have to be impactful.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589490_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:00:25.588018

The Broncos outscored Green Bay 20-3 the rest of the way while converting all four of their red-zone opportunities for the game.
""The game the whole day felt weird; even when we were up, the game felt weird,"" Jacobs said.
While the fourth-year receiver didn't return to the game, Watson was allowed to travel back to Green Bay with the team.
""That's a real critical piece to our offense, obviously,"" said receiver Jayden Reed, who led Green Bay with five catches for 55 yards.","DENVER – As the hits keep coming for the Packers, Josh Jacobs keeps absorbing every blow coming his way.

Listed as questionable with a knee injury entering Sunday's game with Denver, the Packers running back once again blocked out the pain and it was nearly enough to help Green Bay pull of a major road win over the AFC-leading Broncos.

Although the Packers fell 34-26 in front of 75,555 at Mile High Stadium, Jacobs gave the Packers a chance with 14 touches for 91 yards while scoring both of Green Bay's touchdowns.

And he was feeling the aftereffects of the hard-fought game afterwards.

""I'm sore. A little bit of everywhere honestly,"" Jacobs said. ""I told the guys, 'Man, you gotta know that I really care about this group because what we put our body through is crazy.' I'm definitely feeling that today.""

Jacobs has been battling a knee issue dating back to last month's 27-20 win over the New York Giants at MetLife. He missed two days of practice this week before returning on Friday.

Jacobs' importance grew in scale when his primary backup, Emanuel Wilson, was added to the injury report with an illness that had him questionable for the game. Wilson played but carried the ball just twice aside from returning kickoffs.

Green Bay moved the ball throughout the first half but was forced to settle for two Brandon McManus field goals before Jacobs made a terrific catch on a wheel route before halftime for his second career touchdown reception.

Quarterback Jordan Love fit the pass in perfectly to Jacobs, who hauled in the 14-yard touchdown over Dre Greenlaw to give the Packers a 13-7 lead with 4 minutes, 29 seconds left in the half.

""I've been asking them to call that all year,"" Jacobs said. ""I like me against a linebacker any time. It's crazy because like two or three plays before that, we were talking like we need to call that, we've been repping it and then we called it.

""I was trying to tell them, trust me. (Jordan) was like, 'I was throwing it either way. I knew what you were going to do.' Shout out to Jordan for that.""

Jacobs sparked the Packers out of halftime, too, when he broke a 40-yard touchdown run to extend Green Bay's lead to 23-14.

It was his longest run with the Packers and his longest touchdown run since a 63-yard score against Kansas City in Week 12 of the 2023 season with Las Vegas.

The game turned on the Packers' next possession, though, when Love fired a deep ball to receiver Christian Watson. Not only did reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain intercept the ball, but Watson also suffered a chest injury that knocked him out for the rest of the game.

The Broncos outscored Green Bay 20-3 the rest of the way while converting all four of their red-zone opportunities for the game. Meanwhile, the Packers finished 1-of-4 inside the 20.

""The game the whole day felt weird; even when we were up, the game felt weird,"" Jacobs said. ""We got in the red zone a few times, didn't score. We had a lot more penalties than we did the last several weeks.

""We look at this film and we know if we clean up a few things here or there it could be a totally different game. It still came down to the wire. They're a really good team. It's a really good team they have and we'll see them again.""

Injuries took their toll: In addition to losing Micah Parsons to a non-contact knee injury, the Packers finished the game without Watson, safety Evan Williams (knee), tight end Josh Whyle (concussion) and right tackle Zach Tom (knee).

Tom sustained his injury on the same play Jacobs caught his touchdown. Darian Kinnard finished the game at right tackle.

""It's definitely weird on the field seeing guys, 'Dang, another one. Another one is happening,' and it's key players,"" Jacobs said. ""It's guys who play big roles on our team. I don't know. In this game, that's part of this game. Sometimes you can't fill those shoes but somebody else is gonna have to step up and contribute. That's why it's a team sport.""

Watson's loss was a turning point in the contest, especially considering the impact he's had on the offense since he returned from the torn ACL that ended his 2024 campaign.

While the fourth-year receiver didn't return to the game, Watson was allowed to travel back to Green Bay with the team.

""That's a real critical piece to our offense, obviously,"" said receiver Jayden Reed, who led Green Bay with five catches for 55 yards. ""It's our job to go out there and execute and next man step up and make the play.""

Back to the Bears: With the Packers' loss and a 31-3 drubbing of Cleveland, Chicago improved to 10-3 and retook a half-game lead over Green Bay in the NFC North.

The two teams will meet this Saturday at Soldier Field, a rematch of last Sunday's game at Lambeau Field that saw the Packers win 28-21 on Keisean Nixon's game-ending INT.

""We got a short week, we gotta flip the page,"" defensive lineman Rashan Gary said. ""Get back on the Bears. I think they had a hell of a game today. Just gotta get back on track and that's what we're gonna do.""

Penalty problems: The penalty issues that hampered Green Bay earlier this season resurfaced in Denver, as the Packers were called for 10 infractions for 72 yards.

""It's just our job to go out there and execute the right way, not have penalties,"" Reed said. ""Not hurt ourselves. Even with me, I hold myself accountable because late in the game, in a critical game, I ran the wrong route. … so I hold myself accountable.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/iwhmkizifourvyoc4prw,N,,2025-12-15 03:58:52.822706

Quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL in the final moments of the game.

The loss ends the Chiefs' streak of seven consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances.

This season marks the first time the Chiefs have missed the playoffs since Mahomes became the starting quarterback.

So, this is how it ends.

Patrick Mahomes was knocked out of the loss that eliminated the Kansas City Chiefs in the waning moments of the game with a wicked left knee injury.

There was no cape for Superman to put on to save the Chiefs Kingdom this time.

Rats. Oh, you know he tried.

But the knee buckled and bent awkwardly. He lay on the turf in apparent anguish as the medical team administered treatment. Teammates went down to one knee. It was a somber scene at Arrowhead Stadium. Mahomes, who has demonstrated repeatedly that he is as great as it gets, is human after all. The Chiefs needed him to spark a last-minute rally for a game-tying field goal or even a winning touchdown, but there was nothing left.

Oh, you know he was game.

Mahomes scored the only Chiefs touchdown during the 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, and for much of the game was his team’s leading rusher. This was part of the problem. Too often, they’ve relied on him to do too much. He won’t win the NFL’s MVP award this season, but he deserves it nonetheless, because without him – and with all due respect to the oft-proficient, Steve Spagnuolo-coordinated defense that allowed just 16 points on Sunday – his team was toast.

He provided heart, soul, energy, hope and logic that with the Chiefs’ season on the line – and the remarkable streak of seven consecutive trips to the AFC championship game in the mix – there was still a chance to make a miracle run.

Until there wasn’t.

Minutes after the game, the ominous tone from Chiefs coach Andy Reid strongly hinted that the star quarterback was done for the year.

“It doesn’t look good,” Reid said during his postgame news conference.

The Chiefs followed on Sunday night with official confirmation that Mahomes suffered a torn ACL. A statement from the team added, “Patrick and the club are exploring surgical options.”

No Mahomes, no chance on Sunday. Now, what's next?

First things first: Hail to the Chiefs. This is the first time that Kansas City (6-8) won’t be in AFC playoffs since Mahomes became the starter, and it’s the first time the Chiefs have lost at least eight games in a season since 2012, when they were 2-14 in the season before Andy Reid became coach.

With Mahomes, the Chiefs won three Super Bowls and played in two others. In a parity-laden league leveled out by a salary cap, the Chiefs managed to keep winning, keep competing for crowns, to establish their own dynasty in the aftermath of the New England Patriots run powered by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.

Now this.

Mahomes gamely limped off the field and to the bench under his own power after suffering his injury. And intentional or not, it was some kind of statement about the determination and pride that any of us who have watched him over the years realize runs so deep through his blood.

Minutes later, though, CBS’ cameras captured his journey to the locker room. Mahomes couldn’t get there on his own. He was helped up the tunnel with medical staffers holding him up on both sides like human crutches.

Sadly, this moment symbolized how this chapter – if not era – ends for the proud franchise that is now so battered.

Sure, Mahomes is the face of the Chiefs. But that was a dose of unintended insult added to injury. The Chiefs didn’t just lose. They lost their main man in the process.

With Mahomes knocked out of the contest, the Chiefs turned to Gardner Minshew, the backup quarterback without so much as a cape.

Minshew came in and promptly moved the chains with a short completion to Travis Kelce. Good idea. Good execution. Then the Chiefs were flagged for delay of game, with the poor execution of just getting the snap off reflected by the lack of urgency that you’d never see from Mahomes in this situation.

The next play, Minshew threw a lazy pass toward Kelce into double – or was it, triple? – coverage that was intercepted by Derwin James.

In other words, no Mahomes, no chance.

A weird January is coming in 2026. The last time the Chiefs weren’t in the AFC Championship Game? Try 2017. Way back on pre-pandemic Earth.

Maybe it is indeed the end of an era for the Chiefs, whose streak of nine consecutive AFC West titles was snapped. It’s certainly more than a mere speed bump.

Suddenly, this season, a team that knew how to win in crunch time – the Chiefs were 12-0 in one-score games last season and set an NFL record by winning 17 consecutive one-score games – couldn’t win the close ones.

On Sunday, the Chiefs fell to 1-7 this season in one-score games.

What next? There are glaring gaps with the running game and the pass rush, and who knows how much longer Kelce will play after mulling retirement last offseason. Yet with Mahomes being Mahomes – and it is apparent that rehab will dominate his offseason – they can still build around the quintessential centerpiece.

Yet nothing is automatic. As spectacular as Mahomes has been over the years, it was never automatic that he’d lead another Super Bowl run, even though it might have seemed that way. That was always packing a superhero cape. Now it’s not automatic that the Chiefs will quickly bounce back as a contender.

For a change, the Chiefs will have a long offseason to deal with their issues.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/14/USAT/87767071007-usatsi-27816950.jpg?crop=4453,2505,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-15 02:01:11.530962

""Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options,"" the team said in a statement.

Mahomes suffered the injury during the final drive of Sunday's game. After trying to extend a play to his right, he threw the ball away just before his left leg was twisted awkwardly as he planted his foot and Chargers defensive lineman Da'Shawn Hand brought him down.

Mahomes instantly grabbed his left knee in pain as the team's medical staff rushed toward Kansas City's star player. He needed assistance getting to his feet and draped his arms over the shoulders of trainers as he limped to the locker room.

""Don't know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it's hurts,"" Mahomes said in a statement posted to the social media website, X, minutes before the news of his torn ACL was made public.

""But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.""

Mahomes, who had been dealing with a knee issue the past few weeks, was constantly harassed by L.A.'s defense before suffering the injury, getting sacked five times and sustaining several more hits while the Chargers pass rush pressured him on 48.6% of his dropbacks, per Next Gen Stats.

Sunday's loss also officially eliminated the Chiefs from postseason contention for the first time in Mahomes' eight years as a starter and the first time overall since 2014.

Mahomes, a two-time league MVP and three-time Super Bowl MVP, had previously made at least the AFC Championship Game in each season of his career as starting QB (since 2018).

Gardner Minshew replaced Mahomes under center for K.C.'s final drive, throwing a game-clinching interception in the Chiefs' last offensive play of the afternoon.

Leading up to the slate, it was poised to be one of, if not the, defining weekend of the 2025 regular season. As the action unfolded, we started to see the playoff picture come into focus, particularly with teams that will not be vying for a Lombardi Trophy this winter.

Most notably, the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals were officially eliminated from playoff contention, meaning neither Patrick Mahomes nor Joe Burrow will be a factor in the AFC. That's good news for Josh Allen, who helped the Buffalo Bills rally from a 21-point deficit against the New England Patriots to keep his team's hopes of leaping into first place in the AFC East alive.

Naturally, there are numerous takeaways from the pandemonium that Week 15 produced. But which of those takeaways are something that will have legs for the final three weeks, and which are merely an overreaction? Below, we'll determine just that by taking a look at some of the notable storylines from Week 15 and figure out which we should take seriously and which we should chalk up as a mere overreaction.

Josh Allen has played himself into the MVP conversation

Overreaction vs. reality: Reality

Josh Allen was sensational in Week 15. The Bills QB kept his team's hopes of winning the division alive by rallying from a 21-point deficit over the New England Patriots in Foxborough. Allen led a second-half rally that saw Buffalo outscore New England 28-7, and the defending NFL MVP led five straight touchdown drives in the process. Allen finished the day throwing for three touchdowns to go with his 193 yards through the air and a 123.1 passer rating.

This was the third time this season that the Bills rallied from a deficit of 10 or more points, and the second in as many weeks. Not only does this latest comeback win keep Buffalo in range of the AFC East crown, but it should also thrust him into the MVP conversation with Drake Maye (who he just defeated) and Matthew Stafford. Allen just notched his third season with at least 25 passing touchdowns and 10 rushing touchdowns, which is the most in NFL history. If he gets Buffalo back atop the division, there's a strong case for a back-to-back MVP.

Eagles have fixed their issues on offense

Overreaction vs. reality: Overreaction

Philadelphia looked like a well-oiled machine during Sunday's 31-0 win over the Raiders. Jalen Hurts completed 12 of his 15 passes for 175 yards and three touchdowns, while adding 39 yards on the ground. This was Hurts' first game with three or more passing touchdowns since Week 8, and he had just four passing touchdowns over his last five games combined. Meanwhile, the Eagles averaged 5.9 yards per play and converted 10 of their 13 third-down situations in the win.

While this was encouraging for the offense, I wouldn't exhale fully if I were Philly. The Las Vegas Raiders are arguably the worst team in the NFL, and have struggled mightily in the secondary. Had the Eagles not had their way with them through the air in Week 15, it would've been a five-alarm fire. Simply put, they did what they were supposed to do and snapped a three-game losing skid in the process. Lucky for them, they get another easy matchup next week against a poor Commanders pass defense, so the good times should continue to roll. Have they actually fixed their issues, though? That remains to be seen.

Zac Taylor coached his last meaningful game for Bengals

Overreaction vs. reality: Reality

Joe Burrow made headlines this week when he made ominous comments about his playing future. However, I think more eyes should be on his coach. After a shutout loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati is officially eliminated from playoff contention, which should make the seat under Zac Taylor hotter than the surface of the sun.

While he may not get the boot in the immediate aftermath of this contest, I believe he coached his last meaningful game for Cincinnati in Week 15, with the club potentially looking for new leadership once the regular season officially concludes. When you pair Burrow's comments with the lackluster effort we saw unfold in Week 15, this feels like an organization that has no one to inspire, which falls on the shoulders of Taylor.

Jaguars are the best team in the AFC South

Overreaction vs. reality: Overreaction

The Jaguars just notched their fifth straight win and is 10-4 on the season, which keeps them in first place in the AFC South. While the Jags are the No. 3 seed in the conference, I still have a hard time thinking they are the best in their own division, let alone one of the top clubs in the AFC. Trevor Lawrence was spectacular in Week 15, throwing for five touchdowns and adding a rushing score.

As impressive as it was, we have to point out that it came against the lowly New York Jets, and this current winning streak hasn't seen them beat a ton of powerbrokers in the NFL (Chargers, Cardinals, Titans, Colts, Jets). Next week's game at Denver will be a better barometer as to who this team actually is, and how we should view it in the overall playoff picture in the AFC. I think if you gave every playoff team in the AFC some truth serum, each would confess rather playing Jacksonville than Houston at the moment.

Shedeur Sanders played his way out as Browns QB of the future

Overreaction vs. reality: Reality

It was a memorable day for Shedeur Sanders for all the wrong reasons. The Browns quarterback struggled mightily in a 31-3 loss to the Chicago Bears, completing just 51.4% of his passes for 177 yards, no touchdowns, and three interceptions. Those turnovers should be Cleveland's biggest concern as the Browns continue to evaluate the rookie as a potential franchise quarterback.

Sanders had just two interceptions over his first three career starts, so to see the floor fall out from under him here may be the first domino that takes him out of consideration as the QB of the future. Certainly, Sanders didn't do himself any favors in convincing the Browns to steer clear of drafting a young signal-caller.

Seattle is fools' gold after nearly losing to Philip Rivers

Overreaction vs. reality: Overreaction

The Seahawks were nearly the butt of the joke throughout the NFL, had they not pulled off a last-minute comeback to avoid being upset by the Colts. Specifically, it would've been a horrendous look for a team earmarked for the playoffs to lose to a 44-year-old Philip Rivers, who hadn't played an NFL game for 1,800 days. Naturally, allowing Rivers to run somewhat efficiently has folks wondering if we're viewing Seattle all wrong. Are they really as big a threat as their 11-3 record indicates? Or are they merely fools' gold, and this outing against Rivers was a glimmer of their fraudulence?

With a massive showdown with the Rams on deck for Thursday, I think Seattle was simply caught sleeping a bit in this game and looking ahead to that matchup. Its strong play defensively and an offense centered around Jaxson Smith-Njigba is enough to make them dangerous in the playoffs, even if it didn't quite look like it on Sunday.

Micah Parsons' injury dashes Packers' Super Bowl hopes

Overreaction vs. reality: Reality

Week 15 couldn't have gone worse for the Packers. Coming into the day, they were the No. 2 seed in the conference and in first place in the NFC North. However, after losing to the Broncos, they've fallen all the way to the No. 7 seed, with the Bears leaping back ahead of them. To make matters even more dire, star pass rusher Micah Parsons left Sunday's loss with what is reportedly feared to be a torn ACL.

If/when that injury is confirmed, Parsons' absence this season could also result in the end of Green Bay's Super Bowl hopes. Parsons was the straw that stirred the drink of their defense and led the unit with 12.5 sacks on the season. With him out of the picture, it completely changes how opposing teams game plan against them and dramatically lowers the ceiling of the defense. With a pivotal game against the Bears next week, his absence will be felt almost instantly.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/15/dbdf8ff2-3276-4870-b277-649d9ed3b3bc/thumbnail/1200x675/bec4feb50e158d20c3eb2274656fbd23/micah-parsons.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 21:58:58.691548

Patrick Mahomes suffered a left knee injury late in the fourth quarter of Sunday's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers and is set to undergo an MRI either Sunday night or Monday, head coach Andy Reid told reporters after the game.

Reid did not speculate on the severity of the injury, but he said that the play ""didn't look good.""

Mahomes suffered the injury while trying to extend a play to his right, throwing the ball away just before his left leg was twisted awkwardly as he planted his foot and Chargers defensive lineman Da'Shawn Hand brought him down.

Mahomes instantly grabbed his left knee in pain as the team's medical staff rushed toward the two-time Most Valuable Player. He needed assistance getting to his feet and draped his arms over the shoulders of trainers as he limped to the locker room.

""Don't know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it's hurts,"" Mahomes later posted on the social media website, X. ""But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.""

Gardner Minshew replaced Mahomes with the Kansas City's playoff hopes on the line.

Down 16-13 with 1:53 remaining and the ball at the Chargers 46-yard line, Minshew completed three short passes before Derwin James intercepted his fifth pass attempt of the drive to end the game and eliminate a divisional rival from an 11th-consecutive postseason berth.

Mahomes was constantly harassed by L.A.'s defense before suffering the injury, getting sacked five times and sustaining several more hits while the Chargers pass rush pressured him on 48.6% of his dropbacks, per Next Gen Stats.

It amounted to a trying effort on Sunday for Mahomes, who went 16-of-28 passing for 189 yards, including one brutal interception early in the fourth quarter that led to a long Chargers possession that took seven-plus minutes off the clock.

While the Chiefs defense did their part, Mahomes and Co. had a chance to wipe away another rough outing with a game-winning drive.

Green Bay Packers star edge rusher Micah Parsons suffered a non-contact knee injury against the Denver Broncos on Sunday night, and it's doesn't look good for the rest of the 2025 season.

It was initially believed that Parsons, who was infamously traded to the Packers from the Dallas Cowboys before the start of the 2025 season, tore his ACL in his left knee, according to multiple reports.

Some believed Parsons mouthed, ""I’m out,"" as cameras were close up on him to get a look at the moment. Parsons would eventually walk off the field, but he hung his head as he went into the locker room. Broncos star cornerback Pat Surtain II even walked over to Parsons, understanding the situation could be very serious.

Upon review of the play, Parsons had a lane to Nix, but the quarterback quickly moved to his left. That caused Parsons to plant his left leg hard into the turf, and that’s when he immediately grabbed his knee as he went down to the ground.

Parsons left the game with two total tackles.

PATRICK MAHOMES SUFFERS BRUTAL KNEE INJURY AS CHIEFS ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFF CONTENTION

The obvious thought when seeing a non-contact injury involving a knee is that it’s a torn ligament. While the belief is Parsons suffered the torn ACL, an MRI on Monday will confirm what the Packers unfortunately believe.

This injury comes at the worst time for the Packers, who are in the midst of a playoff race. They came into Sunday leading the NFC North with a 9-3-1 record, facing a Broncos team who have won their last 10 games. The Broncos moved that streak to 11, though, as they beat Green Bay, 34-26, after Parsons left the game.

The Packers’ pass rush has been a main driver behind tremendous production on their end. Entering Sunday, the Packers ranked fifth in the NFL in yards allowed per game (287.2) and points allowed (19.0), while Parsons has enjoyed a successful first year in Green Bay.

Parsons, the two-time All-Pro and four-time Pro Bowler, tallied 12.5 sacks in 14 games with 39 combined tackles and one forced fumble. He was already past his 2024 total of 12 sacks and hoping to get more before heading toward the playoffs, granted the Packers made it in as one of the seven NFC seeds.

Parsons was not only traded from the Cowboys to the Packers this offseason, but he also signed a massive five-year, $210 million extension with $120 million guaranteed. The deal made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL, and it was immediately debated whether the Cowboys made the right move.

Star wide receiver Davante Adams suffered a hamstring injury during the fourth quarter of the Rams’ 41-34 win over the Detroit Lions.

Adams was injured as he attempted to track a deep pass thrown by Matthew Stafford on third-and-3 with 12:42 on the clock in the fourth quarter. Adams stayed down on the turf for a few moments before he was helped off the field by the Rams’ medical staff. He was able to walk off the field and into the locker room under his own power.

The Rams deemed Adams questionable to return, but he never checked back into the game.

Adams produced four catches for 71 yards at the time of his injury. The veteran wideout leads the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns this season. He was questionable going into Week 15 due to a nagging hamstring injury.

Even if a ligament isn't fully snapped, a guy with that sort of playing style will be half as good when he has no knee support from an even slightly injured ligament.

The news was first reported by Pro Football Talk.

Parsons sustained a noncontact injury to his left knee in the third quarter against the Denver Broncos.

In the same quarter, the Packers also lost perhaps their most explosive offensive player in Christian Watson to a chest injury.

Parsons pulled up while trying to rush Broncos quarterback Bo Nix and immediately grabbed his left knee. He was able to walk to the locker room but with a significant limp. He was ruled out in the fourth quarter.

Parsons did not record a sack Sunday, but he made his presence felt early when he forced a fumble against Broncos running back RJ Harvey on the game's opening drive that was recovered by Packers linebacker Edgerrin Cooper.

To date, Parsons' first season with the Packers has been a resounding success after they traded two first-round picks plus defensive tackle Kenny Clark to the Dallas Cowboys to acquire him shortly before the season. The Packers gave Parsons a four-year, $188 million contract on the same day they traded for him.

With 12.5 sacks coming into the game, Parsons is the first player in NFL history to record at least a dozen sacks in each of his first five NFL seasons. Parsons also came into Week 15 with an NFL-leading 60 pressures, 10 more than any other player in the league and the most pressures by any player within a team's first 13 games of a season in the past seven years.

Watson was ruled out shortly after his injury, which occurred when Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II landed on top of Watson while intercepting a deep pass from Jordan Love. Watson appeared to land hard on his left shoulder, with Surtain's body weight making it worse.

Before leaving, Watson had three catches for 29 yards in the game, and the Packers were leading 23-14.

Watson was playing in his eighth game of the season after missing the first two months while recovering from a knee injury. He had been highly productive since his return with 25 catches for 452 yards and five touchdowns.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589424_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 19:59:05.174793

Parsons was on the ground for a while, being attended to by athletic trainers after going down while chasing Broncos quarterback Bo Nix. He eventually got up and walked to the locker room with assistance.

The Packers also lost wide receiver Christian Watson to a chest injury earlier in the third quarter. Watson was injured when a pass intended for him was intercepted by Broncos cornerback Patrick Surtain. The Packers trailed the Broncos 27-23 when the fourth quarter began.

The impact of losing Parsons

We don’t know the official diagnosis for Parsons’ knee injury, but it didn’t look good. Losing him for the season would be a crushing blow to the Packers’ Super Bowl hopes. He’s arguably been the second-best defensive player in the NFL this season behind the Cleveland Browns’ Myles Garrett.

Parsons’ face after his non-contact left knee injury spoke volumes, as did his teammates taking a knee and Broncos players coming over to wish him well as he left the field. Parsons needed the assistance of two trainers to limp off the field and then into the locker room. You could argue that Parsons is even more irreplaceable than quarterback Jordan Love, and the Packers already lost one of their most important players in tight end Tucker Kraft for the season to a Week 9 torn ACL. — Matt Schneidman, Packers beat writer

Entering Week 15, Parsons ranked tied for third in the NFL with 12.5 sacks, third in total pressures with 74 and second in pressure percentage (19.2 percent), according to TruMedia. He had rejuvenated a Packers pass rush that couldn’t consistently get home with four last season, after which defensive line coach Jason Rebrovich was fired.

The Packers’ acquisition of Parsons on the eve of the season, in one of the sport’s most seismic trades ever, injected life into not only Green Bay’s defense but also its locker room and the fan base. Parsons had been everything the Packers hoped when they shipped off their next two first-round picks and franchise cornerstone Kenny Clark. Now, they hope his knee injury isn’t as serious as it appeared.

The biggest news of the day comes in the health department, as three-time MVP Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL late in the fourth quarter of Sunday's loss against the Chargers. Not only were they eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since the 2014 season — they'll also be without their star quarterback the rest of the way, with Gardner Minshew stepping in as the next man up.

The Green Bay Packers also got some brutal news, as star defensive end Micah Parsons suffered what is feared to be a torn ACL against the Denver Broncos on Sunday. Parsons tallied 12.5 sacks over 14 games in his first season with the Packers, following his blockbuster trade from the Cowboys this offseason. He's notched another 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble.

The biggest news of the day comes in the health department, as three-time MVP Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL late in the fourth quarter of Sunday's loss against the Chargers. Not only were they eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since the 2014 season — they'll also be without their star quarterback the rest of the way, with Gardner Minshew stepping in as the next man up.

The Green Bay Packers also got some brutal news, as star defensive end Micah Parsons suffered what is feared to be a torn ACL against the Denver Broncos on Sunday. Parsons tallied 12.5 sacks over 14 games in his first season with the Packers, following his blockbuster trade from the Cowboys this offseason. He's notched another 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble.

The Packers will face the Chicago Bears next week in a game that will almost certainly define the division.

Along with the injury news, there were plenty of shake-ups in the NFL playoff race. Here's where things stand heading into SNF:

The ball was intercepted by Broncos' All-Pro Patrick Surtain as both players went to the ground.

The Packers' wide receiver was tended to be several members of the Packers' medical team and head coach Matt LaFleur came on the field. Watson then went to the locker room.

Watson missed the first six games of the season as he recovered from a torn ACL he suffered in the finale game of the 2024 season on Jan. 5, 2025.

The fourth-year receiver, who has battled many injuries in his career, has been playing some of the best football of his career as the team's No. 1 option in recent weeks.

He had five touchdown receptions in the last four games heading into the contest at Denver.

Christian Watson injury update

Watson is getting X-rays in the locker room for the chest injury, CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson reported.

The Packers initially said Watson was questionable to return before ruling him out.

Christian Watson injury

Watson suffered the injury on the first play of the Packers' second offensive drive of the second half. They held a 23-14 lead after their defense forced a three and out on the Broncos.

Love was looking for a big shot with his most explosive player. But Surtain cut in front of Watson and picked off the pass. Watson sustained the injury on the fall.

He immediately grabbed his shoulder and stayed down.

Christian Watson stats

Watson had three catches for 29 yards before the injury. He has been the team's leading receiver in each of the last two weeks.

In seven games, he had 25 catches for 452 yards and five touchdowns.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/15/PMJS/87768381007-gan-20251214-tcs-ac-4-258.jpg?crop=3748,2108,x0,y232&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-14 19:59:44.518059

Titans miss FG attempt ahead of halftime

The San Francisco 49ers get lucky!

The Tennessee Titans very nearly cut the Niners' lead to four points with a field goal attempt at halftime, but kicker Joey Slye was no good from 50 yards as time expired.

It's an unfortunate end to the drive for Tennessee, after gaining some momentum in the second quarter following a 34-yard touchdown from rookie Cam Ward to TE Gunnar Helm.

Mahomes was trying to rally the Chiefs in the closing seconds, but instead their comeback -- and playoff -- hopes ended, as Kansas City was officially eliminated from postseason contention with the loss.

Mahomes was hurt after he scrambled out of the pocket and was chased down by Chargers defensive end Da'Shawn Hand before throwing an incompletion. He remained down on the ground for several minutes before standing up and leaving and was replaced by Gardner Minshew.

A few minutes later, Mahomes exited the medical tent with a towel over his head while being assisted by the medical staff, walking gingerly to the locker room.

The Chargers finished off the win with a Derwin James Jr. interception of Minshew, as they improved to 10-4 while dropping Kansas City to 6-8.

The Chiefs had advanced to the postseason each of the past 10 seasons.

The superstar quarterback awaits further testing to diagnose the extent of his ailment, and coach Andy Reid said postgame that Mahomes will undergo an MRI later on Sunday or on Monday. Gardner Minshew closed the game in relief of Mahomes, who walked off the field and was able to put weight on his left leg.

The injury occurred while Mahomes was rolling out toward the sideline and throwing the ball downfield. A Chargers defender pulled him to the ground during the throw, and his leg bent awkwardly as he lost his footing.

""I don't know, but it doesn't look good,"" Reid said of the severity of Mahomes' injury. ""You guys saw it. We'll just see where it goes.""

Mahomes remained down on the field for multiple minutes while trainers examined his leg. He was in clear discomfort and removed his helmet before rising to his feet and walking into the medical tent. Trainers then helped him walk up the tunnel and into the locker room.

The Chiefs trailed, 16-13, when Mahomes left the contest. He completed 16 of 28 passes for 189 yards without a touchdown, and he threw one interception and took five sacks. Mahomes did find the end zone with his legs, however, and took two carries for 15 yards and a score.

Patrick Mahomes injury clouds Chiefs' outlook for 2025 and beyond

With the loss and the results in other games on Sunday, the Chiefs are eliminated from playoff contention. Kansas City faced a number of elimination scenarios entering Week 15, and a string of results occurred in the early window to dash its postseason homes. The loss to the Chargers, combined with the Jaguars' win over the Jets, the Bills' win over the Patriots and the Texans' win over the Cardinals triggered a nightmare outcome for the Chiefs, who will watch the playoffs from home for the first time since 2014.

The 10-year playoff streak was the second longest in NFL history behind the Patriots' 11-year run from 2009-19.

This is the first time in Mahomes' nine-year career that he will not participate in the postseason. The injury also clouds his outlook for the rest of the regular season. Regardless of the severity, the Chiefs could opt to either slow-play his return or hold him out for the final three games altogether considering they do not have a division or conference title to play for, nor are they in the hunt for playoff seeding.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/14/a1b381fe-1fd1-435d-aad1-5e7f3b6d6cf5/thumbnail/1200x675/a72e1f2edba7069d276cbb9b1581df48/untitled-design-2025-12-14t134555-134.png,N,,2025-12-14 17:58:46.806009

Mahomes was eventually helped to his feet and hobbled over to the bench. He was taken to the blue medical tent for further treatment before being seen hobbling into the locker room with two Chiefs staffers holding him up by the shoulders.

Mahomes was replaced by veteran backup Gardner Minshew. The 29-year-old completed 3 of 5 passes for 22 yards in place of Mahomes but threw an interception to Derwin James with just 14 seconds remaining in regulation.

The pick sealed a 16-13 loss for the Chiefs and eliminated them from postseason contention.

Patrick Mahomes injury update

Andy Reid told reporters during his postgame news conference that Mahomes would have an MRI on his injured left knee by Monday. The 67-year-old sounded pessimistic when discussing the star quarterback's injury.

""It didn’t look good,"" Reid said when asked about Mahomes' injury. ""We'll just see where it goes.""

The Chiefs did not immediately provide an update about Mahomes' status after he exited the game. Just two minutes remained in the fourth quarter when he left the field, and he did not return to action.

The Chiefs have just three quarterbacks in their organization, including Mahomes. They are as follows:

Patrick Mahomes

Gardner Minshew

This offense is philosophically broken to its core. The past two years of winning on defense and 15’s situational brilliance masked the flaws and led to zero real changes. Now those flaws are exposed. A top-half draft pick, a long offseason for rest and scheme evolution, and a third-place schedule set KC up to bounce back.

First, to recap the bad news. The Lions will be without their top three safeties in this game, as Kerby Joseph was ruled OUT on Friday, while Brian Branch was placed on injured reserve, and Thomas Harper was downgraded to OUT on Saturday after not clearing the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Decker has been nursing a shoulder injury all season. While it’s become customary for him to miss a practice or two during the week as part of his injury management plan, he missed all three practices this week, raising some concerns about his availability for this game.

Fortunately, Decker’s absences were just for rehabilitation purposes, and he IS ACTIVE for this game and is expected to start at left tackle.

Unfortunately, there’s a bit more bad news. Kayode Awosika, who had been starting at left guard in place of Christian Mahogany (on injured reserve), will miss his second game with a foot injury. Look for the Lions to once again turn to veteran Trystan Colon to start, while also mixing in rookie Miles Frazier to get some reps.

The last time a team other than the Bills won the AFC East was in 2019, when the Patriots won the division.

Other big Sunday afternoon matchups include the Green Bay Packers visiting the Denver Broncos, and the Indianapolis Colts taking on the Seattle Seahawks. Quarterback Philip Rivers, 44, is set to make his first start since the 2020 NFL season in relief of Daniel Jones, who suffered a ruptured Achilles in Week 14, ending his season.

Fantasy managers out there, beware! The Sunday slate is filled with winter weather. The coldest game of the week is expected to be Bears-Browns in Chicago, where fans can expect a wind chill of -19 and winds up to 22 mph. Check out the full Week 15 NFL weather report here.

They're actually calling it an aggravation or a re-injury and if you're doing that during warm-ups that seems like there was something seriously wrong.","Yeah our sub kept doing the “this is why you don’t rest guys even if we have depth at that position group” after the loss to the Packers, and why it’s good he was activated for this game.

I wouldn't blame them if they were just testing it out to see if he's ready, but from the sounds of it they actually thought he was ready and he actually rehurt himself which is obviously awful",,N,,2025-12-14 15:00:46.877333

Quiet first quarter in Cincy

Neither the Baltimore Ravens nor the Cincinnati Bengals made noise in the first quarter of a critical AFC North showdown, scoring a collective ... *checks notes* ... zero points in the first quarter.

Both teams combined for 49 net offensive yards over 20 total plays as both teams struggled to find rhythm in a frigid matchup.

Ravens QB Lamar Jackson, who's struggled with health this season, had completed just two passes for six yards in the first quarter ... which puts him at -5 net passing yards when taking into account his two sacks for a combined 11-yard loss.

Will they pick on a weakness … again? The Chargers, in their 27-21 Week 1 victory over the Chiefs in Brazil, provided a roadmap for the rest of the league to follow when it came to attacking K.C.’s defense.

Specifically, quarterback Justin Herbert feasted when going to play action. According to NextGen Stats, Herbert finished 9 of 11 for 169 yards on those attempts, which began a trend that was often repeated afterward.

SumerSports’ data has the Chiefs defense as worst in the NFL when going against play action, allowing 0.49 expected points added on those attempts. For context, Cleveland’s defense is second worst but still much better at 0.33 EPA per play allowed, while on typical downs, K.C.’s defense allows only 0.02 EPA/play.

Herbert and the Chargers actually haven’t been super-productive with play action for the season, ranking 15th in efficiency. Given their success in Game 1, however, expect them to test the Chiefs often in this area again.

Jacksonville are 4-1 against teams with a losing record this season. Buoyed by four straight wins (during which they have outscored opponents 125-52), the NFL’s No 1 rushing defense is yet to allow a 100-yard rusher in 13 games.

Parker Washington returns from a hip injury to strengthen a constantly rotating receiving corps, which continues to come up with answers. It helps that Trevor Lawrence is playing with confidence and poise with Jakobi Meyers making a significant impact since joining on November 4. In five games, Meyers has caught 22 of 30 for 284 yards with three touchdowns - one in the past three games. And running back Travis Etienne needs 83 rushing yards for his third 1,000-yard season.

Against a rookie quarterback making his first NFL start, the Jags are 13.5-point favorites. The last time they were favored by such a margin was in 2007 against the Oakland Raiders (they won 49-11). All signs point to a Jaguars win. Dangerous territory, perhaps. But they have comprehensively handled business recently and played balanced, complementary football and looked like the AFC’s No 3 seed of late.

Bills WR Gabe Davis is a healthy scratch against the Patriots, the team confirmed to The Athletic ahead of kickoff. The move is a surprising one, given quarterback Josh Allen's trust level in Davis, and also because Davis has been at the top, or near the top of the leading snap count earners in their receiver room for three straight weeks.

Davis made a clutch catch on a fourth down play against the Bengals in Week 14. Without Davis, the Bills will go with the group of Khalil Shakir, Joshua Palmer, Keon Coleman, Tyrell Shavers and Brandin Cooks. Palmer returned today from a two-week absence due to an ankle injury.

Quietly, one of the Chiefs’ biggest issues defensively has been an inability to create turnovers.

In K.C.’s last five games combined, it has one takeaway: a first-quarter interception against Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott on Thanksgiving.

The Chiefs should have a great opportunity to reverse that trend Sunday. The Chargers have been careless with the ball quite a bit recently, with quarterback Justin Herbert throwing two interceptions with an additional lost fumble in Monday’s win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

Some of this comes down to luck, of course. It seems whenever the Chiefs defense tips a ball in the air, it deflects to an empty space on the field. Or when they create a fumble, the ball has bounded to a spot where the offense can recover.

This sort of thing continues the theme of the Chiefs season, where they just haven’t been good enough in the margins to turn close losses into wins. Sunday offers a new opportunity to make one or two game-changing defensive plays.

The Chiefs and Chargers are set to play on what is forecast to be Kansas City’s coldest day over the next month.

There are some important caveats, though. Snow is not in the forecast, and it’s not supposed to be windy, either. The sun should be out as well, meaning a kickoff temperature in the teens should actually feel warmer than the thermometer indicates.

It’s still unclear how a warm-weather team like the Chargers will respond to these conditions. The Chiefs are used to them — they practice in them each week, with some guys like tight end Travis Kelce taking part in those workouts in short sleeves and shorts.

K.C., in a must-win game, might’ve actually benefited more if the conditions were worse. It still wouldn’t be a surprise, though, if the Chiefs are the team better equipped to handle these weather conditions early.

FOXBORO, Mass. – Since Week 7, the Patriots have played with a light box on defense more than any other team in the NFL.

Essentially, they dare teams to try to run it on them, happy that the lighter boxes will help the Pats slow down opposing passing offenses. So far, it’s been a successful strategy.

But in recent games, the Patriots’ run defense has slowed a bit, and it poses a fascinating matchup Sunday since the Bills, with James Cook, have a really good running offense.

So I’m watching today how dedicated the Bills are to running the ball, whether the Pats will be content to play with light boxes, and how any Bills success on the ground early impacts the Patriots’ gameplan.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Chiefs will be without All-Pro cornerback Trent McDuffie for Sunday's home game against the Los Angeles Chargers, as he was listed as a gameday inactive after suffering a knee injury last week.

McDuffie, who was questionable coming into the game, leaves a void in the Chiefs secondary as the team's unquestioned top defensive back. Jaylen Watson should slide into the No. 1 slot today, and third-round rookie Nohl Williams should now see extended snaps for a second straight week.

One other note: Chiefs fourth-round receiver Jalen Royals, who hasn't played since Week 7, is a gameday active with Hollywood Brown (personal) out for Sunday's game.

Here's the Chiefs' full inactives list:

OT Jawaan Taylor

OG Trey Smith

WR Hollywood Brown

TE Jared Wiley

CB Trent McDuffie

DT Zacch Pickens

RB Elijah Mitchell

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ --- The Giants will be in a tough spot of their own making at returner Sunday with WR Gunner Olszewski inactive. Olszewski suffered a concussion in Week 13, but the team team went up to the last minute with the receivers' availability for Sunday.

But in the mean time, the Giants didn't elevate two other return options (Ihmir Smith-Marsette and Xavier Gipson) on their practice squad. So who will act as returner now? CB Deonte Banks and RB Devin Singletary are the kickoff returners while safety Jevon Holland acted as punt returner when Olszewski was injured in Week 13.

Other inactives include: OLB Kayvon Thibodeaux, WR Ryan Miller, P Jamie Gillan, T James Hudson III, DL Rakeem Nuñez-Roches Sr. and QB Russell Wilson (3rd QB).

Ravens starting wide receiver Rashod Bateman is inactive for Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals because of an ankle injury. Bateman, who was limited in Thursday’s practice and didn’t practice Friday, will miss his third game this season.

Wide receivers DeAndre Hopkins, Devontez Walker and Tylan Wallace will all likely have bigger roles with Bateman sidelined.

Outside linebacker Tavius Robinson, who hasn’t played since Week 6 because of a foot fracture, and defensive back Ar’Darius Washington, who has been out the whole season after tearing his Achilles in May, are active.

The Ravens five inactives are emergency No. 3 quarterback Cooper Rush, Bateman, offensive lineman Joseph Noteboom, defensive tackle Aeneas Peebles and cornerback Keyon Martin.

Bills inactives vs. Patriots: WR Gabe Davis, OT Tylan Grable, OT Chase Lundt, DT Phidarian Mathis, LB Terrel Bernard, CB Christian Benford, S Darnell Savage

The most significant member of the inactive list is top cornerback Christian Benford, who suffered a toe injury during Thursday's practice. The Bills were veering toward full health of their 53-man roster for the first time this season, but Benford's in-practice injury meant they'd be shorthanded at cornerback. In his place, the Bills will use the combination of Tre'Davious White and Maxwell Hairston as their starting boundary cornerbacks. The Bills will get wide receiver Joshua Palmer back into the lineup after he missed a pair of games with an ankle injury. Only having room for five receivers on the game day roster, the Bills made Gabe Davis inactive. It remains to be seen if Davis was a healthy scratch for the game, though Davis was not listed on the injury report during the week.

Davis was not seen on the field with the receivers during the usual pregame warmups. Starting middle linebacker Terrel Bernard is inactive once again and will miss a third straight game. Shaq Thompson will start in his place.

Los Angeles Chargers WR Quentin Johnston is inactive for Sunday’s game at the Kansas City Chiefs. Johnston practiced on Wednesday and Thursday this week, but he appeared on the injury report Friday with a groin injury. Johnston was listed as limited for Friday’s practice. The temperature at game time at Arrowhead Field is projected to be under 20 degrees. Those are not ideal conditions for a player trying to return from a soft-tissue injury in a limited timeframe. With Johnston out, rookie Tre’ Harris will have a huge opportunity Sunday.

Harris has carved out a role primarily as a blocker in coordinator Greg Roman’s offense. The Chargers have weaponized Harris in various rushing concepts, including as a lead blocker in power. But he has not made the same kind of impact as a receiver, with Johnston, Ladd McConkey and Keenan Allen ahead of him on the depth chart. Harris has 20 catches for 185 yards on the season. Harris will likely take over Johnston’s position as the Chargers’ X receiver. In that role, Harris could get some chances to make plays down the field, particularly in 50-50 ball situations, one of the strengths of his skillset.

CHICAGO -- Veteran guard Joel Bitonio and wide receiver Cedric Tillman are active today for the Browns despite having been listed as questionable on Friday's injury report.

The Browns had previously ruled out seven players due to injury: tight end David Njoku, cornerback Denzel Ward, guard Wyatt Teller, running back Dylan Sampson, offensive tackle Jack Conklin, defensive tackle Adin Huntington and guard Zak Zinter.

Longtime starting center Ethan Pocic was placed on injured-reserve last week after suffering a torn Achilles tendon. Luke Wypler takes over as the starting center with the hopes of being able to become the starter in 2026.

Wypler and right tackle KT Leveston are the only starting Browns offensive linemen today who are signed for 2026. Saturday, the Browns signed rookie guard Garrett Dellinger from the practice squad to the active roster so that Dellinger can serve as a potential backup option at both guard and center today.

It's the fourth start for rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who threw for 364 yards and three touchdowns last week. Sanders has developed a rapport with rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr., the Browns' leading receiver, and the two rookies have connected on touchdown passes in each of the last two weeks. But with the offensive line injuries and issues, expect the Bears to mix up their looks and blitzes to try to keep Sanders from getting comfortable.

No opposing quarterback is comfortable with Browns defensive end Myles Garrett looming. Last week, Garrett became the 13th player to reach 20 sacks in a season. Garrett enters today just 2.5 short of the NFL's single-season sack record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt.

With a clear emphasis on not letting Garrett blow up their game plan, the Titans ran for 184 yards on the Browns last week in Cleveland. Expect a run-heavy plan from the Bears today, too. The Bears totaled 281 rushing yards in a Week 13 upset in Philadelphia and will use both veteran starter D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai heavily.

With the Browns shorthanded at multiple spots, expect Sam Webb to start at cornerback in Ward's place and veteran defensive tackle Maurice Hurst to see time also. Hurst was signed to the practice squad last week and elevated on Saturday. As expected, rookie defensive tackle Mason Graham is active despite dealing with a rib injury.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/VnTrvdjsDfr8_hYdkIfhtspdY_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-14 12:59:50.506897

Spillane is officially active for Week 15, which is huge for New England's run defense, in particular, against the Bills potent rushing attack led by star RB James Cook. The Patriots game-day inactives are OLB Bradyn Swinson, OT Marcus Bryant, DT Eric Gregory, TE C.J. Dippre, WR Efton Chism III, and QB Tommy DeVito is the emergency third quarterback.​

Along with Spillane being active, the well-rested Patriots will also get NT Khyiris Tonga, LG Jared Wilson, and special teams ace Brenden Schooler back from injury this week. All three regulars are returning to the lineup after being inactive for New England's victory over the Giants in Week 13. Pats captain Harold Landry III, who has been managing a knee injury, also seemed to benefit from the bye week as he didn't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game. As one would hope, the bye week helped the Patriots roster get healthier.​

Starting on the defensive side of the ball, Spillane was first limited by his foot injury when he only played 69.1% of the defensive snaps in Week 13. In the previous eight games, Spillane played every defensive snap, so his lower snap count vs. the Giants was notable. The Pats captain is the team's starting MIKE linebacker and defensive signal-caller, playing a major role in the middle of the defense. This season, the Pats defense allows a stingy -0.03 expected points added per rush when Spillane is on the field compared to +0.05 EPA per rush without Spillane – a substantial difference. Buffalo comes into the week ranked seventh in rush EPA, while Cook is second in the NFL with 1,308 rushing yards. The Bills rushing attack is very underrated, with most of the attention on MVP quarterback Josh Allen. In Week 5, holding Cook to a 36% success rate was a big reason why the Patriots won.

With the Patriots captain active, Spillane's workload and effectiveness will be worth monitoring during the game. Tonga's return should also help the Pats stop the run, as the 335-pound nose tackle has helped New England hold opponents to -0.10 EPA per rush when Tonga is on the field – the Patriots need two of their best run defenders at their best. That said, if Spillane is limited by his foot injury, the Patriots could lean more on linebackers Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. Jahlani Tavai is also active as a sturdier early-down run stuffer, while LB Marte Mapu could have a role in the passing game on Sunday.

Moving over to the other side of the ball, the Patriots offensive line gets a boost by the return of rookie Jared Wilson. After playing only three snaps in a Week 12 win over the Bengals, Wilson sat out the Patriots last game against the Giants due to an ankle injury. The third-rounder is expected to return to being the starting left guard, while the Pats still have reliable backup G/C Ben Brown as insurance, as they start their fourth different line combination of the season. The expectation is that the Patriots starting offensive line will be LT Vederian Lowe, LG Jared Wilson, C Garrett Bradbury, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Morgan Moses.​

Offensively, the other uncertainty was at running back, with RB Terrell Jennings ruled out due to a concussion. On Saturday, the Patriots signed RB D'Ernest Johnson to the active roster to back up top backs Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. After being elevated three times earlier this season, Johnson was out of standard elevations, meaning he had to be signed to the 53-man roster to be active. New England made room for Johnson on Saturday by placing Jennings on injured reserve. Johnson has some experience on special teams, including returning kickoffs, making him an obvious choice to step in for Jennings.

QB Drake Maye's Supporting Cast

OL - LT Lowe, LG Wilson, C Bradbury, RG Onwenu, RT Moses

WR - Diggs, Boutte, Hollins, Douglas, Williams

TE - Henry, Hooper, Westover (FB), Tonga (short-yardage FB)

RB - Stevenson, Henderson, Johnson

The good news is that the majority of the Patriots skill players around QB Drake Maye this week are all active. New England will have all their regular contributors available to match Allen and the Bills offense. Above is a look at Maye's supporting cast for Sunday's game against Buffalo.

As for Buffalo, the Bills are getting starting DE Joey Bosa (hamstring/wrist) and RT Spencer Brown (shoulder) back from injury. However, Bills top CB Christian Benford (toe) and LB Terrel Bernard (elbow) is inactive. Benford was a mid-week addition to the injury report after suffering a toe injury during Thursday's practice. He's the Bills best corner, logging a pick-six to spark Buffalo's comeback win over the Bengals last week, and might've covered Patriots wideout Stefon Diggs in key situations. Benford being inactive is a huge blow to Buffalo's defense, which will rely more on vet Tre'Davious White and first-rounder Maxwell Hairston at cornerback.

With a win, the Patriots would dethrone the Bills after a five-year run as kings of the AFC East. Buffalo has won five-straight division titles, with New England's last AFC East crown coming in Patriots Hall of Famer Tom Brady's final season in New England (2019). To win the division in their first season under head coach Mike Vrabel would be a huge accomplishment, especially after having back-to-back four-win seasons before Vrabel arrived.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/ciefxkkkmcvxzltk2uhr,N,,2025-12-14 13:00:06.878891

Following Ward's return from injured reserve in Week 12, he acknowledged that he ""contemplated retirement"" following his second concussion.

However, that reportedly isn't the case this time.

""Despite speculation to the contrary,"" Schefter posted, ""Colts CB Charvarius Ward has no intention of retiring, despite being placed on injured reserve this past week due to a third concussion, per source. Ward wants to continue playing, and even wanted to avoid being placed on injured reserve this past week before the organization shut him down.""

This season with the Colts, Ward has allowed a completion rate of just 57% on 37 targets, while forcing seven pass breakups.

In the Week 14 win over Baltimore, Rodgers completed all three of his deep passes (20-plus air yards) for 121 yards to Metcalf.
Rodgers had a season-high 284 passing yards as Metcalf led the Steelers with 12 targets, seven receptions and 148 receiving yards in Week 14.
The Dolphins defense is riding high into Monday's game after recording a season-high six sacks in Week 14.","The Dolphins have won four straight games and, with just a 1% chance to make the playoffs, are looking to play spoiler toward the end of the season. Miami's win streak is the franchise's longest within a season since 2022. After a 1-6 start to the season, Mike McDaniel and the Dolphins have turned things around.

Heading into Monday's game, the Steelers are leaders of the AFC North, but it's a tight race with the Baltimore Ravens in the rearview mirror. Pittsburgh won a crucial division game over the Ravens in Week 14 after losing its previous two games. But the Steelers will be without one of the best pass rushers in the NFL for Week 15, with T.J. Watt recovering from surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung.

A key part of Miami's recent winning streak is running back De’Von Achane. The Dolphins RB has had 100-plus scrimmage yards in each of the last five games for Miami. Since Week 9, Achane leads the NFL with 147 scrimmage yards per game (4-1 record). In the Week 14 win over the Jets, Achane suffered a rib injury and did not return as the Dolphins leaned on Jaylen Wright with their RB1 sidelined. Wright did the most with his opportunity as he had a career-high 24 carries to go with 107 rush yards and one touchdown. Achane's status was in question earlier in the week, but the dual-threat RB is in line to play in Monday's game. Achane, who stands at 5-foot-9 and weighs 191 pounds, ranks first in the league with 5.8 yards per carry and 4.4 yards after contact, according to Next Gen Stats. If the Dolphins would like to pull off an upset and play spoiler, Miami will be leaning on Achane and Wright to extend its win streak to five games.

It appears that the Aaron Rodgers-DK Metcalf connection is peaking to unlock the deep pass game. In the Week 14 win over Baltimore, Rodgers completed all three of his deep passes (20-plus air yards) for 121 yards to Metcalf. The Steelers QB did not complete a deep pass in the entire month of November. Rodgers had a season-high 284 passing yards as Metcalf led the Steelers with 12 targets, seven receptions and 148 receiving yards in Week 14. It was Metcalf's first game with 145-plus receiving yards in a game since Week 4, 2022 when he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks. With the running game averaging the fourth-fewest yards in the league (89.2 rush yards per game), Rodgers building chemistry with his No. 1 WR at this time of the season is a positive trend that Pittsburgh would like to continue to develop heading into the final few games of the season and possibly the playoffs.

Since Week 9, the Dolphins defense has not allowed opponents to score more than 17 points. Despite trading pass rusher Jaelan Phillips at the trade deadline, Miami's defense, headlined with linebackers Jordyn Brooks and Bradley Chubb, has thrived. Brooks leads the NFL with 142 tackles, with Chubb leading the Dolphins with 6.5 sacks and 16 QB hits this season. The Dolphins defense is riding high into Monday's game after recording a season-high six sacks in Week 14. Meanwhile, the Steelers defense will be without T.J. Watt for the first time in the regular season since 2022. Watt leads the team with seven sacks and 18 QB hits, but the Steelers have 10 players with at least one interception this season, which is most in the league.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/veswjybib3vtkkb0krzm,N,,2025-12-14 15:00:54.629395

No one wants to see a player get hurt, but the Jets own the Colts' 2026 and 2027 first-round picks that they acquired in the Sauce Gardner trade.
Coupled with their own first-round pick (currently seventh), the Jets would have plenty of ammo to trade up for a player.
When the Jets and Colts made the Gardner deal at the Nov. 4 trade deadline, the Colts were 7-2, looking like a Super Bowl contender.
""I was fortunate enough to have a coach that believed in me the same way I believe in Wilks,"" Glenn said.","JACKSONVILLE -- A look at what's happening around the New York Jets:

1. One team's misfortune ... : Is the Achilles curse working in reverse?

The Jets, doomed by Achilles injuries in 2023 (Aaron Rodgers) and 1999 (Vinny Testaverde), could benefit greatly from last week's season-ending injury to Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones.

No one wants to see a player get hurt, but the Jets own the Colts' 2026 and 2027 first-round picks that they acquired in the Sauce Gardner trade. Currently, the 2026 pick is 18th overall. The Colts (8-5), already reeling before the Jones injury, have a brutal remaining schedule -- Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers, Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans.

Combined record: 36-16.

If the Colts lose out, the draft pick could go as high as 13th, give or take a spot. Coupled with their own first-round pick (currently seventh), the Jets would have plenty of ammo to trade up for a player. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, anyone?

That would be a stunning turn of events.

When the Jets and Colts made the Gardner deal at the Nov. 4 trade deadline, the Colts were 7-2, looking like a Super Bowl contender. Jets officials figured the draft pick would be toward the bottom of the first round. Now the Colts have lost three straight and face the prospect of starting quarterback Philip Rivers, 44, five years removed from retirement.

This is the same Rivers whom the Jets defeated in their next-to-last playoff run, in the 2009 season, when he played for the San Diego Chargers.

One final twist: A Jets loss Sunday to the Jaguars, who are one game ahead of the Colts in the AFC South, could hurt Indianapolis' playoff bid. The Jets have only a 24% chance to win, per ESPN Analytics.

2. Same as it ever was: This is the Jets' eighth trip to Jacksonville to play the Jaguars, dating back to 1996, and not once have they arrived with a winning record. Think about that for a moment.

3. Another one-and-done? One of the top storylines over the final four games will be the future of defensive coordinator Steve Wilks.

The defense is ranked 28th in EPA (Expected Points Added) and has only one takeaway in what has amounted to a transition year, an on-the-fly rebuild accelerated by the trades of Gardner and Quinnen Williams.

Ultimately, coach Aaron Glenn's decision will be based on whether he believes Wilks is the right man to lead the defense through the next phase of the rebuilding process. No doubt, there will be many new pieces to integrate in 2026.

Statistically, the defense has regressed over the course of the season. The EPA went from 26th over the first seven games (-23.66) to 29th over the last six (-47.12). The only starter exceeding expectations is defensive tackle Jowon Briggs, which doesn't reflect well on player development.

Wilks acknowledged the defense has been ""inconsistent at times, for sure,"" but he also believes there were a handful of encouraging performances.

Glenn was in Wilks' shoes in 2021 -- his Detroit Lions defense was among the league's worst -- but he had the support of coach Dan Campbell. He gave Glenn another chance as the coordinator, which proved mutually beneficial in the long run.

""I was fortunate enough to have a coach that believed in me the same way I believe in Wilks,"" Glenn said.

That might sound like a vote of confidence, but Glenn said he will evaluate his staff at the end of the season. Chances are, he will make some changes. Wilks understands the business; he was a one-and-done coach in his last five jobs.

4. Interception drought update: There have been 298 interceptions in the league, including five by Jaguars linebacker Devin Lloyd, but none by the Jets. They're one game shy of the all-time mark for most consecutive games without a pick (14 games by the 2024 49ers).

5. One tough Cook-ie: What are the Jets getting in rookie Brady Cook, who makes his NFL starting debut? At Missouri, he was known for his toughness.

Against Auburn last season, Cook injured an ankle on the opening drive, went to the hospital for an MRI and returned to lead two fourth-quarter touchdown drives in a 21-17 victory -- his signature game in college.

""He showed the type of leader he is, what he meant to our team,"" said tackle Armand Membou, a college teammate of Cook.

Cook becomes the first undrafted rookie in 50 years to start for the Jets.

6. Big (Apple) Turnover: The Jets have an inordinate number of pending free agents -- 22 of the 53 players on the current roster. They secured one potential free agent by signing center Josh Myers to a two-year, $11 million extension Friday. Four of their five starters on the offensive line are under contract for 2026. The Myers move likely means former center Joe Tippmann will remain at guard. Still unsigned for '26 are Breece Hall, Quincy Williams, Nick Folk and Alijah Vera-Tucker (injured reserve).

Yes, the revolving door will be spinning in the offseason.

7. Will they? The Jets must decide by May whether to exercise Will McDonald IV's fifth-year option for 2027, projected at $15 million. Once thought to be a no-brainer, this decision will require some careful thought.

McDonald probably will lead the team in sacks for the second straight year, but four of his seven came in one game. Consistency has been an issue, as most of his pass-rushing metrics are down from last season.

8. Lukewarm endorsement: One of the big moves last offseason was a three-year, $45 million extension for middle linebacker Jamien Sherwood, whom Glenn dubbed the quarterback of the defense. The returns haven't been stellar. Here's a brutally candid assessment by Wilks:

""I think, in my opinion, Sherwood is having a decent year. Up and down a little bit in regards to the tackling.""

9. What might have been: Facing Trevor Lawrence in a late-season game with no playoff implications will always conjure memories of the Jets' franchise-altering 23-20 victory on Dec. 20, 2020, over the Los Angeles Rams.

At 0-13, the Jets were on their way to the No. 1 pick in the 2021 draft -- Lawrence, the clear-cut top prospect. They went to Los Angeles a 17-point underdog, the second-largest spread in Jets history (second only to the 18-point spread in Super Bowl III).

Punter Braden Mann's touchdown-saving tackle on a fourth quarter return secured the win, allowing the Jaguars to leapfrog them in the draft order. A few days later, Mann told ESPN he received blowback on social media from angry Jets fans.

Lawrence has experienced his share of struggles over the years, but he has far outperformed the quarterback chosen No. 2 overall by the Jets -- Zach Wilson, who's on his third team.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1212%2Fr1588539_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 08:57:51.698472

Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell said Friday, Nov. 21, that LaPorta underwent back surgery and likely will miss the rest of the year, including Sunday's game against the L.A. Rams at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California..

“So look, Sam did have a procedure and he's going to be out for a while,” Campbell said during his press conference in Allen Park. “A while. I think we would be fortunate to have a chance to get him back for the rest of the season, at some point. I think that's very, very slim.”

LaPorta injured his back in the Lions’ Nov. 9 win over the Washington Commanders, was placed on injured reserve and missed a Nov. 16 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Brock Wright is recovering from a trachea injury and not expected back until the playoffs, and Shane Zylstra, out for weeks, was listed as questionable on Friday, and activated from IR on Saturday. He and Anthony Firkser – with two catches for 11 yards in three games – are the only tight ends on the Lions' 53-man roster entering Sunday's game.

That timeframe would have him cleared for training camp next summer, ESPN is reporting.

Kirk Cousins tore his Achilles tendon in Week 8 of the 2023 season with the Vikings and was back on the field for training camp after signing with the Atlanta Falcons, nine months after the injury. It's unclear if he could have returned sooner -- as Jones will have to -- if he has suffered the injury later in the season.

The 2026 NFL season will start on Sept. 13 with training camp beginning in late July; a nine-month recovery would have put Jones back on the field for the end of the preseason.

Jones is a free agent after this season and that timeframe would be beneficial for negotiations with teams looking for a quarterback after his promising season with the Colts. Cousins, 35 at the time of his injury but with a longer track record than Jones, received a four-year, $180 million deal with a $50 million signing bonus and $100 million guaranteed after his torn Achilles tendon.

The Colts will reportedly start 44-year-old Philip Rivers in Jones' place Sunday in Seattle, according to media reports. Rivers, who hasn't played for 5 years, was signed earlier this week. Riley Leonard is expected to serve as his backup with Brett Rypien also on the 53-man roster.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PIND/87657867007-2250558506.jpg?crop=3941,2218,x0,y205&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-14 05:58:13.626702

I knew his hands and ball skills were good and that he had route running ability.” ▪ Dolphins practice squad receiver A.J.","Except for safety Elijah Campbell, every player on the Dolphins’ 53-man roster will be available to play on Monday night at the Steelers, the team revealed after an evening practice in frigid Pittsburgh on Saturday night.

Among players on the 53-man roster, only Elijah Campbell has an injury designation; he is listed as doubtful with knee and ankle injuries.

Running back De’Von Achane, who missed the second half of the Jets game with injuries to multiple ribs, will play in Monday’s 8:15 p.m. game, which will air on ESPN and CBS-4 in South Florida.

Seven Dolphins players who were limited during Friday’s practice were able to practice fully on Saturday evening and are all set to play on Monday: Achane, center Aaron Brewer (ankle), cornerback Rasul Douglas (foot), safety Ifeatu Melifonwu (thumb/two groin muscles), outside linebacker Chop Robinson (oblique), tight end Darren Waller (rest), and long snapper Joe Cardona (hamstring).

Coach Mike McDaniel said center Andrew Meyer likely will not be activated before Monday’s game, though the team listed him as a questionable for the game. In order for Meyer to be eligible to play this season, the Dolphins must activate him by the Wednesday before the season finale at New England. He has been sidelined since the end of preseason with a triceps injury.

Meanwhile, Steelers star T.J. Watt is out after surgery on a partially collapsed lung.

Also out Monday: Steelers offensive lineman Adrus Peat (concussion) and cornerback James Pierre (calf).

Defensive tackle Derrick Harmon (knee) and tight end Darnell Washington (concussion) are questionable.

Night practice

Temperatures at kickoff are expected to be in the teens, but McDaniel said that wasn’t the driving force behind the decision to practice in Pittsburgh on Saturday evening.

“That’s something that we kind of considered in the offseason,” McDaniel said. “The odd part of a schedule is a Monday night on the road. It always feels like you’re so far removed from the last time you were on a football field. Doing it this way allows us our final full-speed practice about 48 hours from kickoff.”

He said acclimating to the weather is “an added bonus that we get to get ourselves into the environment. But realistically, that’s something we’ve been thinking about for a while to keep consistency 48 hours from kickoff having their last activity.”

League fines

The NFL fined Achane and Jaylen Wright for what it deemed a “violent gesture” in their celebration after Achane’s 13-yard touchdown run last Sunday against the Jets.

Achane was fined $8,238, while Wright was fined $6,388.

The Dolphins running backs become the latest among a handful of players who have been fined for a “nose wipe” gesture.

That gesture “has gang connotations; it’s disrespectful,” Troy Vincent, the NFL’s executive vice president of football operations, said in late March when the gesture was banned.

“It’s just where we are in society. Young men, they come from that era, from that age, and they’ve grown up on social media. If anybody Goggled ‘nose wipe,’ you’ll see the language that is used and where that’s affiliated. I think the players know better. I know they know better.”

Defensive line news

The Dolphins’ three rookie defense tackles - Kenneth Grant, Jordan Phillips and Zeek Biggers - have become competent NFL rotation players.

The question is whether more impact plays will follow. Grant has two tackles for loss all season and Phillips has just one. Do they need more of those to become very good defensive linemen?

No, defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver said.

“I don’t measure their success in tackles for loss,” Weaver said. “So much of what they do is unheralded and not on the stat sheet. A lot of the positive plays they have create positive plays for guys around them. A lot of people that benefit from selfless acts they do.”

Brooks and Dodson are so appreciative of the work of the defensive line that they’ve taken out the linemen for dinner on multiple occasions, Grant said.

They enjoy going to Capricco, an Italian restaurant in Pembroke Pines.

Grant says one goal is to generate more negative plays.

Weaver said the rookie defensive linemen are “absolutely” capable of that:

“That comes with football intelligence, gathering football information. You can actively see them calling out plays. Negative plays will come.”

Weaver said Phillips “has been pretty solid for the bulk of the year. Early on he was hanging on blocks too long when there was opportunity to make plays. He remedied that.

“Kenneth turned the page that Cleveland game. Once we got to that Cleveland week and that week of practice, I was like, ‘All right, I think the light switch might have gone off,’ and I don’t ever see that going backwards.”

Grant said he has improved in the area of watching film - and knowing what to look for - by watching Zach Sieler and Benito Jones and taking coaching from Austin Clark.

“I’ve become a better film studier,” he said. “In college, you watch film, but there’s a different way you watch film in the league. Watching how Zach watches film, I try to create that for myself.”

It has helped him learn “a team’s favorite runs and their tendencies.”

This and that

McDaniel on Saturday raved about tight end Greg Dulcich, a capable blocker who has become an asset in the passing game in recent weeks. He had three receptions for 41 yards against the Jets last week.

“Greg has been a very pleasant surprise just in general because you typically don’t have a guy assimilate as fast as he has and that’s a credit to him and ‘Embo’ [Jon Embree] and Frank Smith and Bobby Slowik,” McDaniel said.

“He is very good football player with the nuances of getting leverage on defenders, how to be able to separate from them with an understanding of the timing of the play. Then he is a tough guy to tackle. I knew his hands and ball skills were good and that he had route running ability.”

▪ Dolphins practice squad receiver A.J. Henning on Monday will serve the second game of a two-game suspension for violating the league’s policy on performance enhancing substances.

Robinson has missed the past seven games due to a foot injury and Washington is set to make his season debut after suffering an Achilles injury in May.

Robinson led the Ravens with two sacks before going down, and his return adds more bite to the defensive front in tandem with defensive end Dre'Mont Jones.

""Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today,"" J.J. wrote Dec. 12. ""He and his family are very appreciative of everyone’s kind words and well wishes.""

Pneumothorax, or a punctured lung, is a possible result of dry needling, though very rare.

Dry needling refers to a form of physical therapy with large needles designed to stimulate blood flow around muscular and soft tissue injures. Former Packers employee and NFL commentator Andrew Brandt said it's common for players to receive treatment at their own facilities.

""For insertion around chest, there is some risk of pneumothorax that needs to be fully explained before treatment,"" Brandt wrote.

T.J., who was not on the injury report prior to the development, won't play Dec. 15 on Monday Night Football when the Steelers face the Dolphins and presumably will be lost for multiple weeks. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network posted Dec. 12 that Watt was expected to play again this season.

ESPN reported that the NFL Players Association had been in touch with Watt over the incident. ""Our main immediate priority is supporting T.J.'s health and full recovery,"" the NFLPA said in a statement.

Watt, 31, who has been named a Pro Bowler each of the past seven years and received top-five standing in the defensive player of the year voting in five of those years, may not have the numbers that match his recent production but remains a difference maker. In 13 games this season, he has seven sacks, two fumble recoveries, three forced fumbles, seven passes defended and an interception, with 10 tackles for loss and 18 quarterback hits.

Watt played football at Pewaukee High School and became an All-American linebacker at the University of Wisconsin. He momentarily became the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history with a three-year, $123 million contract extension before the year.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/USAT/87718516007-usatsi-27764683.jpg?crop=5994,3372,x5,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-14 11:03:42.465559

Commanders star quarterback Jayden Daniels will return to the bench after re-aggravating a previous injury, while the Jets and the Raiders will roll out backup signal-callers.

Elsewhere, two star wide receivers face concerns stemming from concussions, with Cowboys wideout CeeDee Lamb poised to play and Bengals receiver Tee Higgins set to miss his second game in the past three weeks.

See who's in and who's out for Week 15:

QB Jayden Daniels (Commanders)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Elbow

Daniels will miss the Commanders' Week 15 game against the Giants. He returned from a four-game absence last week but re-aggravated his left elbow injury and will return to the bench. It's his seventh absence of an injury-riddled season. With Washington (3-10) not having much to play for, it'll opt for caution with its franchise quarterback. That said, veteran Marcus Mariota will make his seventh start of the season.

QB Tyrod Taylor (Jets)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Groin

Taylor will miss the Jets' Week 15 game against the Jaguars with a groin injury. In four games as a starter this season, he has led the Jets to a 1-3 record. With Taylor out, undrafted rookie Brady Cook will make his first NFL start.

QB Geno Smith (Raiders)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Shoulder/Back

Smith will miss his first game of the season when the Raiders face the Eagles in Week 15. In 13 starts this season, Smith has thrown for 2,648 yards, 16 touchdowns and a league-high 14 interceptions. Las Vegas (2-11) is currently tied for the worst record in the league. Backup Kenny Pickett will start in Smith's place.

WR Tee Higgins (Bengals)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-DNP

Injury: Concussion

Higgins will miss the Bengals' Week 15 game against the Ravens. He sustained a concussion in Week 14 after returning from that same injury the week prior. Surprisingly, Higgins returned to practice in a limited fashion on Wednesday and Thursday, leaving hope that he could return later this season. Sunday will mark Higgins' second absence of the season — both against Baltimore. In 12 games, he has 46 catches for 667 yards and nine touchdowns.

WR Rome Odunze (Bears)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Foot

Odunze will carry a questionable tag into the Bears' Week 15 game against the Browns. He has been dealing with a stress fracture in his foot for the past few weeks, and it kept him out of a game for the first time this season last week. After a week of rest, however, he could return to the field to help Chicago in its fight for the NFC North after losing the division lead to the Packers last week. After a hot start to the season, Odunze has struggled since getting injured, hauling in just 13 catches for 188 yards and one touchdown over the past five weeks.

TE David Njoku (Browns)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Knee

Njoku will miss the Browns' Week 15 game against the Bears. He sustained a knee injury catching a touchdown — his only catch of the game — from quarterback Shedeur Sanders in Week 14. Njoku has 33 catches for 293 yards and four touchdowns under his belt so far this season. With Njoku out of the lineup, rookie Harold Fannin Jr. will have the tight end snaps all to himself and will look to continue to build on an impressive season.

RB Josh Jacobs (Packers)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-Limited

Injury: Knee

Jacobs will carry a questionable tag into the Packers' Week 16 game against the Broncos. He has played through lower body injuries throughout this season and might try to do the same against this week. Despite the minor injuries stacking up, Jacobs has totaled 817 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns in 12 games this season.

RB Christian McCaffrey (49ers)

Practice schedule: DNP-Limited-Full

Injury: Illness/Back

McCaffrey will carry a questionable tag into the 49ers' Week 15 game against the Titans. He missed Wednesday's practice with an illness before returning Thursday. He was upgraded to a full participant on Friday. However, on Saturday, he was added to the injury report with a back issue, so his status for the game is once again up in the air.

WR CeeDee Lamb (Cowboys)

Practice schedule: Limited-Full-Full

Injury: Concussion

Lamb will be active for the Cowboys' Week 15 game against the Vikings on Sunday night. He sustained a concussion that forced him out of the team's bout with the Lions in Week 14, but 10 days off helped him not miss time. It's crucial that the Cowboys have their top pass-catcher this weekend, as they're fighting for a playoff spot. In 10 games this season, Lamb has 57 catches for 865 receiving yards and three touchdowns.

McCaffrey should be good to go for the San Francisco 49ers' game against the Tennessee Titans despite being deemed questionable on Saturday afternoon due to a back injury, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported, per a source.

CMC sat out Wednesday's practice while dealing with an illness and was limited Thursday, through he initially went into the weekend without a designation following a full session Friday.

Given San Francisco's extensive injury history this season, a back issue popping up for McCaffrey likely raised some alarm bells among fans.

While key offense players such as Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall have all been absent at different points of the year, McCaffrey has remained as a constant, keeping the Niners moving toward a potential playoff berth despite all the missing pieces.

He's logged a league-leading 322 touches for San Francisco, turning workhorse usage into 849 rushing yards, 806 receiving yards and 13 total touchdowns. He's both the team's leading rusher and receiver by a wide margin.

Thankfully, he's expected to remain in the fold Sunday.

If McCaffrey's back gives him any trouble during the game -- or even if all systems are a go -- the 49ers could still presumably play it smart with their star running back. He entered Week 15 as the only player in the NFL with 300 or more touches, currently averaging 24.8 per game.

The Niners are in the stretch run now, in playoff position with an outside shot (10%) at winning the NFC West. While it'd be unwise to take the 2-11 Tennessee Titans lightly, it's also important McCaffrey remains upright for upcoming games against the Colts, Bears and Seahawks, plus a hopeful postseason run.

The Dallas Cowboys receiver was injured during last week's loss to the Detroit Lions when he went up for a deep pass in the end zone and was contorting his body trying to make a one-handed catch. He couldn't make the catch and then landed hard and his head slammed on the ground.

Lamb returned to practice as a full participant on Thursday as his recovery has gone well enough for him to return for Sunday Night Football.

""Process has been cool. Obviously, it's been a lot of eye work and eye discipline and trying to, I guess, frustrate myself essentially to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion. And I haven't had any type of symptoms,"" Lamb said. ""As for me now, it's been heavy on rest, to be honest. Doing everything, me knowing my requirements, kind of getting ahead of everything, especially with the extra 2-3 days that we had off. I feel like that was big.""

The San Francisco 49ers added Christian McCaffrey to the injury report on Saturday with a back injury. The running back did not practice Wednesday and was limited Thursday due to an illness before being a full participant on Friday.

There's no word on the severity of McCaffrey's back issue ahead of Sunday's meeting with the Tennessee Titans. Despite the injury report addition, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports that the 49ers star is expected to be ""good to go.""

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt had successful surgery to ""stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung,"" according to his brother J.J.

Watt was in a dry needling treatment session at the team's practice facility on Wednesday when he started to feel discomfort. There is no timeline for a recovery, but was released from the hospital on Friday and will not play Monday night against the Miami Dolphins.

Other notable Week 15 injuries:

Cincinnati Bengals receiver Tee Higgins has been ruled out for Sunday's matchup with the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion. Higgins missed Week 13 with a concussion and found himself back in protocol this week after getting injured last week against the Buffalo Bills. Higgins was evaluated in-game and cleared to return, but Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said Monday that the receiver was back in protocol. He was limited during Thursday's practice and ultimately ruled out Friday afternoon.

The Washington Commanders have already ruled quarterback Jayden Daniels out for Week 15 due to aggravating an elbow injury in Week 14's loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Daniels had just returned from a three-game absence after dislocating that elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. Marcus Mariota will start his seventh game this season when the Commanders face the New York Giants on Sunday.

Trey Benson will not return this season after the Arizona Cardinals chose not to activate him from injured reserve during his 21-day practice window. The running back has been out since Week 4 with a knee injury. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Benson had not progressed enough to warrant a return this season.

Injuries to his right shoulder and back will sideline Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Kenny Pickett has been taking first-team reps this week and will start as head coach Pete Carroll called Smith ""day-to-day.""

Ravens at Bengals (1 p.m.

Cardinals at Texans (1 p.m.
Dolphins at Steelers (8:15 p.m.","We've reached Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season, and while some teams aim to make late-season pushes into the postseason, others are keeping one eye on the upcoming NFL Draft and the other on their roster to see which players should and shouldn't return. Making things more complicated at this stage of the year is injuries, and there are quite a few notable ones for bettors to know for Week 15. Here's a breakdown of the most important injuries of Week 15, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. All times Eastern.

Ravens at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)

CIN WR Tee Higgins (concussion, out)

Star Cincinnati receiver Tee Higgins is out this week with his second concussion of 2025, both of which have occurred over the last month. The Ravens need a win to try and keep pace with Pittsburgh for the division lead after dropping two games in a row to fall to 6-7.

The Ravens are 2.5-point favorites, while the total is very high at 51.5.

Raiders at Eagles (1 p.m. ET)

LV QB Geno Smith (right shoulder and back, out)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)

Kenny Pickett will be under center for the Raiders against his old team,as the former first-round pick will start in place of the injured Geno Smith, who's dealing with shoulder and back injuries. The Eagles will again be without star tackle Lane Johnson, which is bad news against Maxx Crosby.

Vegas is a 12.5-point underdog here, with the total at just 38.5.

Cardinals at Texans (1 p.m. ET)

AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, out)

HOU RB Nick Chubb (ribs, questionable)

Marvin Harrison Jr. headlines another lengthy injury list for the Cardinals, who have lost five in a row and are just 3-10 on the year. The Texans are on the opposite end of the spectrum, having won five in a row, but they may be without veteran running back Nick Chubb as he's questionable to play against a lackluster Arizona defense.

Houston is a 9.5-point favorite, and the total sits at 42.5.

Chargers at Chiefs (1 p.m. ET)

LAC WR Quentin Johnston (groin, questionable)

KC WR Hollywood Brown (personal, out)

KC OL Trey Smith and Jawaan Taylor (out)

The Chargers aren't the only AFC West team with issues on the offensive line, as two Kansas City starters are out for this matchup on Sunday. The Chiefs will also be without veteran receiver Hollywood Brown in this must-win matchup, while the Chargers have listed receiver Quentin Johnston as questionable.

Kansas City is a 6-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.

Bills at Patriots (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Arguably the game of the week sees the Bills visit the Patriots in an AFC East clash. New England has won 10 in a row after a 1-2 start and is aiming to spoil the Bills' bid to win the division for the sixth year in a row.

Buffalo is favored by 1.5, and the total is 49.5.

Jets at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)

NYJ QB Tyrod Taylor (groin, out)

NYJ QB Justin Fields (knee, out)

NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

A weird season for the Jets will be made even weirder this weekend with undrafted rookie Brady Cook starting at quarterback with both Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields out. Cook completed 14 of his 30 attempts last week in relief of an injured Taylor, and he won't have reliable tight end Mason Taylor to throw to in this matchup with the AFC South-leading Jaguars.

Jacksonville is favored by 13.5. The total is 41.5.

Commanders at Giants (1 p.m. ET)

WASH QB Jayden Daniels (left elbow, out)

WASH WR Deebo Samuel (illness, questionable)

WASH RB Chris Rodriguez (groin, questionable)

The Commanders' offense is beat up with Jayden Daniels ruled out after returning last week only to get knocked out once again. Marcus Mariota will start, and it's unclear if he'll have Deebo Samuel to throw to as the veteran receiver is questionable with an illness. Washington mixes up its running back rotation quite a bit, and Chris Rodriguez is also questionable.

The Giants are 2.5-point favorites, and the total is 46.5.

Browns at Bears (1 p.m. ET)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (calf and hand, out)

CLE CB Denzel Ward (calf, out)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)

Cleveland will be down two weapons on offense with veteran tight end David Njoku and rookie running back Dylan Sampson both ruled out. Top cornerback Denzel Ward is also out for the Browns' elite defense. For Chicago, the Bears are hoping to get receiver Rome Odunze back for this matchup after he missed last week's loss to Green Bay.

Chicago is favored by 7.5, and the total is 38.5.

Panthers at Saints (4:25 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

The main injury here is that the Saints will be without top running back Alvin Kamara once again. The veteran is out with knee and ankle injuries in this divisional clash with the Panthers, who can take first place in the NFC South with a win thanks to Tampa Bay's loss on Thursday.

Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.

Lions at Rams (4:25 p.m. ET)

DET S Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph (out)

LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, questionable)

This massive NFC clash sees the Lions again dealing with major injuries on defense, and that's especially true in the secondary as both of the team's starting safeties are out. The Rams expect Davante Adams to play, but he is questionable with a nagging hamstring injury.

The Rams are 6-point favorites while the total is the highest of the Week 15 slate at 54.5.

Colts at Seahawks (4:25 p.m. ET)

IND QB Riley Leonard (knee, will be active)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, out)

The big story here is who will start at quarterback for the Colts. Daniel Jones tore his Achilles last week and is out for the year, so Indianapolis signed Philip Rivers, who last played in 2020, to the practice squad. Rookie Riley Leonard played in place of Jones last week and also suffered an injury, but he'll be active in Seattle. Whether he starts is another question altogether. Defensively, the Colts will be down star cornerback Sauce Gardner against the Seahawks' high-flying offense.

The Seahawks are 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.

Packers at Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)

GB RB Josh Jacobs (knee, questionable)

The Packers and Broncos square off in what very well could be a Super Bowl preview on Sunday, and Green Bay is hoping to have its top running back on the field as Josh Jacobs is questionable. If he can't go, Emanuel Wilson would serve as lead back as third-string back MarShawn Lloyd has been ruled out.

Denver is a 2.5-point favorite at home. The total is 42.5.

Titans at 49ers (4:25 p.m. ET)

SF RB Christian McCaffrey (back, questionable)

Star 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey was added to the injury report on Saturday with a back injury ahead of Sunday's matchup with Tennessee. This would leave Brian Robinson as San Francisco's lead back should McCaffrey be inactive.

San Francisco is favored by 12.5 while the total sits at 44.5.

Vikings at Cowboys (8:20 p.m. ET)

DAL TE Jake Ferguson (calf, questionable)

It looks like Dallas' offense will be at full strength, which wasn't a certainty entering the week. Star receiver CeeDee Lamb cleared concussion protocol and will suit up this week, while tight end Jake Ferguson is expecting to play on Sunday despite being listed as questionable.

Dallas is favored by 5.5 points. The total is 48.5.

Dolphins at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

Star Pittsburgh edge rusher T.J. Watt won't suit up this week after he suffered a collapsed lung that required surgery after a dry needling treatment. It's unclear if or when Watt will return this season for the AFC North-leading Steelers.

The Steelers are 3-point favorites at home. The total is 42.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/22/9ba602fb-8eab-4ec3-be43-adfc80417a80/thumbnail/1200x675/f9c3e1e60c2462860b5a7e4bbbd35eae/jayden-daniels.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 23:58:09.646992

Strong is now available to coach Matt LaFleur for Sunday's showdown with the Denver Broncos.

Wilson is listed as questionable to play. So is starting running back Josh Jacobs, who only practiced once this week because of recurring swelling and stiffness in his injured knee. The only healthy running back on the 53-man roster for the Packers is Chris Brooks, making Strong a necessary elevation for Sunday against the Denver Broncos.

Wilson, if available, would be looking at an increased role at running back and a potential start in place of Jacobs. But with his status now in question, the Packers may need to scramble at the position before facing the NFL's No. 1 ranked defense against the run.

Brooks is a capable blocker and receiver who has played in all 13 games for the Packers this season. Strong, a fourth-round pick in the 2022 NFL draft, has played in 46 career games. His 125 career touches have gained 692 yards, and he's also returned 24 career kickoffs.

The belief still is that Jones will play next year in Indianapolis, but his contract expires after this season and he is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

A training camp return would be an aggressive timeline for Jones, but the Colts think it's possible -- and this thinking is going to inform their offseason approach to free agency, a team source told ESPN's Stephen Holder. Indianapolis is expected to have a better idea of Jones' progress by April.

Jones and the Colts did not have any discussions about an extension while the quarterback was having a resurgent season and leading Indianapolis to the top of the AFC South. Last Sunday, Jones fell to the ground, slammed his helmet in frustration and knew that he had torn his Achilles -- before the MRI even confirmed it.

Both Jones and the Colts, who were highly pleased with each other, have significant decisions to make. Jones is expected to be interested in returning to Indianapolis, but he also could have other options. The Colts are expected to try to re-sign Jones, but the question will be the cost.

The Colts could opt to use the franchise tag on Jones, which is expected to come in around $45 million to $46 million this offseason, according to league sources.

But for now, Jones' focus will be on recovering from the Achilles surgery and getting ready for the 2026 season.

Jones has demonstrated the ability to be a quick healer in the past. While playing quarterback for the New York Giants in 2023, Jones tore his ACL but returned for the start of the 2024 season.

The Colts (8-5) have lost four of their past five games after their strong start, falling out of the AFC South lead and into the No. 8 overall seed for the seven-team playoff field.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1207%2Fr1586311_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 23:58:12.340790

Jones underwent surgery Tuesday after rupturing his Achilles tendon in Sunday's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars and was ruled out for the season. Jones was also dealing with a fractured fibula and a calf injury before he suffered the Achilles injury.

Before going down, Jones was having a career season in his first year with the Colts. He threw for 3,101 yards, 19 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. Jones was just 104 yards short of his career-high for passing yards and six touchdowns away from his personal best in passing touchdowns.

Despite the change in scenario, injuries have continued to plague the 28-year-old quarterback. Jones has not missed an entire season in his career. He played in 16 games in 2022, resting only during the final week to prepare for the playoffs.

Jones spent his first six seasons with the New York Giants before being released and signing with the Minnesota Vikings midway through last season. This offseason, he signed a one-year, $14 million contract and ultimately won the starting job over Anthony Richardson. Jones will be a free agent after this season.

Rookie quarterback Riley Leonard finished the game for the Colts, throwing for 145 yards and one interception. Leonard, who dealt with a knee injury earlier this week in practice, was cleared to play on Sunday.

Cook was Mizzou’s starting quarterback from 2022-24.","Former Missouri football quarterback Brady Cook is set to make his first professional start.

New York Jets starting quarterback Justin Fields has been ruled out of the team’s game Sunday, Dec. 14, against the Jacksonville Jaguars with a knee injury, and backup Tyrod Taylor will miss the matchup with a groin injury.

That means Cook, who played for the Jets in relief after Taylor was injured in a 34-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins this past Saturday, has been elevated to the starting role. His backup will be former Kansas State QB Adrian Martinez.

""Brady will be our starting quarterback this week,"" Jets head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters this week. ""He's gotten all the reps with the ones, and Adrian (Martinez) will be our backup.""

Cook went 14-of-30 passing for 163 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions against the Dolphins. He entered the game with the Jets already trailing 21-0.

The Jets will play Jacksonville at noon CT on Sunday in Jacksonville, where Mizzou, coincidentally, will play its bowl game later this month.

“It was just a tough situation for him, not getting a chance to get all the reps,"" Glenn said. ""But now, this week, he's had a chance to get all the reps with (the) ones, get a chance to communicate with the O-line, with the receivers, with the tight ends, with the coaching staff on exactly how we want to go about playing this game.”

Added Glenn: “I have all the confidence in the world. That's something I've stated from the very beginning. (Cook will) be a good player in this league, and he'll have his opportunity again this week.""

The Jets signed Cook as an undrafted free agent shortly after the 2024 NFL Draft.

Cook was Mizzou’s starting quarterback from 2022-24. The St. Louis native and Chaminade grad won 26 games as Mizzou’s starter over those three seasons, helping Missouri record back-to-back double-digit win years in 2023 and 2024.

The quarterback will play alongside former MU teammate and right tackle Armand Membou, who was drafted with the No. 7 overall pick by the Jets and has started every game this season.

Cook registered more than 10,000-career all-purpose yards, which ranks fourth all-time at Missouri. With 9,013 career passing yards, he ranks third all-time in the category at Mizzou. He is the only MU quarterback in program history with more than 9,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards.

The quarterback’s best season with the Tigers came in 2023, when he threw for 255.2 yards per game and 21 touchdowns and five interceptions in 13 starts. He also rushed for 319 yards and eight scores.

Cook appeared in 46 total games for Mizzou with 39 starts. He passed for 49 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.

""I've been nervous before any football game I've ever played. I'm excited. It's important,"" Cook told reporters this week. ""This is everything I've ever done. So, there's a level of importance there that it's going to create nerves. But whenever I (run) out onto the field and take that first snap, it's gone.

After suffering a torn Achilles tendon in the playoffs last season, Tatum began an arduous rehab journey that was expected to hold him out for the entire year. However, he appears to be well ahead of schedule when it comes to his injury rehab, and reports indicate he wants to play this season.

Given how frequently fans have seen Tatum getting work in on the court as late, some folks believe it’s a matter of when, not if, he returns to action this year. However, according to one team insider, it sounds like the C’s still intend on proceeding with caution when it comes to their franchise player.

“Within the organization he continues to indicate that he would like to return this season,” Adam Himmelsbach of The Boston Globe reported. “It probably falls somewhere between possible and likely, but a league source stressed that the team remains several steps away from even considering the decision.

Tatum must still reach several mile markers in his recovery before discussions about a return can be considered.”

Considering how well Boston has played to begin the year, getting Tatum back could instantly make the team a legit title contender. The team isn’t losing sight of its long-term future, though, which could ultimately lead to him being held out for the entire year.

McCaffrey took his usual veteran rest day on Wednesday and did not participate. He was a limited participant on Thursday with an illness, but was bumped up to a full participant on Friday and was cleared with no injury designation on the injury report heading into Sunday’s game against the Tennessee Titans.

Well, on Saturday, the 49ers added McCaffrey to the injury report again with a back issue. He is now listed as questionable for tomorrow’s game.

In last week's loss to the Denver Broncos, Smith suffered a right shoulder injury, which will keep him out of Sunday's road matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles (1 p.m. ET / Fox).

Before Smith's injury, his production hadn't met his or the team's expectations when the 35-year-old signal-caller was traded from the Seattle Seahawks in the offseason. Through 13 games, Smith has thrown for 2,648 yards with 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. He also has a completion rate of 67% and a QBR of 32.5 -- ranked 30th in the league.

Here's everything you need to know about the Raiders' quarterback situation ahead of Week 15's contest.

Who's next up at quarterback for Las Vegas?

Backup Kenny Pickett is set to make his second start in two seasons, and he said it's a ""great opportunity"" to face the Eagles.

Pickett received valuable first-team reps throughout the week, with the expectation that he will take Smith's place. Aidan O'Connell, who has been the team's emergency third quarterback in recent weeks, will be the primary backup.

Raiders coach Pete Carroll called Pickett an athletic player and a good thinker. Carroll added that he has coached ""the hell out of him"" so that Pickett would be ready whenever an opportunity to play emerged.

""This is exactly how we did it with Geno for years [in Seattle],"" Carroll said. ""And however long it takes for the opportunity, he's going to be ready to go.""

In extended playing time against the Broncos, Pickett impressed the coaching staff. He completed 8 of 11 passes for 97 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter of the Raiders' 24-17 loss.

Pickett completed six straight passes, including a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Shedrick Jackson. Pickett was 4-of-4 with 83 yards on attempts for 10-plus air yards.

""He managed it in a very difficult situation,"" interim offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Greg Olson said. ""He had two two-minute situations and scored 10 points. So, it was good to see.""

Olson admired Pickett's mobility, which allowed him to extend plays. The Raiders hope to use this skill set to their advantage Sunday.

""Even in college, he did a lot of things there with his legs,"" Olson said. ""So, he gives us that part of his game, maybe, not that Geno isn't mobile, but the ability to escape and run and create and do some of those things.

""... We expect that going forward.""

Pickett was traded from the Cleveland Browns before the start of the season after O'Connell fractured his wrist in the Raiders' preseason finale against the Arizona Cardinals. At the time, the Raiders were searching for an experienced veteran to fill the backup position, and Pickett fit the mold.

Pickett has played for four teams since he was drafted in the first round by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2022.

After two seasons with the Steelers, Pickett was traded to the Eagles last offseason and played behind Jalen Hurts. The Browns traded a 2025 fifth-round pick and quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson for Pickett in March.

Pickett was competing to be the Browns' starter but didn't play in the preseason after injuring his hamstring in practice July 26.

In 33 career games (25 starts), Pickett has thrown for 4,870 yards, 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions while completing 62.4% of his pass attempts. He is 15-10 as a starter.

""He's been actively taking charge when he gets the opportunities in practice, and we put him in a lot of competitive situations to try to force him to the front,"" Carroll said. ""... He's as ready as a guy can be that hasn't done much playing.""

How long is Smith expected to be out?

Carroll said Smith is on the right track after receiving treatment throughout the week. Carroll added that there's a ""really good chance"" that Smith will be available for next week's matchup against the Houston Texans on the road.

Carroll stated Wednesday that health will be the only reason that Smith will remain sidelined, despite Smith's inconsistent on-field production.

Smith is also dealing with a lower back injury that has been concerning for the two-time Pro Bowl QB, Carroll said. Smith has been in and out of the training facility throughout the week to get tested. But Carroll sounded optimistic about Smith's right shoulder.

""He hasn't thrown this week very much, but it's manageable,"" Carroll said.

What this means for the Raiders' matchup against the Eagles

The Raiders hope Pickett could help snap their seven-game losing streak while extending Philadelphia's skid to four games.

Pickett will have tight end Michael Mayer and rookie wide receiver Dont'e Thornton Jr. back in the lineup after both players missed last week's game because of injuries.

The Eagles' offense has struggled in recent weeks (averaging 16.2 points in the past five games), which could open the door for Las Vegas to potentially steal a road win. At the same time, it will come down to how well the offensive line holds up against the Eagles' defensive front.

Las Vegas ranks 21st in pass block win rate (59.6%) and run block win rate (70.5%).

Due to the expected snowy and cold weather conditions in Philadelphia, the Raiders could rely heavily on rookie running back Ashton Jeanty, even though his production has been inconsistent for most of the season.

The Eagles are 26th in rushing yards allowed (132 per game) but have given up 450 yards in the past two games.

If the Raiders can be impactful in the run game, that should take a bit of pressure off Pickett.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1212%2Fr1588515_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 03:59:11.803607

McCaffrey logged a full practice on Friday after an illness hindered his availability to participate earlier in the week. Him not being on the initial injury report Friday brought a sigh of relief to San Francisco, but a new back injury might bring a bigger concern.

The 49ers offense has dealt with a number of injuries throughout the season, most notably to quarterback Brock Purdy and tight end George Kittle, but McCaffrey's reliable presence has steered the ship.

McCaffrey leads the team in both rushing (849) and receiving yards (806) while also generating the most touchdowns (13) for the Niners. Being without their workhorse RB might not be so crucial against a two-win Titans team on Sunday but there's cause for concern should the back injury linger down the final stretch.

Brian Robinson portends to get more snaps with McCaffrey ailing or especially if he is unable to suit up Sunday. Robinson has averaged 4.6 yards per carry in his role as the No. 2 backfield option.

That took place in the summer because Aiyuk missed team rehabilitation sessions for his injured right knee.
As recently as early December, general manager John Lynch expressed some hope Aiyuk might practice but acknowledged it was increasingly a long shot.
I think that's where I'd leave that ... We're a better football team when Brandon is out there, but that's probably what it is.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Although the San Francisco 49ers publicly expressed some hope that receiver Brandon Aiyuk would return this season, that optimism ran out Saturday when the team moved Aiyuk to the reserve/left team list.

That designation, which is generally used for players who intend either to retire or to temporarily step away from football, means Aiyuk is ineligible to play for the 49ers in 2025. Aiyuk, who has been recovering from a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee, has not been seen around the facility in recent weeks, and his placement on the list suggests he hasn't been around the team or participating in rehab sessions.

It also is likely the next step toward an offseason divorce between the Niners and Aiyuk. On Thursday, Niners tight end George Kittle hinted that Aiyuk wasn't likely to be back.

""At this point, it doesn't seem like he's coming back,"" Kittle said. ""I try my best to not even think about it because I love Brandon. He's one of my favorite teammates I've played with. We have a lot of moments together from his rookie year, every year we've played together. That's the Brandon I remember. So, if I think about the 'I wish he'd be here,' it kind of just makes me sad.""

The extent of the discord between the sides became public late last month when it was revealed that the Niners had voided roughly $27 million in guarantees Aiyuk had in his contract for 2026. That took place in the summer because Aiyuk missed team rehabilitation sessions for his injured right knee.

Before Saturday, Aiyuk had spent this season on the physically unable to perform list because of the knee injury, with the Niners hoping that somewhere along the way they could open his 21-day practice window and potentially get him back on the field.

Coach Kyle Shanahan said early in the season the hope was to get Aiyuk back practicing sometime around midseason.

As recently as early December, general manager John Lynch expressed some hope Aiyuk might practice but acknowledged it was increasingly a long shot.

""[Is it] realistic? I'm not sure,"" Lynch told KNBR radio on Dec. 2. ""Hopeful? Yeah. I think that's where I'd leave that ... We're a better football team when Brandon is out there, but that's probably what it is. Hope.""

After signing a four-year, $120 million contract extension with the Niners in August 2024 following contentious negotiations, Aiyuk injured his knee on Oct. 20, 2024. He had surgery the following month and has been working his way back since.

Now, the Niners and Aiyuk are likely to part ways this offseason with a decision still to be made on how that will happen.

Since the 49ers voided his future guarantees, they would take on a nearly $30 million dead money cap charge if they released him in the offseason. They could also designate him a post-June 1 release to eat $13.325 million in dead money next year and the rest in 2027. The same numbers would apply if the Niners were able to trade Aiyuk.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0903%2Fr1381630_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 22:00:13.843996

It’s been an odd week for McCaffrey. He had his usual “veteran” day off Wednesday, then missed most of Thursday’s session due to an illness. He practiced in full on Friday, with Kyle Shanahan saying McCaffrey would be a full-go for the game. Then on Saturday, McCaffrey reported having a minor issue with his back. The team usually holds a walk-through practice on Saturdays.

If his back were to worsen and he couldn’t play, Brian Robinson Jr. would get his first start of the season, backup Isaac Guerendo likely would see his first carries of 2025 and fourth-round draft pick Jordan James would be activated for the first time.

Their lack of usage speaks to McCaffrey’s health in 2025. He popped up on the injury report in Week 1 with a calf strain, but ended up starting that game and every one since. He leads the league in touches (322) and is third behind the Atlanta Falcons’ Bijan Robinson and the Indianapolis Colts’ Jonathan Taylor in scrimmage yards.

He’s also on pace to become the first player to have two seasons of 1,000-plus rushing and 1,000-plus receiving yards, having first accomplished the feat in 2019 when he was with the Carolina Panthers. At his current pace, he’d finish with 1,110 rushing yards and 1,054 receiving yards.

While the 49ers have been healthy at running back, the linebacker position has grown thin. The team will be without Fred Warner (ankle), Tatum Bethune (high ankle) and Eric Kendricks (calf) against the Titans. The 49ers elevated linebacker Jalen Graham and defensive tackle Sebastian Valdez from the practice squad.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/13172032/McCaffreyback-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-13 20:00:30.447880

Gordon will miss the remaining four regular-season games because of an injury he sustained in warm-ups prior to Chicago’s loss at Green Bay last week, his latest setback in an injury-riddled season. Signed to a three-year, $40 million extension in April, he has played in just three games.

Gordon missed the first four games because of a hamstring injury and five more because of a groin issue before returning for Chicago’s win at Philadelphia in Week 13. A second-round draft pick by the Bears in 2022, he has five career interceptions.

Chicago (9-4) elevated running back Brittain Brown and linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin from the practice squad for Sunday’s game against Cleveland (3-10).

WR Rashod Bateman, Baltimore | Ankle | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Rashod Bateman was added to Thursday's injury report with an ankle injury. While it's unclear whether this is the same ankle issue that caused him to miss Weeks 11 and 12, that appears likely given that he did not practice on Friday.

At this point, Bateman seems to be on the wrong side of questionable heading into the weekend.

WR Quentin Johnston, LA Chargers | Groin | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Quentin Johnston was a late addition to the injury report, a trend you never want to see. He did not practice on Friday due to a groin injury, and assuming this is a new issue, it's unlikely Johnston will play in Week 14.

Groin injuries can be particularly limiting for wide receivers, given the demands of cutting and acceleration. Until Johnston can log at least a limited practice, his availability remains in serious doubt.

WR Rome Odunze, Chicago | Foot | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

The Rome Odunze situation is difficult to assess. While it's unclear how long Odunze has been dealing with the stress fracture in his foot, after sitting out Week 14, it's fair to question how much true healing could have occurred in just one week. Odunze was limited all week, but there does appear to be some optimism that he will play.

Whether he should play is the next question, and whether fantasy managers should trust him is another. Foot injuries are difficult for any athlete, especially NFL wide receivers who rely on explosion and sharp cutting. Even if Odunze suits up, I recommend leaving him out of fantasy lineups this week.

Gordon was already ruled out for Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns after not practicing during the week. The 25-year-old nickel corner was going through warmups at Lambeau Field on Dec. 7 when he sustained a groin injury and was ruled out just before kickoff.

Gordon has been limited to three games this season while dealing with multiple soft tissue injuries. He missed a significant portion of training camp and the Bears' first four games with a hamstring injury. He was later placed on injured reserve for the first time this season after sustaining calf and groin injuries ahead of the Bears' Week 8 loss at Baltimore. Gordon returned in Week 13 and played 36 snaps in Chicago's win at Philadelphia.

""It's disappointing,"" coach Ben Johnson said. ""I wish I had a better feel for the individual, but with him being out as much as he has, I haven't really gotten to see him on the field and competing and get to know him like I'd like to at this point yet. I do know that the biggest predictor of a soft tissue injury is having a previous one, and he's kind of in this rut right now that we're not able to get out of, and so we're going to exhaust all of our resources in and outside of the building to make sure we're addressing it and doing what we can to get him back and healthy again.""

To make room, the Cardinals placed defensive lineman Bilal Nichols on IR with a knee injury, officially ending a second straight frustrating season for the veteran.

Jones, a 2024 fifth-round draft pick, has been plagued by preseason injuries in both his NFL seasons. As a rookie, he spent most of the season on IR with an ankle injury. This year, it was a knee injury that landed him on the sideline. With Johnson hurting his knee last week against the Rams, Kelvin Beachum is expected to start at right tackle and rookie Josh Fryar at left tackle.

The Cardinals, with multiple wide receiver injuries, will also elevate wide receivers Trent Sherfield Sr. and Jalen Brooks from the practice squad for a second straight game.

Nichols signed a three-year free-agent contract in 2024, and hadn't missed a game up until that point in four NFL seasons. But last season he played just six games because of a serious neck injury. That rehab lasted into this season. He finally came off IR but appeared in just four games, missing one for the birth of his child and becoming a healthy scratch in a couple of others. He hurt his knee against the Rams and was already deemed out for Sunday's game.

Even with the IR move, the Cardinals already have seven other players listed as out for Sunday, making for an easy inactives listing. The elevation of the two receivers means wide receiver Xavier Weaver (hamstring) is likely to miss another game.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cardinals/itzn3yx2xpnvtcpm7sqc,N,,2025-12-13 20:59:06.907373

As the Niners returned from their bye this week, McCaffrey said he was ""rested and recovered"" on Wednesday, taking his usual veteran's rest that day. He then was limited in practice on Thursday with an illness but was a full participant in Friday's practice, which is more of a walk-through.

""I know he wasn't feeling well, but he looked good today,"" coach Kyle Shanahan said on Friday.

That seems to indicate the back issue flared up either after Friday's practice or sometime Saturday. McCaffrey has not missed a game this season after he was limited to just four contests in 2024 because of Achilles and knee injuries.

If McCaffrey were unable to go, Brian Robinson would step into the starting running back role with Isaac Guerendo and rookie Jordan James available as potential backups. Guerendo has been limited to special teams only, taking zero offensive snaps, and James has yet to be active in a game this season.

""Brian to me, like his last seven games have probably been his best game seven times in a row,"" Shanahan said Friday when asked why James has yet to be active. ""I think he just keeps getting better. I've been real pumped with [James] in practice, and it would be awesome to get four guys up, but you're only using really two on offense. So, it's got to make sense with the rest of the roster.""

McCaffrey has, of course, been the focal point of San Francisco's offense and a big reason the team sits at 9-4 this season.

Now, 10 weeks later, they need to repeat that feat in order to lock up the division and crown themselves champion for the first time since 2019.

For a victory in the rematch with Buffalo, however, the team of head coach Mike Vrabel will need to bring its A-game. The Bills, after all, are far from dead and stayed the course even after losing to New England earlier in the year: at 9-4, they still have a chance to win their sixth straight division title, and a victory on Sunday would help boost their chances to snatch the top spot away from the Patriots after all.

As always when going up against an opponent of that quality, a complete game is need in all three phases. That said, our eyes will be on a handful of players in particular: considering the circumstances and opponent, here are our pivotal Patriots for Sunday’s game.

RB Rhamondre Stevenson

The Bills run defense has improved slightly over the course of the season, but it is still ranked toward the bottom of the league in efficiency categories such as yards per carry (5.1) and EPA per run (0.045). For New England and its lead running back, this presents an opportunity.

Rhamondre Stevenson has had an up-and-down year so far; he missed time with a toe injury and fumbled three times over the first five weeks of the season, but also has contributed some big plays as a runner and receiver while additionally showing some good pass protection. Considering Buffalo’s defensive weaknesses, one would expect him to be in line for a solid game. Then again, despite scoring two touchdowns, Stevenson was a relative non-factor in the first meeting between those two teams.

WR Stefon Diggs

In his first ever trip back to Orchard Park, Diggs was the most impactful skill position player on the field. Catching 10 passes for 146 yards in Week 5, he willed the Patriots to victory over his former team. To repeat as victors in front of the Gillette Stadium crowd, a similar performance would go a long way.

A veteran of 11 NFL seasons, Diggs knows that no two games are alike. That does not mean there are no lessons to be taken away from his first meeting with the Bills in October either

“That was a long time ago,” he said this week. “A lot of things have happened throughout this season that we kind of learned from. Even that game — we learned a lot from that game and we were like, ‘Damn, if we had this back, we would have done this differently. We would have done that differently.’ But all is well ends well when you win the game. You learn a lot throughout the season that’s going to help you towards the end.

“And the landscape looks different. It’s going to be a little more colder. It’s going to be some winter weather, whatever it is. I think the biggest thing for us is packing what our coach called identity and who we are, what we like to do and that’s finishing plays and that’s being aggressive and that’s being smart.”

LG Jared Wilson

The Patriots suffered some major losses during their win in Cincinnati in Week 12, including the entire left side of their offensive line. While tackle Will Campbell will be out another week on injured reserve due to the sprained MCL he sustained that day, guard Jared Wilson seems set to make a comeback against Buffalo.

Under normal circumstances, Wilson would slot into the left guard spot between Campbell’s replacement Vederian Lowe and center Garrett Bradbury. However, there is no telling just how quickly the third-round rookie will be up to speed again despite not carrying an injury designation into the matchup; even if he is cleared for starting action, there might be some rust to be shaken off after virtually not playing for three straight weekends both physically and in regards to his chemistry with Lowe in particular.

It helps that Buffalo will be without stalwart defensive tackle Ed Oliver. The remaining front seven — including starting tackles DaQuan Jones and Deone Walker as well as edges Joey Bosa and Greg Rousseau — will still present a challenge for the young lineman and the rest of the starting five.

DT Khyiris Tonga

Another player who recently missed some time, Tonga is set to make his own comeback after suffering an injury against Cincinnati. The Patriots will need him to be at his best, too, given Buffalo’s willingness to run the football as well as the scramble abilities provided by quarterback Josh Allen.

“He can do everything,” Tonga said about Allen this week. “Run the ball, throw the ball, throw 60 yards across his body — he can do it all. And we know that, so it’s going to be a fun challenge.”

With fellow defensive tackle Milton Williams on IR, Tonga projects as a starter alongside Christian Barmore (who himself was a limited participant in two of three practices this week). How much action he will actually see, however, has yet to be determined: Cory Durden, Eric Gregory and Joshua Farmer provide rotational depth behind the two top options, and likely will be moved in and out of the lineup as well. That said, at his peak, Tonga and Barmore is the best pairing New England has available against Allen and company.

LB Robert Spillane

The Bills offense presents an array of problems, and as a result no position might be under bigger pressure than linebacker. Tops among the LBs on the Patriots, of course, is team captain Robert Spillane.

Typically a 100-percenter on the defensive side of the ball — even though it remains to be seen whether his current foot injury will impact his availability — Spillane will be faced with a multitude of tasks. There is coming downhill to help stop James Cook and Buffalo’s potent run game; there is spying Josh Allen as a run threat; there is covering tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox; and there is communicating with the rest of the unit against a team using motion on 55.2% of snaps and play action on 16.5%.

K Andy Borregales

Whether or not you believe the Patriots’ underdog status is justified, Sunday’s game projects as a highly-contested affair that could be decided by a handful of points. If so, kicker Andy Borregales will again be in the spotlight.

The sixth-round draft pick has had a solid rookie campaign so far, hitting on 23 of 26 field goals and 36 of 38 extra points. The Patriots will need him to be accurate again on Sunday, especially after he went off he mark in both of his last two appearances at Gillette Stadium: against the Jets and Giants in Weeks 11 and 13, respectively, he missed one field goal each. Like this upcoming game, those two were played in cold conditions as well.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2247701407.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.56334483552052%2C100%2C78.526334262636&w=1200,N,,2025-12-13 20:59:11.128800

The Titans (2-11) visit the 49ers (9-4) at Levi's Stadium (3:25 p.m. CT, FOX). McCaffrey is the engine the 49ers' offense is based around, as he's not only the NFL's third-leading rusher by attempts, but he's also the league's fifth-leading receiver by catches.

He's touched the football 322 times in 13 games, which works out to three more touches per game than any other player. Only Atlanta's Bijan Robinson and Indianapolis' Jonathan Taylor have gained more yards from scrimmage this season than McCaffrey.

Injuries have plagued McCaffrey throughout his career; he's only played one full season without missing a game since 2020.

📰 Lineup News

CeeDee Lamb out of protocol, at practice

CeeDee Lamb navigated concussion protocol this week and should be fully operational for his team’s Sunday night home date with Minnesota.

Philip Rivers, a grandfather who’s spent the past five years coaching high school football, might actually be the starting quarterback for Indianapolis this weekend at Seattle. It’s an incredible story, if also a hopeless situation. Avoid any fringy Colts until further notice.

Tee Higgins has been ruled out for the Baltimore matchup Sunday after reentering concussion protocol. Mike Gesicki, Andrei Iosivas and Mitchell Tinsley could see upticks in usage, but think of them as DFS fliers, not reliable starters in traditional leagues.

Marvin Harrison isn’t ready to return from his heel injury just yet, so Michael Wilson gets the greenest possible green light, even in a challenging matchup with Houston.

Josh Jacobs reportedly experienced swelling in his knee this week. He was limited in practice yesterday following DNPs the prior two days, which is clearly a positive development.

De’Von Achane practiced Thursday and Friday (albeit in a non-contact jersey), so he should be good to go for Monday night’s trip to Pittsburgh.

Rome Odunze was limited in every practice session this week while dealing with a stress reaction in his foot and is officially questionable for tomorrow’s frigid game against Cleveland.

T.J. Watt won’t be available to face the Dolphins after suffering a partially collapsed lung during a dry needling treatment session. What a gruesome sentence that was. Downgrade Pittsburgh’s DST this week.

Lamar Jackson panic

We promise there was actually a time earlier this year when Lamar Jackson was one of the right answers in fantasy football. In fact, he was the season’s top per-game scorer among all quarterbacks just six weeks ago. Jackson had returned from a multi-week hamstring injury with a four-touchdown performance against Miami in which he completed nearly 80 percent of his throws. He looked like a potential league-winner.

Over Jackson’s past five games, however, he’s looked suspiciously like a guy determined to drag our fantasy teams into the consolation bracket. He added ankle and toe issues to the hamstring concern, and he only occasionally gets in full practice sessions. Jackson has thrown two touchdown passes and four picks since the start of November, averaging a modest 197.4 passing yards per game. He also hasn’t rushed for 50 yards in any week since the season opener. Not great.

Jackson has slowed down both figuratively and literally:

On the other hand, Jackson has been victimized by a remarkable series of near-TDs and negated scores over his past two games — drops, goal-line fumbles, phantom OPI penalties and replay overrules have taken points off the board for Baltimore. It’s been an outrageously unlucky ride.

Matchups don’t get much better than what’s on deck for Jackson this week in Cincinnati. So far this season, the Bengals defense has given up the third-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. Cincinnati ranks next-to-last in the league in passing yards allowed (254.9 YPG) and last in passing touchdowns (29). This is a defense that’s allowed multi-touchdown games to fantasy luminaries such as Trevor Lawrence, Carson Wentz and Caleb Williams.

Realistically, you can’t sit a quarterback with Jackson’s ceiling in a get-right spot like this. You are certainly allowed to worry, however. Over to Jake Ciely for more:

💬 Jake’s take

Heading into the Steelers matchup last week, I would have said my level of Lamar concern was extremely elevated. After? It’s moderately minimal. OK, I’ll avoid more annoying alliteration. I had Jackson as a low-end QB1 last week because we hadn’t seen a healthy (or even close) version capable of running with ease. He wasn’t 100 percent against Pittsburgh, but he was close to it. Jackson looked better than he had in some time.

The worry isn’t eliminated, however. While this should be a good week, the Patriots and Packers aren’t great matchups in Weeks 16-17 — particularly if Jackson is playing at 80-90 percent. He lost his top-three weekly set-it-and-forget-it status. If he tweaks this injury at any point, I’d consider benching him again. But let’s hope our Christmas present is a healthy Jackson and top-five playoff returns.

Last-minute moves

Jake Ciely has devoted his professional life to ranking a vast array of objects and people. At this point, if Jake hasn’t ranked something or someone, then it seems fair to question its cultural relevance. Let’s review a few names that landed in unusual spots in Jake’s Week 15 fantasy rankings:

Jared Goff is attached to the game with the highest projected total (54.5) in Week 15, so Jake is understandably not sweating the matchup with the Rams defense. Goff lands at QB9, three spots ahead of industry consensus.

Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal are nowhere near each other on Ciely’s board this week, landing at RB24 and RB41, respectively. Both backs were effective against Philadelphia last Monday, but Hampton is the one who broke the plane.

Stefon Diggs tortured his former team in the first meeting this season at Buffalo (10 for 146), and a repeat performance seems entirely possible. Jake got aggressive with Diggs, slotting him four spots ahead of consensus at WR19.

Matchups to embrace 🤗 and avoid 😨

Each week, KC Joyner delivers a thorough preview of the best and worst matchups on the upcoming slate. Below is a sampling of notable names for Week 15.

Start with confidence

QB Jaxson Dart, RB Tyrone Tracy and WR Darius Slayton (vs. WAS), QB Brock Purdy (vs. TEN), QB Shedeur Sanders (at CHI), RB Kenneth Walker (vs. IND), WR Chimere Dike (at SF), TE Mark Andrews (at CIN)

Exercise caution

QB Bo Nix, WR Troy Franklin and TE Evan Engram (vs. GB), QB Caleb Williams (vs. CLE), RB Breece Hall (at JAX), WR Michael Pittman (at SEA), TE Jake Ferguson (vs. MIN)

On the cut line 🔪

Fantasy analysts are more than happy to give you long lists of must-add fantasy options, but we aren’t quite as forthcoming with drop recommendations. Let the record show that you have our official permission to discard any of the following players:

Jayden Daniels seemed like a great idea this time last week, but, um … no. Washington chose to start him against the Vikings even though his left elbow was apparently not sufficiently recovered to tolerate standard-issue contact with the turf. Daniels won’t play this week, and it’s difficult to imagine why the team would put him at risk again this season. He cannot be started in fantasy until 2026.

DJ Moore appeared to have a massive opportunity last week at Green Bay, with Odunze sidelined by injury. Alas, Moore saw only three targets in the loss, two of which resulted in him being absolutely obliterated. He finished with -4 receiving yards, which is not ideal. He’s well outside the circle of fantasy trust at the moment, unplayable and thus droppable.

Isiah Pacheco is finishing the 2025 season just as he did last year, running as the clear No. 2 in Kansas City’s backfield behind Kareem Hunt. Pacheco isn’t a volume receiver, and he doesn’t see the goal line carries, so he has no obvious path to fantasy value at the moment. He remains rostered in 50 percent of Sleeper leagues (60 percent at ESPN), but he’s done nothing recently to earn his spot on your squad.

Sleeper of the week 💤

Isaiah Likely has drawn a dozen targets and delivered 120 receiving yards over Baltimore’s past two games, and he’s now headed into a matchup with Cincinnati’s defense, a unit that’s been historically generous to opposing tight ends. The Bengals have allowed 15 touchdowns to the position, an almost incomprehensible total. Not surprisingly, Cincy has also given up the most receptions (97) and receiving yards (1,258) to tight ends. If you’ve been streaming the position, Likely is your clear priority this week.

💬 From the Discord

At any given moment, there’s a good chance one of The Athletic’s writers is conducting an AMA in our fantasy football Discord server. No reasonable question is ever refused. Here’s a loaded question from Thursday’s chat:

Agwoq: With [Tee] Higgins most likely out, it is desperation time. 0.5 PPR, 1 Flex spot — Addison, Flournoy, Pearsall, Monangai, Vidal, Charbonnet or an absolute insanity move with Likely? All seem relatively similar. Leaning towards Addison, but none fill me with any confidence.

First of all, Likely would be a perfectly sane move in a week in which he faces the greatest possible matchup in the history of his position. (See above.) Zach Charbonnet, however, is the play for me. Seattle is a 13.5-point favorite at home against the Daniel Jones-less Colts, a reeling team making wild late-season personnel decisions. Charbonnet has made eight house calls on the season, and he’s averaging a respectable 11.9 touches per game. He offers both floor and ceiling.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/12173817/USATSI_27741650-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-13 19:00:53.954576

They are now placing running back Terrell Jennings on injured reserve, according to NFL insider Ian Rapoport.

Jennings entered concussion protocol after the Patriots’ Week 13 win over the New York Giants. However, even with the Week 14 bye, he was unable to get cleared to play. The Patriots initially ruled him out on Friday.

Rapoport noted that Jennings should be back for the playoffs after missing four games. Jennings has just 23 carries this season for 73 yards. He has scored a touchdown as well. In the passing game, he has one catch for nine yards.

Jennings is in his second year, but has been stuck behind TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson on the depth chart. He saw more work when Stevenson was hurt, but has since gone back to being the third running back.

He has played 51 special teams snaps, so perhaps that’s where the Patriots will be losing the biggest impact. According to Rapoport, the Patriots plan to sign D’Ernest Johnson to the active roster this week.

Johnson has 996 rushing yards in his career. He has played for four teams in seven years and has played in three games for the Patriots this season. He has just seven yards, but he provides an experienced replacement for Jennings.

Lawrence was a Friday addition to the injury report.

The Giants will need to make a series of roster moves Saturday if all or some of Green, Muasau, Ezeudu and Collins are going to be activated off injured reserve.

“There are a few scenarios that we’ve been talking through over the last couple of days,” interim head coach Mike Kafka said.

Thibodeaux was optimistic before the bye that he would return for the final four games. Make that three games (at best) now.

“There’s still a ton of optimism,” Kafka said. “I think he’s fired up and preparing himself to get out there with the players. It’s just about when he feels comfortable and when the doctors feel really good to clear him.”

The Giants claimed WR Ryan Miller off waivers from the Buccaneers. He played 123 offensive snaps and 205 special-teams snaps.

Look, Hallett’s been taking reps, (Thomas) DT’s been taking reps, Maddox has been taking reps. We’ve got plenty of guys.","On Saturday, ahead of traveling to the West Coast for a Week 15 matchup with the Los Angeles Rams, the Detroit Lions announced that they have downgraded two players to OUT: safety Thomas Harper (concussion) and Christian Mahogany (fibula).

With Brian Branch likely headed to injured reserve later on Saturday (transactions are typically announced at 4 pm ET), and Kerby Joseph already ruled out, the Lions were hopeful that Harper would be available to start alongside Anthony Maddox against the Rams. Unfortunately, it appears Harper was unable to clear the NFL’s concussion protocols, despite practicing all three days this past week. Returning to practice is a key component in progressing through the NFL’s protocols. However, players in the protocol still need to be medically cleared, and it can be assumed that Harper did not pass the independent medical testing.

With the Lions’ top three safeties unavailable, there is no clear frontrunner to start alongside Maddox on Sunday. Veteran Daniel Thomas looks like he could be the next man up, but he is primarily a special teamer and may not be the preferred option. The Lions also claimed Jalen Mills off waivers this week, but with only a few days of practice, he seems unlikely to be ready to step into a starting role.

The most likely candidate to challenge Thomas for the starting role is Erick Hallett. While currently on the practice squad, Hallett could be a candidate for roster elevation, as he has already started one game for the Lions this season (against the Buccaneers in Week 7). He was also the first name Lions coach Dan Campbell mentioned when discussing the options at safety this week.

“We’ll be good. Look, Hallett’s been taking reps, (Thomas) DT’s been taking reps, Maddox has been taking reps. We’ve got plenty of guys. They’re getting valuable reps, so we’re good,” Campbell said on Friday.

Mahogany started his injury evaluation clock this week, and while the Lions initially left the door open for him to return to the active roster for this game, he’s not quite ready and was downgraded to out, keeping him on injured reserve. With two weeks remaining in his evaluation window, Mahogany still has a lot of time to rehabilitate. That being said, he appeared to be close to returning for this game, meaning he will likely have a good chance of returning in Week 16 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Look for the Lions to ask Kayode Awosika to start at left guard this week. However, if his foot injury keeps him from that role, the Lions could turn back to veteran Trystan Colon, who started at left guard last week. We could also see rookie Miles Frazier get some pre-planned reps, regardless of who starts, as coaches are looking to get him more experience.",https://platform.prideofdetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/127/2025/12/imagn-27742320.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.727820977519%2C100%2C78.544358044962&w=1200,N,,2025-12-13 17:00:27.425073

Don't speak this into existence. Even as someone who loathes having to face Burrow twice a year (at least), he's incredible and the league is a better place with him in it.

He's putting pressure on the FO and the people who need to make those decisions because he hopefully has the power to affect real change within the organization.

The problem is that the team will always be hamstrung by their ownership. For all we know the scouting department could have been begging for more staff to adequately prepare for drafts and reporting, and isn't getting support either.

There is no good comparison in the modern NFL for what Rivers is going to attempt.
I asked one of the smartest NFL offensive coordinators what he would do to help Rivers against the Seahawks.
Daniel Jones worked out of shotgun 78.5 percent of the time this season, ranking 20th in the league.
The majority of NFL officials have primary jobs outside of the NFL.","The eyes of the NFL world will be in Seattle on Sunday afternoon to watch Old Man Rivers against one of the best defenses in the league.

The expectation is that the Indianapolis Colts will activate the 44-year-old Philip Rivers from the practice squad Saturday to be their starter, granting us one of the most improbable and unlikely comebacks in modern NFL history -- the cherry on top of one of the best slates you could ask for. The Colts have not officially named Rivers the starter, and Riley Leonard (knee) was a full participant at practice all week.

Sunday vs. the Seahawks (4:25 ET, CBS) will mark 1,800 days exactly since Rivers' last NFL game, which will be the longest layoff by a quarterback 40 years or older in league history. While many around the league have privately joked about this comeback, and others have issued worries about the spot Rivers is putting himself in, the quarterback has said he's not naïve to the challenges ahead on Sunday against the league's second-ranked defense in Seattle.

""I know that there's risk involved, obviously, on what may or may not happen,"" Rivers said. ""But the only way to find out is going for it. I just felt almost like it was a gift, another opportunity to play and cut it loose with the guys and the game you love to play and the dream that you got to live. You may get some bonus time.""

There is no good comparison in the modern NFL for what Rivers is going to attempt. Steve DeBerg played in 1998 at 44 years old after a four-year layoff, but he didn't start in a game until late in the year and had been with the Falcons all training camp and season long.

When Joe Flacco came off the couch for the Browns in 2023, he was 38 years old and had played the previous year with the Jets. Flacco also still had a great arm, something that Rivers has never really possessed.

I asked one of the smartest NFL offensive coordinators what he would do to help Rivers against the Seahawks.

""Quick game!,"" he said. ""Honestly, you got to be able to establish run game and then passes need to really have thoroughly thought out hot outlets so he can get the ball out.

""Mike Macdonald is going to have some fun packages to watch.""

I then turned to one of the best defensive coaches in the league for how he would plan for Rivers if he ran the Seattle defense.

""I am heavy disguise with two pressures at least he hasn't seen on tape,"" the coach said. ""I'm base defense against 11 personnel early and I'm simulating pressure on second and pass.""

Both Seattle's theoretical plan of attack and Rivers' own plan are predicated on his lack of mobility. When he takes the field Sunday he will instantly be the least mobile quarterback in the league.

His average speed of 3.02 mph/play in 2020 was fourth slowest in the league behind Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees. Today, he would rank second behind only Mac Jones (3.01 mph), but this is five years later with three practices under his belt.

It is unlikely Rivers will be able to do much from under center, either. In 2020 with the Colts he was in shotgun 90.1 percent of the time, third-highest in the league then. Daniel Jones worked out of shotgun 78.5 percent of the time this season, ranking 20th in the league.

It's possible Rivers looks about as mobile as he did in the 2007 AFC Championship Game when he played on a torn ACL. Of course, he was 26 then.

What's clear is that Colts head coach Shane Steichen will have to do things differently for Rivers than he was with Jones, who had five rushing touchdowns.

Saturday's expected elevation will also remove Rivers from consideration for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026 and push his eligibility window out five more years. Rivers would not have gotten into the Hall on this ballot, and it's possible he will always be on the outside looking in with zero All Pros and no Super Bowl appearances.

But if he can somehow defy the odds and get the Colts into the playoffs, Rivers may get his second NFL Comeback Player of the Year award and add enough to his legacy that his Hall candidacy in the 2030s is stronger than it is today.

Who is Daniel Jones playing for in 2026?

If Rivers is the Colts present, Indy's future remains a question. Daniel Jones' Achilles injury means he won't be cleared for contact at a practice until June workouts at the absolute earliest, and likely not until some point during training camp.

Jones is on a one-year contract, meaning the Colts or another team will have to sign him this spring just over three months removed from Achilles surgery. Who is going to do that? And what will his price be?

The second question is hard to answer. It was already difficult to nail down before the injury, considering his level of play through the first half of the season, then the slight decline, along with his history of signing a major deal just to watch everything around him crumble. But with this injury? The second season-ender of his career? That's a difficult projection before Christmas.

The Colts will have the franchise tag at their disposal when it comes to Jones. Indianapolis will surely want Jones back, but it's possible the two sides won't be able to agree to terms. The way Indy ensures it keeps Jones on the team is by using the tag, which will be upwards of $40 million next year. That's a big number for a player coming off a serious injury, and there's no way to anticipate whether Indianapolis would issue the tag now when their doctors would need to fully evaluate Jones months after surgery.

And though much younger than Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers when they had their injuries, might there be some hesitation in a team putting their 2026 eggs in the Jones basket coming off Achilles surgery?

I think what's clear is Jones will want the best situation for himself, from contract to front office to coach to roster. That very well could be in Indy with either the tag or a contract. If the Colts don't tag him, it's possible he becomes a free agent. The best situation may present itself somewhere outside of Indianapolis, in that case. Multiple sources have pointed to Minnesota as being a potential landing spot.

Jones picked the Vikings after his release from the Giants, and J.J. McCarthy has played so poorly it is clear Minnesota will need some quarterback insurance next year regardless of how he finishes the year.

The Colts have plenty to figure out these next few weeks. And Jones has plenty to work through these next few months. But unless the Colts are willing to issue the franchise tag, I don't see it as a slam dunk that Jones is back with Indy next year.

Let's hope we don't get 'Replacement Refs' 2.0

Something that flew a bit under the radar this week was the NFL informing team owners that its talks with the NFL Referees Association toward a new collective bargaining agreement have been ""unsuccessful."" This could wind up being a big deal!

The CBA for officials expires at the end of May, and if talks are unsuccessful in December, I don't know why anyone would feel enthused about minds being changed come the offseason when there's no deadline pressure with games three-plus months away.

To recap, the league wants to reward high-performing officials with more year-end bonus money, wants to get rid of seniority considerations when giving out postseason assignments, wants mandatory training for low-performing officials, wants to extend a probationary period that removes underperforming officials, wants to shrink the dead period that's currently from the Super Bowl to May 15 and wants to increase its ""practice squad"" of officials.

All of these things sound great, of course. And the refs union has decided to keep its wishes private. But you can imagine the union wants more money and fewer performance penalties for officials, at the very least.

While the NFL is the biggest thing going and usually gets its way, what is unique about this is we have seen officials be willing to strike before. The start of the 2012 season was a debacle with replacement officials, and that was when the league was pulling in half the money it does today. Throw in the fact that legalized sports gambling has taken over the country and the idea of these games being placed in the hands of below-standard officials is inconceivable.

And the NFL doesn't wield the sort of power over officials that it does over players. Players are, generally speaking, unwilling to have a work stoppage because that means their primary source of income, which can only be made in a finite amount of time, no longer comes in. The majority of NFL officials have primary jobs outside of the NFL. They can financially stomach a work stoppage much more easily than players could.

I did find there to be some irony in the NFL informing owners of these unsuccessful talks during a virtual league meeting that went virtual this year in part to cut costs. And then one day later, officials flagged the Falcons for the most penalties in a game in nine years.

The long and short is the NFL doesn't have its typical high ground in negotiations when it comes to the refs union, and I think that union knows it.

What sources say about Burrow's cryptic comments

Joe Burrow raised just about every eyebrow across the league this week with his comments about how much fun he's having and his future.

""If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it. I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table,"" Burrow said.

""There's a lot of things going on right now,"" the QB added. And when asked if his frustrations are related to football or more personal, Burrow said ""all of the above.""

Because Burrow has a history of sending messages in the media, and because of Cincinnati's history with unhappy players, many took Burrow's comments to signal he may either want out of the Bengals organization or out of football entirely. Carson Palmer ultimately won his freedom from Cincinnati, and it does not seem like it's really been six years since Andrew Luck called it quits at Burrow's current age (he turned 29 this week).

But pump the brakes. I talked with a couple of sources on this who didn't think we are anywhere close to the above scenarios. ""Blown out"" of proportion, said one source. ""Crazy.""

""He was emotional on his birthday and pissed that for as much as he's worked, he's still not able to win. That's all he wants to do. ... If he cannot win he's miserable.""

Burrow's long injury history is well documented, and the Bengals are on the brink of missing the playoffs for the fourth time in Burrow's six years. But he has another four years left on the largest contract in team history, and I don't get the sense that there's any panic inside the building about his long-term future with that organization.

Panthers enter biggest 3-game stretch in 10 years

Much like William Carlos Williams' red wheelbarrow, so much of the Panthers' playoff hopes depends upon beating the Saints in New Orleans on Sunday. The 7-6 Panthers just took sole possession of first place in the NFC South after Atlanta's comeback win against the Buccaneers. The franchise has not made the playoffs since 2017, and it has not hosted a playoff game since 2015.

If Carolina beats New Orleans on Sunday and can beat Tampa Bay next week, the Panthers will have locked up the division. Carolina can lose to Tampa in Week 16 but beat them in Week 18 and win the division, too.

This is the latest in a season Carolina has been at the top of the division since its Super Bowl run in 2015. Very few of the current players have been in the position they currently are, and this is where coaching comes into play.

Dave Canales has a coaching staff that has playoff experience. He won a ring with Seattle, and OC Brad Idzik joined in late playoff success with the Seahawks. DC Ejiro Evero won a Super Bowl with the Rams and went to others. There are other rings on the staff, as well as two Triple OGs in Jim Caldwell and Dom Capers.

As one source put it, there's a ""numbing sense"" where things within a playoff team's building should not and do not change, where players ignore the noise and stay focused on maintaining the process. A huge few weeks in Charlotte.

This week's unlikely QB story: Brady Cook

Do not sleep on Brady Cook this week against the Jaguars. The undrafted rookie quarterback out of Missouri will be the league's 51st starting quarterback* this season when he takes the first snap for the Jets on Sunday with Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields both out.

I'm told Cook ""has been giving the defense fits"" at practice the last few weeks. He doesn't have the biggest arm, but he's a great processor and the offense can rally around him. Cook faces a difficult task against the Jags defense, but a good showing will reflect well on him and his prospects with Gang Green as a backup in 2026.

Cook was a three-year starter at Mizzou and left as one of the most decorated passers in school history -- second only to Chase Daniel in wins and No. 3 in passing yards. Jets fans remember Brad Smith, the do-it-all former QB from the late aughts. Cook joined Smith, Daniel and Drew Lock as Mizzou players to amass over 10,000 yards in their career.

* — Cook could be the 52nd starting quarterback this season depending on who takes the field first between himself and Raiders starter Kenny Pickett. Both are playing in 1 p.m. ET kickoffs, so we'll know who gets the coveted 51st slot then.

NFL's next McVay hasn't turned 30 yet

It would be crazy to interview a 30-year-old for an NFL head coaching job, right? Right?

Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski is a name you'll probably be hearing a lot more of in the coming weeks. Udinski turns 30 in January, he's the non-play-calling OC of the AFC South-leading Jags, and he may be interviewing for head coaching gigs in about five weeks from now.

Udinski got into the league in 2020 when he followed Matt Rhule to Carolina from Baylor. Since then, he has worked his way up the offensive coaching ladder, spending three years in Minnesota before joining Liam Coen's inaugural staff in Jacksonville. He contributed to some of the best years of Kirk Cousins' career, then the best year of Sam Darnold's career and a resurgence in Trevor Lawrence's career this season.

I am not saying Udinski gets a head coaching gig. He'd be almost 11 months younger than Sean McVay when he took the Rams job. But the Jaguars can block teams from interviewing Udinski for a play-calling OC role, so the only way for a team to ensure they can get him in their building for a chat is to interview him for the vacant head coaching position. Teams interviewing folks for elevated positions only hoping to eventually hire them elsewhere in the organization has happened plenty in recent years even though it is not supposed to.

At the very least, teams may want to try to pick the brain of the young, bright offensive star.

Belichick shuffles UNC staff, including Kitchens

Bill Belichick began dismantling his UNC coaching staff this week as he hopes to improve on what was a bad year on the field and perhaps a more embarrassing year off the field for the program. I have said for months now that the team didn't have much of a chance due to the lack of talent -- its roster ranked in the 30s, per 247Sports -- and that showed with just two victories against Power Four opponents.

While no one who watched Carolina play this season is surprised to see offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens won't be with the team in 2026, I point to the above lack of talent and more. Kitchens had three preventative heart surgeries in 11 days last year, I'm told, which had been anticipated after his initial heart issue arose in 2013. So it was a difficult start to the season personally for him along with getting 70 new players on the team acclimated to the scheme.

The former Browns head coach in 2019, Kitchens has been in the college ranks since 2021. He's fully healthy now, and I think he will be in the mix for both college and pro jobs as these cycles continue in the coming weeks.

I don't see Gruden landing Michigan job

One other pro/college coaching note: a name I have seen floated around for the vacant Michigan job is Jon Gruden. I truly do not know if Gruden will coach again this upcoming year or beyond, and it's possible that question won't be answered until his lawsuit against the NFL reaches a conclusion. But I do not see Gruden to Michigan as a possibility in Ann Arbor, according to multiple sources.

Food for thought if MVP becomes two-man race

With four weeks left in the season, I wouldn't shut down the MVP race just yet, but it's clearly shaping up to be a two-horse race between Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye. There will be plenty of metrics to help decide who should get the award at the end of the year, but one thing I would caution others (including voters) against when considering who should win:

Stafford is set to play three of his next four games in national windows, meaning his games against the Lions, Seahawks and Falcons will go to 100% of the country. Meanwhile, Maye is coming off a bye and has only next Sunday night's game against the Ravens going to the entire country.

All of these games are big for these two teams, which are each vying for their conference's top seed. It shouldn't matter that they played well in a game going nationwide. It should matter that they played well in the game, whether it goes to 7 percent of the country or the world.

I also won't hold against one or both of these guys if they sit the final game of the season because they have already locked up the No. 1 seed. Accomplishing the mission in 16 games is fantastic and should not be considered a detriment to one's end-of-season awards when it comes to total QB statistics.

Ravens doing flurry of deals; Broncos next?

Last week I wrote in this space about how some teams are trying to get in front of the potential spike in the salary cap by getting deals done at the end of this season versus waiting until the spring. Very clearly the Ravens are one of those teams.

After getting Mark Andrews' deal done, Baltimore inked Travis Jones to an extension this past week. We will see if they can get across the finish line with Tyler Linderbaum, who has been another extension target for the team.

Another team to look for is the Denver Broncos. Quarterback Bo Nix will be on his rookie deal for at least one more year, and GM George Paton is looking to make some deals before the end of this year, I'm told.

Higgins' injury puts NFL concussion protocol under scrutiny

Tee Higgins will miss Sunday's game against the Ravens after suffering his second concussion of the season this past week against the Bills, and it's bad optics for the league's concussion protocol.

The NFL has worked intensely on strengthening its concussion protocol. According to a joint review of the process by the league and the players union, it appears all steps were followed last week when Higgins was checked twice for a concussion during the game. It was not until after the game, as part of the protocol process, where Higgins reported symptoms and was officially placed in protocol.

This came two weeks after Higgins suffered a concussion, and against the Bills he appeared to hit his head in a similar way that had resulted in the previous head injury. I'm no doctor, but it was surprising to see Higgins stay in the game after the first head hit. It was stunning to see him stay in the game after the second.

The return-to-play protocol is the same for any player regardless of being concussed once or twice, and it's a slippery slope to change any rules because of how things may ""appear."" But as someone who has covered concussions in the NFL for several years now, Sunday's events seemed like a gap in the protocol armor that needs to be addressed.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/13/1c5480ad-be47-4f2d-8086-47842e022638/thumbnail/1200x675/3aa37f078f201470f74bc79786242f98/philrivers.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 15:01:44.440384

In Watt's situation, according to his brother JJ, he suffered a partially collapsed lung (also a pneumothorax) after a dry needling treatment session.","PITTSBURGH -- Steelers star T.J. Watt, one of the highest-paid edge rushers in the NFL and the 2021 AP Defensive Player of the Year, suffered a partially collapsed lung during a Wednesday dry needling treatment at the team facility, prompting questions about the events that led to the incident and what will happen next.

J.J. Watt, T.J.'s brother, said in a social media statement Friday that T.J. had surgery Thursday to repair and stabilize his lung and was released from the hospital Friday.

""Yesterday TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,"" J.J. Watt wrote on social media. ""Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today. He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes.""

T.J. Watt, 31, will not play in Monday's home prime-time matchup against the Miami Dolphins (8:15 ET, ESPN), Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said, as Pittsburgh seeks to bolster its AFC North lead over the Baltimore Ravens.

The Steelers haven't provided many details surrounding the incident. The initial statement released by Pittsburgh spokesperson Burt Lauten on Thursday said Watt went to the hospital for further evaluation of his lung after experiencing ""discomfort"" at the practice facility Wednesday. After Friday's practice, Tomlin said Watt had a ""medical procedure today or yesterday."" And when asked if the incident that led to Watt's hospitalization occurred during a dry needling session, as J.J. Watt said, Tomlin continued to be vague.

""I don't have a lot of information, so I'm certainly not going to dispute something that's said by someone close to him,"" Tomlin said. ""I hadn't had discussions along those lines.""

The NFL Players Association is aware of the situation and has been in touch with Watt and his representation. ""Our main immediate priority is supporting T.J.'s health and full recovery,"" the NFLPA said in a statement.

Dry needling isn't unusual during an NFL player's physical therapy, but a significant incident like this is uncommon.

Did Watt have an injury before the treatment? What is dry needling? Is Watt's situation similar to then-Chargers quarterback Tyrod Taylor's situation in 2020, when he suffered a punctured lung? How will Pittsburgh's defense step up as the team chases a divisional title? Steelers reporter Brooke Pryor and ESPN senior writer and injury analyst Stephania Bell break down the biggest questions.

Did Watt have a chest or back injury before the dry needling?

Watt has not been listed on the team practice or injury report this season. Tomlin also said Thursday that, to his knowledge, Watt didn't have an injury that was worthy of being on an injury report or after the Steelers' Week 14 game.

Watt was on the practice report because of a toe injury during the week leading up to the game at Baltimore, and earlier in the season, he was listed on the practice report because of a hip issue leading up to the Week 8 home game against the Green Bay Packers. Dry needling isn't necessarily associated as a treatment for a specific injury, and it can be used to alleviate general muscle tightness, including around the shoulders, and in some cases, the pectoral muscles. -- Pryor

What is dry needling? What is required to legally administer dry needling? How safe is it?

Dry needling is a skilled intervention where the provider uses a thin needle to penetrate the skin with the goal of alleviating pain and improving movement. Unlike ""wet"" needling, which utilizes a hollow bore needle (which has a central channel to allow liquid to pass through it) to inject a medication, dry needling utilizes a solid needle and no substance is injected.

Common applications for dry needling include, but aren't limited to, muscle pain/strains (e.g., hamstring, quad), tendinitis/tendinopathy (e.g., patellofemoral, biceps, rotator cuff), plantar fasciitis and headaches. Utilization has expanded within the past decade, in particular, and it is not uncommon to see dry needling in most athletic rehabilitation settings or training rooms.

Requirements vary by state as to who may legally perform dry needling. The range of practitioners engaging in dry needling may include physical therapists, athletic trainers, acupuncturists, chiropractors, physicians, physician assistants, nurses and nurse practitioners.

Health care professionals typically undergo post-graduate education specific to dry needling procedures. The requirements vary by state as to requisite hours of training as there is no nationally recognized board that oversees dry needling certification. Programs require completion of didactic and practical elements, and participants must pass written and practical exams that incorporate safety components.

Dr. Sue Falsone, president and founder of Structure and Function Education, is a physical therapist, athletic trainer and certified strength and conditioning specialist who has over 15 years of experience practicing and teaching dry needling. She has treated and consulted with numerous elite athletes, including NFL and MLB players, and says there are numerous safety studies that have been published showing very low risk with dry needling.

""Precautions and patient safety are always a part of any patient intervention,"" Falsone said, ""but as with any modality, there is a chance for an adverse reaction.""

Falsone noted that the four most common adverse reactions consistently documented in the scientific literature are relatively benign. They include bleeding (noted as a drop or two of blood at the needle site), localized bruising, pain or residual soreness at the needle site and pain or soreness away from the site.

""Pneumothorax [punctured lung] is reported in the literature as a very rare event,"" Falsone said. -- Bell

How many other Steelers do dry needling?

It's hard to say how many Steelers players seek dry needling to treat tight muscles and soreness during the season, but former linebacker James Harrison told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler in 2015 that ""three to five"" other players in the locker room were also doing dry needling.

""It's a more invasive form of needling,"" Harrison said then. ""It can be recovery-based and help to heal any injuries that are nagging. ... It's painful as hell.""

Steelers inside linebacker Patrick Queen said Friday that he prefers to use acupuncture over dry needling.

""Kind of two different things,"" Queen said. ""... I don't do the whole dry needle thing. I'm actually scared of dry needling, so I kind of stay away from that stuff.

""It is unfortunate. You could probably get dry needled a thousand times and never have anything happen, and it just probably a half an inch in the wrong direction. So, you never know.""

Queen added that he has always been cautious about whom he permits to use needles on him in treatment.

""Obviously, it's needles, then you need 'em in the right spot and stuff, and they could go in the wrong spot at any time,"" he said. -- Pryor

What should be the typical prognosis for Watt? Will there be any long-term effects?

The most critical aspect of Watt's case is that once he reported symptoms and was evaluated, he was sent to the hospital for care emergently and treated promptly by the appropriate personnel. This gives him an excellent chance of full recovery.

Lung tissue is remarkably resilient, especially in a young, healthy athlete. A lung injury like Watt's has the potential to heal within 7-10 days, and there should be no long-term effects. -- Bell

Is this like the Tyrod Taylor situation? What are the differences?

Taylor was reportedly dealing with two cracked ribs and received a pregame pain-relieving injection, the intent of which was to decrease localized pain and allow him to compete on game day. The needle punctured a lung, and the result was a pneumothorax (where air leaks into the space between the lung and the chest wall, putting pressure on or ""collapsing"" the lung).

In Watt's situation, according to his brother JJ, he suffered a partially collapsed lung (also a pneumothorax) after a dry needling treatment session. By definition, dry needling means no medication was being delivered via the needle, making this different from Taylor's specific procedure.

While we do not have access to the specifics of either player's medical records, it is worth noting that every player's injury severity and recovery experience is unique, even in the presence of the same diagnosis. We do know that Taylor has since gone on to return to football at the NFL level and expect Watt to do the same. -- Bell

What does Watt's absence mean for the Steelers' defense in their quest to win the AFC North?

There's no firm timeline on Watt's return, and that's a significant hit for a team that has a slim lead over the Ravens for the AFC North and a coveted playoff spot with four games remaining.

The Steelers are 1-11 all time, including the playoffs, when Watt doesn't play. Watt last missed a game in the 2023 playoffs, when he was sidelined because of an MCL sprain for the wild-card loss to the Buffalo Bills in January 2024.

This time without Watt, the Steelers will rely on a rotation of Alex Highsmith, Nick Herbig and rookie Jack Sawyer. Highsmith, who has dealt with injuries throughout this season, sealed the win against the Ravens with a walk-off sack of Lamar Jackson.

""That's a clear representation of who he is, the type of plays he provides, the type of splash he makes, game on the line, he'll go make a play for us,"" Herbig said of Highsmith. ""That's who Alex is. That's who he's been his whole career.""

Herbig is also another young player on the rise. The 2023 fourth-round pick recorded two sacks the last time he faced a left-handed quarterback in Cleveland's Dillion Gabriel; Herbig had two tackles for loss and four quarterback hits. Herbig faces Miami's left-handed QB Tua Tagovailoa on Monday.

""T.J.'s done a great job of being a leader, not just in the room, but in the whole building, the organization,"" Herbig said. ""I think he rubs off on a lot of people in the right way, and I'm not worried at all because we have great guys, great leaders that'll pick up that slack, and I think that he's prepared, not just myself, but a bunch of the younger guys in that sense to be able to take on that larger role, not just as a player but as a leader, and bringing that energy and just doing everything that he does."" -- Pryor",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1213%2Fr1588703_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 13:00:32.231529

If Bateman can't play Sunday, that would open up more opportunities for veteran DeAndre Hopkins and second-year speedster Devontez Walker. Harbaugh and Offensive Coordinator Todd Monken have said this week that they want to get Hopkins more involved.

Ravens outside linebacker Tavius Robinson (foot) and safety Ar'Darius Washington (Achilles) are questionable and would need to be activated to the 53-man roster on Saturday to play. The Ravens currently only have 51 players on the roster, so there's room for them to move up without making a cut.

Robinson has missed the past seven games due to a foot injury and Washington could make his season debut after suffering an Achilles injury in May.

Wembanyama was listed as probable on Friday’s Spurs injury report, but he pronounced himself “ready to go” while talking to reporters on Friday night.
Because, I mean, there was no reason to take (an) inconsiderate risk two days after my injury.” Wembanyama accepted the advice, but he’s been pushing for clearance for quite some time.
The Spurs beat the Los Angeles Lakers in Wednesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal to advance to Las Vegas.
Wembanyama suffered the injury during the Spurs’ game against the Golden State Warriors.","After nearly a month sidelined by a left calf strain, Victor Wembanyama is expected to return for the San Antonio Spurs in Saturday’s NBA Cup semifinal in Las Vegas against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Wembanyama was listed as probable on Friday’s Spurs injury report, but he pronounced himself “ready to go” while talking to reporters on Friday night.

“I’m feeling great,” Wembanyama said during media availability.

Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said he expects Wembanyama to play, adding that the center will be on a minutes restriction, and he anticipates subbing him out of the game early.

Wembanyama felt he and the Spurs staff undertook the right process to get him back on the floor, acknowledging that he may be a little tired from the conditioning work he is still doing to ramp up ahead of Saturday’s game.

“It’s a lot of trust that comes into play both ways. I know I have a chance to be around the best staff in the world, so I trust them very much,” he said. “I have the chance, also, that they trust me because I’ve shown them I know my body and I give them good feedback.”

Johnson acknowledged that Wembanyama was lobbying to play from the day he suffered the injury on Nov. 14, trying to get into a game in Sacramento two days later. The Spurs shut him down and stated they would be abundantly cautious with Wembanyama, which was not easy for him to accept.

“But it’s true if it was only me, I would have came back earlier,” Wembanyama said. “But I think it’s more reasonable to do it (this) way, to listen to them and do as they said. Because, I mean, there was no reason to take (an) inconsiderate risk two days after my injury.”

Wembanyama accepted the advice, but he’s been pushing for clearance for quite some time. Johnson noted that the conversation around Wembanyama’s return has been going on for two weeks.

The Spurs beat the Los Angeles Lakers in Wednesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal to advance to Las Vegas.

Wembanyama suffered the injury during the Spurs’ game against the Golden State Warriors. San Antonio went 9-3 without their 21-year-old face of the franchise, who averaged 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.6 blocks in 12 games this season.

Assuming he returns, the Spurs will be fully healthy for the first time this season. It comes just in time for a matchup against the defending champion Thunder, who, at 24-1, have tied the best 25-game start in NBA history.

During the Spurs’ shootaround Wednesday morning before the NBA Cup quarterfinal, Wembanyama tested his calf by jumping on force plates, which measure impact data from a player’s leaping and landing to help determine if they are moving with sufficient impact and any imbalances in the lower body. He and the surrounding staff seemed sufficiently satisfied with the results, a precursor to the Spurs’ medical staff giving him the go-ahead to play.

While Wembanyama has been getting in a warm-up before games this week, it has been a more abridged and lower-intensity routine than usual. The Spurs were adamant that they won’t rush him back, even for a game they have clearly valued.

For the Spurs to get past the Thunder, they will need Wembanyama to blend with the uptempo offense that has thrived without him. The Spurs maintained they wanted to play in transition as much as possible entering the season, but the offense got bogged down at times trying to learn how to play through Wembanyama. Once De’Aaron Fox returned from a hamstring strain and got control of the offense, everything started to fall into place, even without Wembanyama.

“I’ve been really proud,” he said. “Of course, it’s been hard to watch from my couch, but almost every night, they have proven (to) me that I have nothing to worry about.”

He was most proud that the team is playing the brand of basketball they have been aiming for since the start of training camp. Fox’s return has catalyzed their offensive evolution, getting more players involved and into their comfort zones.

It’s why Wembanyama said they are getting closer to “ideal basketball.”

“Everybody has something to eat,” he said. “Everybody can step up at any time. Everybody can take up responsibilities. Everybody trusts their next teammate. It’s just beautiful to see.”

The team will get better with its best player back, but the challenge is to maintain that same energy. Can everyone keep eating when Wembanyama needs so many calories?

If they can make it work, it could be lovely to watch.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/11171952/USATSI_27789448-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-13 13:00:35.186202

Yahya Black did not practice Friday, per the injury report, and fellow rookie defensive tackle Derrick Harmon continues to sit out.

That adds to three veteran defensive linemen on injured reserve for the Steelers, who have allowed 466 rushing yards over their past two games.

Monday’s opponent, the Miami Dolphins, have amassed 303 rushing yards over their past two and carry a four-game winning streak into the primetime meeting.

Harmon has missed the past two games because of a knee injury, and Black has a shoulder ailment. Additionally, the Steelers’ most accomplished defensive linemen — Cameron Heyward and Keeanu Benton — are listed on the injury report. Benton, in fact, was downgraded to limited participation Friday as he deals with his ankle injury.

Heyward missed practice Friday, listed with a knee injury. But it is not atypical for the 36-year-old to sit out a practice each week, and he is expected to play against the Dolphins.

The only fully healthy defensive linemen on the Steelers roster are Logan Lee, Esezi Otomewo and Brodric Martin-Rhodes. Those three have been in uniform for only a combined 13 games this season. Each has been a regular healthy scratch.

Kyler Baugh and Anthony Goodlow are defensive linemen on the practice squad. Between them is a total of 36 NFL regular-season snaps of experience, all by Goodlow earlier this season with the Arizona Cardinals before his release.

Dugger, others on track

Starting safety Kyle Dugger practiced fully for the second consecutive day, meaning there is a good chance he will return from a one-game absence because of a hand injury.

Other starters who practiced fully Friday despite nursing injuries were quarterback Aaron Rodgers (wrist), receiver DK Metcalf (abdomen) and inside linebacker Patrick Queen (hip).

Austin added, Pierre still out

Receiver Calvin Austin III was an addition to the injury report, getting a “limited participation” designation for Friday’s practice.

Joining T.J. Watt, Harmon, Black and Heyward as those who missed practice were starting cornerback James Pierre (calf) and fill-in starting left tackle Andrus Peat (concussion). If Pierre cannot play, Asante Samuel Jr. likely will get his first start with the Steelers. If Peat cannot play, Dylan Cook would get his first NFL start just seven days after his pro debut.

Status quo in protocol

Two other Steelers who joined Peat in NFL concussion protocol during last week’s win at the Baltimore Ravens remain limited in practice: inside linebacker Malik Harrison and tight end Darnell Washington.

Receiver and special teams ace Ben Skowronek was upgraded to a partial participant with his hand ailment suffered in Baltimore. Skowronek is expected to play against Miami.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/12/9124897_web1_ptr-Steelers38-091525.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 12:01:21.083078
