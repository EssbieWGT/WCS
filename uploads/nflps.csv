Simpson said the injury occurred after he took a helmet to the rib while scrambling for a first down late in the first half.
Simpson said he had an X-ray at halftime, and he was on the field to start the second half for the Crimson Tide.
Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said Simpson wanted to see if he could continue to play in the second half.
""He did some nice things when he got on the football field,"" DeBoer said of Mack.","PASADENA, Calif. -- Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson said he suffered a cracked rib in the first half of the Crimson Tide's 38-3 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff quarterfinal Thursday at the Rose Bowl.

Simpson said the injury occurred after he took a helmet to the rib while scrambling for a first down late in the first half. He fumbled on the play, however, and Indiana recovered.

""Felt like I had a good thing going on that drive when I got hit,"" said Simpson, who completed 12 of 16 passes for only 67 yards in the game. ""It kind of changed the momentum for sure. ... The competitor in me wanted to make sure I got the first down. Got more than the first down, and then should have been smart and just got down.""

Simpson said he had an X-ray at halftime, and he was on the field to start the second half for the Crimson Tide. After a three-and-out, he said he realized that he couldn't play through the injury and ""I made an executive decision and thought [about] what gave us the best chance to win.""

Backup Austin Mack played the rest of the game for Alabama.

Said Simpson: ""I thought Austin being 100 percent could help us win.""

Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said Simpson wanted to see if he could continue to play in the second half.

""We treated him there at halftime and he gave it a series, and I know he feels like he let down the team -- and there's no way that that's the case,"" DeBoer said. ""He went out there and tried to battle, and that's who he is. And so I'm never going to let that be a thing where he [thinks he] let us down in any way.""

Mack, a redshirt sophomore who has completed 13 of 16 passes this season for 125 yards, guided the Crimson Tide to a field goal on his first drive for Alabama's first -- and only -- points of the game.

Mack, a third-year sophomore, went 11-of-16 for 103 yards against the Hoosiers with three sacks.

If Williams is unable to play, the 49ers will turn to Austen Pleasants to make his first career NFL start. He entered the NFL as an undrafted rookie in 2020 and spent time with five teams before joining the 49ers late last season. He saw considerable action in the final two games of 2024 while splitting time with Charlie Heck after the 49ers lost their top three left tackles due to injuries. Pleasants earned a spot on the 49ers’ 53-man roster after a strong training camp.

“A big thing for him is every Wednesday, since he's been our swing tackle, is Trent takes Wednesdays off,” general manager John Lynch said on 49ers Game Plan. “We give him (Williams) Wednesdays off to get his body back. And he (Pleasants) has taken advantage of those opportunities, and I think that gives him some comfort. He's worked with the starters before.”

Pleasants was called upon Sunday night against the Chicago Bears when Williams sustained a hamstring injury while chasing linebacker T.J. Edwards’ 34-yard interception return for a touchdown. Pleasants entered the game at the beginning of the next possession and played the final 71 snaps in the 49ers’ 42-38 victory.

White has played approximately 60 percent of the 49ers’ defensive snaps as part of the 49ers’ defensive line rotation since arriving in a mid-season trade from New England.

Cornerback Renardo Green is also set to be back after missing two games with a neck condition.

Epps this season has played in 12 games and has started 4. He has played very well since taking over the starting job. Epps’ experience has been on display the last month.

For most of the season, the Eagles started rookie Drew Mukuba at the safety spot next to Blankenship in the secondary but Mukuba fractured his ankle in Dallas on Nov. 23 and has been on Injured Reserve after having surgery.

DNP: DT Jalen Carter (hip), LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring), TE Dallas Goedert (knee), T Lane Johnson (foot), OLB Jaelan Phillips (ankle)

Full: LB Jihaad Campbell (back/shoulder), S Marcus Epps (concussion)

After practice, safety Marcus Epps reported symptoms to the team and it was determined he has a concussion. So Epps is now in concussion protocol.

Goedert, Dean and Carter were spectators at practice, while Johnson and Phillips were not seen during the portion of practice open to reporters.

NFL

LB Jihaad Campbell (back/shoulder) was practicing after being listed as limited to start the week. This should be his second straight start.

And OT Cameron Williams (shoulder) was practicing after being listed as a full participant to start the week. The Eagles activated Williams off IR to the 53-man roster, which means the sixth-round pick will make his NFL debut on Sunday. Williams on Thursday was removed from the injury report after being activated.

The Eagles are going to rest many key starters for their Week 18 game against the Commanders, so it’s not a big deal that Johnson, Dean, Goedert and Phillips are not practicing this week. They will obviously not play against the Commanders as the Eagles rest up for their wild-card round game the following week.

Johnson will miss his seventh consultive game after suffering a Lisfranc sprain against the Lions on Nov. 16 and Dean will miss his second after suffering a hamstring injury against the Commanders on Dec. 20.

Phillips suffered that ankle injury in the win over Buffalo and could probably use a bye week anyway; he has already played in 17 games this season because of the timing of his trade from the Dolphins to the Eagles. Goedert has missed just one game all year but will likely sit in this regular season finale.

Some Eagles starters are going to be inactive on Sunday, while others will be limited and some will dress out but will not play.

Olave is eligible for a contract extension this offseason and set to make more than $15 million next season after the Saints picked up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract.

McCarthy missed last week’s game with a right-hand injury. He practiced in full Thursday for the first time since exiting the Week 16 game against the New York Giants with the injury.

“I felt like the ball was spinning,” McCarthy said after Wednesday’s practice. “We’ll take it day to day.”

Earlier in the season, head coach Kevin O’Connell suggested that McCarthy needed a full week of practice to give him the best chance at optimal performance. The circumstances are different this late in the season. O’Connell said Monday the team would love to get McCarthy one final opportunity.

It’s been a rollercoaster of a season for the 2024 first-round pick. McCarthy, 22, has missed seven games due to three injuries: a high-ankle sprain, a concussion and currently a hairline fracture in his throwing hand. He struggled early in the season, then found his footing from Weeks 14-16. Improved accuracy and decisiveness provided optimism about McCarthy’s trajectory. He called having to miss the Week 17 victory versus the Lions “extremely tough.”

“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs and twists and turns,” McCarthy said. “But at the end of the day, it’s a beautiful picture and a beautiful story that I’m really starting to understand the meaning of. And the reasoning behind it. And we’re not done yet.”

Green Bay has secured its playoff bid, so it may not play most of its starters. Regardless, this is an opportunity for McCarthy to give a closing statement on his first season as a starter ahead of a critical offseason. The current Vikings regime has not won a playoff game. Flipping that will likely be the expectation in 2026, which will require a particular baseline level of play at the quarterback position.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/01165836/GettyImages-2252294261-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-01 19:58:29.176813

No question about Baker Mayfield's toughness Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield popped up on Tampa Bay's injury report this week with right shoulder and knee.
Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury against the Rams earlier in the season but returned the next week.
As to whether the right shoulder injury could affect Mayfield on Saturday, though, shouldn't change his availability, said Brown.","CHARLOTTE — Claudin Cherelus was out of the boot he was wearing all week on Thursday, but he's not ready to play, which is forcing the Panthers to adjust at linebacker again this week.

With Cherelus ruled out, the Panthers are thin at the position, with veteran Krys Barnes and rookie Bam Martin-Scott up next to play next to Christian Rozeboom.

Barnes has played in 74 games with 32 starts in his career, but he didn't practice Tuesday because of a back issue. He's listed as questionable on the final injury report.

Martin-Scott has played defense in a couple of games this year (San Francisco and Seattle).

""We've been working him back in, looking better and better each day; so hopefully we'll get him out there,"" Panthers head coach Dave Canales said of Barnes. ""Krys has played some good snaps for us, and then we got a couple of other guys.""

Canales said if need be, known commodity Jacoby Windmon could be activated from the practice squad for depth.

But obviously, Barnes' experience is significant in a situation like this with the playoffs on the line.

""Extremely valuable,"" Canales said. ""Just with the week of preparation, and what do you do? You don't do anything different. You go about it the same way, and you attack the work, and Krys has been a stud for us. We've asked him to play special teams roles, pop in there and play linebacker for us, he's a guy that can handle a lot and has really good experience within our scheme. So, really fortunate that he's here.""

Hunt and Moore's status remains questionable

Offensive lineman Robert Hunt and receiver David Moore both continued to practice this week, within their 21-day window to be activated. Both are officially considered questionable for the game, but Canales isn't quite ready to commit to either playing on Saturday against the Buccaneers. However, it is for different reasons.

""David had a fantastic week, you know, at this point it's just about figuring out, roster-wise, when that makes sense for us,"" Canales explained. The roster is currently full at 53 men, so for Moore to be activated, a man would have to be cut.

As for Hunt, it remains a matter of having him physically ready.

""Rob was able to do a little bit more, but we got to see how his body responds tomorrow (Friday), and that's why, you know, it's questionable right now for Rob.

""We were able to kind of ramp up his work, but it's like the recovery of what does this thing feel like the next day, where are we at in terms of football, whole football readiness.""

Some of the challenges with testing Hunt's readiness stem from the fact that teams are not in pads at this late stage of the season. And for an offensive lineman, a lot of their work centers around being as physical as possible, something that isn't full tested unless in pads.

""We were able to simulate some things from a physical standpoint,"" Canales shared, before continuing, ""Not being in pads certainly does present its challenges. If we were just practicing in the normal scheme of the season and being able to hit each other and all that, you can gather a little bit more information.""

However, considering Hunt's injury is in his biceps, the coaches can still gather a lot of information from non-padded drills.

""The nature of the injury, he just needs that physical change of direction and getting his hands split the right way. So we were able to evaluate some of that.""

No question about Baker Mayfield's toughness

Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield popped up on Tampa Bay's injury report this week with right shoulder and knee. He was a limited participant on Tuesday, but was able to practice fully on Wednesday.

Those who know him well, such as Canales (who was Mayfield's coordinator in Tampa in 2023) and Derrick Brown (who was teammates with Mayfield in Carolina), fully expect to see him on the field Saturday.

""My short time with Baker, this is a tough guy. This is a competitor. He's a great teammate. He's going to be out there with this team, and he's going to give everything he has,"" Canales said Thursday. ""We got to expect that. We got to be ready for that version of Baker, and, so, and I respect him for it, and I've seen him battle through things and find his way to game day and give everything he has.""

Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury against the Rams earlier in the season but returned the next week. The left shoulder is Mayfield's non-throwing shoulder, but he has thrown five of his 10 interceptions in the five games since. As to whether the right shoulder injury could affect Mayfield on Saturday, though, shouldn't change his availability, said Brown.

""Knowing 6, he'll be out there Saturday,"" said Brown. ""He'll be out there for sure. So, you know, I think he's the ultimate competitor, so we'll see him out there Saturday.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/ljrj14tfqvdmlwt4czub,N,,2026-01-01 18:58:47.232081

The Detroit Lions (8-8) and Chicago Bears (11-5) were back on the practice field on Thursday in advance of their Week 18 matchup this Sunday.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

No practice

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

IOL Trystan Colon (wrist)

DT Alim McNeill (abdomen)

Sewell has now missed back-to-back practices, and it’s fair to speculate if he’ll play this week, considering coach Dan Campbell’s comments earlier in the week surrounding playing injured players. At the same time, Sewel has taken two practices off earlier in the season and was still able to play by Sunday, so there is still a chance he plays on Sunday.

Colon missing two practices with a lingering wrist injury he has previously played through is unusual, and could be a sign he re-aggravated it.

McNeill showed up on last week’s injury report, then exited Week 17 very early and has not practiced since. His status for this Sunday’s game is very much up in the air.

Limited practice

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee/ankle) — upgraded from no practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness)

LG Christian Mahogany (illness) — upgraded from no practice

OL Kayode Awosika (illness) — upgraded from no practice

OT Giovanni Manu (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 6

LB Alex Anzalone (concussion) — upgraded from no practice

SAF Thomas Harper (concussion) — upgraded from no practice

St. Brown hopes to be able to play this weekend, per Campbell, and a return to practice on Thursday sets him up for that. He’ll need to participate on Friday in some capacity, but signs are pointing up. St. Brown talked to our Jeremy Reisman in the locker room on Thursday.

“I feel solid. I would say a little banged up, but good enough to go, so that’s all that really matters.”

St. Brown would go on to add that he doesn’t believe there is any long-term injury risk involved for him with his current ailment:

“I don’t think so. Obviously, there’s risk in any game you play with any injury, but to answer your question, I don’t think so.”

Decker getting in a second practice this week is a good sign that he’ll be able to finish out the season on the football field.

Mahogany and Awosika returned from their illnesses, a good sign that they’re likely to be available on Sunday.

Manu is closing out his injury evaluation window, but it’s still not entirely clear if he’ll be activated and play this weekend. Sewell’s health could be a factor in determining that.

Anzalone and Harper both returned to practice on Thursday, suggesting they’re progressing through the NFL injury protocols. That being said, there are still hurdles to clear, and there’s no guarantee either play, especially Harper, who is dealing with his second concussion this season.

Full Practice

DB Avonte Maddox (back/illness) — upgraded from limited

Maddox getting in back-to-back practices after missing last week’s game is a good sign he’s on track to return, though there is no guarantee, as we’ve seen many times this season.

Joining the limited, both starters were back at practice as Miami Dolphins prep continued inside the WIN Waste Innovations Field House. But fullback Jack Westover, guard Jared Wilson, defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga, as well as linebackers Harold Landry III and Robert Spillane remained non-participants.

Here’s the second injury report leading up to Sunday’s 4:25 p.m. ET season finale at Gillette Stadium.

After beginning the week with seven sidelined, the Patriots went forward with five sidelined. Wilson, Tonga, Landry and Spillane had all been ruled out ahead of what became a 42-10 win over the New York Jets last Sunday. But the visit to MetLife Stadium also ended without Westover due to an ankle injury that surfaced on a kickoff in the fourth quarter.

The Patriots had four partial participants on hand. After catching his seventh touchdown and eclipsing 700 receiving yards for the first time in his NFL career, Henry missed practice on New Year’s Eve due to a knee injury. And across the line of scrimmage, Barmore, who is facing a domestic assault charge stemming from August, had also been absent due to an illness. Elsewhere, two players whose 21-day practice windows opened over the past week remained limited. Ankle and wrist injuries sent Williams and Austin to injured reserve in November. Both await activation.

Boutte went without a non-contact jersey after spending the past week in the NFL’s concussion protocol.

The Bills quarterback did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday.

With the Bills seemingly destined to finish as the No. 6 seed in the AFC, and given that they’re playing the Jets, it could make sense to give Allen all or most of the day off on Sunday.

The injury happened in Week 16 against the Browns, on a long self-sack play. He finished the game, but his post-game contention that the foot didn’t affect him in the second half wasn’t convincing.

After seemingly aggravating it against the Eagles, Allen insisted it had “zero” impact on him. (And then he went to the X-ray room.) Meanwhile, Allen possibly rushed his throw on the fateful two-point misfire to receiver Khalil Shakir so that he wouldn’t have to try to run away on the injured foot from Eagles linebacker Jaelan Phillips.

Given that Sunday will likely be the last game at Highmark Stadium, maybe the Bills will give Allen a drive or two. Or maybe just one snap so he officially gets the start in the final game. There’s no point in risking further aggravation to his foot, not with the playoffs looming — and with Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, and possibly Lamar Jackson not among the quarterbacks Allen may face.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd1df61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7169x4033+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc2%2Fb1%2F3d40da4641e6adf5fa91d71205ba%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2254071059,N,,2026-01-01 17:57:53.600510

NFL teams are allowed to designate up to eight players to return from injured reserve during the regular season. The Broncos have already used six of those designations, including two for linebackers Drew Sanders (foot) and Karene Reid (hamstring). Neither player has been activated to the 53-man roster yet, but both are eligible.

Even if Reid and Sanders are not eventually activated, they will still count against the team's limit of eight designations, so the club has to weigh roster spots and return limits as it makes decisions.

Another player who is eligible to return is tight end Lucas Krull (foot). If Denver plans to maximize its regular season IR returns, decisions have to be made by Saturday before the team faces the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.

Once the NFL playoffs begin, the Broncos can bring back two more players from IR. Potential candidates could include center Luke Wattenberg (who might be able to return for a potential AFC title game) and running back J.K. Dobbins (who might be able to return for a potential Super Bowl).

""Chris had an illness come up ... obviously he's navigating that with our medical staff,"" coach Kellen Moore said Thursday. ""Our medical staff is awesome and for them to kind of get ahead of this, I thought it was a credit to those guys. He's in great care.""

Olave, 25, will finish his fourth season with the Saints with a career-best 1,163 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. The 2022 first-round pick will head into his fifth-year option if he and the Saints do not reach a contract extension before the 2026 season begins.

""The game of football is a game of football, but there's game of life is a lot more important. So, number one, his health is what's most important. And then you think about that his health's going to be fine and he's in great care is the next thing is for him,"" offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier said Thursday. ""What a season, what a great job he's done, accomplishments he's had. And we'd like to see him finish the season, but that wasn't in our card. So, our thoughts and prayers were with him.""

Olave, who has been dealing with a recurring back injury this season, was able to play in a win against the Tennessee Titans in Week 17 after receiving treatment on Friday and Saturday.

He said last week that his goal was to play all 17 games after missing the second half of the 2024 season after sustaining two documented concussions.

""I think it's going to be my first time in my NFL career playing 17,"" Olave said Sunday. ""It means a lot, man. One of my goals, one of my main goals for this year is trying to play all 17. Playing through injuries, playing through all that. So I'm super grateful, like I said. Got to give all glory to God to be in this position. We just got to finish next week.""

Olave said he contemplated retirement at one point last season after seeking opinions from concussion specialists.

""It was a tough time last year,"" Olave said after the Saints' win against the New York Jets on Dec. 21. ""I was only 24 years old, contemplating retirement, especially with the head injuries, but I prayed about it. My fam, my close fam was around me. They stuck by my side, and I just gave it another try, another chance. And it's been a great year.""

Coach Matt LaFleur said Thursday that Love would only play on Sunday if he's needed as the backup quarterback, but most likely either Malik Willis or Desmond Ridder would serve as the No. 2 quarterback against the Vikings.

""If he's the backup on game day and if something bad happened, then you've got not many other options,"" LaFleur said when asked if there's any reason to play Love. ""But the intent, I would say, is not to play him.""

Love sustained a concussion in the Dec. 20 loss at the Chicago Bears and missed last week's loss to the Baltimore Ravens. He was a full participant in practice Wednesday for the first time since the Bears game and was cleared Thursday, 12 days after what was believed to be the first concussion of his NFL career.

Willis was a limited participant in practice Wednesday because of right shoulder and hamstring injuries. He did not throw at all during the open viewing portion of practice but said he threw a few passes later in the session. The Packers signed Ridder to the practice squad Wednesday, giving them four quarterbacks in house for the first time since training camp. LaFleur said Ridder could ""potentially"" serve as the No. 2 quarterback Sunday.

The Packers (9-6-1) are locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC and will open the playoffs with a wild-card game on the road against either the Bears or Philadelphia Eagles. The Vikings (8-8) have been eliminated from playoff contention and have not named a starting quarterback yet for Sunday.

Tune, a fifth-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals in 2023, has made one NFL start -- a 27-0 loss to the Cleveland Browns midway through his rookie season. He completed 11-of-20 passes for 58 yards with two interceptions and a lost fumble.

He joined the Packers on Aug. 28, when he was signed to the practice squad. He was elevated for game day last week against the Ravens and finished the game after Willis reinjured his shoulder. He completed just 1-of-4 passes for 8 yards with an interception on a pass that went off the hands of receiver Bo Melton. Tune was signed to the active roster Wednesday.

""He's a guy that's shown some pretty good promise in terms of what we've seen,"" LaFleur said. ""What an opportunity for him. I think he's started one other game in his career, I want to say. It's going to be a great opportunity, it's going to be great for everybody to see what he can go out there and do.""

McCarthy noted the team ""had a tremendous Wednesday"" as the Vikings ready for their final game Sunday against Green Bay. Though they've already been eliminated from postseason contention, there's a shared desire to win a fifth straight game and end the 2025 campaign on a high note.

""The boys were really coming out today with a level of intent, focus, energy, urgency, and it was really awesome to kind of feel that momentum we've been building over the last few weeks carry into today,"" McCarthy said. ""We've gotta keep doing that. A great divisional rival ahead of us, and it's going to be a lot of fun.""

""It's win-at-all-costs when it gets late in the year,"" McCarthy said. ""Everyone's banged up, and it's that willpower, falling into your … habits and your discipline in those habits. I feel like we did a lot of the things early on that helped us become successful in December, and it's encouraging to see it happen … but we've got to get in the dance, and we've got to make sure we don't end up in this position again — and take care of the [games] we've got to take care of.""

""But you know, the most encouraging thing is seeing them pick me up and understanding the culture, the type of guys we have in that room — it's something special,"" he said. ""So yeah, it's been a tough year, but we learned a lot about each other, a lot about ourselves and me personally.""

"" 'Understand, you know, this is one of the hardest positions in the world, and you're 22 years old,' "" he said when asked what advice he would give for himself at training camp. "" 'It's going to take some time and really just keep taking those punches and keeping … at the end of the day, it's about showing up.""

""With some of the stuff he's been able to do, thinking back to the Dallas game, moving the team in the first half of the Giants game and the Commanders game.

""Credit the players, that's what they've done. And J.J. has been a huge part of that and has continued, you know, looking at starts 7, 8 and 9, and we'd love to get him another one, but obviously only if he's medically cleared and can 100% do his job.""

""But at the end of the day, it's a beautiful picture, beautiful story that I'm really starting to understand the meaning of it and the reasoning behind it,"" McCarthy said. ""And we're not done yet.

The Packers have already secured the No. 7 seed for the playoffs, and LaFleur said he doesn’t plan to play Love unless injuries make it necessary. Love will likely enter the wild-card round having missed the last 10.5 quarters since suffering his first documented NFL concussion midway through the second quarter of a Week 16 game against the Chicago Bears.

The Packers are uncertain who will back up Tune. Malik Willis is nursing a hamstring injury, and the Packers signed Desmond Ridder to the practice squad Wednesday. It’s possible that Love backs up Tune, but the Packers would probably like to avoid the scenario of their starter coming off a head injury being one snap away from playing.

Tune is a 2023 fifth-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals who spent the entire season on Green Bay’s practice squad before stepping in when Willis aggravated his right shoulder injury last Saturday against the Baltimore Ravens. Tune completed 1-of-4 passes for eight yards and an interception on a tipped pass that wide receiver Bo Melton dropped.

Sunday will mark Tune’s second career start, with his first coming in a 27-0 loss to the Cleveland Browns in 2023. Tune completed 11-of-20 passes for 58 yards and two interceptions in that game while running five times for 28 yards and losing a fumble.

“I think there’s a lot to like,” LaFleur said of Tune. “I think he’s got a good handle on the offense, especially for a guy that really wasn’t here through an offseason or training camp. … You can tell he’s a smart guy. He’s got some athleticism in regards to his ability to get out of the pocket.

“I think that that was one of the alluring things about him, is just he is not a statue back there by any stretch. He can make off-schedule plays, and we’re just trying to put him in the best position possible to go and make plays.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/01124839/love-jordan-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-01 14:58:23.451600

Head coach Sean McDermott gave an injury update from the first day of practice. The Bills held a walk-through on Wednesday.

Allen (foot), linebacker Terrel Bernard (calf), defensive end Joey Bosa (hamstring), safety Jordan Poyer (hamstring), defensive tackle DaQuan Jones (calf) and fullback Reggie Gilliam (illness) did not practice.

""He looks like he's moving in the right direction,"" McDermott said of Allen. ""We'll see how it goes this week.""

Allen tweaked his foot during Week 16's game against the Browns. He played on it against the Eagles and McDermott said he is in a better place this week than last.

The HC did not give us an update about starters resting or playing, but McDermott sees value in both sides when it comes to his QB.

""There certainly is,"" McDermott said of if there's value in Allen playing on Sunday. ""There's also value in taking another approach as well so that's what we're going through right now. It all starts with number one is his health. And I could tell you that he's in a better spot according to Nate (Breske) early this week than he was last week.""

Tight ends Dalton Kincaid (knee) and Dawson Knox (knee), cornerback Cam Lewis (hamstring) and defensive tackle Jordan Phillips (ankle) were limited.

""He's in a better spot than the way he ended the week,"" McDermott said of Kincaid. ""We'll take it one day at a time and see where it goes.""

Kincaid missed last week's game against the Eagles due to the knee injury.

Kicker Matt Prater (right quad) was full on Wednesday.

""Anytime you miss a game, it's always tough,"" Prater said. ""Watching the games play out and you're not a part of it, it's tough to watch. But I'm excited to get back out there.""

Prater has missed the last two games with the right quad injury. McDermott said on Monday that Prater is heading in the right direction.

Bills players reflect on their memories at Highmark Stadium

With Buffalo being a Wild Card team in the playoffs, Sunday could be its last time playing in Highmark Stadium. The Bills have called the stadium home for 52 memorable years. They'll move across the street to the new Highmark Stadium for 2026.

The players reflected on what the stadium means to them and how, though they're focused on the task at hand and winning the game, they're going to take a moment to appreciate and soak up everything around them from the locker room to the field to the fans.

""I love football history. There's so much football history that has happened at Highmark, and this stadium means a lot to a lot of people,"" offensive lineman David Edwards said. ""To be a part of that's really special, and I don't take that for granted. Even though I've only been here three years, I really feel like I'm part of this community, part of this history and that means a lot to me and my family.""

""The history of it all – to be a part of that definitely feels surreal,"" wide receiver Gabe Davis said. ""This is a game that we all dreamed about playing, and to be able to beat some of the record books and doing it in that stadium.""

For defensive end Greg Rousseau, he said one of his all-time favorite memories is from 2024 when kicker Tyler Bass kicked the game-winning field goal against Miami with 10 seconds left of the game. The 61-yard kick was a career-best for Bass, gave Buffalo a 30-27 victory and secured the AFC East title that season.

""Just being in the moment, walking through the locker room another time and walking out the tunnel, running out,"" Rousseau said of what he wants to do. ""We've had a lot of crazy wins in there … I can go on for hours about it, but it was real special. Had a lot of fun there.""

Knox said he plans on dedicating a moment on Sunday to take a few deep breaths and take everything in. Whether it's before the game, after the game or even a moment during the game, he wants a mental and emotional snapshot of Highmark Stadium one last time.

""The sentimental value of that stadium, the nostalgia that I'll be feeling, the amount of memories that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. I'm so thankful for that,"" Knox said. ""Even though it's just a location … it's a place that I'll be forever grateful for.""

Long snapper Reid Ferguson is the current longest active Bills player (10 seasons), so he has memories of Highmark Stadium from before the Sean McDermott and Josh Allen era.

""Every game is a blessing and every game is a gift,"" Ferguson said. ""It's a privilege to be able to go out there and wear the Bills uniform – and wear just an NFL uniform in general.""

James Cook can finish the regular season at the top of the league

Running back James Cook has an opportunity to claim the NFL's rushing title in 2025. He currently leads the league in rushing yards with 1,606 yards and Indianapolis Colts' rusher Jonathan Taylor is second with 1,559 yards.

""That's definitely on my mind,"" McDermott said when asked if Cook will play on Sunday. ""That's a heck of an accomplishment if one can accomplish that, or in this case a team or an offense can accomplish that. So, I'm aware of it, we'll see where it goes here.""

Cook being on track to lead the NFL in rushing yards in the regular season is an accomplishment that reflects on the whole offense. McDermott said it takes everyone, not just the offensive line and sole running back, to be at the top. He said it's an honor for the entire offense regardless of the player's position.

Earlier this season, McCarthy missed five games because of a high right ankle sprain and a sixth because of a concussion.","EAGAN, Minn. -- Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy practiced Wednesday for the first time since he was diagnosed with a hairline fracture in his right hand earlier this month.

The team listed him as a limited participant on its practice report and has made no final determination about his availability for Sunday's season finale against the Green Bay Packers.

McCarthy has missed seven games this season because of three separate injuries, most recently the Vikings' 23-10 victory over the Detroit Lions on Christmas Day. But coach Kevin O'Connell said he is eager to get him back on the field for one final outing before the end of the season, hoping to continue the momentum built during a four-game winning streak.

""A ton of stuff during this win streak has been about stacking plays,"" O'Connell said, ""stacking for our team, just positives of complementary football and finding a way to win by any means necessary every single game. And that's credit to players. That's what they've done. And J.J.'s been a huge part of that, really looking at starts seven, eight, nine, and would love to get him another one. But obviously, only if he's medically cleared and can 100 percent do his job.""

O'Connell said the decision on McCarthy's availability will be based on whether he can reliably grip the ball. The Vikings removed him from their Week 16 game at the New York Giants after the ball fell out of his throwing hand on an aborted screen pass, leading to a fumble that safety Tyler Nubin returned for a 27-yard touchdown.

On Wednesday, McCarthy said he ""felt like the ball was spinning"" and added: ""If it's stable, let's ride."" But asked when the pain from the injury subsided enough to resume throwing, McCarthy said that ""was a difficult question to answer.""

McCarthy also wasn't able to pinpoint when the injury occurred.

""It was just a multitude of things,"" he said. ""Things that happened over the year.""

McCarthy had previously suffered what the Vikings called a bruised hand in Week 10. The injury caused him to be a limited participant in one practice but did not force him from any games. A review of the game film showed that McCarthy hit his hand on the helmet of Giants defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris after a throw with two minutes, 57 seconds remaining in the second quarter at MetLife Stadium. McCarthy managed to throw a short completion on the next play and then scrambled 12 yards for a touchdown. He opened the Vikings' next possession by handing off to tailback Aaron Jones, but on second down he dropped the ball as he tried to throw the screen pass.

McCarthy said Wednesday that ""there was a lot of adrenaline"" before the touchdown run but that he felt the hand ""right away when I went to the sideline.""

""That was a great learning lesson for me to handle that situation a lot better in the future,"" he said. ""If I don't feel like I can go or there's any sort of gray, just take it into halftime and regroup from there.""

Jeremiah: What’s changed since Seahawks’ Week 1 loss to 49ers

Here’s a look at each team’s injury report for Wednesday. Both teams will have to make their game status designations by Thursday.

Seahawks injury report

Left tackle Charles Cross (hamstring) and veteran swing tackle Josh Jones (ankle, knee) were both listed as non-participants on Wednesday’s practice report for the second straight day, which further indicates there’s a real possibility the Seahawks could be down to their third-string left tackle on Saturday night.

Cross, who has missed the past two games, has yet to practice since getting injured in the final minute of Seattle’s Week 15 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 14. Jones, who has started at left tackle in place of Cross for the past two games, was a new addition to the injury report this week.

If neither Cross or Jones are available, Seattle’s other options at left tackle include undrafted rookie Amari Kight and rookie guard/tackle Mason Richman. They have a combined three offensive snaps this season.

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald didn’t divulge much about the team’s left tackle situation when speaking to reporters prior to Wednesday afternoon’s practice.

“If Josh can play, he’s gonna play,” Macdonald said. “If Charles gets better and can play, he’ll play. If not, then we’ve got some other guys that can play.”

More info: The latest on Seahawks’ left tackle situation

Meanwhile, wide receiver/kick returner Rashid Shaheed (concussion) was upgraded to a full participant on Wednesday after being listed as limited on Tuesday. That appears to indicate he’s progressing through the NFL’s concussion protocol after sustaining a concussion in Sunday’s win over the Carolina Panthers.

However, safety Coby Bryant (knee) was downgraded to a non-participant on Wednesday after being limited on Tuesday. He’s working his way back after missing Sunday’s game.

Here’s Seattle’s full injury report for Wednesday:

Did not participate

• LT Charles Cross (hamstring)

• OT Josh Jones (ankle, knee)

• S Coby Bryant (knee)

Limited participation

• WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba (non-injury-related/rest)

• TE AJ Barner (elbow, hip)

• RT Abraham Lucas (neck)

• OLB Derick Hall (hand)

• S Ty Okada (oblique, knee)

49ers injury report

The 49ers are also dealing with a major question at left tackle after 12-time Pro Bowler Trent Williams (hamstring) was listed as a non-participant for the second straight day. Williams got hurt in San Francisco’s win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday night.

Meanwhile, star running back Christian McCaffrey (back) and fullback Kyle Juszczyk (hip) were both upgraded to limited on Wednesday after being listed as non-participants on Tuesday.

Seven-time Pro Bowl tight end George Kittle (ankle) also was limited for a second straight day. He returned to practice this week after missing Sunday night’s game.

Defensive end Keion White (groin) sat out practice for a second straight day, while wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle), defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) and cornerback Upton Stout (concussion) were each limited for a second straight day.

According to the Steelers, Watt “was experiencing some discomfort” at the team’s facility on Dec 10 and was later taken to a Pittsburgh-area hospital for an evaluation of his lung.

Watt underwent surgery on Dec 11 and was discharged on Dec 12. He has not played an NFL game since Dec 7 but may play in the January 4 season finale against the Baltimore Ravens, which will decide the NFL’s AFC North Division title.

ESPN reports that dry needling is “a skilled intervention where the provider uses a thin needle to penetrate the skin with the goal of alleviating pain and improving movement. Unlike ‘wet’ needling, which utilizes a hollow bore needle (which has a central channel to allow liquid to pass through it) to inject a medication, dry needling utilizes a solid needle and no substance is injected. Common applications for dry needling include, but aren’t limited to, muscle pain/strains (eg, hamstring, quad), tendinitis/tendinopathy (eg, patellofemoral, biceps, rotator cuff), plantar fasciitis and headaches. Utilization has expanded within the past decade, in particular, and it is not uncommon to see dry needling in most athletic rehabilitation settings or training rooms.“

Instead, 2023's fourth overall pick continues to battle vision problems due to the orbital fracture he sustained earlier in the year, and the Colts will not activate him from injured reserve for the regular-season finale.

Instead, coach Shane Steichen announced Wednesday that Riley Leonard will start in what is now a meaningless Week 18 game for the Colts, who have been eliminated from playoff contention. Seth Henigan, who signed with the Colts' practice squad, has a chance of serving as the backup. If he is not up to speed, Philip Rivers will handle the backup duties.

""Had a conversation in my office yesterday with him,"" Steichen said of Richardson. ""It was great. He's still got the vision limitations. It's just a smart thing. Obviously, you put him out there with vision limitations and something happens, not a good idea. So we won't activate him.""

Richardson sustained his injury in Week 6 when an elastic band in the Colts' locker room snapped and hit him in the face. The backup quarterback experienced severe swelling around the broken orbital bone, though he avoided damage to his eyeball. More than two months later, he still does not have all of his vision back.

With the Colts tumbling all the way out of the postseason picture despite opening the year at 8-2, they have no incentive to rush Richardson back at less than 100% -- even as they lack experienced options behind injured starter Daniel Jones, who tore his Achilles tendon earlier this month.

""It was a freak accident that happened,"" Steichen said. ""I feel for him, because it is a terrible thing that happened. You never want it to happen. You don't know why things happen. But he's been in good spirits, and he's battling like crazy and hopefully everything comes back good.""

The 2025 season goes down as a lost year for a once-promising prospect who just two years ago was a first-round talent. Richardson remains under contract with Indianapolis through 2027, but if Jones returns to full strength in time for next year's opener, there is no clear path to the starting lineup for the Florida product.

It could take a trade for Richardson to get another shot at a starting job in the next two years. His outlook with the Colts is as cloudy as ever. But returning to full health is a bigger priority at this point than determining his long-term role, according to Steichen.

""I think the biggest thing for him is just to make sure that vision comes back fully, and then we go from there,"" Steichen said. ""He's a talented player. Very talented. Can make all the throws and run around and make plays. So really just praying for his health right now.""",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/01/34913bb2-ef09-4379-a291-b67b40f34bda/thumbnail/1200x675/6790d442db98fa233c6d0e5565dcf68c/gettyimages-2235427299-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 04:58:50.627302

Richardson returned to practice Dec. 18, and Wednesday’s walkthrough marked the first time he was listed as a full participant, but he is still managing “vision limitations” in his right eye that stem from his injury, according to Steichen.

Steichen said he and Richardson had a long conversation in his office Tuesday regarding the decision to keep the dual-threat QB inactive. Richardson appeared in just two games this season, completing one of his two passes (surprisingly to himself) for 9 yards.

“If you don’t have a perfect eyesight there, and something happens (and) you don’t see someone and you get hit, I mean, that’s not a good thing,” Steichen said. “So, we just want to be smart with it.”

Richardson suffered an orbital fracture during what Steichen called a “freak accident” in pregame warmups in Week 6. The quarterback was using a band to stretch. However, when he attached the band to a rod in a locker and pulled it, the rod broke and a piece of the rod recoiled with the band, smashing into Richardson’s face at a high rate of speed, league sources told The Athletic. Richardson was taken to a local hospital and discharged later that day. He was subsequently placed on injured reserve and underwent surgery Oct. 20 to fix his fractured orbital bone.

Richardson initially said he didn’t have any “major limitations” with his vision when he returned to practice a few weeks ago. He reemphasized that point Wednesday while offering more details.

“Everything downfield, not gonna be a problem,” Richardson said. “(It’s) more so within the foot radius of my (vision) box that’s more so the toughest part (in my) daily life, but that’s about it.”

Although he’ll end up missing the final 11 games of the season due to his eye injury, Richardson remains optimistic about his NFL future. The 23-year-old was drafted fourth in 2023, making him the Colts’ highest drafted player since Andrew Luck was first in 2012.

“Oh, yeah, no doubt,” Richardson said of his potential. “If I still got a chance to play football, then, s—, it’s always out there for me.”

Richardson said his eyesight continues to improve, and he’s already seen major progress from when the orbital fracture happened. He’s scheduled to have a check-up in January and anticipates that he’ll have a relatively normal offseason of training as he prepares for his fourth year.

That fourth season might not be in Indianapolis, however. Richardson has not become the franchise QB the Colts envisioned, due to injuries, inaccuracy and immaturity. He was benched for two games last year due to what Steichen labeled as a lack of game preparation. He has only appeared in 15 games in three years, going 8-7 as a starter. He’s thrown 11 touchdowns against 13 interceptions, while adding 10 rushing TDs.

Richardson entered the 2025 campaign as the Colts’ backup after losing the starting job to Daniel Jones in training camp. Despite Jones tearing his right Achilles in Week 14, the Colts are expected to retain him in free agency, potentially giving him another season with Steichen and GM Chris Ballard if they are also retained this offseason. Jones, the 2019 No. 6 pick, was released by the New York Giants last year and inked a one-year deal with Indianapolis. He quickly revived his career under Steichen, which has set him up to be the incumbent starter next year, assuming he doesn’t have any setbacks with his Achilles recovery. In that scenario, if Richardson is still on the Colts’ roster, he’d likely be competing with rookie sixth-round pick Riley Leonard for the team’s QB2 role. Before it gets to that point, he and the team may welcome a trade.

Asked if he’s thought about what’s next for him, Richardson said he “always” thinks about his future but that he hasn’t looked too far ahead.

“I always want my life to be better, better than it was before,” Richardson said. “My life improves each and every year. I haven’t necessarily thought about my future here because I don’t see anything wrong right now. Setbacks happen. The injury to my eye kind of happened, so that kind of dictated what happened throughout the season.”

For now, Richardson looks forward to his last couple of practices, especially since he was initially told that he wouldn’t be able to suit up again in any capacity this season. Richardson has been working with the scout team and has enjoyed the controlled competition.

“Some plays, I catch myself out there throwing and fitting it into certain spots that I was doing before, so that definitely feels good,” Richardson said. “But there were a few plays that the defense did get me, and it hit me like, ‘Man, maybe I should’ve did this or that,’ but it’s just football. I’ve been making plays out there, and I’m excited to be back out there for sure.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/15130422/USATSI_27255004-scaled-e1765821882844.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-01 05:57:35.187357

The team released its first injury report of the week on Wednesday evening. The Eagles held a walkthrough on Wednesday, so this report is an estimation:

Did not participate: LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring), TE Dallas Goedert (knee), T Lane Johnson (foot), OLB Jaelan Phillips (ankle)

Limited: LB Jihaad Campbell (back/shoulder)

Full: T Cameron Williams (shoulder)

The Eagles held a walkthrough to start the week but are scheduled to practice on Thursday and Friday.

While the Eagles can’t rest everyone on Sunday, they probably won’t play anyone with an injury. So this is another hint at who won’t be playing against the Commanders.

NFL

Johnson has missed the last six games with a Lisfranc sprain and it wouldn’t make sense to rush him back for a game where the Eagles are resting a bunch of starters. And Dean missed last week with a hamstring injury; it also wouldn’t make sense to rush him back from that soft tissue injury.

Phillips injured his ankle against the Bills in Buffalo and was able to play through the injury to finish the game. He even had a pressure on that final game-sealing 2-point conversion. Phillips, who was traded during the season, has already played 17 games this season because he was traded before the Dolphins’ bye week and after the Eagles’ bye. So he could really use this week off.

And Goedert’s injury presumably happened during the game as well. He has managed to stay pretty healthy this season, playing 15 of 16 possible games. But if he’s nursing an injury, it would be wise to sit him for this one.

Campbell, 21, is a more interesting case. He had to start for Dean on Sunday and the rookie could probably still use the experience. But if he’s banged up, he might not play on Sunday. The Eagles’ other linebackers are Jeremiah Trotter Jr. and Smael Mondon.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/12/Phillips-J-USATSI-27622884.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-01 05:57:37.854373

""We'll see how the week progresses,"" McVay said. ""If he is able to go, it'll be great to be able to get him some snaps before the playoffs end up starting, and if he's not, then we'll hope that the playoffs will represent for sure him being ready to go.""

Meanwhile, the Rams will open the 21-day practice window for safety Quentin Lake (elbow) tomorrow, but he and wide receiver Davante Adams (hamstring) are not expected to play Sunday. Lake hasn't played since Week 11, and Adams since Week 14.

McVay declined to rule either out definitively for Sunday, but said the ""goal"" is for both to play in the Wild Card round of the playoffs the following week.

""It's more of just to make sure that we're able to get him a full workload,"" McVay said of Adams' recovery. ""He's gonna be able to do some different things in a more controlled setting, but just with the position he plays, being able to open up, want to make sure that we're getting everything ready to roll and being smart with him.""

If Shaheed were unable to play, the Seahawks would be looking for players to step up at receiver as well as in the return game.
Asked what he would expect from players taking on bigger roles in that scenario, Macdonald said.
""Some things need to happen before he can play,"" Macdonald.
I know those guys are working like crazy, but we're going into a football Friday (on Thursday), he'll probably have to do something before the game goes.""","After a walkthrough a day earlier, the Seahawks were back to holding a full practice on Wednesday, which from a preparation standpoint, was like a normal Thursday as the Seahawks get ready for Saturday night's game against the 49ers.

And among those taking part in practice, Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said, was receiver and Pro-Bowl returner Rashid Shaheed. Being on the practice field doesn't guarantee anything for Saturday's game for Shaheed, who exited Sunday's win in Carolina with a concussion, but it is at least a sign that he's moving through the concussion protocol.

""To my knowledge he's practicing today,"" Macdonald said. ""In what capacity, I can't tell you, but he should be out there.""

If Shaheed were unable to play, the Seahawks would be looking for players to step up at receiver as well as in the return game.

Asked what he would expect from players taking on bigger roles in that scenario, Macdonald said. ""Come and play great football for us. I feel like we have a really deep receiving room and guys that have made plays in key moments, from training camp all the way until now. That's what we expect. We've got really good players.""

Macdonald also gave a little more clarity on the injury to tackle Josh Jones, who played every snap in Sunday's game, but who was listed as a non-participant on Tuesday's estimated injury report due to knee and ankle injuries. Jones, who has been starting in place on an injured Charles Cross, is ""just banged up a little bit"" Macdonald said, and should be able to play Saturday.

""Some things need to happen before he can play,"" Macdonald. ""I'd say it's a non-zero chance that he plays, but we'll see.""

Cross, who has missed two games with a hamstring injury, was one of two players to miss last week's game along with safety Coby Bryant, who has a knee injury.

Asked if Bryant was improving, Macdonald said, ""Coby's getting better. He's not going to practice today, he did walkthrough. Again, we'll see. I know those guys are working like crazy, but we're going into a football Friday (on Thursday), he'll probably have to do something before the game goes.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/sq2fchwrnukdxnghhbnl,N,,2025-12-31 21:13:06.336812

Fullback Jack Westover, tight end Hunter Henry, guard Jared Wilson, defensive tackles Christian Barmore and Khyiris Tonga, as well as linebackers Harold Landry III and Robert Spillane stayed sidelined on New Year’s Eve in Foxborough.

But three returned to practice. Wide receiver Kayshon Boutte was back in a non-contact jersey after spending last week in the NFL’s concussion protocol, while the 21-day windows opened for offensive tackle Will Campbell and cornerback Alex Austin to be activated from injured reserve.

Here’s the first injury report ahead of Sunday’s 4:25 p.m. ET finale at Gillette Stadium.

Last Sunday’s 42-10 win over the New York Jets did not include Wilson, Tonga, Landry and Spillane. Due to a concussion as well as foot, knee and ankle injuries, respectively, the four starters remained non-participants before being ruled out on the final injury report. The visit to MetLife Stadium saw the team’s fullback depart in the fourth quarter, while at tight end, Henry scored his seventh touchdown of the season and surpassed 700 receiving yards for the first time in his career.

Mike Vrabel shared during Wednesday’s press conference that Barmore, who is facing a domestic assault charge stemming Aug. 8, would miss the team’s in-stadium practice due to an illness. The Patriots head coach added that he hasn’t heard anything from the NFL that would keep the defensive tackle from playing in Week 18. The same status goes for wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who is facing charges of strangulation or suffocation and assault and battery from a Dec. 2 incident. Both legal cases are under review of the league’s personal conduct policy.

Boutte returned to practice as a limited participant after spending Week 17 in the league’s protocol. And across the ball from the wideout, Austin was available in that capacity, as well. A wrist injury had sent the cornerback to injured reserve late last month. He stands with 13 tackles, two starts and one pass deflection on the year and has handled 120 snaps on special teams.

An activation also awaits along the interior defensive line after New England went five contests without Williams due to a high ankle sprain. The four-year, $104 million signing saw his 21-day clock start last week yet remained on IR for the trip to East Rutherford.

Cornerback Trevon Diggs has been claimed off waivers by the Packers a day following his release from the Cowboys, NFL Media reported Wednesday.
The Packers will reportedly be on the hook for Diggs' $472,000 base salary and $58,823 bonus he'd get for being active for Week 18.
A person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press the decision on Diggs wasn't the result of a specific incident.
Diggs eventually returned to the Cowboys' lineup in Week 16, but he's largely struggled this season.","The Green Bay Packers are adding another former standout from the Dallas Cowboys' defense.

Cornerback Trevon Diggs has been claimed off waivers by the Packers a day following his release from the Cowboys, NFL Media reported Wednesday. The Packers will reportedly be on the hook for Diggs' $472,000 base salary and $58,823 bonus he'd get for being active for Week 18.

Green Bay's decision to add Diggs comes four months after it traded for Micah Parsons from Dallas, a move that helped the Packers have one of the league's top defenses this season. However, Parsons tore his ACL earlier in December, and the Packers have seen a handful of other key players go down with injuries in recent weeks ahead of the postseason. In the secondary, the Packers placed cornerback Kamal Hadden on injured reserve on Tuesday, while cornerback Nate Hobbs and safety Zayne Anderson are reportedly likely to miss the rest of the season.

The Packers enter Week 18 with a 9-6-1 record and are locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC for a third straight year. They were ahead in the NFC North race for much of the season, but their Week 16 loss to the Chicago Bears put a dagger in their hopes to win the division.

Still, as quarterback Jordan Love seeks to make a return soon from the concussion that knocked him out of that Week 16 loss, the Packers remain hopeful about making a deep postseason run. They rank second in total defense among the NFC playoff contenders, and the addition of Diggs could help further bolster their defense.

Rumors of the Cowboys potentially moving on from Diggs grew in recent weeks as he spent nearly two months on injured reserve. Diggs missed eight games after sustaining a concussion in an accident at home, something Diggs waited two months to try to explain to reporters. He said he was hit in the head by a mounting pole while trying to install a TV. The team said Diggs' delayed return was more about issues with the 27-year-old's knees.

Asked during the absence what the team needed to see from Diggs to get him back on the field, head coach Brian Schottenheimer said the sixth-year player needed to show consistency in many areas in practice and in meetings. Owner Jerry Jones flatly said near the end of the absence that Diggs wasn't healthy enough to play.

A person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press the decision on Diggs wasn't the result of a specific incident.

Diggs' departure was a culmination of factors, including performance and off-field issues, and the move was best for Diggs and the Cowboys, the person said on condition of anonymity because the team wasn't commenting specifically on Diggs.

The Cowboys withheld a workout bonus in Diggs' contract after he spent last offseason rehabbing his latest knee injury with his own medical personnel. He was also benched by Schottenheimer early in the season for reasons the coach never fully explained.

Diggs eventually returned to the Cowboys' lineup in Week 16, but he's largely struggled this season. Opposing quarterbacks have posted a perfect passer rating (158.3) when they've targeted receivers Diggs has covered this season, as the cornerback has allowed three touchdowns in eight games, per Pro Football Focus.

Diggs briefly emerged as one of the best cornerbacks in football not long after the Cowboys selected him in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. That helped him get a five-year, $97 million extension ahead of the 2023 season. However, the two-time Pro Bowler has only played 21 games since then, tearing his ACL in the 2023 season and undergoing an operation to repair the same knee in 2024.

Defensive lineman Brandon Dorlus has a hamstring injury.
Obviously, going to miss this game, but we do feel really good about what happened, as opposed to what everybody thought.""
Dorlus went down with what was originally thought to be a knee injury.
Only Tennessee's Jeffrey Simmons has more sacks than Dorlus among defensive tackles in the league.","FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — The Atlanta Falcons got some good news as 2025 comes to a close. Defensive lineman Brandon Dorlus has a hamstring injury. He will miss time, according to head coach Raheem Morris, but nothing close to what was originally feared when he was injured on Monday night against the Los Angeles Rams just a few plays after notching his 8.5 sack of the year.

""We dodged a big-time bullet,"" Morris said. ""We feel pretty good about the injury. He's going to miss a couple of weeks. Obviously, going to miss this game, but we do feel really good about what happened, as opposed to what everybody thought.""

Dorlus went down with what was originally thought to be a knee injury. He was helped off the field by trainers as he struggled to put pressure on his left side. After being evaluated on the sideline, an emotional Dorlus was carted to the locker room.

After more imaging and evaluations, though, it was determined that Dorlus suffered a hamstring injury and that there was no ligament damage in his knee.

Though the Falcons will finish the 2025 season without Dorlus, this isn't an issue that should linger for the second-year defensive lineman tied for the team lead in sacks; not at all like a knee injury that requires surgery would.

One would be hard pressed to find an interior lineman who had as big of a jump from Year 1 to Year 2 as Dorlus did with the Falcons. After only seeing action in two games in 2024, Dorlus became not only someone this Falcons defense could rely on in a rotation but depend on to make a big play. Only Tennessee's Jeffrey Simmons has more sacks than Dorlus among defensive tackles in the league. Along with his 8.5 sacks on the year, Dorlus also notched 11 quarterback hits and tackles for a loss.

In other injury news, the Falcons will continue to be without starting cornerback Mike Hughes, too. Hughes has missed the last two games for Atlanta. Rookie undrafted free agent Cobee Bryant filled in for Hughes when he went out against Tampa Bay and he got the start the next week against Arizona. He split time that game with C.J. Henderson, who started Monday night's game opposite A.J.

While the Lions don’t plan to rest any of their veterans to get a look at younger players, coach Dan Campbell acknowledged that he will consider shutting down players who have been dealing with season-long injuries or who could risk further injury by playing. In those situations, they will put their next best player on the field to try to win the game. Furthermore, Campbell noted that there’s a difference between players who are injured and players who are just working through the aches and pains of the regular season—the latter of which he expects them to play.

At the end of the day, while logical, this approach complicates our ability to analyze an already messy injury list properly. As always, we’ll do our best to decipher the daily injury reports, but don’t be surprised if there are a few unexpected outcomes this week.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

TE Brock Wright (neck, IR)

OT Giovanni Manu (knee, IR) — Evaluation clock started

LB Zach Cunningham (hamstring, IR)

With neither Wright nor Cunningham returning to practice this week, it looks like their season could be over.

No practice

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee/ankle) — reaggravated in Week 17

RT Penei Sewell (ankle) — reaggravated in Week 17

LG Christian Mahogany (illness) — New ailment

OL Kayode Awosika (illness) — New ailment

IOL Trystan Colon (wrist)

DT Alim McNeill (abdomen) — reaggravated injury in Week 17

LB Alex Anzalone (concussion) — injured in Week 17

SAF Thomas Harper (concussion) — injured in Week 17

St. Brown appeared to be bothered by his existing knee injury in Week 17 and is considered “day-to-day” by coach Dan Campbell. While his availability is still in question for this weekend, Campbell noted that St. Brown “wants to go” and his injury is not long-term, which means there’s a chance he can play against Chicago.

Sewell appeared to aggravate his ankle injury in Week 17, but he managed to play through it. It’s possible that he missed this practice because it was a maintenance day, or it could be a sign that he made it worse. We’ll likely find out more in the coming days.

Mahogany and Awosika have been on the injury report for lower-body injuries in recent weeks, but it looks like they’ve put those injuries behind them. However, they are the latest players to deal with an illness that has been making its way through the locker room.

Colon has been dealing with a wrist injury for a few weeks now, and while it’s limited him at separate times, he’s also shown he’s been able to play through it.

McNeill appeared to aggravate his abdominal injury early in Week 17 and was forced from the game. Like with most players on the report this week, his status is very much up in the air.

Anzalone and Harper were both concussed in Week 17 and are currently in the NFL’s concussion protocol. It’s a wait-and-see approach for both defensive starters.

Limited practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness) — upgraded from no practice

OT Giovanni Manu (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 7

DB Avonte Maddox (back/illness) — upgraded from no practice

Decker hasn’t quite put his illness behind him, and his season-long shoulder injury is still keeping him on the injury report.

“The plan is to get Decker going,” Campbell said on Wednesday. “He wants to play. I mean, he wanted to play last week, but he looked like he was about six inches from the grave. It was unfortunate. But barring anything this week, he’ll be ready to go.”

Manu continues to work his way through the injury evaluation window. While there is no guarantee he is activated for the Lions’ final game, with the other injuries on the offensive line, they may need him for depth purposes.

Maddox missed last week’s game, but a return to practice is a good sign that he may be able to play against Chicago. With Harper’s status up in the air, the Lions would benefit from Maddox’s return to help stabilize a safety position that has been decimated by injury.

No longer on the injury report

RB David Montgomery (illness)

WR Tom Kennedy (abdomen)

C Graham Glasgow (knee)

EDGE Al-Quadin Muhammad (knee)

EDGE Marcus Davenport (shoulder)

CB Amik Robertson (hand)

CB Khalil Dorsey (illness)

The players in this section no longer have an ailment significant enough to keep them on the injury report.

After missing Week 16, Glasgow was healthy enough to be active in Week 17 but only enough to contribute in a reserve role. Now, with even more time to heal, Glasgow is “feeling a lot better,” according to Campbell, and is expected to return to his starting center role this Sunday.

Robertson has been dealing with a hand injury for nearly a month now, and his play has been limited, with him requiring a club on his hand to play. With him no longer needed to be listed on the injury report, it will be interesting to see if his role increases in Week 18.

Driscoll, who was signed to the Steelers practice squad on Oct. 29, was elevated from the practice squad for the Week 15 game against the Miami Dolphins, Week 16 game against the Detroit Lions and Week 17 game against the Cleveland Browns.
Bell also spent time on the Philadelphia Eagles practice squad this year.
Also on the injury front, the Steelers could be getting several players back this week.","The Steelers began their preparation for Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens, practicing at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.

It's a game with everything on the line, as the winner takes it all in the AFC North.

And Coach Mike Tomlin is ready for it.

""Welcome to AFC North Championship Week,"" said Tomlin opening his weekly press conference on Tuesday.

In a week with everything on the line, you want every healthy body available to you.

One player who could be available is linebacker T.J. Watt. Watt was limited in practice on Wednesday.

Watt has slowly been working his way back from his health issue with his lung, and Tomlin said he is 'more optimistic' than he has been about Watt's availability.

""Optimistic about his potential inclusion in this game,"" said Tomlin. ""We'll work him up throughout the course of the week and let the amount of participation, the quality of participation, be our guide in terms of whether or not he's a participant.

""But certainly, I am more optimistic this week than I have been in previous weeks.""

Tomlin said they have proceeded with caution regarding Watt's return as he is coming off a medical issue.

""He's coming off of a medical circumstance, different than the injury circumstance,"" said Tomlin. ""And so, certainly he has a certain level of health.

""But we want to be cautious about how we work him back into the fold. And certainly, he's done the appropriate things in that area as well.""

Watt was limited in practice last week and Tomlin said his participation this week will have an impact on his availability, and he will utilize him however possible.

""Practice participation certainly would be more comforting in terms of making a decision given he's coming back from a medical circumstance,"" said Tomlin. ""I'm open to utilizing him in any way that's appropriate relative to his availability.""

Tomlin said he liked what he saw from Watt last week in practice.

""I thought he looked great,"" said Tomlin. ""I know he was glad to be out there with his teammates. I think that's a component of it that we don't talk often enough about when someone is injured or out. The isolation component of it.

""We're a communal group. This is a team sport definitively, and so more than anything, I thought he displayed an excitement that comes with being back out there with his teammates.""

While Watt has missed the last three games, Tomlin isn't concerned about him being in football shape when he does put the uniform back on.

""I doubt that T.J. is ever out of football shape or conditioning over the course of a 12 month calendar,"" said Tomlin. ""I know how he lives his life and how he prepares. How thoughtful he is in terms of what he puts in his body and how he trains.

""And so, I don't imagine that component being a major concern.""

While they could get Watt back, the team will be missing a key component on offense.

Tight end Darnell Washington, a weapon in the passing and running game as a blocker, and a key part of the Steelers version of the 'tush push,' was placed on the Reserve/Injured List on Wednesday after having surgery on his arm.

Washington brings a unique skillset, and size, to the offense, but Tomlin is comfortable with who they have to step in.

""We use a lot of tight ends,"" said Tomlin. ""We also use guys at the tight end position that don't play tight end, Spencer Anderson.

""So, we have a lot of options at our disposal relative to that from a strategy perspective. Certainly, given six or seven days to prepare, I don't think it would be a strategic issue in terms of replacing his efforts.""

As part of the move with placing Washington on IR, the team signed Jack Driscoll to the 53-man roster from the practice squad. Driscoll, who was signed to the Steelers practice squad on Oct. 29, was elevated from the practice squad for the Week 15 game against the Miami Dolphins, Week 16 game against the Detroit Lions and Week 17 game against the Cleveland Browns.

Driscoll was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the 2020 NFL Draft.

He spent five seasons with the Eagles, appearing in 67 games, starting 18.

The team also signed tight end Jaheim Bell to the practice squad.

Bell was drafted by the New England Patriots in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL Draft out of Florida. He appeared in 15 games for the Patriots, with two receptions for 20 yards.

Bell also spent time on the Philadelphia Eagles practice squad this year.

Also on the injury front, the Steelers could be getting several players back this week.

""Thankfully, all other guys I'm about to mention have some level of optimism in terms of their availability,"" said Tomlin. ""Calvin Austin missed the last game with a hamstring, definitively has a chance. Brandin Echols, same thing with his groin. James Pierre, same thing with his calf. Isaac Seumalo, same thing with his triceps injury.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/w5u6v30xcbqoixcxu9xx,N,,2025-12-31 17:00:27.804861

Coming off a record-setting, back-and-forth win and facing another short week, Shanahan addressed injury updates, roster confidence, and the team's mindset heading into a high-stakes Week 18 matchup.

Here are the top takeaways from Shanahan following Sunday's win:

Injury Report

Shanahan opened with a cautious injury update as the team balances recovery with preparation following the Sunday night win.

Defensive lineman Keion White (groin), tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), fullback Kyle Juszczyk (hip), and running back Christian McCaffrey (back) did not practice on Wednesday. Shanahan emphasized McCaffrey's absence was precautionary, describing the issue as stiffness rather than a new injury.

""It's just stiff,"" Shanahan said. ""It was sore from Sunday night, so that's why we've got him on here today.""

Several players were limited, including cornerback Upton Stout (concussion protocol), tight end George Kittle (ankle), wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle), and defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (knee). Shanahan confirmed cornerback Renardo Green is fully healthy and listed as a full participant.

With another short week, Shanahan cautioned against overinterpreting Wednesday's practice participation.

""We're barely moving today,"" he said. ""It's a walkthrough with the short week that we've got.""

Confidence in Pleasants

With Williams sidelined, Shanahan expressed confidence in offensive lineman Austen Pleasants, who stepped in during Sunday night's win and helped stabilize the offensive line during a game that had multiple momentum swings.

""Played good enough for us to win,"" Shanahan said. ""Real good in the run and pass game. He did a solid job.""

After reviewing the film, Shanahan highlighted that Pleasants' reliable performance, especially in primetime, spoke for itself.

""That's usually how it is for an O-Lineman. If you don't say their name much in a game, usually it's alright,"" Shanahan said. ""And when you matched it up with the tape, I thought he did a real good job… He really held his own.""

He also credited Pleasants' weekly Wednesday first-team reps while Williams takes his regular Vet Day, noting those opportunities have been crucial in preparing him for moments like Sunday night.

""That's why he was ready for that moment,"" Shanahan said. ""And I think he'll be even more ready this week.""

McCaffrey Sets the Standard

Coming off a historic night in which running back Christian McCaffrey set the franchise record for receptions by a running back, Shanahan acknowledged the toll December football can take, while also sharing that elite players typically elevate as the season goes on.

""Christian's pretty good every time I feel like he's in our uniform,"" Shanahan said. ""But good ones only get better as the year goes.""

Against the Bears, McCaffrey finished with 181 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown, remaining the league leader with 2,069 scrimmage yards as the postseason approaches.

Purdy Fuels Late-Season Momentum

Shanahan praised quarterback Brock Purdy's composure, highlighting his response after an early mistake as a true estimate to his demeanor.

""I just want him to keep being him,"" Shanahan said. ""Not hesitating on stuff. When he sees it, let it rip. I loved how he's been playing.""

Purdy threw for over 300 yards and led the game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter with a 38-yard touchdown to wide receiver Jauan Jennings.

""He didn't change at all,"" Shanahan said. ""Personality-wise, demeanor-wise… When he's confident and he sees it he lets it rip. If he doesn't, he gets rid of it, usually to a check down or he finds a way to make a play. So, keep being him and keep being aggressive.""

Defensive Depth Continuing

Shanahan highlighted the impact of improved depth along the defensive line, particularly with Gross-Matos back in the rotation as the season winds down.

""Just having nine guys, we can rotate better,"" Shanahan said. ""Having Ye out there, his talent, the way he plays, the numbers, it helps a lot.""

Shanahan also praised rookie defensive lineman Alfred Collins, highlighting his persistence after missing OTAs while working back from injury. Collins' ability to stay available throughout the season has been a key part of his development.

""He battled through that and got his stamina back up and was able to avoid an injury doing it. And to me that's what prepared him for the season and that's why he's been able to get through 17 weeks. I've been really happy with Alf so far,"" Shanahan said.

Week 1 Rematch for the Divisional Crown

Looking ahead, Shanahan said the team will revisit the Week 1 matchup against Seattle while accounting for subtle changes as both teams prepare to close the regular season.

""You always look at it,"" Shanahan said. ""But our teams are pretty similar from the beginning of the year to now.""

Shanahan discussed the challenge of defending Seahawks wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, praising his awareness within coverage.

""He almost plays in slow motion,"" Shanahan said, ""But he's one of the fastest guys out there.""

All In on the Regular-Season Finale

Despite already clinching a playoff spot, Shanahan made it clear there is no balancing act with postseason positioning at stake.

""Everyone's goal is to win a Super Bowl and in order to do that I would say it's easier to win three games than four games. You'd always rather play at home, no doubt about it… That's our goal. If that doesn't work out, we're excited to go on the road too.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/49ers/rgdmf7kkci6zmyavcklz,N,,2025-12-31 17:00:42.895288

On Wednesday, coach Jonathan Gannon ruled the Cardinals wide receiver out of Arizona's season finale against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday because of a left foot injury Harrison suffered in Sunday's loss at the Cincinnati Bengals.

Harrison had been dealing with a right heel injury that he suffered in Week 13 at Tampa Bay.

Harrison's season ends with 41 catches for 608 yards and four touchdowns.

Injuries defined Harrison's season. He played in just 12 games, missing two because of appendicitis surgery, two because of his heel and Sunday because of his foot.

""I thought he did some good things,"" Gannon said of Harrison. ""We moved him around the formation. He scored points for us. He got open, caught it. I don't think he has hit his ceiling and look forward to the future with that.""

Gannon didn't want to get into what it would take for Harrison to hit his ceiling.

""We'll talk about that later,"" Gannon said. ""I'm not in the mental space right now thinking about development of players as we move forward. I'm trying to stay focused on today in the Rams.""

“Chris Tanev’s gonna miss some time, significant time,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said Wednesday.
Berube said the 36-year-old suffered a groin injury in the third period of a Sunday night overtime loss in Detroit.
Still, the team did get a glimmer of hope with injured goaltender Anthony Stolarz on Wednesday morning.
While they’ve lost Tanev for an extended period, the Leafs may have fellow righty, Brandon Carlo, back soon.","TORONTO — The Maple Leafs updated the status of injured defenceman Chris Tanev, and it’s not good.

“Chris Tanev’s gonna miss some time, significant time,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said Wednesday.

Berube said the 36-year-old suffered a groin injury in the third period of a Sunday night overtime loss in Detroit. “Kind of a freak thing more than anything,” the coach said. “It’s one of those things that happens. It’s unfortunate for him. You feel for him, what he’s gone through this year.”

Tanev — who has played in only 11 games all season — has already had two separate (but related) injury-related absences, totalling 28 games.

The game he played on Sunday was only his third back in the lineup following an absence that began on Nov. 1.

“It’s tough,” Berube said. “He wants to be out there helping the team. It’s been hard on him.”

The Leafs are still determining a plan of care for Tanev.

Still, the team did get a glimmer of hope with injured goaltender Anthony Stolarz on Wednesday morning. Stolarz, 31, skated for the first time since he suffered an undisclosed injury in Boston more than seven weeks ago.

However, there remains no timetable for Stolarz’s return to the net.

The crease will continue to be manned for the foreseeable future by Joseph Woll and Dennis Hildeby.

Dakota Joshua, meanwhile, will remain in Detroit with family until the New Year before heading back to Toronto. Joshua suffered an internal injury to his kidney in Sunday’s game against the Red Wings and had to remain there in the aftermath.

He was doing “better,” according to Berube. “But again, he’s (going to miss) significant time.”

The injury news didn’t end there: Auston Matthews took part in an optional practice Wednesday morning and could be available to play on Thursday night against the Winnipeg Jets.

Matthews is expected to take part in the morning skate before a determination on his status is made.

“Hopefully he’s in there tomorrow,” Berube said.

The Leafs captain missed his team’s Tuesday night win over the New Jersey Devils with a foot injury.

Also sidelined for the game was the team’s leading scorer, William Nylander. Unlike Matthews, Nylander didn’t skate on Wednesday. He didn’t skate on Tuesday either and looks to be in jeopardy of missing a third straight game.

While they’ve lost Tanev for an extended period, the Leafs may have fellow righty, Brandon Carlo, back soon. Carlo continues to skate with the team and might be available to return Saturday in New York from a foot injury that’s kept him out since the middle of November.

“He’s close,” Berube said.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/31124439/GettyImages-2210609711-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-31 17:00:46.458873

The 49ers also hope to get tight end George Kittle back from injury, although there are other injury concerns.
Seattle is a bit banged up defensively, although that unit rebounded at Carolina by holding the Panthers to 139 yards last week with two turnovers.","Sam Darnold answered some of his critics in Week 16 with his late heroics against the Rams, which helped flip the divisional hierarchy and set up this winner-take-all game in Santa Clara. But in last week's win at Carolina, Darnold also lost a fumble, threw an interception and was lucky to have not had multiple other passes picked. The Seahawks have lived dangerously with their 28 turnovers this season, and Darnold has been responsible for 20 of those (14 INTs, six fumbles lost), with more turnovers (10) than touchdowns accounted for (eight) since Week 11. He's also been at the wheel of 27 victories the past two seasons, so Darnold is doing something right. If he can harness his playmaking ability while limiting turnovers, the Seahawks could be in great shape. The 49ers' pass rush has struggled, with only 18 sacks -- eight fewer than the next-lowest team. That could mean intermediate targets for the Seahawks' talented tight ends and deep shots for wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, especially off play action from the Seahawks' run game, although the status of WR Rashid Shaheed (concussion) is unclear.

There have been few hotter quarterbacks down the stretch than the 49ers' Brock Purdy, who has accounted for five TDs in each of his past two games, leading the team to 48- and 42-point outings. The Seahawks, on the flip side, are the second-best scoring defense in the NFL at 18.1 PPG allowed, with only two opponents able to top the 24-point mark against them this season. Purdy has leaned heavily on Christian McCaffrey down the stretch, as the All-Pro back is leading the team in rushing and receiving. The 49ers also hope to get tight end George Kittle back from injury, although there are other injury concerns. McCaffrey (back) missed practice this week, as did full back Kyle Juszczyk, and left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) could miss this game and could be rested for the playoffs, which would be a big loss in such a meaningful game.

Quarterback Josh Allen’s health is among them. To that end, McDermott told reporters that Allen will not participate in Buffalo’s walk-through practice on Wednesday as he continues to deal with a foot injury.

But Allen is on the mend and is expected to be available.

“It looks like he is moving in the right direction,” McDermott said, via Katherine Fitzgerald of The Buffalo News.

McDermott added that Allen’s right foot is in a better spot than it was at this time last week.

Allen appeared to be hampered by the injury during Sunday’s loss to the Eagles. He finished the game 23-of-35 passing for 262 yards while rushing for 27 yards with two touchdowns. He also had two fumbles and was sacked five times.

Allen has not thrown a touchdown pass in the last two weeks.

That's especially true in a season like 2025, where it seems like there are no truly dominant teams and it feels like Super Bowl LX could be anyone's. So teams don't want the biggest problem on their roster rearing its ugly head in the most important games.

Below, I looked at weak spots for each of the 12 clinched playoff teams, plus both possible winners of the AFC North (Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens) and NFC South (Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers). Some of these stats are particularly concerning because of which squads these teams might face in the postseason. Others are less of a dilemma because prospective opponents are not strong in these particular areas.

Let's start with the Seattle Seahawks and go in order of Super Bowl chances via ESPN's Football Power Index (FPI).

Jump to:

49ers | Bears | Bills | Broncos

Bucs | Chargers | Eagles | Jaguars

Packers | Panthers | Patriots | Rams

Ravens | Seahawks | Steelers | Texans

Seattle Seahawks

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 13.4%

Concerning weakness: Covering tight ends

The Seahawks have the best defense in the league, according to DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average), and they rank fourth by FPI. So there's not a lot going wrong for that unit. But they do have a clear weakness in covering tight ends.

Once we adjust for the quality of the tight ends Seattle has faced, it ranks 29th in allowing 67 yards per game to the position. Obviously, that's a problem when the Seahawks' main rival is the Rams, who run 13 personnel (three tight ends) all the time. The Rams' tight ends combined for seven catches, 88 yards and a touchdown in Week 16 at Seattle.

Safety Nick Emmanwori has been highly regarded in his rookie season, but his coverage numbers against tight ends are not impressive. And the Seahawks might have to get through top tight ends such as the 49ers' George Kittle and the Eagles' Dallas Goedert if they want to make it to the Super Bowl.

Denver Broncos

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 12.1%

Concerning weakness: Defending slot receivers

Denver also has one of the NFL's best defenses this season, led by a vicious pass rush that leads the league in sacks (64). However, if opponents can get a pass off, they can take advantage of the Broncos' slot cornerbacks, Ja'Quan McMillian and Jahdae Barron.

Denver ranks only 27th in DVOA against passes to slot receivers, allowing 7.6 yards per attempt. The good news for the Broncos is that only two AFC playoff teams rank in the top 10 in the number of pass attempts to slot receivers this season: the Chargers and themselves.

Los Angeles Rams

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 11.4%

Concerning weakness: Short-yardage run defense

The Rams' run defense is interesting when it comes to the gains it does and does not allow. Ahead of their Week 17 Monday night loss, the Rams ranked third with 1.0 second-level yards allowed per carry, which is defined as gains that come between 5 and 10 yards after the line of scrimmage. They allow an NFL-best 0.3 open-field yards per carry, which is defined as gains that come 11 or more yards after the line of scrimmage. Preventing long runs is where the Rams shine.

Up front, however, Los Angeles has stuffed opposing running backs for a loss or no gain on only 12.2% of runs. Only Cincinnati is worse. That really becomes a problem when the opponent needs only a yard or two to move the chains or score. The Rams have allowed a conversion on 74% of short-yardage runs -- defined as third down, fourth down or the goal line with 1 to 2 yards to go (that ranks 26th).

It's not a good weakness to have against this playoff field. Most of the Rams' possible playoff opponents have converted short-yardage runs over 70% of the time this season, including Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Carolina and Tampa Bay.

San Francisco 49ers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 10.5%

Concerning weakness: Lack of a pass rush

The 49ers have been hit by a ton of injuries. Most of the affected offensive players have returned to the lineup, unlike with the defense.

Among the players out for the season are edge rushers Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams, who both sustained torn ACLs. As a result, the 49ers have had almost no pass rush this season. They rank 29th in pass rush win rate (30%) and last in pressure rate (25%). As a result, the Niners are 25th in pass defense DVOA when they do not blitz. (They're 17th when they do blitz.)

Playing defense without much pass pressure puts more demand on quarterback Brock Purdy and the 49ers' offense to excel. So far, they've been able to do that.

Philadelphia Eagles

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 8.5%

Concerning weakness: Quarterback Jalen Hurts facing a blitz

For a long time, this would have been an easy choice to highlight Hurts' struggles against zone coverage. However, he has played better against zone in recent weeks. For the season, Hurts ranks 16th in DVOA against zone, which compares favorably with his rank of 13th against man coverage.

Instead, we should look at how Hurts has had trouble with extra pass rushers. He is 20th in DVOA against the blitz this season -- down to 30th if we look only at games since Week 10, with just 6.0 net yards per play. I'm not sure opponents have gotten the message here. Hurts has faced a 36% blitz rate this season, third in the NFL behind the Ravens' Lamar Jackson and the Commanders' Marcus Mariota. However, that rate has actually gone down to 28% since Week 10.

Most of the NFC playoff field is not particularly blitz-heavy, with the Buccaneers as the clear exception. But teams such as the Seahawks and Bears might blitz more if they know that's a weakness for Philadelphia.

New England Patriots

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 6.4%

Concerning weakness: Quarterback Drake Maye after his first read

Of course, Maye is a leading MVP candidate, and it is hard to find holes in his game -- but there is one. FTN Data tracks whether quarterbacks throw to their first read. On first-read throws, Maye ranks fifth in DVOA. However, if he has to go to a later read, Maye drops to 22nd.

The problem is getting him off his first read. Maye is one of the league's best quarterbacks against the blitz, and among quarterbacks who have played the full season, only Philly's Jalen Hurts and Seattle's Sam Darnold were knocked off their first read less often.

Among AFC playoff qualifiers, there are two teams that are above average at getting the opposing quarterback off his first read: the Steelers and the Jaguars. And while the Broncos are only average at forcing second reads, they have the best defensive DVOA when they do.

Green Bay Packers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 6.2%

Concerning weakness: Defending the pass on later downs

The Packers' pass defense has been outstanding on first down. It ranks third in DVOA and allows an NFL-low 5.1 net yards per dropback. The problem comes on later downs. On second, third and fourth downs, the Packers rank 26th in defensive DVOA and allow 5.9 net yards per dropback. It has been particularly bad since edge rusher Micah Parsons went down with a torn ACL, as the Packers have allowed 8.3 net yards per dropback on second through fourth downs in their past three games.

This is going to be a problem in the playoffs. On second down, three of the four best passing teams in the league are the Rams, Seahawks and 49ers. And the league's best passing teams on third down include the 49ers and Eagles.

Buffalo Bills

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 5.9%

Concerning weakness: Run defense

It's pretty clear that to beat the Bills, you must run on them. Buffalo's undersized defense ranks 31st in run defense DVOA. Is there a particular type of run that works best? No -- they all work.

Against runs marked by FTN Data as man blocking (iso, duo, power), the Bills allow a league-worst 5.8 yards per carry and are 29th in DVOA. Against runs marked as zone blocking, the Bills are better in yards per carry (4.9, which ranks 29th) but worse in DVOA (31st).

The good news for the Bills is that the run-heavy Colts missed the playoffs, and they handled the Steelers' running game in Week 13. But the Ravens would be a terrible matchup for them.

Houston Texans

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 5.8%

Concerning weakness: Offensive line

This one is very clear. Their offensive line ranks 30th in pass block win rate (55.4%) and 32nd in run block win rate (68.3%). And things have not improved over the course of the season. Since Week 10, the Texans are 31st in pass block win rate (54.2%), and they slightly improved to 30th in run block win rate (68.7%).

In addition, left tackle Aireontae Ersery and left guard Tytus Howard are among the most penalized players in the league. It's going to be an issue in the postseason against fierce pass rushes like those of the Broncos and possibly the Steelers, who each rank in the top five for pass rush win rate.

Jacksonville Jaguars

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 5.3%

Concerning weakness: Stagnating run game

The Jaguars are red-hot right now with a seven-game winning streak. Their passing game has been on fire since they acquired wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. And quarterback Trevor Lawrence is playing at the top of his game. The Jaguars ranked 21st in pass offense DVOA through Week 9, but since Week 10, they rank fifth.

However, the run game has completely slowed down. Jacksonville ranked sixth in DVOA through Week 9, but that dropped to 26th since Week 10. Not including scrambles, the Jaguars have dropped from 4.5 yards per carry to 3.7 yards per carry since Week 10. Speedy rookie Bhayshul Tuten should return from a finger injury by the playoffs, but Jacksonville really needs better blocking to stay on schedule when it runs the ball.

The Jaguars will need to produce on the ground against defenses like those of the Chargers and Bills, which are better against the pass than the run.

Los Angeles Chargers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 4.7%

Concerning weakness: Covering tight ends

The Chargers rank just 27th in DVOA against tight ends, and this has not improved in recent weeks. Opposing tight ends have a 77% catch rate against the Chargers since Week 9. The Chiefs' Travis Kelce and Eagles' Dallas Goedert each had 70-yard games against Los Angeles in recent weeks.

The problem is not the great safety Derwin James Jr. but rather when the Chargers end up with a linebacker in coverage. They'll need to avoid that when covering possible playoff opponents such as Broncos' Evan Engram, Patriots' Hunter Henry and Bills' Dalton Kincaid.

Baltimore Ravens

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 4.3%

Concerning weakness: Passing in the red zone

The Ravens have been awful this season when the field is condensed and there's less room to work with. Quarterback Lamar Jackson has been particularly bad, ranking last in both passing DVOA and EPA per dropback inside the 20-yard line.

With the injuries he has dealt with in 2025, Jackson hasn't had the mobility to do the magical things outside the pocket that have always given him an advantage in the red zone. And the Ravens don't exactly make up for it with a great running game, as they are only 19th in rush DVOA in the red zone.

The good news for Baltimore is that this season's best defenses in the red zone are primarily teams from the NFC playoff field. Denver (third) is a clear exception, but no other AFC team is in the top 10.

Chicago Bears

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 3.4%

Concerning weakness: Defending slot receivers

The Chicago defense has not been as strong as the Denver defense overall, but the Bears have the same weakness: defending against opposing slot receivers. Only the Jets allowed a worse DVOA to opposing slot receivers, and no other team has allowed more yards per attempt (9.1) or total touchdowns (13) than Chicago.

However, according to my coverage DVOA metric, the issue is not the main slot defender, C.J. Gardner-Johnson, who joined the team in Week 9. The problem is when opponents can get their slot receivers onto other defenders -- primarily cornerback Nick McCloud, safety Jaquan Brisker and linebacker Tremaine Edmunds.

Most of Chicago's prospective playoff opponents rank quite low in how often they throw to slot receivers, although Tampa Bay is an exception.

Pittsburgh Steelers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 1.2%

Concerning weakness: Dependence on short passes

At age 42, quarterback Aaron Rodgers does not have the arm he once had, and the Steelers' passing game is designed around getting the ball out fast. Rodgers has an average depth of target of just 6.1 yards, tied with the Browns' Dillon Gabriel for the shortest in the league this season. Rodgers has thrown 86% of his passes at 15 air yards or shorter, second behind Gabriel in this case.

Why does this matter? First, the Steelers haven't been particularly efficient in this short passing game. Rodgers' DVOA on these passes is slightly below the NFL average. Second, most of the AFC playoff field is very strong against short passes. The top 10 defenses against short passes include Houston, Jacksonville and Buffalo. The Broncos and Chargers are also above average.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 0.6%

Concerning weakness: Defense has fallen apart

We don't need to focus on a single down, type of coverage or even an aspect of the Tampa Bay defense. The whole thing has fallen apart over the past few weeks.

Through Week 8, the Bucs' defensive DVOA was eighth against the pass and sixth against the run. Since their Week 9 bye, the Bucs are 27th against the pass and 22nd against the run. Over that same time period, they have dropped from fourth to 17th in pass rush win rate (35.3%). Their run stop win rate is about the same, but the Bucs have allowed more yardage at the second and third levels.

There haven't been big personnel changes -- just an overall decline. And it might cost Tampa Bay a playoff spot.

Carolina Panthers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 0.5%

Concerning weakness: Third-down defense

The Panthers' defense has a very hard time getting off the field. Carolina ranks 15th on first down by DVOA and 13th on second down. Yet it ranks 31st on third down, ahead of only the Cowboys. If you prefer more conventional stats, the Panthers rank 31st in conversion rate allowed on third downs; opponents move the sticks 46.7% of the time against them on third down and 63.6% of the time on fourth down.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1230%2Fr1594994_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 15:01:21.835696
,,2025-12-31 17:03:28+00:00,ESPN.com,Bucs' Mike Evans not thinking about future ahead of finale - ESPN,"Jenna Laine, Courtney Cronin, Mike Reiss, Ben Solak, Aaron Schatz, ESPN staff, NFL Nation, Jeff Legwold, Eric Woodyard, Kris Rhim",,,,,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47457339/bucs-mike-evans-not-thinking-future-ahead-finale,"The team is giving the first 13,000 fans bobbleheads of Evans, in his No.
""I'll know when I get out there and see, but right now I'm just treating it like a normal game,"" Evans said.
Evans was forced to miss six games this season with a broken collarbone -- the first broken bone of his career.
And they told me I would have a chance to play at the end of the season,"" Evans said.
Last week at the Miami Dolphins, Evans became the 22nd player in NFL history to reach 13,000 receiving yards.","TAMPA, Fla. -- Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans said Tuesday that he hasn't thought about his future beyond Saturday's regular-season finale hosting the Carolina Panthers, a game the Bucs must win, in addition to needing the New Orleans Saints to defeat the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, to reach the playoffs.

The franchise's leading career scorer, who is 32 and finishing his 12th season, is not under contract next year and hasn't committed to playing beyond 2025, although he has long said he wants to finish his career with Tampa Bay.

""I just approach it how I always approach it,"" Evans said. ""It's whatever happens, happens. I'll focus on that when the time is right. Right now, we have to win. And I'm always giving my all and I'm always gonna go out swinging.""

It certainly has the makings of a super sendoff if he wanted it that way, with the exception of the team's current predicament -- losing seven of its past eight games and needing some help to reach the playoffs. The team is giving the first 13,000 fans bobbleheads of Evans, in his No. 13 jersey, doing his signature celebratory salute.

He joked about the youthful depiction of his bobblehead's hair, much more reminiscent of his as a 20-year-old seventh overall draft pick out of Texas A&M. Now he's a married father of four with six Pro Bowl selections to his name and a Super Bowl LV ring and has become one of the most celebrated players in the team's history, with fans even tattooing his image and his autograph to their bodies.

He's not sure whether there will be emotions.

""I'll know when I get out there and see, but right now I'm just treating it like a normal game,"" Evans said. ""And obviously we have to win it and do our part and cheer another team on Sunday.""

Coach Todd Bowles echoed that when asked Tuesday about the possibility of it being not just Evans' last game but also that of inside linebacker Lavonte David.

""I think we need to win because we need to win,"" Bowles said. ""The fact that it could be or could not be their last game is not even talked about at this time.""

Evans was forced to miss six games this season with a broken collarbone -- the first broken bone of his career. He also missed three games with a hamstring strain. That ended his streak of 1,000-yard seasons at 11, tying him for first with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice. It was a career record Evans wanted to gain sole possession of this year, and he had Rice's blessing to do so, but then the collarbone injury hit.

After that, all he could think about was getting back. The team struggled in his absence.

""I mean, when the injury happened, you hear 'broken bone,' you think 'out for the season.' And they told me I would have a chance to play at the end of the season,"" Evans said. ""So I was trying to expedite that process -- rehab extremely hard, the training staff did a great job, and I was able to come back. And that's one thing I've always prided myself in. If I'm healthy enough to play, I'm going to play. Like, I'm paid to play football, and the fans are wearing my jerseys in the stands to watch me play. So I just made a point to get back as fast as I could.""

But it gave him a sneak preview of what retirement would be like. He found himself longing for the joy of playing.

""It's kind of a blessing in disguise,"" Evans said. ""I missed the game more than I thought I would. And I come back and I still got the love for the game. And who knows what it'll do for me in the future?""

Last week at the Miami Dolphins, Evans became the 22nd player in NFL history to reach 13,000 receiving yards. He is also one of just nine players in league history with at least 850 receptions, 13,000 receiving yards and 100 touchdown receptions in their career, joining Rice, Tim Brown, Cris Carter, Tony Gonzalez, Marvin Harrison, Randy Moss, Terrell Owens and Larry Fitzgerald.

""It was looking tough this year, but thank God that I was able to come back and get healthy and get that,"" Evans said. ""That's elite company, man. That's something I've never even dreamed of doing. So I thank God for it. ...""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1018%2Fr1562232_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 15:59:44.479256

The beginning of the season, with GM Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll keeping their jobs, make some fans unhappy. The end of the year, where the Giants won a game and lost control of the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, also made some fans unhappy.

Truthfully, not much about the 2025 season — other than getting quarterback Jaxson Dart — made anyone happy. Let’s review the year in Big Blue View headlines.

Could an injury prevent him from playing in the regular season finale? The star running back has managed to avoid those issues all season long, but he popped up on the injury report with a back ailment ahead of Week 18.

Early indications are that it's just a stiff back for McCaffrey and the overall concern appears to be minimal. Regardless, his status is now in question for the team's matchup against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday, Jan. 3.

The No. 1 seed in the NFC is on line in San Francisco and all eyes are now on the health of McCaffrey.

Here's the latest on the 49ers running back.

Christian McCaffrey injury update

McCaffrey missed practice on Tuesday, Dec. 30 with a stiff back.

The running back has routinely missed the first official practice of the week all season for rest-related reasons. Given his injury history, it appears San Francisco has been doing everything in its power to ensure the star would be fresh for a postseason run.

Head coach Kyle Shanahan didn't seem too concerned about the injury for McCaffrey, telling reporters on Dec. 30 that it's only a stiff back. The coach added that it was an ailment that popped up against the Tennessee Titans on Dec. 14.

""I know he battled it hard that week, but I haven't heard anything about it since,"" Shanahan said. ""It might have stiffened up in the game, and it was sore from Sunday night, so that's why we've got him on here today.""

Shanahan indicated that the team has been holding walkthrough practices since their Week 18 contest against the Seahawks comes on a short week.

Injuries have been a problem for the 49ers throughout the 2025 season, but McCaffrey doesn't appear to be in danger of missing the regular season finale at this time.

That concern will ramp up if he continues to be sidelined though.

Here are five things to know about the Packers' newest defensive lineman: Ford was one of Green Bay's four seventh-round picks in 2022.
Despite spending two-plus seasons in Green Bay, Ford never appeared in a game for the Packers.
After being elevated for three games, Ford was signed back to the 53 on Oct. 25.","GREEN BAY – Welcome back Jonathan Ford.

The Packers claimed the 6-foot-5, 338-pound defensive tackle off waivers from Chicago after losing Jordon Riley to a season-ending Achilles injury during Saturday's loss to Baltimore.

Ford, 27, recorded 13 tackles (one for loss) while playing 173 defensive snaps for the Bears over 12 games.

Here are five things to know about the Packers' newest defensive lineman:

Ford was one of Green Bay's four seventh-round picks in 2022.

Taken with the 234th overall pick, Ford was part of a fruitful 11-player draft class for Green Bay that included linebacker Quay Walker, defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt, receivers Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs, and starting offensive linemen Rasheed Walker, Zach Tom and Sean Rhyan.

Ford shared his seventh-round selection with Walker (249), safety Tariq Carpenter (228) and receiver Samori Toure (258).

Ford and former college teammate Jonathan Garvin (seventh round, 2020) are the only defensive players whom the Packers have drafted out of the University of Miami (Fla.).

Despite spending two-plus seasons in Green Bay, Ford never appeared in a game for the Packers.

Green Bay was both deep and durable on the defensive interior during Ford's time here. A healthy scratch throughout his rookie season, Ford spent the 2023 season on the Packers' practice squad without being activated to the gameday roster.

Ford garnered high praise from the Packers during training camp in 2024 before injuring his calf in the preseason finale. Still, the Packers thought enough of Ford's ability to place him on injured reserve with a designation to return during final cuts.

He was activated on Oct. 21, 2024, but immediately released and re-signed to the Packers' practice squad. The Bears signed Ford to their 53-man roster near the end of a five-win season.

Ford got his first chance to see the field in Chicago.

The monstrous defensive tackle made a solid first impression when he racked up five tackles (one for loss) in his debut against the Minnesota Vikings on Dec. 16, 2024.

Chicago re-signed Ford in January after finishing with nine tackles on 77 defensive snaps in the Bears' final four games.

He didn't make Chicago's initial 53-man roster this past summer but signed to the practice squad the following day. After being elevated for three games, Ford was signed back to the 53 on Oct. 25.

Ford was a healthy scratch during the Bears' two December meetings with Green Bay. He was waived on Saturday to enable Chicago to activate rookie guard Luke Newman off IR.

He has prototypical makeup as a run-stopper.

Ford's size was his calling card coming into the NFL. With Wyatt (ankle) and Riley both out for the season, Ford gives the Packers another option on the interior after giving up 307 rushing yards in a 41-24 loss to the Ravens last Saturday.

During the NFL Draft process, NFL.com's Lance Zierlein praised Ford for his knock-back power, quickness off the snap and ability to penetrate the backfield for a man his size.

Ford was a three-year starter for the Hurricanes.

The Ford Lauderdale, Fla., native chose to stay home as a three-star recruit in 2017. He spent five years at Miami, racking up 60 tackles (eight for loss) in 50 games with 30 starts.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/laxkvylswtvx42rc0eba,N,,2025-12-31 15:01:31.090971

More notes on Week 18

What are you hearing on potential jobs that could come open over the next seven days?

Graziano: My sense is that a lot of people are watching Las Vegas for the potential that Pete Carroll is one-and-done with the Raiders. This season has gone quite poorly, and they seem to be positioning themselves for the No. 1 draft pick, so the theory is they might want someone else around to develop that selection if it's a quarterback.

Atlanta still seems like a spot to watch, given how far short of expectations the Falcons have fallen with Raheem Morris. I'm hearing conflicting things on Miami; for a while it sounded as if Mike McDaniel was a good bet to stay, but lately the winds seem to have shifted a bit on that, so we'll see where that lands. Cleveland is a spot people are keeping an eye on, with the idea that Kevin Stefanski could be a head coach candidate elsewhere if the Browns do move on. And some are wondering what Tampa Bay might do if the Bucs don't win Sunday to salvage their season. Otherwise ... I'm not sure. What do you think about Arizona?

Fowler: That one is complicated, because some within the coaching staff are cautiously optimistic that Jonathan Gannon will get a fourth year, and some within the coaching industry see a path to Gannon potentially staying. Owner Michael Bidwill likes Gannon and can attribute the rough season to injuries and the lack of a hand-picked quarterback for the head coach. The flip side is Arizona is so far away from the other three teams in the NFC West and simply isn't competitive right now.

On the Bucs, Todd Bowles' buyout would be hefty after the team extended his contract through 2028, and the team doesn't seem overly eager to pay that. Bailing on Bowles would be the Bucs' way of embracing a rebuild. But someone will have to pay if they lose to Carolina. Staff changes are not off the table either way.

We're in the same spot on the other jobs you mentioned, and Cincinnati's Zac Taylor appears to be safe. Morris has helped himself a bit over the past three games, but I'm not sure it's enough. That leaves us with the surprise category. I can't help but envision teams with current or future openings watching the Baltimore-Pittsburgh game wondering whether John Harbaugh or Mike Tomlin could somehow become available. That's not my expectation, to be sure, but the chatter won't quite dissipate.

Graziano: That chatter is out there, but I've heard nothing from inside either building to indicate either team is contemplating a change. Most of the speculation seems to stem from fan discontent, and neither the Steelers nor the Ravens are the type of organization to make compulsive decisions based on fan discontent.

That said, one of those teams is going to miss the playoffs and the other is going to be the weakest team in the AFC playoff field. The Ravens had the very highest of hopes for this season, and the Steelers always expect to contend. So there will be disappointment to be addressed in both places. Count me among those who would be extremely surprised if Tomlin and Harbaugh aren't back in their current jobs next season. But I don't believe either organization has had real conversations yet about the future of their respective coaches.

Fowler: Harbaugh has three years left on his contract, so I don't anticipate him initiating an exit. But there is at least some intrigue leaguewide about whether Harbaugh and owner Steve Bisciotti could have big-picture talks about the future at some point. In other words, I'm not totally getting shut out when I knock on those doors. It's also noteworthy that Harbaugh's mentor is Andy Reid, who had a successful second stint in the NFL when he left Philadelphia. Perhaps that blueprint is not lost on Harbaugh. It could be nothing, but Sunday's game is intriguing beyond the score.

Graziano: If Tomlin or Harbaugh were cut loose, either would certainly top the wish list of just about any team with an opening. But if not, what do you think about the chances of someone such as Stefanski or McDaniel latching on quickly with another team as head coach if they're let go in Cleveland or Miami, respectively? If the Browns are of a mind to make a move, is it possible they could look to work out a trade that sends Stefanski elsewhere, since he has years left on his deal? I'm just trying to spitball out-of-the-ordinary scenarios here.

Fowler: Stefanski might be the strongest retread candidate in the eyes of many. The Giants would be an ideal fit. And trades of any kind are never off the table in Cleveland, but it'd be tricky trying to trade a coach who's 7-26 over the past two years. And here's something funny: My sense is that McDaniel would be a candidate in Cleveland, should the Dolphins move on and Cleveland's job open. He still has some support in Miami. We will see if that's enough. He has made a case to stay. From what I've gathered, the Dolphins' GM search won't necessarily be centered around fitting with McDaniel; it's more so about finding the best team fit in general.

One more: Some folks around the league have wondered to me whether Bills ownership might grow impatient with Sean McDermott if Buffalo doesn't make a playoff run in a year Patrick Mahomes is out of the postseason.

Which candidate do you believe most strongly will get a head coaching job this cycle?

Fowler: There are several options here. The field is as wide open as I can remember. It's missing the proverbial golden goose, eliciting several different answers from industry sources over the past few weeks. Former or recently fired head coaches could be happy with this cycle, and interview quality will absolutely matter. But I'll go with Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley. He's part of the cluster of strong defensive-minded candidates this cycle. He seems to have some traction in New York, too. I've heard his name linked to the Giants job a few times in my calls over the past week, and I expect him to be on their list. Hafley is also a geographical fit as a Montvale, New Jersey, native.

Graziano: The name that jumped to my mind is Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, who I believe will be on a lot of lists. That Sean McVay pixie dust has been the key for a lot of guys getting their first head coaching shot, and Shula could be next. I could see him being of interest in Tennessee if he brings the right offensive coordinator with him for quarterback Cam Ward's development. I also think Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph will get another shot, with Miami and Las Vegas both strong possibilities for a variety of reasons if those teams decide to make changes.

Fowler: Shula has that Rams tree, coaches an opportunistic defense in L.A. and has long been on the league's internal radar as an emerging candidate. That's a good formula. We outlined a few weeks back the reasons Joseph is well positioned, and Joseph and 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh acquitted themselves well with the Raiders during last year's cycle. Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Jaguars defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile and Texans defensive coordinator Matt Burke are poised to score their first interviews. Seattle's Aden Durde could land in that group, too.

One thing this cycle has in spades is defense. It's lacking a bit on offense. I'm expecting Kansas City offensive coordinator Matt Nagy to be in the mix in Tennessee (and possibly elsewhere). Seattle offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak and Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Brady have earned interview chances but aren't considered runaway prospects at this point. Stefanski and Kliff Kingsbury might be involved. It wouldn't surprise to see Bengals offensive coordinator Dan Pitcher on the interview circuit. And a sleeper candidate is Rams pass game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase, who could have some action. What do you make of that side of the ball, Dan?

Graziano: I've heard Nagy's name a lot; it was thrown around in connection with the Titans job seemingly within the first few minutes after Brian Callahan was fired. I agree that Kubiak is one to watch and think he might get more interviews than some might expect him to get. Brady would be the guy to watch in Cincinnati if the Bengals did move on from Taylor, but like you, I don't expect that to happen. The relative lack of top offensive candidates is the thing that makes me wonder whether Kingsbury gets some attention or even Mike McCarthy gets some looks, though I haven't heard anything solid on teams being interested in the latter.

Who is the most interesting head coach candidate not currently in the NFL?

Graziano: I really struggled with this one, as did most of the people to whom I spoke. Jon Gruden? That's complicated by a ton of factors, including his pending litigation against the league. I'm not sure McCarthy gets another shot, but he could get some looks. College guys don't seem to be very hot right now. I never thought Notre Dame's Marcus Freeman was getting serious interest, but good for him for getting a raise out of the whole thing. I just haven't heard much on who could be this year's, say, Pete Carroll.

Fowler: It wouldn't shock me if teams wanted to speak with Gruden, assuming his lawsuit will reach a conclusion at some point. In a year with limited offensive options, this would be the time. His imprint is still all over the NFL coaching landscape. McCarthy would be a key figure in this equation, too. Out of the retread options, he seems well positioned. That doesn't mean he'll get a job, but I do expect him to interview.

Texas coach Steve Sarkisian publicly denying any NFL interest back in October doesn't necessarily end the conversation. He has deep NFL ties after stints with the Falcons and Raiders over the years, and he could easily gauge the market without being directly involved.

Graziano: Who knows? There are always surprises. I'd be saying Bill O'Brien, who was a successful NFL head coach once upon a time, if he hadn't had such a lousy season at Boston College. The Bears gave Eddie George an interview last cycle. Would the Titans do the same? Could the Giants give Antonio Pierce a call two years after his brief stint with the Raiders and bring back their legendary linebacker?

Fowler: Here's a college sleeper ... Bret Bielema. He has won 19 games over the past two seasons as Illinois' head coach, and he spent three years as an NFL assistant between collegiate head coaching stints, so I believe the pros is still attractive to him. He's an outside-the-box idea, but anything goes this cycle.

What about the general managers: Who has the hottest front-office seat right now?

Fowler: Falcons owner Arthur Blank will evaluate the team's football operation at the conclusion of the season. General manager Terry Fontenot is finishing his fifth year at the helm. Over that time, the Falcons have not produced a winning season, which is hard to overcome. Of the 18 sitting general managers with at least five years of experience, only one -- the Rams' Les Snead, in the middle of a move from St. Louis to Los Angeles -- failed to produce a winning season through the first five years. So this is a spot people around the league who follow such things have been monitoring closely for potential change, despite the team showing signs of life in recent weeks and its 2025 draft picks emerging.

Graziano: For sure. Again, that team had high expectations the past two years and has not come close to meeting them. Blank is eager to win as soon as possible and might not be patient with this group.

I was in Indianapolis on Sunday, and no one there seems to know for sure where things are headed following the Colts' late-season collapse. GM Chris Ballard has a good relationship with owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon, from what I am told, and while the Anthony Richardson Sr. pick seems to have been a miss, the Daniel Jones signing was a hit until he got hurt. I think Ballard sticks around, but people are asking about him a lot these days.

Fowler: Ballard remains a moving target because he drafts well and builds good rosters -- but no division titles in nine years is a tough sell. I've talked to a few people in the league who wonder whether Ballard would be the first to go over coach Shane Steichen if Irsay-Gordon makes changes at all. But the Colts had a good thing going for 10 games before the injuries, so that factors in, too. Most people I've talked to are leaning toward Ballard's job being safe.

With other spots, some of the people I've talked to believe Cardinals general manager Monti Ossenfort will ultimately be safe. Browns general manager Andrew Berry has been operating like someone who will be back, and that's my sense of what will happen. His successful 2025 draft was carefully crafted with 2026 in mind, and he has had the freedom to negotiate extensions with veterans.

Graziano: That all lines up with what I'm hearing. I haven't been told anything to indicate Berry would be in trouble. A couple of people I talk to are still watching the Giants, who said after coach Brian Daboll's midseason firing that GM Joe Schoen would lead the coaching search but haven't done much besides lose games since then. Schoen seems to be pretty well aligned with the other decision-makers in the Giants' building from what I can gather, but the team's record during his tenure is poor enough that eyeballs are on this situation. Some people wonder whether this could turn out the way the Jaguars' situation did last offseason, when Jacksonville said GM Trent Baalke would lead the coaching search and then ended up firing him to entice Liam Coen to take the head coach job.

What else are you hearing this week?

Fowler's notes:

• The Ravens' playoff hopes are still alive, but this season has been challenging, raising questions about whether some level of change is coming after the season. Harbaugh has never been afraid to make staff changes when necessary. Some people around the league are watching defensive coordinator Zach Orr's status closely after Baltimore fell from 10th to 25th in total defense since 2024.

Offensive coordinator Todd Monken's future is complicated because he's known as a skilled coach, his contract was extended in the offseason, and he has interviewed for head-coaching jobs. He also was a person of interest during the Michigan coaching search that ultimately landed on Kyle Whittingham. But the offense has fallen from first to 16th in yards, and questions exist about the chemistry between Monken and quarterback Lamar Jackson. The usage of Derrick Henry has been a source of frustration at times, too. Either way, something could come to a head with the staff. Of course, Baltimore is dangerous if it can get into the playoffs with a win Sunday in Pittsburgh, and a spirited late-season run could silence all of this noise. But there is noise.

• The Falcons have not quit on Morris, who has railed off three consecutive wins to make his case for a third year in Atlanta. But that doesn't ensure his return. Morris would most likely need to make staff changes if he does stay. Special teams has been a bugaboo, and quarterback Michael Penix Jr.'s development hasn't proceeded as hoped.

• There is talk in some league circles about the future of Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard. The offense has tanked of late, and Baker Mayfield has regressed in the second half of the season. Some level of change is needed after this year's late-season collapse, which is at least somewhat injury-driven. The Bucs are playing with third-string offensive guards, and the running game hasn't been quite the same. Grizzard is well respected and helped former coordinator Liam Coen with game planning last season, but the Bucs' offense can't stop the slide.

• League sources consider it likely that Washington makes a change at defensive coordinator after Joe Whitt Jr. was stripped of playcalling duties earlier this season. The Commanders are 31st in total defense. Injuries and a lack of pass rush personnel have contributed, but coach Dan Quinn faces a critical third season in Washington and appears poised to make changes. Quinn has been calling the defense; whether he continues to do so will depend on an offseason review.

• With a weaker pool of offensive candidates for head-coaching jobs, I expect several up-and-coming non-playcallers to get looks for more prominent playcalling jobs or even head-coaching opportunities. We know the drill: Oftentimes a team will interview a coach for a head-coaching position with the back-pocket thought to pair that coach as a coordinator for the head coach it really wants. This year's group of young offensive coaches working behind a skilled playcaller is deep -- including the Jaguars' Grant Udinski, Bears' Declan Doyle, Panthers' Brad Idzik and Broncos' Davis Webb. There are many others, but those coaches fit a younger mold and could surprise some people.

• Kingsbury's head-coaching candidacy is interesting despite Washington's struggles. The Commanders rank 21st in total offense -- ahead of Tampa Bay, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh -- despite a poor supporting cast ravaged by injury. He's a potential fit in Tennessee, with a young quarterback in Cam Ward who fits his style of offense. Las Vegas, should that job open as many around the league expect, will take a hard look at improving its offense. Kingsbury has been selective but is also open to becoming a head coach again. So while he's not the shiniest name because of Washington's record, I could see him being in the mix again.

• Former Giants coach Brian Daboll should be a viable offensive coordinator option for teams looking to hire one. He could get head-coaching interviews, as well. He has significant playcalling experience and did some good things with Jaxson Dart before his November firing.

• Names that come up fairly often for the general manager cycle include Green Bay vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan and Indianapolis assistant general manager Ed Dodds. They have significant personnel experience. Also, Chicago assistant GM Ian Cunningham has been a fixture on the scene and has helped build Chicago into a winner. The same goes for assistant GMs Terrance Gray (Buffalo), Alec Halaby (Philadelphia) and Chad Alexander (L.A. Chargers). Another candidate to watch through the Eagles system is vice president of football operations and strategy Adam Berry.

• The Rams are feeling the urgency after back-to-back losses. As defensive lineman Kobie Turner put it, teams have trouble hanging with the Rams when they are at their best, but that's not often enough. ""We've got to get ourselves together,"" he said after Monday night's loss in Atlanta. Part of the reason the team isn't panicking: The Sean McVay-Matthew Stafford relationship that is thriving in Year 5. Stafford has embraced more under-center play and with multiple tight ends on the field. Even during his worst game (intercepted three times by the Falcons' defense), he was well on his way to 350 or so yards if not for penalties or plays negated by official review.

""The offense presents things that look the same but are different for the defense -- I think that bodes really well for us moving forward,"" tight end Colby Parkinson said. ""These will set us up for success.""

Graziano's notes:

• Anthony Campanile is worth watching; the Jags' defensive coordinator could get interviews this cycle and a head-coaching job down the road. People around the league are taking note of what has happened in Jacksonville and how quickly Coen and his relatively inexperienced staff have turned things around. The Jaguars have the league's best run defense in yards allowed per game, and they trail only the Bears with 30 takeaways.

The turnaround in Jacksonville is across-the-board impressive. QB Trevor Lawrence's confidence is sky-high thanks in part to a couple of midseason moves by the coaching staff and the front office. Coen and his staff used the team's Week 8 bye to drill down on what they believed Lawrence liked and didn't like in the offense and focus on what they could do to keep building it around his strengths and preferences.

""The biggest difference I see is Trevor running out of the pocket, using his legs and then just ripping the ball,"" Jags offensive lineman Cole Van Lanen told me. ""He's making decisions he might not have made in the past, I'm talking about in a good way, and it's really elevated the offense.""

The front office, around that same time, acquired wide receiver Jakobi Meyers in a trade with the Raiders. Using first-round picks on wideouts two years in a row and paying Dyami Brown $10 million in free agency might have made most teams reluctant to make this kind of move, given the amount of high-end resources already sunk into the position. But the Jags knew they had a very specific problem -- namely a league-leading number of drops -- that the sure-handed Meyers could help them correct. His addition changed their offense, moving 2024 first-rounder Brian Thomas Jr. into a role he was more comfortable with and allowing Parker Washington to shine. And the team rewarded Meyers with a contract extension shortly after the trade. What that means for the future of their WR position once Travis Hunter comes back is a discussion for another day. (Hunter, remember, can do other things!)

GM James Gladstone and vice president of football operations Tony Boselli deserve a lot of credit for a smart, aggressive deadline deal that has Jacksonville in position to win its division and potentially still get the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs in what a lot of front offices might have been content to view as a rebuilding year. I was a skeptic about Jacksonville's 2025 chances after visiting the team in training camp, but the Jaguars already posted their first 12-win season in 20 years (and third in franchise history). They've won in Denver, they split with Houston, and they're beating the teams they're supposed to beat. In a wide-open, Chiefs-free AFC playoff field ... why not?

• Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he was optimistic about edge rusher T.J. Watt returning for Sunday night's game against Baltimore. Watt, who had surgery three weeks ago to repair a partially collapsed lung, was a limited practice participant all three days last week, which was an encouraging sign. But people close to this situation have cautioned me that the Steelers aren't treating this as a run-of-the-mill injury recovery (which it's not) and they likely will want to see Watt get through multiple full practices before activating him for the game, even as vital as it is to their season. So watch the practice reports this week to get a sense of Watt's chances to go.

• Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson's status for that same game is very much up in the air, as the team entered the week with no idea how much (if anything) Jackson would be able to do in Wednesday, Thursday and Friday practices. We might have some clues by Wednesday, if Jackson is able to get out on the field for practice and move around OK with the back injury that cost him last week's game. But it's no sure thing he'll be able to answer the bell for Sunday night, and I'd expect Tyler Huntley to get some first-team reps this week either way, just in case.

• Niners left tackle Trent Williams is dealing with a pulled hamstring, and while coach Kyle Shanahan declined to rule him out Tuesday for Saturday night's game, Williams is 37 and hasn't had this injury before, and the team is playing on a short week. He's probably a long shot to play against the Seahawks in a game that will decide the NFC West title and the conference's top seed.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1230%2Fr1594995_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:00:48.228997

NFC WEEK 18 MOTIVATION RATINGS

Here is more context and quotes on the Week 18 motivation:

AFC

1. Broncos (13-3)

SITUATION: A Denver win locks them into the top seed in the AFC.

OUTLOOK: This is pretty simple. There is only one bye available, and it is for the top seed in the conference. The Broncos control their own destiny and will be all-out to beat the Chargers Week 18.

2. Patriots (13-3)

SITUATION: The Patriots could get to the No. 1 seed with a win and a Denver loss. They could also fall to the No. 3 seed with a loss and a Jacksonville win. Otherwise, they are the No. 2 seed.

OUTLOOK: While New England technically has a shot at the top seed, it would require the Broncos to lose to a Chargers team resting their starters. Mike Vrabel stated that starters will play if healthy: “Probably everybody who’s healthy will play,” Vrabel said. “I mean, that’s just where we’re at, and I haven’t looked too far into it this morning here. But I would anticipate everybody who’s healthy will play in the football game.”

Note that the Patriots and Broncos both play at 425pm ET in Week 18. We could see some scoreboard watching from Vrabel — if the Broncos are in trouble, the Pats should go all-out to win.

3. Jaguars (12-4)

SITUATION: Jacksonville locks up the AFC South with a win on Sunday. A loss would open up the Texans to steal it.

OUTLOOK: The Jaguars should go all out to win the division, and earn a home game in the first round of playoffs.

4. Steelers (9-7) and 9. Ravens (8-8)

SITUATION: Pittsburgh plays Baltimore for the AFC North crown. The loser is out of the playoffs.

OUTLOOK: Both teams will be going all out to try to make the postseason.

5. Texans (11-5)

SITUATION: Houston can still win the AFC South with a win and a Jaguars loss. Otherwise, a win keeps them at the No. 5 seed.

OUTLOOK: The Texans should be going all out for this game. Even if Jacksonville (which plays at the same time) were to win their game, Houston has a lot of incentive to keep their position at No. 5 in the AFC. It is the difference between facing the AFC North winner and a team with 12+ wins.

6. Chargers (11-5)

SITUATION: Los Angeles is locked into a Wild Card spot. They can’t get higher than the 6 seed.

OUTLOOK: The Chargers have relatively nothing to play for, and could use a week to get healthy. Jim Harbaugh has acknowledged this and has already stated that Trey Lance is expected to start instead of Justin Herbert. We expect other starters to sit as well.

7. Bills (11-5)

SITUATION: Buffalo is locked into a Wild Card spot.

OUTLOOK: The Bills are only playing for seeding, and head coach Sean McDermott appears conflicted so far: “Where do you want to start? We’ve got a lot of things we need to discuss as a leadership group,” McDermott said. “You’ve got the last game in Highmark Stadium here. That’s important to me; it’ll be important to our guys, to our staff. Then there are other things that come into consideration. It won’t be easy, but it is important that we have a good week here.”

It is worth noting that Josh Allen finished Week 17 with an injury, which could outweigh any seeding or momentum goals for Week 18. It’s also worth noting that the Bills could beat the pathetic Jets without playing their starters a ton.

JUST ELIMINATED IN WEEK 17

* Colts — expected to start Riley Leonard in Week 18. Expecting other evaluation spots.

* Raiders, Jets, Titans, Browns, Chiefs, Bengals, and Dolphins

NFC

1. Seahawks (13-3) and 5. 49ers (12-4)

SITUATION: This game will determine who wins the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the conference.

OUTLOOK: Both teams will be going all out, as this game has massive playoff ramifications.

2. Bears (11-5)

SITUATION: Chicago locks up the No. 2 seed with a win on Sunday. They cannot fall farther than No. 3.

OUTLOOK: The Bears need a win over the Lions to avoid the NFC West teams in the first round of the playoffs. Ben Johnson indicated they will play for the No. 2 seed: “Yeah, we’re playing to win this week.” We are inclinced to believe him for now — there is a difference between facing the Packers and facing one of Rams/Seahawks/49ers. Dan Campbell is likely to match fire with fire, and we should expect a legit game here.

3. Eagles (11-5)

SITUATION: The Eagles will be the No. 3 seed unless they win and the Bears lose to Detroit.

OUTLOOK: Philly has a small chance at the No. 2 seed, but they may opt to rest up for the playoffs. Mike Garafolo has indicated that the Eagles are considering resting “some starters” in Week 18 against Commanders. This is a contest that could feature starters for less than a full game, even if they suit up.

**UPDATE** Jeff McLane is reporting that the Eagles will rest “Jalen Hurts and most starters” for Week 18

4. Panthers (8-8) and 11. Bucs (7-9)

SITUATION: Carolina plays Tampa Bay for the NFC South. The loser is eliminated.

OUTLOOK: If the Falcons beat the Saints on Sunday, this game will actually not matter. But since it is played on Saturday, both teams will be going all out for a chance to make the playoffs.

6. Rams (11-5)

SITUATION: The Rams can clinch the No. 5 seed with a win and a Niners loss. Otherwise, they will be the No. 6 seed.

OUTLOOK: The NFC West title game will already be in the books, and it should give a bit of a clearer picture here. If San Francisco wins, the Rams cannot advance their seeding and should be considered likely to rest. If Seattle wins, L.A. has a shot at the No. 5 seed, which they may play for, given the difference in matchup quality for Round 1. Sean McVay stated the starters would play after the Monday Night Football loss to Atlanta: “No, they were going to play anyway,” McVay said. “We need to play. We need to play better football. So I don’t know what the consequences are in those different types of things, but we’ve got to play better.”

It is worth noting that McVay has basically never played for seeding, and the Cardinals (their Week 18 opponent) are awful. The starters may participate in an effort to get some momentum going into the playoffs, but it would be surprising to see them play the whole game.

7. Packers (9-6-1)

SITUATION: Green Bay is locked into the No. 7 seed.

OUTLOOK: The Packers cannot advance their seeding and are an extremely banged-up team right now. We consider them likely to rest a ton of starters in Week 18.

**UPDATE** Matt LaFleur says the Packers will rest “some starters” in Week 18. Jordan Love was still in concussion protocol as of Wednesday.

Per ESPN, a source said the decision to move on from Diggs was due, ""to a culmination of events, including performance.""

Diggs signed a five-year, $97 million contract extension in 2023 but almost immediately began having injury problems, including a blown-out knee in 2023, more knee issues last year, and a concussion this year while trying to install a television at his home.

Last offseason he rehabbed on his own, which didn't sit well with the Cowboys, who fined him, then Dallas waited three weeks to play him this year after he came off injured reserved for his concussion, as he eventually missed seven games.

Digges played eight games this year. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2021, when he led the league in interceptions, and in 2022.

The Buffalo Bills enter the regular-season finale against the New York Jets with a mix of injured players, others playing through ailments and an added layer of uncertainty over who might be held out with the postseason in mind.

Quarterback Josh Allen continues to manage a foot injury, several veterans remain sidelined or limited, and Buffalo could choose caution over urgency with certain starters depending on how the week unfolds.

Linebacker and defensive captain Terrel Bernard has already been ruled out with a calf injury.

The Bills (11–5) host the New York Jets (3-13) at 4:25 p.m. Sunday.

NFL teams have to submit a report on practice participation on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for a Sunday game. There are three levels of practice participation that can be designated: did not participate, limited participation and full participation.

A game status report is due by 4 p.m. Friday for Sunday games.

Here is the Bills vs. Jets injury report for Week 17:

Buffalo Bills injury update for Week 18

Josh Allen, QB, foot

Josh Allen's right foot continued to be bothersome in the Bills' loss to the Eagles.

Allen had X-rays postgame, which were negative, on the foot in Week 17 and Week 18.

He originally suffered the injury while retreating and falling to the ground on a 22-yard sack against the Browns in Week 17. Allen limped off the field and was evaluated by athletic trainers as he sat on the bench late in the second quarter. He walked to the locker room with trainers just prior to halftime with his right cleat off and received X-rays, which were negative. Allen returned to for the second half and did not miss any plays.

Allen played the entirety versus the Eagles, rushing for two touchdowns in the final 5:11 of the game, but he was sacked five times. He appeared to be favoring the foot and attempted all of his passes from the pocket for the first time in his career.

Allen has started 139 consecutive games, the longest active streak by a quarterback.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said to get off the field he'll have to ""wrestle him.""

""We'll just take it one day at a time and see how he does here through the week,"" McDermott said.

Dalton Kincaid, TE, knee

Dalton Kincaid did not play against the Eagles due to a nagging knee injury. It was the fifth game he's missed this season.

He was shut out with no catches on one target and agitated the knee injury in the win over the Browns in Week 16.

Jordan Poyer, S, hamstring

Jordan Poyer missed Week 17 with a hamstring injury that occurred while recording a half-sack on Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders late in the fourth quarter. He came off the field for the Bills' final two defensive snaps of the game.

Matt Prater, K, right quadriceps

Matt Prater has been out the last two games.

The 41-year-old kicker suffered a quadriceps injury in Week 15 and did not practice leading up to Week 16 or Week 17.

Prater has made 18 of 20 field goals and 43 of 46 extra points for 97 points in 14 games. His 90% field goal percentage is tied for 12th in the NFL this season.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Monday that Prater should be available against the Jets.

In his absence, the Bills signed veteran kicker Michael Badgley to the practice squad and elevated him twice. Badgley missed an extra point in each of the two games and was released by the Bills on Monday.

Jordan Phillips, DT, ankle

Jordan Phillips has not played the last two games after suffering an ankle injury against the Patriots in Week 15.

Phillips stayed down on the field after a 9-yard run by TreVeyon Henderson in the second quarter. He was able to get to his feet and walk off under his own power. He went into the blue medical tent and the locker room for further evaluation and did not return. Phillips had a boot on his right foot in the locker room after the game.

The 11-year veteran has nine tackles and one sack in 10 games in 2025.

Terrel Bernard, LB, elbow

Terrel Bernard has already been ruled out against the Jets by Bills head coach Sean McDermott.

Bernard exited with a calf injury against the Eagles on Sunday. He was initially ruled questionable to return but was downgraded to out.

Bernard went into the blue medical tent then exited the tent and talked with athletic trainers.

Bernard was playing in his second game since returning from a three-game absence due to a dislocated elbow.

DaQuan Jones, DT, calf

DaQuan Jones did not play in Week 17 due to a calf injury. The 12-year veteran has 22 tackles, three sacks and a forced fumble in 12 games in 2025.

Spencer Brown, OT, eye

Spencer Brown briefly left in the fourth quarter after he was gouged in the eye and hit in the throat by Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter. He missed two offensive plays. Brown said he ""took a strong right hook to the eyeball"" and did not think it was accidentally.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Jackson is out for the rest of the season.

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Ed Oliver suffered a torn biceps injury which required and is out indefinitely. He was placed on on injured reserve on Oct. 28 and was eligible to return in Week 13.

Oliver was hurt in the second quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

He missed four games earlier this season (Weeks 2-5) with an ankle injury after he got stepped on in practice on Sept. 10.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Oliver could potentially return for the playoffs.

McDermott gave an update on Dec. 28 that Oliver suffered a minor setback in his recovery but is ""moving in a good direction.""

Taylor Rapp, S, knee

Taylor Rapp was placed on injured reserve on Oct. 24.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Rapp was battling an injury since training camp and ""it got to the point where he can't be himself.""

Rapp ha 26 tackles in six games this season.

Michael Hoecht, DE, Achilles

Michael Hoecht tore his right Achilles in the fourth quarter of the win against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

He suffered the non-contact injury while taking one step into his rush off the left edge with 14:25 remaining. Hoecht was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

Matt Prater, 41, signed to the Bills practice squad, was elevated for Week 1 and made a 32-yard game-winning field goal with no time left to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 41-40 in Week 1. Prater has since been signed to the active roster and is 10-for-11 on field goals and 17-for-17 on extra points through six games.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Bass underwent season-ending surgery in November.

Cameron Johnston, P, foot/ankle

Cameron Johnston suffered left foot and ankle injuries after taking a hit to his left plant leg on a punt in the fourth quarter in the Week 4 win over the Saints. The Bills placed him on injured reserve on Sept. 30 and signed punter Mitch Wishnowsky.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Dorian Strong, CB, neck

Dorian Strong played in four games with one start before suffering a neck injury and being placed on injured reserve on Oct. 4. The rookie sixth-round pick was eligible to return in Week 10.

Damar Hamlin, S, pectoral

Damar Hamlin suffered pectoral injury in practice Oct. 9 and was placed on injured reserve.

He was eligible to return in Week 11, although Bills coach Sean McDermott said it's ""up in the air"" if Hamlin's injury is season-ending.

Hamlin started 14 games in 2024 but has played a reserve role this year with Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp as the starting safeties. He has one tackle in five games.

DeWayne Carter, DT, Achilles

DeWayne Carter suffered a torn Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.

Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, recorded 14 tackles, five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits and a pass defended in 11 games last year.

Chase Lundt, OT, knee

Chase Lundt, a rookie sixth-round pick, was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 19. Lundt has appeared in two games, with three offensive snaps and five special teams snaps, in 2025.

Wande Owens, S, undisclosed

The undrafted rookie was waived Aug. 23 with an injury designation and went unclaimed on waivers.

New York Jets injury update for Week 18

Breece Hall, RB, knee

Breece Hall suffered a knee injury when he slammed his knee into the ground out of bounds while being tackled in the fourth quarter against the Patriots on Sunday. He said after the game that he is fine and won't need testing.

Mason Taylor, TE, neck

Mason Taylor has missed the last three games with a neck injury. The rookie has 44 catches for 369 yards and one touchdown in 13 games in 2025.

Isaiah Davis, RB, concussion

Isaiah Davis was evaluated for a concussion after a kickoff in the fourth quarter against the Patriots in Week 17. He did not return to the game.

Davis has 236 rushing yards and a touchdown on 43 carries and 21 receptions for 186 yards in 16 games in 2025.

Qwan'tez Stiggers, CB, knee

Qwan'tez Stiggers was helped off he field with a knee injury in the third quarter in the loss to the Patriots last week. He was helped off the field by athletic trainers and did not return. Stiggers led the Jets with 10 tackles in the game.

We go game by game to see who has things to play for, either from a team perspective or based on statistical milestones.

A note: ""Motivation"" is entirely made up and subjective. Players will give their all, but teams will make selective decisions about who plays and who sits out. For projected standings, we used the Vegas lines to determine winners.

Games With Both Teams Motivated

Games With Neither Team Motivated

Now, here's a game-by-game look at Week 18 motivation.

Saturday, January 3rd - 4:30 pm Eastern

Carolina (8-8) at Tampa Bay (7-9) (ESPN/ABC)

Early Line: Tampa Bay - 3.2, Total 44.5

Carolina Motivation: 10/10

Projected Playoff Position: NFC #4 Seed (Range: NFC #4 Seed to 13th pick)

Tampa Bay Motivation: 10/10

Projected Draft Position: #14 Overall (Range: NFC #4 Seed to 12th pick)

The Falcons' win over the Rams on Monday Night threw a dramatic wrench into the NFC South championship race. The simple scenario: a Panthers win clinches the NFC South. If the Buccaneers win, both teams will be watching the Atlanta-New Orleans game. A Buccaneers-Falcons win combination puts three teams in first with 8-9 records. The Panthers would win that tiebreaker.

Fantasy Impact: Rico Dowdle needs seven yards for a $1 million contract incentive. Bryce Young and Tetairoa McMillan are coming off disappointing performances. They were much more productive in Week 16 against Tampa Bay. Jalen Coker and Chuba Hubbard are options in deeper leagues.

Baker Mayfield had his best game since Week 5 last week. Mike Evans, Chris Godwin Jr., and Jalen McMillan are the top receiving options, as Emeka Egbuka has been quiet over the second half of the season, especially after all three other receivers returned from injury. Bucky Irving has led the backs but also failed to put up substantial fantasy numbers. Rachaad White and Sean Tucker are free agents following the 2025 season and are looking to make an impact to improve their value.

Revenge: Baker Mayfield, Teddy Bridgewater, David Moore

Saturday, January 3rd - 8:00 pm Eastern

Seattle (13-3) at San Francisco (12-4) (ESPN/ABC)

Early Line: Seattle -1.5, Total 49.5

Seattle Motivation: 10/10

Projected Playoff Position: NFC #1 Seed (Range: NFC #1 to #5 Seed)

San Francisco Motivation: 10/10

Projected Playoff Position: NFC #6 Seed (Range: NFC #1 to #6 Seed)

The winner takes the #1 seed in the NFC. The Rams' loss to Atlanta ensures the Seahawks can fall no lower than fifth. If the 49ers lose, they would need the Rams to lose to the Cardinals to avoid falling to the six seed.

Fantasy Impact: Play everyone you have in this game. Rashid Shaheed will likely be out for Seattle. There is optimism that George Kittle will be available after missing Week 17 for the 49ers. Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey, Jauan Jennings, and Ricky Pearsall are in play for the 49ers. Sam Darnold, Zach Charbonnet, Ken Walker III, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and A.J. Barner are the options for the Seahawks. Cooper Kupp is a desperation option.

Given the uncertainty around the Week 18 schedule, kickoff timing, and projected points, this is a game to target when players are available.

Revenge: Sam Darnold, Eric Saubert

Sunday, January 4th - 1:00 pm Eastern

Indianapolis (8-8) at Houston (11-5) (CBS)

Early Line: Houston -10.0, Total 40.5

Indianapolis Motivation: 0/10

Playoff Position: 15th Overall (Range: 14th pick to 18th pick, Current SoS: .537)

Houston Motivation: 10/10

Projected Draft Position: AFC #5 Seed (Range: AFC #3 to #7 Seed)

Houston can win the AFC South with a win and a Jacksonville loss. They cannot climb higher than the #3 seed. A loss, combined with Buffalo and LA Chargers wins, would drop them to the #7 seed.

Indianapolis traded its pick to the Jets in the Sauce Gardner move. The Colts should be motivated to play spoiler with no draft consideration attached.

Fantasy Impact: Houston's pieces are in play, with C.J. Stroud, Woody Marks, and Nico Collins the priorities. Tight end Dalton Schultz has been reliable. Rookie receivers Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel had big games in Week 17. Collins has incentives in play, but it would take 24 receptions and 343 yards to trigger them.

The Colts announced rookie Riley Leonard will start at quarterback over Philip Rivers. Jonathan Taylor is the headliner as he chases the NFL rushing crown. He trails James Cook by 47 yards. Cook kicks off after Taylor. Michael Pittman Jr needs 227 yards to trigger a $250,000 incentive. Pittman has a $29 million cap hit in 2026 that will likely require a restructuring or extension, or force the Colts to move on. Alec Pierce is a pending free agent who should have ample attention if he gets to the open market.

Tennessee (3-13) at Jacksonville (12-4) (CBS)

Early Line: Jacksonville -11.5, Total 47.5

Tennessee Motivation: 0/10

Playoff Position: 4th Overall (Range: 2nd pick to 7th pick, Current SoS: .574)

Jacksonville Motivation: 10/10

Projected Draft Position: AFC #3 Seed (Range: AFC #1 to #5 Seed)

Jacksonville has a wide range of outcomes, from grabbing the #1 seed with a win and a Denver and New England loss, to falling to the #5 seed with a loss and a Texans win. A win combined with either Denver or New England losing would move them to the #2 seed. The Jaguars play before Denver and New England, so they want to get to the clubhouse with the lead, then hope for chaos.

Tennessee cannot get to the 1st overall pick, but, like multiple teams, anything from the 2nd overall pick to the 7th pick is in play.

Fantasy Impact: Jacksonville is a full go offensively, and Trevor Lawrence has been red hot. Travis Etienne Jr., Jakobi Meyers, Brian Thomas Jr., Parker Washington, and Brenton Strange are all in play for fantasy and DFS purposes. Jacksonville has multiple contract incentives in play, but none are likely to be reached.

Tennessee will play all its pieces. Cameron Ward remains at quarterback, and Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears will both be involved at running back. The team has cycled receivers, leaning on rookies Chimere Dike, Elic Ayomanor, and Gunnar Helm in different moments. Chig Okonkwo is a pending free agent. Pollard is chasing significant contract incentives, needing 66 rushing yards for $250,000, and two touchdowns would give him $200,000. Van Jefferson joins Okonkwo as a pending free agent; one reception will earn him a $100,000 incentive.

Revenge: Calvin Ridley (IR)

Green Bay (9-6-1) at Minnesota (8-8) (FOX)

Early Line: Minnesota -6.5, Total 36.5

Green Bay Motivation: 0/10

Playoff Position: NFC #7 Seed

Minnesota Motivation: 2/10

Projected Draft Position: 18th Overall (Range: 13th pick to 18th pick, Current SoS: .517)

Green Bay is the only team in the NFL that knows precisely where it will be seeded after Week 18. The Packers are locked into the 7th seed and will wait to see whether they travel to Chicago or Philadelphia. The Packers have not officially announced they will rest key starters, but they have been hammered with injuries, and it would be a surprise to see them not take advantage of the situation. The one mitigating factor is Jordan Love missing Week 17 with a concussion and the potential rust concerns, though that feels more like a media talking point than an actionable decision.

Minnesota has played spoiler down the stretch, winning four straight and eliminating the Cowboys and Lions from playoff contention.

Fantasy Impact: This is not a matchup to aggressively target in fantasy, evidenced by the 36.5 point total.

Malik Willis should receive another opportunity to build upon a strong resume for a bridge quarterback opportunity. Willis will be a free agent following the season, and Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Halfley is in the running for head coach opportunities, potentially creating a natural pairing. We should not expect to see Josh Jacobs, Christian Watson, Jayden Reed, or Romeo Doubs in a meaningful role, as all are high-value to the offense and have worked through injuries this season. It could be an opportunity for rookie Matthew Golden to have a showcase game. Dontayvion Wicks suffered a concussion against Baltimore in Week 17. The only incentive in play is John Fitzpatrick topping 35% of the offensive snaps. He is at 35.2% for the year.

The Vikings expect Max Brosmer to start again. Brosmer was better in Week 17, though the offense struggled badly. Justin Jefferson is chasing 1,000 yards. Josh Oliver has a somewhat unrealistic incentive in play, needing two touchdowns. Jordan Mason has a yardage incentive in play, though he has missed the last couple of games with a leg injury. Jailen Nailor is the only pending free agent of note.

Revenge: Aaron Jones Sr., Ben Sims

New Orleans (6-10) at Atlanta (7-9) (FOX)

Early Line: Atlanta -2.5, Total 43.5

New Orleans Motivation: 4/10

Projected Draft Position: 8th Overall (Range: 8th pick to 12th pick, Current SoS: .493)

Atlanta Motivation: 10/10

Projected Draft Position: 13th Overall (Range: 8th pick to 15th pick, Current SoS: .496)

This matchup became the most bizarre of the week after the Falcons upset the Rams on Monday Night. The Falcons can win a share of the NFC South, though they would lose the tiebreaker to the Panthers. If the Buccaneers beat the Panthers on Saturday, a Falcons win would force a three-way tie that ends with Carolina. The Falcons do not own their own 1st round pick, trading it to the Rams for James Pearce Jr. in 2025's draft. There is little reason for them not to try for a share of the division.

On the Saints' side, they have been playing spoiler for two months. They are on a 5-2 run after starting 1-8, and they have a 4-game winning streak. The Texans have the longest active streak, at 8, the Jaguars are at 7, and the Seahawks and 49ers are at 6. A win here would give the Saints a chance at the longest active streak when the 2026 season starts. Kellen Moore is working to instill a winning culture in New Orleans and will not disrupt that for a draft position.

The intensity of this rivalry is the cherry on top. These teams fall into the classic ""They do not like each other"" trope.

Fantasy Impact: Bijan Robinson has a chance to break the NFL's scrimmage yardage record, needing 254 yards. A huge lift, but it is in play. Kirk Cousins could be getting his final opportunity to show a team he can be their bridge starter. His contract includes an out, and Atlanta may feel compelled to exercise it given the $57 million at play. Kyle Pitts Sr. and Tyler Allgeier are pending free agents. The Falcons have no contract incentives in play.

The Saints hit their significant contract incentives with Juwan Johnson's big season. Most of the roster is under contract for 2026, with Taysom Hill the significant question mark. Chris Olave becomes extension eligible and would be looking to cap his best season before those negotiations. Olave can not claim the top spot in any receiving categories, though he could land inside the Top 5 for Saints seasons in all three triple crown categories of receptions, yards, and touchdowns. There is hope Devin Neal can return from the hamstring injury that has cost the last couple of weeks. Cameron Jordan could be playing his final game with the franchise; he is the Saints' all-time sack leader.

Cleveland (4-12) at Cincinnati (6-10) (CBS)

Early Line: Cincinnati -7.5, Total 44.5

Cleveland Motivation: 0/10

Projected Draft Position: 6th Overall (Range: 2nd pick to 7th pick, Current SoS: .491)

Cincinnati Motivation: 0/10

Projected Draft Position: 11th Overall (Range: 8th pick to 12th pick, Current SoS: .517)

The Browns got the chance to play spoiler to rival Pittsburgh in Week 17 and came through, but the win took them out of the running for the 1st overall pick. They can still reach 2nd, but it would take the Giants, Cardinals, Jets, and Titans to all win. Unlikely. A win drops them to 7th at the lowest, as there is a two-win gap between 7th and 8th.

The Bengals also won in Week 17, though their win over Arizona did not carry the silver lining of ruining Pittsburgh's weekend. Both teams are playing their starters as Zach Taylor announced Joe Burrow would be on the field.

Fantasy Impact: The Browns are chasing history, with Myles Garrett going for the NFL sack record. Stellar rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. is unlikely to play after leaving Week 17 with an injury. The Browns have been without David Njoku for multiple weeks; he could move into second on the team's reception list. The Browns have a void option on Njoku's deal, and he carries a massive $24 million cap hit. If active, he could be playing his final game with the franchise, given Fannin's emergence. The Browns have no other notable pending free agents.

The Bengals are also pursuing milestones. Ja'Marr Chase could break his own team record for receptions in a season, needing ten. Chase Brown could record his first 1,000-yard season, while Tee Higgins could set a career high for touchdown receptions. Samaje Perine is the only Bengal chasing obtainable contract incentives, though it would take 160 rushing yards. Joe Flacco, Noah Fant, and Tanner Hudson are pending free agents.

Revenge: Joe Flacco, Trayveon Williams

Dallas (7-8-1) at NY Giants (3-13) (FOX)

Early Line: Dallas -5.5, Total 52.5

Dallas Motivation: 0/10

Projected Draft Position: 16th Overall (Range: 11th pick to 18th pick, Current SoS: .436)

NY Giants Motivation: 0/10

Projected Draft Position: 2nd Overall (Range: 1st pick to 7th pick, Current SoS: .531)

The Giants and the Raiders are the only teams capable of getting the #1 overall pick. The boost to the Jets' SoS after adding Buffalo in Week 18 will take them out of the running, while Tennessee and Arizona's metrics are already too high. They showed in Week 17's dominant tankathon win over the Raiders that they are still trying. The team will have a new coach and was not shy in saying everyone on the roster, including Jaxson Dart, would be evaluated following the season.

Brian Schottenheimer confirmed that the Cowboys will play their starters in Week 18. The Cowboys played everyone against the Commanders in Week 17 in a similar situation. The tie against Green Bay takes tiebreakers out of the conversation; they would pick behind all the teams with seven wins or behind all the eight-win teams.

Fantasy Impact: Week 2's 40-37 shootout showed everyone is a go here for fantasy purposes.

Dak Prescott can set the franchise's all-time passing touchdowns record. He already owns the yardage record. He can also set the franchise record for single-season yardage. George Pickens is set to be a free agent, looking to hit the market on a high note. Wan'Wan'Dale Robinson is in a similar position for the Giants. Both tight end Jake Ferguson and running back Javonte Williams were removed from the Christmas Day game against Washington with injuries. Malik Davis would be the top back if Williams is out, and can be on the radar in the deepest leagues even if Williams starts. Tight end Theo Johnson missed Week 17 with an illness for the Giants; he should be good to return. Tyrone Tracy Jr. has led a 65-35 split with Devin Singletary over the second half of the season.

Pickens, Robinson, Williams, Davis, Cowboys receiver Jalen Tolbert, and Giants tight end Daniel Bellinger are all potential free agents looking to end the season on a high note. Neither team has significant contract incentives in play.

If things go even a little off the rails over the 16 games Jokić is set to miss at a minimum, they could find themselves in a nasty fight for a top-six seed.","Nikola Jokić suffered a left knee hyperextension during the Nuggets' loss at Miami on Monday. That's good news, relatively speaking. There was legitimate fear of an ACL.

The bad news is Jokić is expected to be out at least four weeks, and probably more than that as that is just the date for reevaluation. That changes quite a lot -- both for the Nuggets, who are currently sitting right on the West's 10-loss cut line for a top-four seed, and for what was shaping up to be a photo-finish MVP race.

SGA is the runaway MVP leader now

Jokić hasn't missed a single game this season, but with the Nuggets slated to play 16 games over the next 28 days, he'll finish with a maximum 66 games played. The cutoff for MVP is 65 games played. That mean Jokić would have to come back on the shortest timeline possible and not miss one game the rest of the season to be eligible for MVP. Not going to happen.

This totally clears Gilgeous-Alexander's path to a second straight MVP (-450 to win, per BetMGM), and that would change his historic standing pretty considerably. Going from one to two MVPs is a big leap. Kobe Bryant never won a second. Neither did Shaq. Kevin Durant only has one.

All told, only 15 players in NBA history have won multiple MVPs, with 10 of them having won at least their second by the time they turned 27: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Jokić, Moses Malone, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Tim Duncan and Bob Petit.

If this happens, Gilgeous-Alexander would become the 16th to win at least two and the 11th to do so by the age of 27. With two MVPs, he would jump into the class of Curry, Duncan, Antetokounmpo and Petit and Steve Nash -- with a long runway in front of him and a team built to keep him in MVP position for years to come.

Can a sleeper MVP emerge?

It's unlikely if SGA stays healthy, but it's worth mentioning the guys who are now elevated into the tier where circumstances could break their way and they have one less hurdle to jump with Jokić out. These guys would include Cade Cunningham (+4000), Jalen Brunson (+6600) and Jaylen Brown (+25000), who are leading the top three teams in the East right now and are having absolutely incredible seasons.

Tyrese Maxey (+15000) is doing the same, but the Sixers almost certainly aren't going to win enough games to give him a real chance. In the West, Kevin Durant (+100000) and Alperen Sengun (+100000) would likely split each other's vote from Houston. Victor Wembanyama (+5000) has already missed 12 games, so he'll probably end up ineligible.

Luka Doncic (+375) is the West's wild card. If the Lakers were to get red hot and take over Denver's spot in the standings as a top-three team, he could get some love if he puts up crazy numbers. Anthony Edwards (+20000) is someone to watch for the same reasons if the Wolves, currently No. 6, make a huge run.

At the very least, all these guys are now in position to get higher votes than they were before Jokić went down. But again, something unforeseen would have to happen to SGA and/or the Thunder for someone else to actually win.

Where does this leave the Nuggets?

This is the big question. Denver is currently No. 3 in the West but tied in the loss column with the No. 4 Rockets and No. 5 Lakers. As well as they've played, they're only three games above the play-in line in what is a bumper-to-bumper Western Conference race. If things go even a little off the rails over the 16 games Jokić is set to miss at a minimum, they could find themselves in a nasty fight for a top-six seed.

The good news is the Nuggets have gotten marginally better with Jokić off the court than they have been dating back to the championship season, but let's keep this in proper perspective. They still struggle in a big way without him, as any team would absent the best player in the world.

Beyond the numbers, the Nuggets are equipped with more players who can scale up their offensive output this season. Jonas Valanciunas will slide into the starting center spot. Tim Hardaway Jr. can crank up. Cam Johnson has finally gotten on track from 3. Peyton Watson can play. Aaron Gordon is due back from injury soon. Jamal Murray is having the best regular season of his career.

There's a big difference, however, in scoring the way Murray has with Jokić running the show and consuming so much attention and doing so as the No. 1 option on whom defenses will now be disproportionately focused. It doesn't bode well for the Nuggets that so far this year, when Murray has had to play without Jokić, they have been outscored by eight points per 100 possessions with what would rank as a bottom-five offense and defense, per CTG.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/30/a8ee5a1e-7e89-4f11-b6d3-cb8cc9e32079/thumbnail/1200x675/ebf503249a87f192161bb433304eb632/jokic-getty.png,N,,2025-12-31 10:00:59.248683

You just try to take care of your guys and get them as ready for that short week as much as you can.""","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The San Francisco 49ers began preparation for Saturday's showdown against the Seattle Seahawks with two of their best players -- left tackle Trent Williams and running back Christian McCaffrey -- sitting out Tuesday's practice.

Though Williams and McCaffrey don't normally participate in the first practice of the week because of veteran rest days, the pair showed up on Tuesday's participation report with actual ailments. In Williams' case, it was an injured right hamstring suffered in Sunday's win against the Chicago Bears. McCaffrey was a new addition because of what coach Kyle Shanahan described as back stiffness.

Of the two, Williams' status for the game against Seattle appears to be more tenuous. Shanahan said there isn't yet a determination on how much time Williams could miss after injuring the hamstring on the first play of last week's game. He did leave the door open for Williams to play against the Seahawks, though that will be difficult, especially on a short week.

""Not sure how long [he'll be out],"" Shanahan said. ""He's got a shot for this week.""

McCaffrey was more adamant about his status, saying the back issue is ""not serious"" in his weekly meeting with the media. Shanahan indicated McCaffrey has been fighting the back stiffness since the Dec. 14 game against the Tennessee Titans.

""I know he battled it hard that week, but I haven't heard anything about it since,"" Shanahan said. ""It might have stiffened up in the game, and it was sore from Sunday night, so that's why we've got him on here today.""

In better news for the 49ers, tight end George Kittle was a limited participant in Tuesday's practice after missing last week with a sprained left ankle. Kittle injured the ankle against the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 22, then didn't practice last week or play against the Bears.

Kittle's participation in practice is a positive sign, but Shanahan wasn't ready to declare that Kittle will return this week just yet since the Niners didn't have anything close to a full-speed practice Tuesday.

""I wouldn't assume that [he'll play this week],"" Shanahan said. ""We're barely moving today. We have a short week, so we won't be doing much all week.""

Defensive lineman Keion White (groin) and fullback Kyle Juszczyk (hip) also did not practice because of lingering issues from the win against Chicago.

Like Kittle, receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee), cornerback Upton Stout (concussion) and defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) were limited.

Saturday's game comes with significant stakes: The winner will be the NFC's No. 1 seed, which comes with a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Shanahan and the Niners weren't thrilled with the game landing on Saturday because it leaves them less time to rest and recover from injuries for a second straight week.

""Once you find out, you spend 10 seconds bitter about it then you say it is what it is,"" Shanahan said. ""Everyone's got to deal with it sometimes, that's just how it is. So, you get frustrated but nothing you can do after that. Then you've got to make the adjustments to make sure you're right for that day. ... You just try to take care of your guys and get them as ready for that short week as much as you can.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1229%2Fr1594587_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 06:58:38.235618

How would you grade the Patriots’ performance in Week 17?","The New England Patriots. took care of business against the New York Jets on Sunday, living up to their status as a 13.5-point favorites by completely dismantling their opponent. The Patriots jumped to a 42-3 lead midway through the third quarter and ended up winning 42-10 after taking their foot off the gas down the stretch.

The game did not only see several noteworthy performances on both sides of the ball, but an impressive all-around outing from the newly-crowned AFC East champions.

Patriots position grades from NFL Week 17

Quarterback: Even if we are regarding the quality of the opponent — or lack thereof — Drake Maye was outstanding. He led the Patriots to six touchdowns in his six drives, and when he was pulled after the final TD had completed 19 of 21 passes for 256 yards with five touchdowns to five different receivers. He also posted 1.24 expected points added per play, the highest such mark in the NFL this season for a quarterback. The new MVP frontrunner was spectacular, and even his backup fared well: Joshua Dobbs went 3-for-4 for 30 yards in his one-and-a-half quarters of work. | Grade: A

Running back: The first game between the Patriots and Jets in Week 11 was the TreVeyon Henderson show. On Sunday, Rhamondre Stevenson had his day in the sun: the veteran, who missed that November meeting with a toe injury, finished with 102 scrimmage yards and a pair of touchdowns on 14 touches. Henderson also remained actively involved, though, and led the team with 82 rushing yards. Even backup D’Ernest Johnson contributed 5 yards to what was a 156-yard outing on the ground for New England. | Grade: A

Wide receiver: Down starters Kayshon Boutte and Mack Hollins, the Patriots turned to rookies Kyle Williams and Efton Chism to take on a bigger workload. The pair delivered, catching a combined five passes for 50 yards and a Chism touchdown. The star of the show at wide receiver, however, was Stefon Diggs: the veteran caught all six of his targets for 101 yards and a score. The least prominently-featured of the bunch was DeMario Douglas, who played just nine snaps after carrying the questionable label into the game; he finished with one 10-yard reception. | Grade: A

Tight end: Facing some turnover at wide receiver, the Patriots decided to get both of their top tight ends actively involved in the passing game. They, too, rose. up to the occasion: Hunter Henry caught three passes for 49 yards and a touchdown, while Austin Hooper finished with two receptions for 11 yards and a score. The pair also looked good in the blocking department, with Henry in particular standing out. Fullback/tight end hybrid Jack Westover, on the other hand, was more hit-and-miss before exiting the game with an ankle injury in the early fourth quarter. | Grade: A-

Offensive line: Even with left guard Jared Wilson out, the Patriots offensive line did not skip a beat against the Jets. The Patriots’ quarterbacks were hit just four times all game — including a roughing the passer penalty drawn by Drake Maye — while the running backs found big holes for much of the afternoon. That said, the running game was a bit streaky even before the team decided to mix up its personnel with the game already decided. | Grade: B+

Defensive line: Entering the game with sack leader Harold Landry sidelined because of a knee injury and with neither Milton Williams nor Khyiris Tonga available along the interior, the Patriots took down Jets quarterback Brady Cook only once. It did not matter, because they were still disruptive enough to make Cook’s like uncomfortable. They also held firm on the ground, despite giving up 164 yards on 28 carries: most of that production came when the game was already way out of hand. | Grade: A-

Linebacker: No Robert Spillane, no problem. While the rushing total mentioned above could have been a problem it really did not change the nature of the game: the Jets had only 50 yards on the ground at intermission, in large part because of the Jack Gibbens-led linebacker group making good reads at the second level and coming downhill quickly and decisively. | Grade: A

Cornerback: The Jets did some stat-padding in the second half and had a few positive plays against New England’s backups, but the first half was a no-contest — in large part because of a cornerback group shutting down the opposing wide receivers. Led by Pro Bowler Christian Gonzalez, the Patriots dominated in man-to-man situations and allowed Brady Cook to complete only a third of his attempts against man coverage. New York’s most dangerous receiver, Adonai Mitchell, was held to 22 yards on nine targets and three receptions. | Grade: A

Safety: Brady Cook entered Week 17 with a turnover-per-dropback rate of 5.8%, and it did not take him long to add to his tally. On just his third pass attempt of the day, he threw deep down the sideline only for Jaylinn Hawkins to come over for an easy interception. Hawkins and fellow starting safety Craig Woodson did not allow any deep passes and were actively involved in the blitz-heavy run plan. Both missed a tackle attempt, while backup run support was a bit too aggressive on Breece Hall’s long touchdown in the fourth quarter, but overall the performance was solid. | Grade: B+

Special teams: The Patriots’ return and coverage units played a solid game against what is a very competitive Jets unit, while both punter Bryce Baringer and kicker Andy Borregales positively contributed as well. That said, the latter missed his lone field goal attempt in the third quarter, hitting the right upright from 41 yards out, while New York was able to convert the firsts of its two fake punts in the same period. | Grade: B

All in all, the Patriots were the better team in virtually every area on Sunday. The grades above show it, and so does the lopsided final score: outside of a few minor hiccups here and there, they played a pretty flawless game.

“It might have stiffened up in the game (against the Bears),” Shanahan said.

McCaffrey, who has regularly missed the first practice session each week this season, said the injury is “nothing serious.”

Williams tweaked his hamstring on the first play against the Bears while trying to make a tackle after an interception and didn’t return. Williams, 37, told Shanahan after the game that he had never pulled a hamstring before in his 15-year career. The coach said Tuesday he wasn’t sure how long Williams would be out, adding that the veteran will “give it a shot this week.”

Kittle missed the game against the Bears with a sprained ankle he suffered in Week 16 against the Indianapolis Colts. He will be limited in Tuesday’s practice, and Shanahan cautioned that Kittle’s participation does not necessarily put him on track to play against Seattle, as San Francisco’s practices will be light.

“I wouldn’t say that (Kittle has a good chance),” the coach said. “We’re barely moving today. It’s walk-through. With the short week we got, we won’t be doing much all week.”

The winner of the matchup between the 13-3 Seahawks and the 12-4 49ers will claim the No. 1 seed in the NFC, a first-round bye and home-field advantage. The Niners could fall as far as the No. 6 seed with a loss.

Further details including the nature of the injuries or when Mayfield sustained them were not clear. The Bucs didn't initially provide more information about the injuries other than listing him as limited at practice.

How will injury impact Saturday's Panthers-Bucs game?

There's no indication the injuries threaten Mayfield's status for Saturday's game against the Panthers. But they're cause for further concern around a Bucs team that's floundered in the second half of the season and enters Week 18 having lost seven of its last eight games to surrender control of the NFC South.

Mayfield's play has suffered alongside that of his team. Mayfield posted four games with a quarterback rating higher than 100 as the Bucs got off to a 6-3 start. He's not eclipsed that number since Week 10 and has four games in that time frame with a rating below 80.

Now he's dealing with new injuries ahead of Tampa Bay's biggest game of the season. The Panthers would clinch the NFC South and the division's only playoff berth with a win by securing the best record at 9-8.

Rice picked up a knee injury in Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion after starting the game at right-back.
“That swelling (on his knee) has to come right down for him to have the chance to function.
“Big Gabi comes back from injury after six weeks, which probably should have been a bit longer,” he said in his post-match press conference.
“And he impacts the game in an incredible way, both defending and in the opposition box.”","Mikel Arteta has revealed that Declan Rice is “improving” and could be in contention to make his return for Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Bournemouth.

Rice picked up a knee injury in Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion after starting the game at right-back. He was able to play on and finish the game, and was hopeful of being fit to play a part in Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Aston Villa but was left out of the squad entirely for the 4-1 victory at Emirates Stadium.

The injury is not thought to be too serious, and when asked if the England international had a chance of coming back into the Arsenal squad for their trip to the Vitality Stadium on January 3 Arteta responded: “It depends.

“That swelling (on his knee) has to come right down for him to have the chance to function. He wasn’t available to do that today yet. He’s improving. Let’s see where he is in the next couple of days.”

While there are concerns over Rice, there was at least some positive news for Arteta who was able to welcome Kai Havertz and Ben White to the squad back for the Villa game.

Gabriel also returned to the starting XI after a lengthy spell out with a thigh injury to nod home the opening goal of the match, prompting praise from Arteta.

“Big Gabi comes back from injury after six weeks, which probably should have been a bit longer,” he said in his post-match press conference. “He comes against the team that is probably hardest to control — especially the front players and the striker that they have in terms of their movement.

“And he impacts the game in an incredible way, both defending and in the opposition box.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/30180537/GettyImages-2252877314-scaled-e1767136085494.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-30 23:59:22.044839
,,2025-12-31 03:21:34+00:00,www.vikings.com,NFL Power Rankings: Vikings Push Win Streak to 4 Entering 2025 Season Finale vs. Packers,Sam Thiel,,,,,https://www.vikings.com/news/nfl-power-rankings-2025-week-18,"Smith – who will turn 37 in just under five weeks – delivered another vintage performance in Purple (or in this case, Winter Whiteout) against the Detroit Lions on Christmas Day at U.S. Bank Stadium.

That's why this season hasn't buried my belief in O'Connell, and I am still willing to envision a scenario where J.J. McCarthy starts putting it together next year.
The Vikings are 8-8 despite a team passer rating of 74.3, which ranks 31st in the NFL.
The question will be how to get that upgrade at QB, whether it's from J.J. McCarthy or elsewhere.","Smith – who will turn 37 in just under five weeks – delivered another vintage performance in Purple (or in this case, Winter Whiteout) against the Detroit Lions on Christmas Day at U.S. Bank Stadium. The Vikings safety nabbed his 39th career interception to go along with a sack (No. 21.5 of his 14-year career), a pair of tackles for a loss and a trio of passes defensed. He also made his 202nd career regular-season start, moving ""The Hitman"" past Pro Football Hall of Famer and Vikings Ring of Honor member Carl Eller for third in franchise history.

With their savvy defensive veteran leading the way, the Vikings (8-8) dominated Detroit (8-8), forcing six takeaways and sacking Lions quarterback Jared Goff five times in a 23-10 rout. Detroit entered the game with only eight giveaways as an offense all season, which was the fewest in the NFL. According to Next Gen Stats, the Vikings also held the Lions to a season-low offensive success rate of 29.7 percent. Detroit's previous low in the category was 33.9 percent, which also came against Minnesota in Week 9.

Thursday was the 34th time in franchise history Minnesota has recorded at least six takeaways in a game and its first since Week 15 of the 2019 season (the Vikings forced seven turnovers at the Chargers in a 39-10 victory). Of those 34 instances, seven have come against the Lions, which is the most against any opponent. Minnesota is 25-7-2 all time when tallying six or more takeaways in a game and has won 21 consecutive games when doing so going back to the 1973 NFC Championship Game at Dallas.

The game also marked just the second time ever the Vikings have won the turnover battle 6-0 or better. The only other occurrence was in Week 8 of the 1975 season when Minnesota forced eight Atlanta turnovers and didn't turn the ball over in a 38-0 shutout victory.

Additionally, the win gave Minnesota its first season sweep of Detroit since 2020. Last year, the Vikings swept Green Bay in the regular season for the first time since 2017; coincidentally, Minnesota not only accomplished both feats in Week 17 home victories, it also occurred in the 50th regular-season game for Head Coach Kevin O'Connell (last year) and Defensive Coordinator Brian Flores (Thursday) in their coaching roles with the Vikings.

I know Kevin O'Connell can coach. He has logged 13- and 14-win seasons, somehow kept his 2023 team competitive with a mishmash of quarterbacks and essentially has done the same in 2025 with significant shortcomings at the game's most important position. Winning a divisional bout with 3 net passing yards is something I'd brag about at parties. At 8-8, the Vikings can finish a trying season with a winning record by beating Green Bay at home – and the Packers are locked into the No. 7 seed, meaning they'll likely rest players on Sunday. That's why this season hasn't buried my belief in O'Connell, and I am still willing to envision a scenario where J.J. McCarthy starts putting it together next year. We'll see if another team tries to poach Brian Flores for a head-coaching opening, and Harrison Smith could retire, but I suspect this is still a team that can compete in 2026.

WR Justin Jefferson's 59.2 receiving yards per game are, by far, the fewest of his career − through no fault of his own. But hit that average in Week 18, and he'd join Mike Evans and Randy Moss as the only players to top 1,000 in each of his first six seasons.

Minnesota has won four in a row, restoring the can't-miss-kid status to Kevin O'Connell that had started to wane after a 4-8 start that saw the Vikings eliminated from the playoffs. Still, O'Connell has ultimately tied his fate to that of quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who missed Thursday's game with a hand injury and has only started nine games in two years. The results have been mixed (5-4 with an EPA that ranks 52nd among quarterbacks with more than 100 pass attempts in the last two years).

Last season, the Colts won eight games despite a team passer rating of 75.8, which was 31st in the NFL. They got better quarterback play in 2025 and were 7-1 before a losing streak and injuries derailed them. The Vikings are 8-8 despite a team passer rating of 74.3, which ranks 31st in the NFL. The Vikings are clearly good enough to be a playoff team in 2026 with decent quarterback play. The question will be how to get that upgrade at QB, whether it's from J.J. McCarthy or elsewhere.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/ituebbn5gog8lzndxquw,N,,2025-12-31 01:57:57.019786

Tennessee players opted out of Music City Bowl

EDGE Joshua Josephs (NFL draft)

Joshua Josephs, the playmaking edge rusher, is projected as an early round NFL draft pick. ESPN analyst Matt Miller ranks Josephs as the No. 36 prospect in the 2026 draft class. He had 33 tackles, six tackles-for-loss, four sacks, six quarterback hurries, three pass breakups, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and a defensive TD. Josephs is a senior with no eligibility remaining.

LB Arion Carter (NFL draft)

That was the day general manager Omar Khan traded receiver Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers. While it was a necessary move to shake up some locker-room dynamics and part with a challenging personality, the other shoe never dropped. Khan never added another proven receiver to round out that room. During the subsequent season, the depth chart at the position looked like George Pickens … a huge gap … and then everyone else.

Many wondered who would fill the void at WR2. The real concern, though, was what happens if Pickens gets hurt?

That worst-case scenario came to fruition at the worst time, when Pickens pulled his hamstring that December. His ensuing absence coincided directly with the Steelers’ late-season tailspin. Pickens missed a Week 15 loss in Philadelphia and a Week 16 game in Baltimore, when the Steelers had a chance to clinch the AFC North. Even after Pickens returned, the Steelers never recovered.

Rather than learn from history, Khan and the Steelers repeated it. This offseason, the Steelers reshuffled their deck. They acquired DK Metcalf in a blockbuster trade and then, shortly after, dealt Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys. The receiver room looked different, sure, but the dynamic was awfully familiar. Pittsburgh had one star receiver at the top of the depth chart … a big gap … and then a lot of question marks.

At least that’s how most people who follow the Steelers saw it. Well, everyone except the person most responsible for putting the team together.

“We wouldn’t have done this if we didn’t feel good about the receiver situation (and) about our depth there,” Khan said shortly after trading Pickens. “I know people make a comparison about last year. It’s not even close to being the same.”

What’s the difference?

“Well, obviously, we made the investment with DK,” Khan said. “We’ve had another year with some of the young guys and gotten to know them and watch them develop. We added Robert Woods. Roman (Wilson’s) healthy.”

The fact that Woods was part of Khan’s answer tells you everything you need to know about how the Steelers have evaluated the wide receiver position.

Woods, if you even remember his Steelers tenure, was cut at the end of training camp and spent a week on the practice squad before being released. No offense to Woods, who he put together a solid 12-year career, but the fact that a 33-year-old in his 13th season was supposed to help provide depth at a critical position is almost laughable. None of the other 31 teams were willing to take the same gamble, as Woods’ career effectively ended when he was released.

At the same time, the “young guys” Khan mentioned — Calvin Austin III and Roman Wilson — have failed to take the anticipated step forward.

Austin looked like he was on a positive trajectory in 2024, when he caught 36 passes for 548 yards and four touchdowns. His production should have improved significantly this year, given that he was handed the WR2 role in camp. Instead, the 5-9, 162-pound receiver endured an oblique injury in camp that prevented him from developing chemistry with Rodgers, suffered a shoulder injury in Dublin in Week 4 that kept him out a month and now is recovering from a hamstring injury. For those who doubt Austin can thrive in the NFL at his size, his injury-marred season has done little to quell those concerns.

Even when he’s been healthy, Austin has been out of synch with Rodgers, especially on out routes that require timing near the sideline. How many times have we seen Rodgers barking at Austin after he’s failed to keep his feet in bounds? Austin enters Week 18 with 10 fewer targets, eight fewer receptions, 231 fewer receiving yards, two fewer touchdowns and four fewer games played than in 2024. Instead of taking a step forward, he’s regressed.

Wilson’s season has been even more disappointing. After a slow start, the 2024 third-round pick looked like he was beginning to earn Rodgers’ trust in the middle of the season. In Week 8, he caught four passes for 74 yards and a touchdown against the Packers. However, rather than building momentum, Wilson eventually slid down the depth chart and off the game-day roster entirely. He was a healthy scratch in three consecutive games, beginning with Week 14 in Baltimore. Active for the first time in a month on Sunday in Cleveland, Wilson played just nine offensive snaps and wasn’t targeted at all.

The lack of development and chemistry from those two would have been concerning on its own. It’s even more of a problem now that Metcalf has been suspended for the final two games of the season over an altercation with a Lions fan at Ford Field in Week 16.

It’s the same nightmare scenario that unfolded last year. A team that never answered its question at WR2 now has to fill Metcalf’s 6-foot-4, 230-pound void. To make matters worse, Austin missed Sunday’s loss in Cleveland with his third injury of the year.

Recognizing their need to upgrade, the Steelers have tried to remake their receiver room on the fly. They brought in a 31-year-old Marquez Valdes-Scantling and claimed 35-year-old Adam Thielen off waivers. Both players have put together careers worthy of respect and seem to be handling themselves like professionals. If either was WR3 or WR4, that would be reasonable, but when the Steelers trotted out this tandem in a pivotal Week 17 game as the top two receiving threats, that’s simply not a recipe for success.

The only way for things to get better this season is for the Steelers to beat the Ravens in Week 18, qualify for the playoffs and get Metcalf back for the postseason. That’s easier said than done, especially against the Ravens.

In the first meeting, the Ravens often dared the Steelers to throw it deep by challenging them with press-man and single-high coverages. Rodgers, who hadn’t hit a deep ball in weeks prior to that meeting, aired it out for four completions with 20-plus air yards. Yet with Metcalf suspended and Austin’s status uncertain, the Ravens would be wise to deploy a similar tactic.

If they do, and the Steelers’ undermanned receiving corps is unable to make plays, the Ravens would take control of the AFC North.

Here's the full first practice report for Week 18.","The San Francisco 49ers are once again dealing with new injury issues entering their vital Week 18 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks.

In a bit of good news, tight end George Kittle was back in practice after missing all three sessions before Week 17 and then missing the game. He's dealing with an ankle injury he suffered back in Week 16. The 49ers listed him as questionable for the game, but head coach Kyle Shanahan indicated Kittle was never able to test out the injury. His limited participation in practice would typically be a sign that injury is trending in the right direction, but Shanahan tamped down on the optimism.

""I wouldn’t assume that,"" Shanahan said when asked if Kittle's return was a sign of his improvement. ""We're barely moving today. It's a walk-through with the short week that we’ve got, so we won't be doing much all week.""

Beyond that, a trio of key starters were on the sidelines for the session including Trent Williams, Christian McCaffrey and Kyle Juszczyk.

There's a chance the 49ers are simply being cautious on a short week and they're not going to rush veterans into action. Tuesday's practice was the first of three for the week, so Wednesday and Thursday will give us a better idea of which direction those players are trending going into Saturday.

In eight games played this season, Diggs recorded 25 tackles with zero pass defensed and zero interceptions.
While Diggs said he felt good enough to play, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer plus team owner and general manager Jerry Jones felt differently.","The Dallas Cowboys announced Tuesday that they are releasing cornerback Trevon Diggs. The veteran defensive back is subject to waivers. If he passes through waivers, he will be free to sign with any team.

Any club that claims Diggs becomes responsible for the $472,000 he is due in base salary for Week 18, and $58,823 if he is active this week, per ESPN. Diggs signed a five-year, $97 million extension with Dallas prior to the 2023 season, in which he tore his ACL. While he is technically signed through 2028, there is no more guaranteed money remaining on his deal after this year.

Diggs' release was ""a cumulation of multiple factors both on and off the field,"" CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported. Clarence Hill Jr. of the DLLS Sports reported that Diggs requested to stay in the Washington, D.C. area after the Cowboys' Week 17 game against the Washington Commanders. The team denied the request, but Diggs, who is from the area, stayed back anyway.

""It is extremely unusual for teams to allow someone to not travel back when a hardship isn't involved,"" Jones noted.

Diggs played in the first six games of the season before an accident in his home landed him in concussion protocol. Dallas placed him on injured reserve after re-aggravating a knee injury, but he returned to the lineup in Week 16. In eight games played this season, Diggs recorded 25 tackles with zero pass defensed and zero interceptions.

It appeared Diggs and the Cowboys were headed for divorce earlier this month when the two sides disagreed over whether the cornerback should be activated off injured reserve or not. Diggs said he was healthy enough to play vs. the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15, but was not allowed to do so.

""Going into the week, that was the plan, for me to play. I was included in the game plan to play, and [Saturday] I was told I wasn't playing, so that's why I thought I was playing,"" Diggs said, via CBS Sports' Garrett Podell. ""It was a quick decision. I thought I was going to come out here and play, but they felt otherwise. That's just what it was.""

While Diggs said he felt good enough to play, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer plus team owner and general manager Jerry Jones felt differently.

""Diggs isn't healthy enough to be out there for us. Period,"" Jones said following the loss to the Vikings. ""You have to look at practices and if they practice good enough. Whether it's a limitation they've had in recent games or a long-term injury, you've got to make your mind up when you see him practice. When we looked at practice, we didn't like what we saw relative to his health and ability to make plays.""

Ultimately, Diggs was activated for the Week 16 matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers, and then played 100% of the defensive snaps during the Christmas victory over the Washington Commanders. However, Diggs is now being allowed a change of scenery.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/30/ae63f822-aff2-4afd-9818-8f24bc5f1b2e/thumbnail/1200x675/94cf6df97649d911dec869b800188e5d/trevon.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 01:58:11.334785

With only one week of regular season games left, every bit of news is all the more consequential as we inch closer to the playoffs and Super Bowl LX.

Who's hurt? Who's practicing? Who's starting? And who's on the hot seat? Here's the latest on what's happening around the league entering Week 18:

49ers' stars miss Tuesday's practice

Running back Christian McCaffrey and offensive tackle Trent Williams missed the San Francisco 49ers' Tuesday practice, according to head coach Kyle Shanahan. Both McCaffrey (back) and Williams (hamstring) sustained injuries during the 49ers game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday night. Williams, who got hurt on the first series of the game, has a more severe injury and may miss some time. The 49ers have a short week, hosting the Seattle Seahawks in a game that will decide the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the conference.

Colts starting QB Riley Leonard

After starting 44-year-old Philip Rivers for three consecutive weeks in place of the injured Daniel Jones, Indianapolis, which is eliminated from playoff contention, will start the rookie Leonard at quarterback in its road tilt against the Houston Texans, per ESPN. Anthony Richardson remains on injured reserve. In the four appearances he has made this season, Leonard has thrown two interceptions, recorded a 40.6 passer rating and completed 54.5% of his passes, while rushing for one score. The Colts have lost six consecutive games after beginning the season 8-2.

Bills QB Josh Allen expected to sit out Week 18

A little battered and visibly frustrated, Allen can use a rest, and he's expected to get one Sunday in what’s essentially a meaningless regular-season finale against the Jets. Aside from taking the opening snap to extend his streak of consecutive regular-season starts to 122, the longest active run among NFL quarterbacks, Allen is expected to watch the rest of the game from the sideline.

It's likely to be Allen's final game at the Bills' 52-year-old stadium, affectionately called ""The Ralph"" in honor of the late franchise founder and Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson. Next season, the Bills are set to relocate across the street to a new $2.1 billion home, already dubbed ""The Stadium Allen Built.""

More important, Allen will get an opportunity to allow his sore right foot time to heal before Buffalo opens the playoffs on the road in two weeks. Allen also certainly could use a mental break during a season in which he’s been relied upon to carry the offensive load too often. Competitive and remarkable as he’s been in combining for 39 touchdowns (25 passing, 14 rushing) and engineering four fourth-quarter comebacks, even Allen has limitations, which became readily apparent in a 13-12 loss to the Eagles on Sunday.

Chargers QB Justin Herbert will miss regular-season finale

Head coach Jim Harbaugh announced Monday that Herbert will not start for the AFC's No. 6 seed in Week 18 against the Broncos. Barring an unforeseen change, Herbert will finish his sixth NFL season with 3,727 yards, 26 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Backup Trey Lance will take over for the finale, allowing Herbert to enjoy some additional rest (particularly for his broken left hand) heading into the postseason.

Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown considered day-to-day

The Lions may finish the 2025 season without their star receiver. Head coach Dan Campbell announced Monday that St. Brown is ""day-to-day."" He appeared to suffer the injury late in the Week 17 loss to the Vikings. With the Lions eliminated from playoff contention, it's possible St. Brown sits out of the season finale, ending his fourth straight Pro Bowl season with 106 receptions for 1,262 yards and 11 touchdowns.

The timing couldn’t be much better San Francisco, which is heading into critical Week 18 win-it-all game against the Seattle Seahawks facing the possibility of being without all-world left tackle Trent Williams.

The 28-year-old Pleasants gave the 49ers Faithful a glimpse of what he’s capable of during the team's 42-38 win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday at Levi's Stadium. Williams sustained a hamstring injury on the first play from scrimmage and did not return, leaving the blind-side protection for quarterback Brock Purdy in the hands of a player who is the complete definition of journeyman.

“There's definitely a lot of things to clean up as far as the angles of some of my sets, and just stay staying on blocks a little bit longer,” Pleasants said of his performance in the win. “Just little things. The good thing is it's all stuff that I can control.

“For the most part it really came down to the preparation throughout the whole year. I felt ready. I felt comfortable. There's obviously a little bit of butterflies, like when you first step in, but after that first drive I felt really comfortable and good.”

It definitely showed.

Pleasants played 71 snaps while helping anchor an offensive line that paved the way for 42 points and nearly 500 yards of offense.

San Francisco 49ers

“He played a great game,” said left guard Spencer Burford, who was San Francisco’s swing tackle and Williams' backup before being moved inside due to other offensive-line injuries. “He just fell back on his training, everything that he does in practice, everything that he's been practicing all year.

“It's a standard that we hold ourselves to, really as a unit, just making sure that you try to plug and plug and play. We work together in practice, just building that chemistry there, just feeding off each other, making sure that we communicate. That's the biggest deal.”

Williams has not been ruled out for Saturday’s game at Levi’s Stadium. Coach Kyle Shanahan hinted Tuesday that there was a chance the All-Pro left tackle would be available, but in all likelihood Pleasants will make his first NFL start in the 49ers' biggest game of the 2025 season thus far.

It’s a long way, physically and mentally, from the path that Pleasants traveled to get to this point.

“I’ve bounced around a lot, so it's kind of validation for all the days that I thought this could be it and just persevering anyway,” Pleasants said. “I'm going to keep my head. There were definitely those moments that I felt [like quitting], but I know God's always got my back. Just trust him to do the work and he'll take care of the rest.”",https://media.nbcsportsbayarea.com/2025/12/austen-pleasants-GettyImages-2239261155-e1767144786180.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-31 01:58:15.876931

Diggs, 27, will now be subject to waiver. If he clears, he'll become a free agent and can sign with any team seeking cornerback depth ahead of the playoffs.

The release of Diggs marks the end of his six seasons in Dallas, which featured a mixture of ups and downs.

Let's take a look back at the timeline of Diggs' career with the Cowboys:

Cowboys draft Trevon Diggs in 2nd round of 2020 NFL Draft

After winning an All-SEC first-team season at Alabama in 2019, the Cowboys selected Trevon Diggs with the 51st overall pick in the second round of the NFL Draft. At 6'1, 205 with 32 ¾ in. arms, Diggs fit the bill of the taller, long armed corners that Dallas has preferred from a measurables standpoint.

Diggs was the eighth CB drafted in 2020, and joined a room in Dallas that had just lost Byron Jones in free agency to the Miami Dolphins. Now, the room was made of players like Diggs, Jourdan Lewis, Anthony Brown and Chidobe Awuzie.

Diggs' rookie season in 2020

Diggs earned a starting role for the Cowboys right off the bat, tallying three tackles in his first career start and game against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 1.

From there, Diggs would go on to continue his strong season until Week 9, where he left Dallas' game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth quarter with a foot injury. It was later discovered that he had a fractured foot, and the Cowboys placed him on injured reserve.

After missing four games, Diggs returned to the lineup and closed out his rookie season strong, finishing as the team leader in pass breakups (14) and interceptions (3) while also tallying 58 total tackles.

A record-breaking sophomore season

In Diggs' sophomore NFL season, he exploded onto the scene and leapt into the upper echelon of cornerback play in the NFL. Diggs started in 16 games for the Cowboys, tallying 52 total tackles and 21 pass breakups.

He also led the NFL in interceptions with 11, the most a player has ever had in a single season since Cowboys CB Everson Walls accomplished the feat in 1981. Diggs added 142 interception return yards and two pick sixes, both of which also led the NFL in their respective categories.

After the 2021 season, Diggs earned first-team All-Pro honors and was named to his first career Pro Bowl.

Another Pro Bowl season in 2022

Diggs followed up his stellar second season with another Pro Bowl campaign in 2022, starting in all 17 games for the Cowboys in their second straight 12-5 season.

Finishing the year with 14 pass breakups, three interceptions and a career-high 59 total tackles, things were continuing to go well as he headed into the final year of his rookie contract.

Diggs signs five-year, $97 million extension

In July of 2023, the Cowboys signed Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension which included $42.3 million guaranteed.

It was a huge pay day for the young corner, who in just 45 career games had already tallied 17 career interceptions and 49 pass breakups, helping the Cowboys be among the best in the NFL in takeaways over his first three seasons, including first in the league in 2021.

Things were looking up for Diggs and the Cowboys heading into the 2023 season on the heels of back-to-back 12-5 finishes.

Tragedy strikes in practice

Less than three months after signing his extension with the Cowboys, Diggs tore the ACL in his left knee during practice after two weeks of the regular season, ending his season early.

Diggs was having a promising start to his fourth year in the NFL, with three pass breakups and an interception already to his name in just two games.

Now, a long recovery process laid ahead of him to get back on the field for the Cowboys in 2024.

Diggs' return in 2024, injury struggles still linger

At the start of training camp in 2024, Diggs started the year on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list as he continued his recovery from the torn ACL the year prior. Then later on at camp, the Cowboys lost their other All-Pro CB DaRon Bland to a stress fracture in his foot, sidelining him for the first 10 games of the season.

Diggs would go on to start the first 10 games of the season for the Cowboys, recording two interceptions and eight pass breakups for Dallas' defense that had its fair share of struggles.

Then, Diggs suffered a groin injury after Dallas' 34-10 loss against the Texans and returned to the lineup just once more against the Bengals in Week 14 before news came out that Diggs needed surgery to repair a knee injury in the same knee as his ACL tear the year prior. Diggs would miss the remaining four games of the season.

A rocky start to training camp

Over the offseason, Diggs elected to do a majority of his knee recovery work outside of the Cowboys' facilities, and instead in South Florida. In his latest contract, Diggs had a clause that stated he needed to participate in 84.375 percent of the offseason program at the Cowboys' facility.

Ultimately, Diggs did not reach that threshold, and the Cowboys decided to enact the de-escalator in his contract that docked $500,000 off his 2025 salary.

""We expect a player paid like Trevon to be here all the time,"" Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones said in the team's opening press conference. ""We expect him to be leading, expect him to be leading, but that's not new.""

The next day, Diggs and fellow Cowboys teammate at the time Micah Parsons held a joint press conference with reporters. Both had each other's backs for their respective situations.

""At the end of the day, this is his business, his body, it's his body equity,"" Parsons said of Diggs' decision to recover outside of Dallas' facilities. ""He's gotta feel like he got to do what's best for his body. Like always, at the end of the day, if he's not available, what are they going to do? Get rid of him. So he's got to keep his body up to par.""

Micah Parsons is traded to the Green Bay Packers

Diggs and Parsons were very close friends on and off the field during their time together with the Cowboys. When Dallas traded Parsons to the Green Bay Packers in exchange for Kenny Clark and two first-round draft picks, Diggs was surprised.

""I think everybody was surprised,"" Diggs said. ""I was really surprised, I really thought it was going to get done so we could just stay a family. Just him being here all his years, but unfortunately that's not what God had for him.""

From Diggs' perspective, the decision that the Cowboys made to ultimately move on from his friend in Parsons seemed to be a mixture of business, and personal differences.

""It's definitely a business, but people always say never make it personal,"" Diggs said. ""But when you go out there and lay your life on the line, you're practicing hard, you're in the game, you're risking your body. It becomes personal because you care about it, you care about the game so much you want to win. It is a business at the end of the day, but it is also personal.""

Diggs suffers concussion, more knee issues midseason

After Diggs cleared his physical in late August and going through practices, he returned to the field for the Cowboys and started in four of Dallas' first six games of the 2025 season, starting the year on a pitch count to get his legs back under him.

After playing in those first six games, head coach Brian Schottenheimer announced that Diggs had suffered a concussion in an at-home accident just days before the Cowboys were set to play the Commanders in Week 7. Diggs later revealed that his concussion came from a TV mounting pole that fell on him as he tried to install it in his home.

A week later, Diggs was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury added to his injury status. He would go on to later say that there was some fluid that had built up in his knee that needed to be taken care of, which is why the team decided it would be best to sit him down and allow him to recover further.

Uncertainty continues to build about Diggs' future

As the weeks went on and Diggs got closer and closer to return, the 21-day practice window opened for Diggs to make his return to the field in 2025. A week before Diggs' window was getting ready to close, Diggs was under the impression he would play on Sunday Night Football in Week 15 against the Giants, but was kept on the designated for return list.

""Going into the week, that was the plan, was for me to play. I was included in the game plan to play."" Diggs said. ""Yesterday, I was told I wasn't playing, so that's why I thought that I was playing. It was a quick decision, I didn't know. I thought I was going to come out here and play, but they felt otherwise. That's just what it was.""

That came after Brian Schottenheimer and Jerry Jones both said they needed to see more from Diggs in all areas both on and off the field when each were asked about Diggs' return to the lineup. After finding out he wouldn't play against Minnesota, Diggs told reporters he was ""upset"" with the decision and voiced his frustrations with the team.

""Definitely disappointed, because I definitely thought I was coming out, going to play, being able to help these guys try to pull out a win,"" Diggs said. ""I think how it was handled, I didn't like that, because I thought that I was playing. It is what it is, try to focus on next week, see if I can show them whatever they want to see. I'm going to show them and go from there.""

""I love Dallas. Dallas is a great place,"" Diggs said. ""I've built great relationships with these guys, they're like my brothers, so of course I want to be here. But at the end of the day, it's a business. I don't know what the future holds, it's in God's hands. I'm just doing what I can do, showing up where I can show up, and go from there.""

Cowboys waive Diggs on December 30

The uncertainty came to a close on Tuesday, with the Cowboys making the decision to waive Diggs ahead of their season finale against the New York Giants.

Reid cemented his legacy in Kansas City with three Super Bowl titles, but his age, Patrick Mahomes’ season-ending ACL injury and the uncertainty swirling around Travis Kelce’s future have fueled speculation that he could step away as soon as 2026.

Despite those factors — including the Chiefs missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 — Reid confirmed his plans to return to the sideline in 2026. ""I mean, I think I'm coming back, right?"" Reid said in jest during a call with local reporters on Tuesday.

""If they'll have me back, I'll come back. You never know in this business. That's a tough one. But I plan on it, yeah.""

BULLET FIRED INTO ANDY REID'S OFFICE IN 2024 MONTHS AFTER TEAM WON SUPER BOWL: REPORT

The 67-year-old Reid is accustomed to answering questions about his future in February, after the Chiefs have played in the Super Bowl, which they had done each of the past three years. But he's less familiar with facing those questions in the final days of December, a time when the Chiefs have routinely been preparing for a postseason run.

Kansas City is 6-10 as it prepares for its season finale on Sunday against the Las Vegas Raiders.

Reid, who reportedly signed a five-year, $100 million extension with the Chiefs in April 2024.

Reid has 307 wins overall. He needs 18 to pass George Halas for third on the NFL's career list behind Belichick and Don Shula. While Reid's return to the sideline seems likely, the continuity of the rest of the coaching staff remains less certain. Matt Nagy, who is in his second stint as the Chiefs’ offensive coordinator, is in the last year of his contract.

Shortly before Mahomes underwent surgery to address damage to his left ACL and LCL, Reid expressed confidence in the quarterback's mindset regarding his rehab approach.

""He'll attack it, just like he does everything else,"" Reid said of Mahomes' upcoming rehab. ""There have been some pretty good quarterbacks who have had the same injury, and they've done pretty well after they came back. He'll get after it, and he's got good people here to rehab him. He'll be right on top of all of that.

""As long as the surgery goes well, as expected, then I would expect a fairly quick recovery for him just because of those factors.""

Kelce faced questions about retirement last season. He sparked more questions about his NFL future after he became less definitive about his 2025 playing prospects following the Chiefs’ loss to the Eagles in February's Super Bowl.

But a couple of weeks later, ESPN host Pat McAfee revealed Kelce sent him a message confirming he would return in 2025, which said, ""I'm coming back for sure.""

Kyle Shanahan said cornerback Renardo Green will practice in full after missing the previous two weeks with a neck injury.

McCaffrey was getting his back looked at during the game on Sunday night. Shanahan said McCaffrey’s back is stiff. Shanahan said McCaffrey has been battling a back injury up to the game as of two weeks ago. So, the Titans game: “I know he battled it hard that week. Hadn’t heard about it since. So, it might have stiffened up since. I know it was sore from Sunday night. That’s why we got him on here today.”

As for Trent Williams, “We’re not sure how long. Giving it a shot for this week. So, we’ll see.” Shanahan said Austen Pleasants, Williams’ replacement, played “good enough for us to win.”

With a short week and a quick turnaround, it’s safe to say the 49ers won’t have very physical practices this week. The team isn’t practicing until 5 p.m. PT on Tuesday and Wednesday. Part of that is to get the body clock right for a primetime game on Saturday. The other reason is to squeeze as much sleep recovery and treatment in as possible.

Shanahan said they are having to change quite a bit of the routine this week due to the Saturday schedule, from allowing players to arrive later to cutting some meeting time.

When Shanahan was asked if we can assume Kittle would play this week because he’s listed as limited, Shanahan said, “I wouldn’t assume that. We’re barely moving today. It’s a walkthrough, so the short week we got, we won’t really do much all week.”",https://platform.ninersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/115/2025/12/gettyimages-2253869110.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-12-31 00:58:14.359880

Sadly, he may not be able to build on those numbers in Week 18 after suffering an undisclosed shoulder injury against the Commanders.

While some teams continue to fight for playoff positioning, others have made health a priority as they enter the postseason or offseason. As a result, expect plenty of players to sit out Week 18 with others playing in a reduced or limited role. Let's do an all-Turf Burns look around the league for the regular season finale.

Josh Allen: The Bills quarterback underwent additional testing on his ailing foot after Sunday's loss to the Eagles. X-rays were performed on the area, and fortunately nothing significant was found. The decision for extra images was likely precautionary but a good indicator they are worried about the integrity of the foot. The injury does appear to be limiting his mobility on the field but not substantial enough to keep him off it. The good news is Allen has not been seen wearing a protective boot, suggesting they are not concerned with him bearing weight on the ailing foot. While the Bills have secured a playoff spot and could improve their seeding with a win against the Jets, resting Allen in Week 18 could be more beneficial for their postseason aspirations. Look for this to situation to be reevaluated on a daily basis as the team weighs all their options and closely assesses Allen's sore foot. Mitchell Trubisky would start if Allen is held out.

George Kittle: The 49ers tight end continues to nurse a low-grade ankle sprain that kept him sidelined for Week 17. San Francisco remains in contention for the top seed in the NFC but has indicated it will prioritize health over everything. The Niners face the Seahawks on Saturday night, reducing Kittle's recovery time by a day. This isn't ideal for a situation that is likely to be handled conservatively. Tread cautiously here even if Kittle is cleared to return.

Amon-Ra St. Brown: The Lions are no longer in playoff contention and may opt to protect their star wideout. St. Brown has been slowed by an undisclosed knee injury over the past few weeks and appears to have aggravated the issue in Week 17. Detroit currently considers St. Brown ""day-to-day,"" though those invested here should anticipate a carefully managed workload for him.

Cowboys Running Backs: Javonte Williams has been one of the better bounce-back stories in the NFL this season and serves as a good reminder about the difference between returning to play and returning to previous form. After tearing his ACL, PCL and LCL in Week 4 of 2022, Williams struggled in the two subsequent seasons but has looked sharp since signing a one-year deal with the Cowboys. Williams has thrived this season, rushing for more than 1,000 yards while finding the endzone 13 times. Sadly, he may not be able to build on those numbers in Week 18 after suffering an undisclosed shoulder injury against the Commanders.

Malik Davis excelled in Williams' absence, finishing with 103 yards on 20 carries. Davis suffered a right eye injury during the performance but doesn't believe it will stop him from suiting up against the Giants. It sounds like the injury is nothing more than a contusion with associated swelling. The swelling should improve throughout the week, making Davis a worthy waiver-wire option. Rookie Jaydon Blue has struggled to establish himself this season but could be active if Williams and/or Davis is limited or out.

Jake Ferguson: It's not just injured running backs in Dallas, as Jake Ferguson suffered a calf injury in the team's Christmas Day win over Washington. He luckily snagged a touchdown before the injury, salvaging the performance, but his availability for Week 18 remains in doubt. Calf injuries are the most commonly aggravated or reinjured strains among athletes, and Ferguson will carry an elevated degree of risk if he is able to suit up against the Giants. Consider healthier options to close out the season.

Marvin Harrison: Head coach Jonathan Gannon said his top receiver will suit up for the regular-season finale against the Rams, ""if he is healthy enough to play."" Harrison has been limited by injury since undergoing an appendectomy in the lead up to Week 11. He missed two games recovering before sustaining a heel injury that forced him out of two more games. Harrison appears to have aggravated the injury in Week 17's loss to the Bengals. Even if he is deemed ""healthy enough to play,"" it is hard to trust a guy who is averaging just 27.7 snapes over his past three games played. By comparison, Harrison averaged 53.3 snaps through the first 10 weeks of the season prior to the surgery and heel injury. Look elsewhere to close out the season.

Josh Jacobs: The Packers are locked into the seventh seed in the NFC and could use Week 18 as extended rest for several key players. Jacobs should be at the top of the list, as he looks to overcome lingering knee and ankle injuries. He finished with just five total touches in the loss to the Ravens, and it wouldn't be surprising if Jacobs is simply inactive against the Vikings.","https://res.cloudinary.com/rotowire/image/upload/ar_16:7,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto:custom_no_override,q_auto,w_800/xztbaq8bdeppbunpwsez.png",N,,2025-12-30 19:57:52.291293

The move comes just two years after the team signed Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension.

The 27-year-old will be subject to waivers before hitting the free-agent market. Due to the nature of Diggs' contract, a team would have to pay Diggs his $472,000 base salary for Week 18 and $58,823 if he's active for the game, per ESPN's Field Yates.

Since the rest of Diggs' contract wasn't guaranteed, the team that claims him wouldn't be on the hook for the remaining roughly $55 million Diggs would have received over the next three seasons if he remained with the Cowboys.

The possibility of Diggs being cut at age 27 seemed extremely unlikely after his first few seasons in the NFL. After being selected by the Cowboys in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft, Diggs turned in a modest rookie season.

He burst onto the scene in his second year, however, leading the NFL with 11 interceptions. That performance earned Diggs the first of two straight Pro Bowl nods and made him a first-team All-Pro.

He followed that up with a strong third season, picking off three passes and earning another Pro Bowl appearance.

Coming off two straight excellent seasons, Diggs was given a five-year, $97 million extension from the Cowboys in July of 2023. That deal proved to be ill-timed. Diggs played in just two games that season, tearing his ACL in practice ahead of Week 3. He was off to a decent start, already registering an interception and three passes defended before going down for the season.

Though he was able to return in 2024 in time to play in Week 1, Diggs didn't grade out well once back on the field, per PFF. After missing time late in the season with a groin injury, it was announced Diggs would sit out the remainder of the year to have surgery on the same knee in which he tore his ACL in 2023.

Diggs missed time in the offseason and training camp while recovering from surgery. He was able to return in time to play in Week 1, but once again posted poor metrics before a concussion sidelined him after just six games.

After sitting out eight games, Diggs returned to play in Week 16 despite the Cowboys already being eliminated from the playoffs. He registered six tackles in the contest. Diggs then played again just four days later, when the Cowboys took on the Washington Commanders on Christmas. Diggs played every single defensive snap for the Cowboys during that contest.

The Indianapolis Colts are turning to rookie Riley Leonard as their starting quarterback for Sunday's season finale at the Houston Texans, sources told ESPN, ending veteran Rivers' run after coming out of a five-year retirement.

Rivers, the longtime NFL great who retired after a single season with the Colts in 2020, rejoined the team earlier this month after the season-ending injury to starter Daniel Jones. With 2023 first-round pick Anthony Richardson Sr. also on injured reserve from a previous injury, the Colts were left with few options. Coach Shane Steichen, one of Rivers' closest friends, coaxed Rivers out of retirement because of his intimate knowledge of the offense and leadership capacity.

But with the Colts eliminated from playoff contention last weekend, the team had to weigh whether it made sense to continue starting the 44-year-old Rivers who is not in their future plans. Steichen said this week he was navigating the situation and planned to speak with Rivers before making a decision. Steichen seemed to acknowledge that Rivers had some desire to play.

""Bringing Philip in here to come here and play is what he wanted to do,"" Steichen said.

He added, ""Those are conversations that we're having with him to see how that goes. And that's pretty much it. Getting a feel for him.""

Rivers said after Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars that he'd accept any decision the team made. The Colts made the surprising move to sign Rivers in a desperate attempt to make the postseason. They were in the thick of the AFC playoff race when Jones was injured and, knowing they'd need consistent quarterback play to stay there, they took a flier on Rivers.

Indianapolis ended up 0-3 with Rivers under center, but he certainly gave their offense a fighting chance. It was no masterpiece, but Rivers was competent, completing 63% of his pass attempts (58-of-92) for 544 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions.

Sam Darnold and the Seahawks have won six in a row to take a one game lead into the final game of the regular season. Seattle is outscoring its opponents 29-18. Their stifling defense has allowed just 31 touchdowns through 16 games including just one last weekend in Charlotte to the Carolina Panthers in a 27-10 win.

Last weekend seemed to be a statement game for the 49ers. Brock Purdy and the Niners’ offense was at its season’s best in San Francisco’s 42-38 win over Chicago. Mr. Irrelevant completed 24 of 33 passes for 303 yards with three touchdowns. Christian McCaffrey rushed for 140 yards and a touchdown and caught four passes for 41 yards as San Francisco denied Chicago’s pursuit of the top overall seed in the NFC.

These teams met in Seattle to open the regular season. San Francisco won 17-13. Purdy threw for 277 yards and two touchdowns and McCaffrey picked up 142 total yards (69 rushing and 73 receiving).

However, Diggs has not been on the field nearly as much after signing the contract. In 2021 and 2022, he played 16 and 17 games, respectively, whereas in 2023 he played just two games as he tore his ACL in a September practice.

Diggs played 11 games in 2024, but was unable to recapture his form and was eventually placed on injured reserve to have another procedure done on his surgically repaired knee.

In 2025, Diggs played eight games as he spent time on IR with a knee injury — the same knee that had been surgically repaired — and with a concussion. The concussion stemmed from an accident he sustained at home.

In eight games in 2025, Diggs recorded 25 combined tackles with no interceptions. In 66 career games, all with the Cowboys, the former Alabama cornerback has 20 interceptions, 63 passes defended, two forced fumbles, and 240 combined tackles.

Both before and after the injury, Diggs' play was rocky, giving up catches and suffering miscommunication breakdowns.

Per Pelissero, Diggs' release was not the result of a single incident but rather the culmination of multiple factors over time -- both performance and other factors.

The Cowboys inked Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension in July 2023, with the corner coming off back-to-back Pro Bowl nods and a 2021 first-team All-Pro selection.

Injuries were also an issue this season as Diggs dealt with a knee injury and then suffered a concussion at his home in October.
Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer had talked about wanting to see more from Diggs on and off the field before making him active.
We just have to wait and see.” He was finally active for a game in Dallas’ Week 16 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.
Diggs, who had three years left on his contract, continued to say that he wanted to remain with the Cowboys beyond this season.","The Dallas Cowboys released veteran cornerback Trevon Diggs on Tuesday with one game remaining in the season.

From the team’s perspective, the move was a culmination of multiple factors, which included his performance on and off the field. The feeling was that it’s best for both parties to part ways.

Diggs never appeared to be a fit for defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus’ heavy-zone scheme. The two-time Pro Bowler has been at his best in his career when playing man coverage.

Injuries were also an issue this season as Diggs dealt with a knee injury and then suffered a concussion at his home in October. He was then placed on injured reserve. After he returned to practice Nov. 30, it was unclear when he’d be active for a game because of other behind-the-scenes issues with the team.

Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer had talked about wanting to see more from Diggs on and off the field before making him active.

“I don’t know the special requirements that I need to show that I can play,” Diggs said while he was practicing but not active for games. “I’ve been at practice. I’ve been practicing well, running around, doing what I’m supposed to. It’s not my decision, at the end of the day. We just have to wait and see.”

He was finally active for a game in Dallas’ Week 16 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. He then played again last week in the Cowboys win at Washington.

Diggs, who had three years left on his contract, continued to say that he wanted to remain with the Cowboys beyond this season. Diggs will cost the Cowboys about $5.8 million in dead cap money in 2026.

NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday that any team claiming Diggs would be responsible for his remaining $472,222 guaranteed game check this season, making it likely that he clears waivers and then will become a free agent.

Cornerback will be one of the Cowboys’ top offseason needs. DaRon Bland, who recently suffered a season-ending foot injury, and rookie Shavon Revel are expected to be two of their starters in 2026. But at least one more starting-caliber corner is needed. That other corner wasn’t expected to be Diggs. Had he not been released Tuesday, the two were likely to part ways in the offseason.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/30133901/GettyImages-2172216603-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-30 18:58:58.721580

“I’ll just say that there’s some plays throughout the game that we’re going to follow up with,” Macdonald said.
Why it matters: Shaheed impacts both the receiver rotation and the return game, a spot Seattle already had to patch together recently.

What It Means for the Seahawks vs. the 49ers If Shaheed can’t go, the ripple isn’t just at receiver.","Seattle Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald indicated December 29 that the team plans to likely follow up with the NFL regarding the play on which Pro Bowl wide receiver/return man Rashid Shaheed was injured, while also acknowledging he has no firm update yet on Shaheed’s status heading into January 2’s showdown with the San Francisco 49ers.

Asked what he thought of the play Shaheed was hurt on, Macdonald didn’t dive into specifics. But he made it clear Seattle wants clarity from the league on what was — and wasn’t — called.

“I’ll just say that there’s some plays throughout the game that we’re going to follow up with,” Macdonald said. “It’s just trying to understand what’s getting called, what’s not, and why… We want to defend our guys and make sure that they’re not getting put in harm’s way.”

Key details

Coach’s stance on the hit: Seahawks will “follow up” with the NFL on multiple plays, likely including the one Shaheed was hurt on.

Shaheed status: Macdonald said he has no updates and no timetable right now.

Why it matters: Shaheed impacts both the receiver rotation and the return game, a spot Seattle already had to patch together recently.

Mike Macdonald Hints Seahawks Will Send the Play to the League

Macdonald’s wording was careful, and that’s typical when coaches are trying to avoid turning officiating into a week-long sideshow. It’s also in an effort to protect their wallets and not draw any fines.

Still, the important part for Seattle fans is the signal: the Seahawks are not simply shrugging off the injury sequence as “part of football.” Macdonald’s comments suggested the team is going to press the league for an explanation on how the play was officiated and what the standards are going forward.

That matters even more with Seattle headed into a high-stakes matchup against a division rival, where every possession (and every special-teams rep) can swing the game.

Rashid Shaheed Concussion Update: “No Time Frames”

When asked directly about Shaheed’s situation, Macdonald said he doesn’t have anything concrete yet.

“I really don’t have any updates,” he said. “We just don’t have any update on time frames or anything like that… we’re really going to be playing that throughout the week.”

That puts Shaheed in the “true day-to-day” bucket as Seattle moves through a compressed practice week. In practical terms, the tells will be familiar: participation level (if any) midweek, any ramp-up later in the week, and whether the Seahawks have to plan for life without one of their most explosive open-field options.

What It Means for the Seahawks vs. the 49ers

If Shaheed can’t go, the ripple isn’t just at receiver. Macdonald already pointed to how quickly the return game can become an emergency when bodies go down, noting Cam Akers was asked to jump in with minimal reps after Seattle was suddenly missing return options.

In other words: Shaheed’s availability can affect field position, play-calling, and who’s active on game day.

Seattle’s offense has found ways to win games late — including leaning on the run game to close out wins — but losing an explosive return/receiver threat can remove one of the easiest ways to steal hidden yards, especially against a top opponent.

Diggs has been released by the Cowboys amid his injury-plagued season, ESPN reported Tuesday. Diggs will immediately hit waivers and could become a free agent if he clears waivers. If a team claims him, they'll reportedly be on the hook for the $472,000 base salary and $58,823 bonus he'd get for being active for Week 18.

Rumors of the Cowboys potentially moving on from Diggs grew in recent weeks as he spent nearly two months on injured reserve. He initially missed a game due to a concussion he suffered in an incident at home in October before getting placed on injured reserve later that month due to a right knee ailment.

Diggs eventually returned to the Cowboys' lineup in Week 16, but he's largely struggled this season. Opposing quarterbacks have posted a perfect passer rating (158.3) when they've targeted receivers Diggs has covered this season, as the cornerback has allowed three touchdowns in eight games, per Pro Football Focus.

Diggs briefly emerged as one of the best cornerbacks in football not long after the Cowboys selected him in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. That helped him get a five-year, $97 million extension ahead of the 2023 season. However, the two-time Pro Bowler has only played 21 games since then, tearing his ACL in the 2023 season and undergoing an operation to repair the same knee in 2024.",https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1408/814/trevon2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-30 14:59:33.726640

In the first meeting of 2025, back on Oct. 12 in Pittsburgh, Garrett had 0 sacks, and the Browns lost.
ANSWER: I have to admit, your question made me chuckle, because usually I get the other version of this question.
They've gone from the possibility of their last two games being meaningless to potentially being eliminated by a Ravens team that looked unstoppable in Green Bay.
Is there anything fans can do to request certain announcers NOT BE on Steelers games?","DONNIE BROWN FROM VAN BUREN, ME: Is it me or did the Steelers offense try harder to not let Myles Garrett get a record-breaking sack instead of playing to win the game?

ANSWER: What the recent history of the Steelers-Browns series told anyone who was paying attention was that Myles Garrett's individual success is tied closely to his team's success. Here is a snippet from what I wrote for Steelers.com after the 13-6 loss on Sunday to the Browns:

""But when it comes to the Browns, home or on the road, what the Steelers had experienced in the last 5 installments of this series is that if Myles Garrett is allowed to wreck the game, he wrecks it. In 2023, when Garrett had 2 sacks vs. the Steelers, the Browns won; when he had 0, they lost. Same thing in 2024. When he had 3 sacks, the Browns won; when he had 1, they lost. In the first meeting of 2025, back on Oct. 12 in Pittsburgh, Garrett had 0 sacks, and the Browns lost.

""Granted, there was added spice to Sunday's game because Garrett was looking for 1 sack to break the all-time NFL single-season record in that category, but the attention paid to preventing Garrett from getting to Aaron Rodgers was primarily about beating the Browns and clinching the division title. Preventing him from breaking the record came along with that.""

FRITZ SCHERZ FROM VERONA, NY: Like all in Steelers Nation, I was disappointed in the result vs. the Browns. My question: Is there a stat for dropped interceptions? I'm asking because it seems like this year the Steelers had more dropped interceptions than previous years.

ANSWER: There is no official NFL statistic kept for dropped interceptions, but there are some analytics sites that take a shot at that. But like all analytics sites, in my opinion, there is a lot of guessing and speculation involved.

DOUGLAS PIPER FROM STATE COLLEGE, PA: I'm sure many will ask this question, but do you have any thoughts on why the offense had trouble moving the ball all day in Cleveland, but was able to quickly drive from their 20-yard line to the Browns 7-yard line at the end of the game?

ANSWER: I have to admit, your question made me chuckle, because usually I get the other version of this question. As in, why did the Steelers defense stop the opponent for three quarters of the game and then allow the opponent to move it up and down the field in the fourth quarter? I suspect the answer to your question is that the Browns knew that the Steelers had to score a touchdown to tie the game and had no timeouts left, and so they made the decision to force the offense to complete passes in the middle of the field to keep the clock running and count on their No. 1 pass defense to make a play.

TOM HENSON FROM MARTINSVILLE, IN: It's well documented that the Steelers never seem to take the easy road. The disparity between the two possible scenarios leading into Week 17 was enormous. They've gone from the possibility of their last two games being meaningless to potentially being eliminated by a Ravens team that looked unstoppable in Green Bay. Can you recall a time when the Steelers (or any team) has had their playoff scenario change this drastically in literally one weekend?

ANSWER: First of all, in order for the Week 17 game vs. the Browns to be meaningless for the Steelers, the Packers had to beat the Ravens. That was totally out of the Steelers' hands. As to that outcome, were the Ravens really unstoppable, or was the Green Bay defense simply not ready to do what was necessary to minimize Derrick Henry in a game where Baltimore's quarterback was going to be Tyler Huntley instead of Lamar Jackson? Anyway, the facts are that the Steelers entered last weekend's games with two different ways to clinch the AFC North Division – a Ravens loss on Saturday, or a Pittsburgh win on Sunday. Neither of those happened, and so the Steelers now have another chance to clinch the division and the home playoff game that comes with that by defeating the Ravens on Sunday night. Everything else is speculative drama.

MIKE PALOMBO FROM McMURRAY, PA: I've read varying reports about the Steelers decision not to void the guaranteed money remaining in DK Metcalf's contract. What is actually correct? Has the team already decided not to void this money? If the decision hasn't yet been made, what is the deadline for doing so?

ANSWER: My sense is that the ""varying reports"" you read were speculation, because what you're asking about is not something the Steelers typically make public, and I would doubt they are going to change that policy of revealing detailed matters involving contracts in this instance.

JACK G. FOSTER FROM ROUNDUP, MT: Is it just me or does the rest of the fan base think that the game announcers (Tony Romo in particular) hate the Steelers? Romo never says anything positive about us but always says positive things about the other team. Is there anything fans can do to request certain announcers NOT BE on Steelers games?

ANSWER: No. There is nothing fans can do to impact which announcers are assigned to which games. That's the sole purview of the network broadcasting the game.

JOE LaMOLINARE FROM DALLAS, GA. I see quite a few players wearing face shields on their helmets. Are QBs allowed to wear shaded face shields to prevent the defense from reading the QB's eyes?

ANSWER: The way I believe it works for a defense is that when an attempt is being made to ""read the quarterback's eyes"" to determine where he's going with the football it will look at the quarterback's helmet and judge where he's looking by using the stripe on the top of his helmet as something of a pointer.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/jd5su1uqyxg3wqxqq2y5,N,,2025-12-30 18:01:02.738819

Patriots injury analysis: Week 17

QB Drake Maye: The Patriots’ starting quarterback being a bit slow to get up after taking a hit to the head in the second quarter, drawing a roughing the passer penalty and prompting head coach Mike Vrabel to sprint onto the field, could have been a scary moment. It ultimately wasn’t, because Maye looked fine right away and remained in the game without showing any limitations from the play. He went 8-of-9 for 97 yards and a pair of touchdowns from that point on, and overall played one of the most productive games in recent memory.

FB Jack Westover: New England’s fullback remained down after a kickoff with 14:51 left in the fourth quarter, but walked off under own power. After some time in the blue medical tent, he returned to the sideline trying to walk the injury off. Ultimately, Westover did not reenter the game after he was announced as questionable to return with an ankle ailment.

CB Charles Woods: The Patriots’ backup quarterback, who entered the contest questionable with a foot issue, showcased some apparent discomfort in his back after unsuccessfully trying to break up an 18-yard pass in the late fourth quarter. Woods remained in the game and no injury was announced.

What this means for the Patriots

The Patriots were down seven players heading into their game against the Jets, but that list growing ahead of the season finale seems unlikely: New England escaped without any obvious major injuries. The biggest question mark is Jack Westover, but head coach Mike Vrabel gave a positive update on his status on Monday.

“Sore, probably could have returned,” Vrabel said. “We’ll monitor him here in the next couple days. I don’t think it’s anything that is too significant, but we’ll just see how he progresses here when we get back to work.”

The Patriots will hold their first practice of the week on Wednesday, and will release an injury report later that day.

I’ll remind you that he ranks first all-time in points, 25th in rebounds, fourth in assists, sixth in steals, second in games played, first in minutes played, second in shots made, sixth in 3-pointers made, second in free throws made, first in All-Star selections (21), first in All-NBA selections (21), first in All-NBA First Team selections (13) and third in MVPs (four). And he’s still going. Happy birthday, LeBron!

About last night

A knee injury that could change everything

I thought about GIF’ing the play in which Nikola Jokić seemed to hyperextend his knee against the Heat on Monday. But I didn’t want to broadcast a replay of something you don’t want to see. The Nuggets’ superstar left the game at the end of the first half with the injury, after he limped off the floor to the locker room. Teammate Hunter Tyson stepped on Jokić’s foot in a way that made him take a bad step. Our Sam Amick reported that the results of Jokić’s medical tests will be known today.

Jokić is having one of the best seasons we’ve ever seen. He went into last night averaging 29.9 points, 12.4 rebounds and 11.1 assists. He’s leading the league in rebounds and assists. He has absurd 60.4/44.0/85.5 shooting splits. And he still managed to lead Denver (22-10) in points (21) in its 147-123 loss to Miami (18-15) despite not playing the second half.

Now we all just wait with bated breath and hope it’s not a serious knee injury. We’ll update tomorrow when we know more.

Cavs 113, Spurs 101: If it wasn’t for the Jokić injury, this would have led the night. Cleveland had a monster 37-23 fourth quarter to take control of this game. Donovan Mitchell only had 10 points on 12 shots, but Jarrett Allen put in 27 points. Victor Wembanyama’s 26 and 14 weren’t enough, and the Cavs (18-16) finally looked like the team we saw last year.

Raptors 107, Magic 106: Jamal Shead’s 19 off the bench helped erase a 20-point deficit as Toronto (20-14) held Orlando (18-15) to 12 fourth-quarter points. The Raptors had 50 bench points in this one.

Knicks 130, Pelicans 125: Zion Williamson had 32 and Saddiq Bey had 27 for New Orleans (8-26). But the Knicks (23-9) dished out 35 assists and knocked down 20 3-pointers to overcome it. Jalen Brunson had 28 and 10 to lead New York.

Thunder 140, Hawks 129: The good news is the Hawks (15-19) did not lose another game with Trae Young. That’s because he didn’t play. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s 39 for OKC (28-5) sent Atlanta to its seventh straight loss.

Suns 115, Wizards 101: Devin Booker struggled a bit with 22 points on 8-of-23 shooting. But Dillon Brooks helped with 26 and Collin Gillespie had 25 for Phoenix (19-13). Rookie Tre Johnson dropped 24 for Washington (7-24).

Wolves 136, Bulls 101: The Wolves (21-12) outscored the Bulls 81-53 in the second half. Chicago (15-17) lost both Coby White (calf) and Josh Giddey (hammy) in the first half.

Bucks 123, Hornets 113: Giannis Antetokounmpo had 24, Bobby Portis had 25 and Myles Turner had 23 as the Bucks lit up the Hornets for 52 percent from the field and 47 percent from deep.

Warriors 120, Nets 107: Steph Curry’s 27 points were enough for Golden State (17-16) to hold off a spirited effort by the Nets (10-20), who got 23 from rookie Egor Demin. Also, this happened.

Blazers 125, Mavs 122: Deni Avdija’s 27 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds were enough for Portland (14-19) to stop the Max Christie (25) comeback in this one. Cooper Flagg’s great stretch hit a speedbump; he had 15 points on 20 shots for Dallas (12-22).

Rockets 126, Pacers 119: This game was not as close as the score says. Indiana won the fourth 41-21 to make it look better. Kevin Durant dropped 30 on the Pacers (6-27), who have lost nine straight.

Fix the lottery?

We judge the NBA’s anti-tanking ideas

The NBA wants to fix tanking … again? Or for the first time? I’m not sure the league ever accomplished this, but it does believe flattening the lottery odds has helped curb tanking, along with the Play-In Tournament. I’m dubious that flattened lottery odds actually stopped any tanking, but the Play-In Tournament has helped a lot. You only get a few teams bailing on the season, rather than several.

As part of the NBA’s effort to fight illegal gambling incidents, the league wants to put a stop to teams tanking as blatantly as they have. Whether that’s setting up your roster for a season of feces ball or just deciding in the last couple of months that all your best players are coincidentally too banged up to play, tanking is a blight for the league. It’s hard to justify charging full price on tickets when teams tank. (They still do it, but it’s hard.)

The league has been brainstorming some ideas to help curb tanking further. David Aldridge wrote a great article on the problem being the lottery itself. This part struck me the most:

“Trying to make the lottery somehow ‘fairer,’ while at the same time discouraging teams from embarking upon it as a roster-building tool, is a contradiction of purpose — a fatal flaw in the whole apparatus of letting ping-pong balls determine the fate of billion-dollar franchises, rather than significant investment in infrastructure, coaching and development to make the players you have get better. Standing on your own two feet as an organization, not praying for lottery luck, is a much better predictor of adding difference-makers in free agency and/or trades, as more great players think your shop is where they want to be.

“But you’re either all in and competing for real, or you’re not. And there’s no way to reconcile those two contradictory approaches.”

That is perfectly and succinctly stated. I guess that’s why DA is literally in the Hall of Fame. There’s a lot of potential benefit to tanking, which is why Sam Hinkie went so hard with it with the 76ers over a decade ago. Most teams are subtle about it. Plenty of teams are accidental about it. And some teams are fine flaunting it in your face at some point. They do it because you can end up with a superhero to save your franchise. Sometimes, you can even end up with multiple superheroes.

You don’t always end up with a Wembanyama, but you still want to play the lottery odds to give yourself the best chance. Let’s go over some ideas and judge them on a “Fix It” meter of 1-10 hammer emojis.

NBA Idea 1: Freeze future draft-pick protections.

Fix it meter: 🔨🔨🔨. I think draft-pick protections can cause some trouble. We saw Dallas bow out of Play-In Tournament contention a few years ago to save its pick (it landed them Dereck Lively II). The idea is to get rid of anything between top-four protection and outside of the lottery. It could work a little, but I don’t see this changing anything but trades being made.

NBA Idea 2: No top-four picks in consecutive years.

Fix it meter: 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨. This prompts the conversation of whether it’s fair for a team to have a situation in which it lands a top-four pick one year and the next year suffer legitimate major injuries. I’m open to this idea, but we might see more on-the-fly tanking spread across the league than just the same bad franchises over and over.

NBA Idea 3: Draft position locked in on March 1.

Fix it meter: 🔨🤦. So we just move the tanking season from March and April to January and February? This is the dumbest idea possible, and it doesn’t fix anything. It just moves the tanking window.

My idea: Unweight the lottery.

Fix it meter: 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨. I like my idea! I do not believe teams will consistently tank out of the playoff picture for a 1-in-14 chance to win the lottery. Owners won’t pass up any playoff revenue, and you have to convince them this is the right move. This is a nearly flawless plan, but is there another version better? Let’s go to The Athletic’s Eric Koreen!

Koreen’s idea: Unweight the lottery, including teams that lose in the first round of the playoffs.

Fix it meter: 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨. This would eliminate any idea of missing the postseason to tank for a 1-in-14 chance. Now you make it a 1-in-22 chance for the top pick and you’re drawing for all 22 spots, not just the top four? Sign me all the way up.

Early returns

Fans are over Lebron and KD as All-Stars

The NBA released the first fan voting returns for the 2026 All-Star starters yesterday. And there are some very surprising developments. Remember, this year will have two teams of USA-born All-Stars and one team of international All-Stars. So the voting process is a little more complicated. However, the league also simplified it by making it entirely positionless. Here are the top 20 in each conference.

A report from The Athletic said Rice sustained an knee injury against Brighton but the knee issue won’t keep Rice out long-term and he was left out against Villa as a precaution.

What impact will Rice’s absence have on Arsenal?

A pretty huge one. Rice has arguably been Arsenal’s player of the season so far and his influence in midfield, and anywhere on the pitch, is crucial to the Gunners being on the front foot.

With so many injuries cropping up in the same few areas of the pitch in spells throughout this season for Arsenal, they have stalled in terms of performances in recent weeks.

Let's dive into the week 17 NFL injury recap and learn about the injuries to Josh Allen, Blake Corum, Luther Burden, and many more.

Quarterbacks

Josh Allen

Injury: Right foot injury

Analysis: Allen clearly aggravated his right foot on Sunday. However, he did continue to play, and although he looked slightly slower, he still performed fairly well. Allen had X-rays again, which were negative, continuing to hint at a sprain in the mid-foot. As we discussed during last week's injury preview article, the mid-foot is a critical junction in the foot for throwing and running. The mid-foot adapts shape depending on what the foot and body are doing. When the foot is accepting weight, it flattens out to absorb ground reaction forces, and when the foot is ready to pushoff the mid-foot creates a rigid arch to generate power from. When an injury is mild, this function is spared, but moderate-severe sprains (which do not appear to currently be the case for Allen) disrupt the mid-foots shape-shifting ability and impact power generation needed for throwing and running.

Right now, there is no indication Allen is dealing with anything more than a mild injury, and pain is the main factor that could impact performance. Allen will receive plenty of treatment throughout the week and will likely utilize either a supportive insert or heavy tape job to protect the midfoot and allow him to play fairly well, but he may not be at 100% until this foot heals more. Rushing upside is the main potential impact, though at times it appeared Allen was not comfortable fully pushing off his right foot to throw.

Adams is trying to work his way back from a hamstring injury to ready himself for the Rams' postseason run.

Is Davante Adams playing tonight?

Adams is officially inactive for the Rams vs. Falcons game on ""Monday Night Football in Week 17.

Adams' absence is not a surprise. He wasn't expected to play, as Los Angeles listed him as ""doubtful"" on the team's final injury report for Week 17 because of a hamstring injury.

Davante Adams injury update

Adams is dealing with a hamstring injury he originally suffered in the team's Week 15 win over the Detroit Lions. The 33-year-old was unable to return to the field on ""Thursday Night Football"" in Week 16 before being ruled ""doubtful"" for Week 17.

Rams coach Sean McVay told reporters throughout the week that Adams is progressing well in his recovery from the injury.

""He's doing great. He's making really good progress,"" McVay said of Adams at a Dec. 27 media availability. ""I know he's chomping at the bit to get back out there.""

Despite McVay's positive prognosis, Adams was unable to practice in the lead-up to the Rams' ""Monday Night Football"" game against the Falcons. He was a non-participant at each of Los Angeles' three listed practice sessions and isn't expected to take the field in Week 17.

Nonetheless, McVay didn't seem worried about Adams' injury lingering in the playoffs.

""We'll be in good shape when we get him back, whether that's this week or next week with the playoffs,"" McVay said.

The Rams have little incentive to rush Adams back into action, as they are guaranteed to be either the No. 5 or 6 seed in the NFC playoff field after being eliminated from the NFC West race by the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers' Week 17 wins.

That should afford the 33-year-old a couple of extra weeks to heal before the Rams look to mount a Super Bowl 60 run.

The Rams have six wide receivers on their 53-man roster, including Adams. They are:

Puka Nacua

Nacua has been the team's primary target all season, logging 114 catches for 1,592 receiving yards and eight touchdowns over the first 16 weeks of the season, while Whittington and Mumpfield figure to see extra action across from him with Adams out of action.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/29/USAT/87950707007-usatsi-27782750.jpg?crop=2497,1406,x0,y302&width=2497&height=1406&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-30 12:59:55.710930

NFL Week 18 Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens

At this stage, Lamar is expected to return from his back injury for the team's Week 18 game against the Steelers with a playoff spot on the line. Huntley played fine in his relief, but Derrick Henry was the true star of the game with over 200 yards and 4 TDs on the ground.

Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills

Allen underwent another set of X-rays on his injured foot on Sunday, and it was determined that those were negative. This is the 2nd straight game with this occurring, so it’s clearly hampering his performance, and he may sit out week 18 for the playoffs.

Jordan Love, Green Bay Packers

While Love missed week 17 due to a concussion, Matt LaFluer did state that he would resume starting once healthy, but declined to say if players may be rested in week 18 with the Chicago Bears having secured the division title.

Geno Smith, Las Vegas Raiders

Smith suffered a high ankle sprain in the team's week 17 loss to the Giants. He’s unlikely to play in week 18, and we will likely see Kenny Pickett start the team's final game on their way to the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.

J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings

McCarthy is progressing, and swelling has come down in his injured hand, but his status for week 18 will be determined throughout the week.

NFL Week 18 Injury Report: Running Backs

Alvin Kamara, New Orleans Saints

At this point, Kamara is not expected to return to action in 2025 with nothing on the line for the team. Audric Estime took over the majority of rushing work in Week 17, and I expect him to do the same in week 18.

NFL Week 18 Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Rome Odunze, Chicago Bears

Odunze has still not returned to practice, and I’m expecting him to be inactive in week 18 with little on the line for Chicago besides seeding.

Luther Burden, Chicago Bears

Burden suffered a quad injury at the end of the game and had to be carted off the field. After the game, though, he seemed fine and mostly just tired, likely meaning this won’t impact him much moving into the playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, Arizona Cardinals

Harrison left Sunday’s game with a reaggravation of the heel injury that caused him to miss time recently. I’m expecting Marv to be shut down for the remainder of the year with no playoff spot on the line for Arizona, making Michael Wilson Jr a fringe WR1 in the final week of the season.

Drake London, Atlanta Falcons

London is listed as questionable for Monday night's game with a knee injury. This is likely precautionary, and he’s expected to play tonight.

Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions

ARSB suffered a knee injury in week 17 and is currently day-to-day for their season finale in Chicago. With Detroit out of the playoffs and just playing for pride, ARSB may sit out this one.

Rashid Shaheed, Seattle Seahawks

Shaheed suffered a concussion on Sunday and was removed from the game. He will need to clear protocol to play in week 18, but I’m expecting him to be inactive with the playoffs right around the corner for Seattle.

NFL Week 18 Injury Report: Tight Ends

JaTavion Sanders, Carolina Panthers

Sanders suffered a broken ankle during their week 17 loss, likely ending his season, as he will undergo surgery to repair it. He may be able to return should Carolina make it to the playoffs, but they’ll be without him for the time being.

Harold Fannin, Cleveland Browns

Fannin aggravated the groin injury he suffered in practice on Friday and came out of the game as a result. He will undergo an MRI to determine the severity of the injury, but his season is likely over.

Jake Ferguson, Dallas Cowboys

Ferguson left the team's Christmas Day game with a calf injury and did not return. While he may attempt to play in week 18, Dallas is out of playoff contention, and the team may opt to rest him with eyes towards 2026.

Jackson was inactive for Baltimore’s Week 17 game against the Packers, with Tyler Huntley starting in his place. Huntley completed 16-of-20 passes for 107 yards and a touchdown, but the big story was Derrick Henry.

One thing for Seattle didn’t feel as potent in the second half, though.

A key part of Seattle Seahawks’ success isn’t on the stat sheet

“Special teams do not hit the same if Rashid is not in that game, man,” Michael Bumpus said, referring to Pro Bowl return man Rashid Shaheed, on Monday’s edition of Bump and Stacy on Seattle Sports.

The 27-year-old Shaheed suffered a concussion in the first half, leaving Seattle to turn to running back Cam Akers to return kicks for the rest of the game. It also puts Shaheed’s availability in doubt for Saturday’s huge regular season finale against the San Francisco 49ers that will decide the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed from the NFC in the playoffs.

Time and TV set for Seahawks’ huge Week 18 showdown vs. 49ers

Shaheed, who was a big acquisition by the Seahawks last month just before the NFL trade deadline, has been perhaps the best returner in football since the trade from New Orleans. He has 180 yards and a touchdown on 11 punt returns plus 384 yards and a touchdown on 14 kick returns in eight games with Seattle.

The presence of Shaheed has breathed new life into the Seahawks’ special teams.

“It’s not like we took (Shaheed) for granted, but we’re just a bit spoiled,” Bumpus said. “It’s so fun having them back there and feeling the potential of a return going to the house. No disrespect to Cam Akers… I think it’s safe to say that (Shaheed) is the best returner in the game. And when you have a guy back there, as we run a special teams unit that you feel can take it to the house, it’s not like you play a little harder, but it just feels different. Your angles are different. You feel like every play can be a home run.”

The injury to Shaheed has Bumpus, a former wide receiver and return man for the Seahawks and WSU Cougars, lowering his expectations in the return game.

“As soon as he was out and whoever was returning, it just didn’t feel the same. It felt like, alright, just possess the football and let’s get the offense out there. When he’s back there, I’m literally looking for lanes for him to go to the house every single time. I doubt that he passes concussion protocol and plays on Saturday. That’d be unfortunate, but he’s special, man. And I think that whoever has to replace him, possession is all we need at this point. Just possess the football. Don’t turn it over.”

What about on offense?

While Shaheed has been a big boost for Seattle’s special teams, he hasn’t been as noticeable as a wide receiver in Seattle’s offense. He has 186 yards on 14 catches in his eight games with the Seahawks, and most of that production came in a two-game stretch in early December against the Atlanta Falcons (four catches, 67 yards) and Indianapolis Colts (five catches, 74 yards). Shaheed has just one catch for eight yards over his last two games combined.

“Are you still kind of hoping for him to be even more integrated into the offense?” co-host Stacy Rost asked Bumpus.

“Yeah, I am,” Bumpus responded. “I think because of what he can do with the football on his hands, you’ve got to find ways to get him football. Put him on some of those crossing routes you put JSN (wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba) on. He’s run some of them, you’ve got to find him. Go ahead and take the top off with some double moves. He should be the double-move guy when it comes to taking those shots.”

Michael Bumpus answers four football questions during the Four Down Territory segment at 11:15 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. during each edition of Bump and Stacy. Catch Bump and Stacy from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays on Seattle Sports.

But on Sunday, for the first time in his career, Allen did not attempt a pass from outside of the pocket.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has been dealing with a foot injury sustained in the narrow Week 16 victory over the Cleveland Browns. He has not missed any time, but his touchdown in the final seconds of this Sunday’s loss to the Philadelphia Eagles was the only time his offense got into the endzone the entire day.

Perhaps now, offensive coordinator Joe Brady has provided some insight into why the Bills’ offense struggled so badly against the Eagles.

“I think yesterday was a little different,” Brady said when asked if he had to adjust his play calling to account for quarterback Josh Allen’s injured foot. “He was hobbling a little bit, but once the adrenaline got going a little bit — I mean, you can look at the last drive of the game, he’s running away from Jalen Phillips — so it was just constant communication with him about how he’s feeling.

“Once Josh is out there, I have to just trust that if he’s out there, he’s 100% and good things will happen.”

Despite what the offensive coordinator had to say, there was one glaring statistic that stuck out in Allen’s performance.

Josh Allen Didn’t Throw Outside The Pocket Once

The reigning MVP’s game is built on the utilization of his legs, both on and off script.

Allen leads all NFL quarterbacks in rushing yards with 579, the only gunslinger over the half-century mark. But on Sunday, for the first time in his career, Allen did not attempt a pass from outside of the pocket.

According to ESPN’s Buffalo beat reporter Alaina Getzenberg, this was the first time in the 29-year-old quarterback’s career that he has finished a game with at least 20 pass attempts coming all from inside the pocket.

Allen averaged 3.9 yards per carry on Sunday, the fifth-lowest mark of the season. One run contributed 17 of his 27 yards, meaning the remaining of his six rushing attempts ended up with a gain of less than two yards on average.

The week prior, when the injury was sustained, was the same story. He had just seven carries for 17 yards with a long of seven in that win over the Browns.

Despite his 262-yard passing performance, it is clear that the injury is playing a factor in the quarterback’s performance during a crucial stretch of the season.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1815555661.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780,N,,2025-12-30 14:00:25.370803

MVPs and All-Pro lists will be debated for the next month, but I wanted to build first- and second-team All-Rookie rosters to highlight standout debut seasons before the playoff field is set and we turn our eyes to the race to Super Bowl LX.

Before we get into the picks, a few considerations:

All rookies make bad plays. Every single player on this list has made massive mistakes this season. You could easily cut up a lowlight montage that would make me look like an idiot for calling Carson Schwesinger the no-brainer Defensive Rookie of the Year. This list is largely based on the bulk of positive plays, and peak performances are weighed fairly heavily. Optimism is fun with rookies. Believe a little bit!

Late-season production is weighted heavier, but early-season performance is not discarded. Should Tyler Shough be penalized for failing to beat outSpencer Rattlerin camp, or for quieter performances before hisrecent surge in production? Probably not. Should Emeka Egbuka be docked for dominating early but losing his starting job to Jalen McMillan over the past month? Still probably not. It's easy to trick ourselves into thinking development is linear, and that the past three games we've seen from a rookie are predictive of his next three (and rest of his career). Anyone who woke up from a coma on Thanksgiving would put Shough above Cam Ward on their list and would have Egbuka as a third-team rookie receiver. I did neither, because September and October still matter to me.

Snap counts matter (kind of). The most productive rookie pass rusher at defensive tackle this season was the Cardinals'Walter Nolen III, who had 13 pressures on just 93 pass-rush snaps before being placed on the PUP list before Week 17. Are 93 pass-rush snaps enough to confidently put Nolen on this list over players with more than twice as many reps? I don't really know the answer. Earning snaps is a skill, though it's more significant for some teams (such as the loaded Eagles) than others (such as the Browns, who are handing out rookie snaps like there's no tomorrow). Being healthy and available is critical for rookies -- it is the best predictor of future development. So I tried to acknowledge and credit Week 1 starters while also giving nods to players with smaller roles, whether for depth chart concerns or injury absences.

With that out of the way, here are my first- and second-team All-Rookie rosters.

Jump to a position:

QB | RB | WR | TE | OL

Edge | DT | LB | CB | S

Quarterback

Cam Ward, Tennessee Titans

2025 stats: 320-for-537 passing (59.6%), 3,117 passing yards, 15 touchdowns and 7 interceptions; 148 rushing yards, 1 touchdown

Drafted: Round 1, No. 1

Shough finished the season strong for the Saints, but in terms of quality of film, Ward still has him in seasonlong excellence. Ward's advanced metrics, such as EPA or success rate, all show a passing game suffering league-worst levels. But the Titans' wide receivers room has dealt with injuries, drops and general dysfunction -- and the same is true of their offensive line. Ward has demonstrated tremendous resiliency and creativity through it all.

A supercut of Ward's best throws stands up with those of Drake Maye, Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, C.J. Stroud and a slew of other quarterbacks during their own rookie seasons. All of those passers' peak plays foretold strong ensuing seasons. Ward is at his best pushing the ball down the field aggressively, and he has the arm talent, post-snap processing and sharp timing to access high-difficulty throws in the structure of the offense. Undeterred by safeties, Ward will rip throws to the seam with Dak Prescott-esque accuracy and boldness.

Now, Ward will put the ball in danger and must become more willing to find his checkdown and live for another play, but it is far preferable to have a quarterback capable of such throws and dial him down than it is to draw such throws out of a QB naturally averse to them. Ward's rookie season has been clear proof of concept for his potential as an above-average NFL starting quarterback.

Second team:Tyler Shough, New Orleans Saints. Shough became the betting favorite to win Offensive Rookie of the Year after leading the Saints' come-from-behind win over Ward and Tennessee in Week 17. I kind of get it -- the Saints have won their past four games, and Shough has looked better with each passing week. But while I see quality play from Shough, I don't see the sort of jaw-dropping, math-changing potential I see in Ward.

Shough has checked every box you could hope for out of a rookie: poise, creativity, execution of the offense, a short memory for mistakes. He needs to cut down on the sacks and sprays, but he looks like a clear hit for general manager Mickey Loomis and a Saints team in need of a rookie contract starter at quarterback.

Running back

TreVeyon Henderson, New England Patriots

2025 stats: 168 carries for 858 rushing yards (5.1 yards per carry) and 7 touchdowns; 35 receptions for 221 yards and 1 touchdown

Drafted: Round 2, No. 38

On a down-to-down basis, Henderson has not been as consistent as several other rookie backs this season. He misses lanes as a runner, and despite his reputation as an elite pass protector, he has some errors in that capacity. With that said, the way he creates yardage with the ball in his hands is simply impossible to ignore. Henderson is a walking home run in both the handoff and checkdown game, and that profile of missed tackles and hidden yardage created tends to expand a player's role over his career. For the peaks, Henderson gets my nod.

Second team:Quinshon Judkins, Cleveland Browns. It is agonizing to decide between Judkins, Kyle Monangai, Ashton Jeanty, Omarion Hampton, RJ Harvey, Cam Skattebo and Woody Marks for one second-team spot. Each of them was solid in some ways and disappointing in others. I gave the nod to Henderson's college teammate, Judkins, because he ran tough and minimized negatives behind a floundering offensive line and without any supporting passing game to create space for him.

Judkins, Skattebo and Hampton are the three who stand out on film with consistent positive plays. Still, this is a tough pick.

Wide receiver

Tetairoa McMillan, Carolina Panthers

2025 stats: 66 receptions for 922 yards (14.1 yards per reception) and 7 touchdowns

Drafted: Round 1, No. 8

The favorite for Offensive Rookie of the Year before he was held to just one catch against the Seahawks, McMillan needs 71 yards in Week 18 to clear 1,000 on the season -- an impressive milestone for any rookie receiver, and doubly so with Carolina's inconsistent quarterback play. McMillan is showing the physicality and catch radius that was promised of him when he was coming out of Arizona, and his route running has really shined as NFL-caliber despite his supersized frame. He looks the part of a three-level X receiver who can win over the middle of the field just as frequently as he wins jump balls against the sideline -- a Courtland Sutton-type of pass catcher.

Emeka Egbuka, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

2025 stats: 62 receptions for 930 yards (15.0 yards per receiver) and 6 touchdowns

Drafted: Round 1, No. 19

Egbuka was far more productive in the first half of the season (34 catches, 562 yards, 5 touchdowns) than in the second (28 catches, 268 yards, 1 touchdown). But the entire Buccaneers offense experienced a downswing, and Egbuka still looks as detailed and smooth as ever on film. An ideal do-it-all receiver who can provide value as a blocker, a downfield threat and everything in between, Egbuka is the lone rookie to stand next to McMillan as a potential No. 1 receiver after one pro season.

Luther Burden III, Chicago Bears

2025 stats: 44 receptions for 617 yards (14.0 yards per reception) and 2 touchdowns

Drafted: Round 2, No. 39

It took time for Burden to get a foothold in Ben Johnson's thick and detailed playbook, but as the game has slowed down for him, he has cashed in on his opportunities and carved out a bigger role, culminating with his career-best 138-yard performance Sunday night against the 49ers. Burden has run at least 16 routes in every game since the Bears' Week 5 bye after never running more than 12 before it. In seven games post-bye, he has snagged 31 of 41 targets for 446 yards -- that's a 17-game pace of 75 catches on 100 targets for 1,083 yards.

Burden is a sudden movement player who can win on the outside, in the slot and with designed touches behind the line of scrimmage. He's still more of a screen/checkdown option than a downfield target, but that part of his game will come as he improves his play strength. With only two drops this season, Burden has earned more downfield opportunities entering Year 2.

Second team:Chimere Dike, Tennessee Titans;Pat Bryant, Denver Broncos;andJayden Higgins, Houston Texans. Dike gets an additional boost for his return ability -- he set a record for all-purpose yards in a rookie season! Higgins has come along late and wonderfully so for an ascending Texans offense, while Bryant's contested catch and blocking abilities shine -- two traits in which rookie receivers often struggle.

Tight end

Harold Fannin Jr., Cleveland Browns

2025 stats: 72 receptions for 731 yards (10.2 yards per reception) and 6 touchdowns; 1 rushing touchdown

Drafted: Round 3, No. 67

You're forgiven if you haven't been dialed in to the season Fannin is having in Cleveland. He has emerged as a unique threat as a movement piece (using pre-snap motion) in Cleveland's offense by creating huge hidden yardage with broken tackles on screens and jump balls over the middle of the field. Fannin is only the ninth tight end since the merger with 700-plus receiving yards in his rookie season.

Fannin already has some of the best change-of-direction skills at the position, and his instincts as a tackle breaker are excellent. It's fair to expect him to become a Sam LaPorta-esque producer, and his ceiling is in the range of Trey McBride and prime Travis Kelce as team-leading target-getters who can be used at all three levels of the field.

Second team:Colston Loveland, Chicago Bears. I had the Colts' Tyler Warren in this spot until Sunday night, when Loveland posted a quality six-catch, 94-yard performance. It's razor thin between the two first-rounders. Were it not for Warren's quarterbacking situation going down the drain, he'd likely still take this spot. Loveland has the edge as a blocker and catcher outside of his frame, while Warren wins as a tackle breaker and has a greater variety of routes in his bag. Both look like bona fide No. 1 tight ends and game-plan-worthy playmakers.

Left tackle

Kelvin Banks Jr., New Orleans Saints

2025 stats: 16 starts, 87.7% pass block win rate, 76.1% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 1, No. 9

One of the quieter first-round picks, Banks has slid easily into New Orleans' left tackle spot and taken on a veteran's workload with aplomb. Rarely given tight end or chip help, Banks has been an above-average pass protector and has the quickness and flexibility that elite pass protectors often have. Those movement skills translate into the running game, where Banks has been a high-impact blocker as a puller and climber. The Saints got a good one.

Second team:Josh Simmons, Kansas City Chiefs. I don't think Simmons would have knocked Banks out of the first-team spot if he had been healthy the whole season, but it sure would have been close.

Left guard

Grey Zabel, Seattle Seahawks

2025 stats: 16 starts, 89.2% pass block win rate, 83.1% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 1, No. 18

Zabel would be the overall No. 1 offensive lineman on this All-Rookie team if positions were removed from the equation. He has been a little less consistent since his Week 11 knee injury, but his steadiness in pass protection before the injury looked like that of a 10-year veteran. Zabel has rarely been beat clean this season, and when it has happened, it has been by some of the league's best. If Zabel had the name recognition of a vet, he would have been a Pro Bowler this season.

Second team:Dylan Fairchild, Cincinnati Bengals. One of the least-known rookies on this list, Fairchild has gotten better each week and makes splash blocks with impressive quickness and core strength for his size. He was a developmental player coming out of Georgia and looks to be ahead of his curve. He's a nice middle-round find for the Bengals.

Center

Jonah Monheim, Jacksonville Jaguars

2025 stats: Two starts, 95.1% pass block win rate, 77.8% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 7, No. 221

Haven't heard of Monheim? I don't blame you. The seventh-round pick has played 187 snaps at center this season, which is ... 162 more than second place. For those 187 snaps, he is our first-team center. (The film against the Colts this past Sundaywas ... not great!)

Second team:Drew Kendall, Philadelphia Eagles. Kendall has played 25 snaps at center, which gives him the slight edge for No. 2 center on the All-Rookie team over Seahawks rookie Bryce Cabeldue, who has played ... six snaps.

Right guard

Tyler Booker, Dallas Cowboys

2025 stats: 13 starts, 93.7% pass block win rate, 76.0% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 1, No. 12

Booker moves people. It's a sight to see. He's already one of the most imposing guards in the downhill running game, and while his sheer size will always create some disadvantages on the move or against quick pass rushers, he's much better in pass protection than expected for a rookie of his heavy-footedness. In Booker's best games, he has been a key engine of the Cowboys' offensive success, and that will continue for years to come.

Second team:Tate Ratledge, Detroit Lions. Ratledge has been about as good as you'd expect for a second-round offensive lineman. The shaky play around him has limited his ceiling, but he's a clear starter for the duration of his rookie contract.

Right tackle

Armand Membou, New York Jets

2025 stats: 16 starts, 91.7% pass block win rate, 79.6% run block win rate

Drafted: Round 1, No. 7

Membou occasionally gets beat clean or suffers a rookie mental lapse. But snap to snap, he has a solid floor and a high ceiling in pass protection due to his tremendous grip strength and the reach to catch and control speedy rushers. The Jets' best runs and screens have often come to the offensive right on the back of Membou's ability to uproot defensive linemen and carve out running lanes. He's an impactful player.

Second team:Josh Conerly Jr., Washington Commanders. Conerly was getting worked in the first month of the season but found his sea legs as of late. If he can continue this developmental arc into Year 2, the Commanders will be set at right tackle throughout his rookie deal.

Edge rusher

Abdul Carter, New York Giants

2025 stats: 43 tackles, 4 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries

Drafted: Round 1, No. 3

My All-Rookie team is not particularly concerned with attending team meetings on time or paying attention while in them; we just like good players on the football field, and Carter sure is one. He is first among all defensive linemen in quick pressures with 44, and his time to pressure of 2.41 seconds is leaps and bounds above second place (2.57 seconds) among edge rushers. Carter must learn how to convert his incredible first step into more targeted rushes that end with sacks, but the bones of his play are tremendous. He looks like a future double-digit sack artist.

Jalon Walker, Atlanta Falcons

2025 stats: 33 tackles, 5.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 1 fumble recovery

Drafted: Round 1, No. 15

Walker was a tweener coming out of Georgia but has spent 90% of his snaps on the edge -- and to great effect. His football IQ leaps off the film, as he regularly sees blocks developing fast enough to slip, shed and create havoc in the defensive backfield. Pound for pound, the 6-foot-2, 245-pound Walker is tough to uproot and has more power as a pass rusher than expected. His ability to drop into coverage is also integral to defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich's pressure packages. Walker is a high-impact player for his dirty work in the margins.

Second team:Donovan Ezeiruaku, Dallas Cowboys;andJames Pearce Jr., Atlanta Falcons.Ezeiruaku looked a bit like a luxury pick in April, but once Micah Parsons was traded to Green Bay in August, he suddenly became a key part of Dallas' rotation. Ezeiruaku has the tools of a productive outside pass rusher, but it's his play against the run at 6-foot-2, 248 pounds that really impresses. Ezeiruaku is behind only Carter among rookie edge rushers in run stop EPA and has eight tackles for zero yards or negative gain on the season.

Pearce is the sack artist he was billed to be in the leadup to the 2025 draft, leading all rookies with 8.5 sacks. His blistering 2.66-second time to pressure is ninth among all edges and third among all rookie edges, and he creates immediate opportunities for sacks with that wicked first step. Pearce is almost purely a pass-rush-down player at this point and struggles to hold the point of attack in the running game, so an offseason in the weight room is needed for him to become an every-down performer.

Defensive tackle

Deone Walker, Buffalo Bills

2025 stats: 39 tackles, 1 sack, 1 forced fumble, 12.5 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 4, No. 109

Once a prospective first-rounder thanks to his truly elite size (and great movement skills at 6-foot-7, 331 pounds), Walker fell in the draft after a poor final season at Kentucky. Buffalo struck gold when it took the risk in Round 4. Walker regularly takes on two blockers at the line of scrimmage, creates tackle-for-loss opportunities and makes high-effort pursuit plays into the boundary. He has also found more quick wins as a pass rusher than I expected. He'll get his hands into passing lanes, too -- and at his size, that's a big impediment for opponent QBs.

Elijah Roberts, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

2025 stats: 13 tackles, 2 sacks, 1 fumble recovery, 3 passes defensed

Drafted: Round 5, No. 157

A fifth-rounder out of SMU, Roberts was not a big part of the rotation until Calijah Kancey went down with a torn pectoral in Week 2. Roberts has answered the call wonderfully. A college defensive end who is transitioning to defensive tackle, Roberts sometimes loses ground in the running game and needs some weight room work in the offseason. But he's slippery, with active hands and good lateral quickness. For a fifth-round rookie undergoing a positional switch, he has been very impressive.

Second team:Mason Graham, Cleveland Browns; and Walter Nolen III, Arizona Cardinals. If I did this list at the midway point of the season, Graham would not have made it. He was getting moved with ease in the running game and was providing little impact as a pass rusher. He overcame the rookie hump in the second half of the season, collecting 19 pressures in eight games after the Browns' bye relative to 11 pressures in the eight games before it. Graham still needs to be better when engaged -- he struggles to shed blocks without giving up ground -- but he is creating more quick wins, which is what the Browns drafted him to do.

Several defensive tackles played more snaps and had flashier plays than Nolen (such as the Steelers' Derrick Harmon, Dolphins' Kenneth Grant, Chargers' Jamaree Caldwell and Dolphins' Jordan Phillips). But Nolen's limited film is so good and so disruptive that I have to give him the nod over the field. A healthy sophomore season from Nolen could lead to eye-popping tackle-for-loss and pressure numbers given how naturally he won as a penetrator as a rookie.

Linebacker

Carson Schwesinger, Cleveland Browns

2025 stats: 159 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 2 interceptions, 13 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 2, No. 33

The easy pick for Defensive Rookie of the Year, Schwesinger is all that and a bag of chips. He is fast, physical, slippery, quick to see plays unfold, nimble, savvy before the snap, a great tackler on the move, improving as a zone dropper, productive around the football, aggressive in seeking splash plays and overall just really instinctive. He was dropped in an ideal run-and-chase system in Cleveland, but the alacrity with which he got up to NFL speed was something to see. Tackle stats are generally unreliable, but Schwesinger is one of five linebackers this century to post 150-plus tackles, 10-plus tackles for loss and 2-plus passes defensed in his rookie season. The other four are Kiko Alonso, Luke Kuechly, Shaquille Leonard and DeMeco Ryans. Good group.

Jihaad Campbell, Philadelphia Eagles

2025 stats: 70 tackles, 2 passes defensed, 2 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 1, No. 31

It's a little tricky to give a first-team nod to Campbell, who was pretty resoundingly removed from the starting lineup once Nakobe Dean returned from injury and regained his old form. From Weeks 12 to 15, Campbell played 26 total defensive snaps. But his film is still pretty good. And now that Dean is hurt again, Campbell is back to a full menu of snaps. Campbell makes bad rookie mistakes against misdirection and in coverage, but his peak plays of explosive speed, stopping power and turnover creation are a sight to see. He just ekes out the first-team selection ahead of the second-team picks below.

Second team:Teddye Buchanan, Baltimore Ravens; and Cody Simon, Arizona Cardinals. Buchanan wrested the starting job from incumbent Trenton Simpson early in the season and proved an impactful coverage player before a Week 15 ACL tear ended his rookie year prematurely. Buchanan could struggle against the league's more complex running games, but he was playing faster as the season went on, and his ability to cover ground in space minimized easy yardage for opposing offenses.

Simon is a bit of a ""best of the rest"" nod. He has been up and down when thrust into the starting lineup because of injuries ahead of him on the depth chart, but the rest of the field has been a lot more down than up. The Bengals, who are starting two rookie linebackers, would do anything to have a player like Simon in their building right now.

Cornerback

Will Johnson, Arizona Cardinals

2025 stats: 37 tackles, 10 passes defensed, 1 forced fumble

Drafted: Round 2, No. 47

Johnson's advanced metrics aren't great, and he has gotten cooked by some top receivers, but that's the reality of playing corner in the NFL. The body of work on film is still quite good. Johnson is an impressively fluid mover at his length and would benefit from a scheme that allows him to play closer to the line of scrimmage when tasked with man-coverage responsibilities. Johnson needs to stay healthy, but I'm willing to bet on his physical profile on a healthier defense for seasons to come.

Quincy Riley, New Orleans Saints

2025 stats: 31 tackles, 1 interception, 8 passes defensed

Drafted: Round 4, No. 131

A fourth-round pick out of Louisville, Riley got his first significant action in Week 3 and his first start in Week 5. But he took the starting job with both hands and refused to give it back. A sticky downfield corner with surprising physicality, Riley has impressive production at the catch point despite his size (5-foot-11, 195 pounds), detailing a highly encouraging future. Riley was only the No. 3 corner for the Saints this season and had some classic rookie mental snafus, but with Alontae Taylor being a rising free agent in 2026, Riley might end up a starter in all packages next season. He has earned it.

Second team:Denzel Burke, Arizona Cardinals; and Maxwell Hairston, Buffalo Bills. Burke has provided the ball production for the Cardinals' rookie cornerback duo, with three interceptions and 11 passes defensed on 52 targets. His ballhawk rate of 21.2% is 11th among all corners this season, rookie or otherwise, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Some of Burke's ball production has been fortuitous, and he did give up a 20-yard completion to an offensive lineman this week. But even with the warts in run support and issues tackling in space, Burke's production at the catch point is too valuable to ignore.

Hairston has 156 coverage snaps this season, which is just enough to qualify (it's a made-up list, so there are no real rules). Hairston has the speed, ball-tracking ability and ball skills of a true No. 1 cornerback with shadow ability, though his play is predictably up and down for a rookie who missed training camp. His lack of bulk will also be exposed by physical receivers and in run defense. Hairston barely beats out two more physical corners -- Nohl Williams (Chiefs) and Azareye'h Thomas (Jets) -- who have fewer splash plays. But man, both of those guys looked great, too. This is a good cornerback class.

Nickel

Jacob Parrish, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

2025 stats: 73 tackles, 1 interception, 6 passes defensed, 2 sacks, 5 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 3, No. 84

Parrish has had a prototypical rookie season: a splash play here, a brutal rep there and a whole lot of vacillation in between. His film shows quickness, physicality and willingness to make plays against the run when facing bigger bodies. Parrish has the Bucs' nickel job secured and should see his play smooth out over time, but for a third-round pick thrust into immediate starting action, his season was far more good than bad.

Second team:Upton Stout, San Francisco 49ers. Stout is a perfect fit in the 49ers' secondary under Robert Saleh. Ferocious and undeterred, Stout will stick his nose into the fan with reckless abandon, regularly creating splash plays along with solo tackles in run support. Stout needs to play with faster eyes and feel in coverage, but he did well to minimize yards after the catch with his tackling ability. The peaks are very impressive, and if the game slows down for him, he'll generate a lot more forced incompletions

Safety

Jonas Sanker, New Orleans Saints

2025 stats: 78 tackles, 2 interceptions, 6 passes defensed

Drafted: Round 3, No. 93

One of my favorite rookies independent of position or draft capital, Sanker has shined in Brandon Staley's defense as a premier communicator and coverage player. He takes great angles, rarely false steps and doesn't get fooled by route distributions. Sanker looks like a 10-year vet but has the spry legs of a rookie, which allows him to make plays sideline to sideline. Sanker is also a reliable tackler at the third level and prevents explosive runs from becoming house calls. He is a rising star to watch.

Nick Emmanwori, Seattle Seahawks

2025 stats: 74 tackles, 1 interception, 11 passes defensed, 2.5 sacks, 5.5 run stuffs

Drafted: Round 2, No. 35

For as fun of a debut season as it has been, Emmanwori gets billed as a fusion between Kam Chancellor and Kyle Hamilton, which is a little too rich for my blood. But he is a highly disruptive player with length, closing speed and a nose for the football. He rarely misses tackles given his length and play strength, and he can rip through blocks to produce behind the line of scrimmage as well. On blitzes, Emmanwori is a true playmaker who must be accounted for at all times. Another offseason of work on coverage instincts and play recognition is needed for a player mostly operating on feel right now, but his ceiling is through the roof in that regard.

Second team:Xavier Watts, Atlanta Falcons; and Malaki Starks, Baltimore Ravens. There were three great safety seasons from rookies, and only two first-team spots. Watts was easier to slot into the second team before his two-interception performance on ""Monday Night Football"" -- he now leads all rookies with five interceptions. Watts has tremendous feel for route combinations and spacing, which allows him to anticipate route breaks with unreal quickness. Doubly impressive is Watts' ability to play on the roof and in the box. He also has a sky-high ceiling.

Starks would be a first-teamer in many other seasons. A true center fielder, he doesn't see the ball often but tracks it well and addresses it at the highest point. He doesn't experience mental lapses as often as expected for a rookie, especially in the Ravens' tricky defense. Starks barely gets the nod over Malachi Moore, a fourth-rounder who has brought impressive physicality to the box for a Jets defense in need of tone-setters. Moore is one to watch as well.

Not only did they celebrate a 42-10 victory over the New York Jets that was very much uncontested, they also ended up clinching the AFC East later on Sunday.

As the cherry on top, they also caught a much-needed break on the injury front. After sustaining some losses in recent weeks, there are no obvious concerns coming out of their latest game. Let’s assess the damage.

Patriots injury analysis: Week 17

QB Drake Maye: The Patriots’ starting quarterback being a bit slow to get up after taking a hit to the head in the second quarter, drawing a roughing the passer penalty and prompting head coach Mike Vrabel to sprint onto the field, could have been a scary moment. It ultimately wasn’t, because Maye looked fine right away and remained in the game without showing any limitations from the play. He went 8-of-9 for 97 yards and a pair of touchdowns from that point on, and overall played one of the most productive games in recent memory.

FB Jack Westover: New England’s fullback remained down after a kickoff with 14:51 left in the fourth quarter, but walked off under own power. After some time in the blue medical tent, he returned to the sideline trying to walk the injury off. Ultimately, Westover did not reenter the game after he was announced as questionable to return with an ankle ailment.

CB Charles Woods: The Patriots’ backup quarterback, who entered the contest questionable with a foot issue, showcased some apparent discomfort in his back after unsuccessfully trying to break up an 18-yard pass in the late fourth quarter. Woods remained in the game and no injury was announced.

What this means for the Patriots

The Patriots were down seven players heading into their game against the Jets, but that list growing ahead of the season finale seems unlikely: New England escaped without any obvious major injuries. The biggest question mark is Jack Westover, but head coach Mike Vrabel gave a positive update on his status on Monday.

“Sore, probably could have returned,” Vrabel said. “We’ll monitor him here in the next couple days. I don’t think it’s anything that is too significant, but we’ll just see how he progresses here when we get back to work.”

The Patriots will hold their first practice of the week on Wednesday, and will release an injury report later that day.

On May 25, Chelsea qualified for the Champions League for the first time under James’ captaincy. Three days later, he lifted his first trophy as captain when Chelsea won the Conference League, and on July 13, he added another with victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final. October 18 saw James reach 200 appearances for his boyhood club on their trip to Nottingham Forest.

Tonight, when Chelsea host Bournemouth, will mark another milestone: one year injury-free. After a hamstring injury in November 2024, James returned to Enzo Maresca’s matchday squad on December 30 for their 2-0 defeat away at Ipswich Town and, bar a brief illness in March, has been fit ever since.

Given how injuries have disrupted the 26-year-old’s career to date, that is a huge achievement — for which both player and club deserve credit.

“The fact that he’s been able to sustain a good period without injury is definitely a positive sign for him going forward,” says physiotherapist Luke Anthony, who has not worked with James but provided The Athletic with a general view from his time at Watford, Reading, and Norwich City.

“I think probably the biggest difference with him is he’s been able to get on a run (of games) and he’s had a period of adaptation where he has developed that robustness.

“What may have happened is either that he has just been able to develop that consistency of training and develop strength in his body, (or) whether he has changed his approach.”

Two statistics from Chelsea’s festive fixtures highlight the improvement in James’ availability.

He made his 50th club appearance of 2025 against Aston Villa on Saturday, the highest figure he has reached in a calendar year since 2021. Hamstring and knee problems have particularly plagued James, and across the past three full seasons, he has averaged 22.3 appearances in all competitions per campaign. He has already made 22 appearances this season with five months remaining.

The club’s medical team, led by Bryce Cavanagh, have managed James carefully. Ben Macdonald, one of Chelsea’s rehab physios, has been tasked with working closely with James on his fitness and the two have developed a strong rapport.

James is also an example of how Chelsea believe their approach to load management can pay off. As The Athletic have reported, this season has seen a deliberate strategy of carefully managing players’ minutes, led by the medical and performance team.

The graph below shows James’ rolling minutes-per-game average. Previously, steep drops were followed by sharp peaks as he was introduced to a heavy load quickly after returning. Since his return in January, his minutes have been managed more carefully.

“It makes perfect sense to take longer with the return to play,” Anthony says. “There is such a huge gap between a few days or a week of training and then being able to sustain 90 minutes of high-intensity Premier League football game by game.

“Sometimes with these soft-tissue injuries, you don’t necessarily get the warning signs, and the player plays and feels OK. Then the temptation is to use him again, especially if they’re an important player in your team.”

Anthony explains the importance of patience as a player’s tissues adapt to the load of professional football after a lay-off. “It takes a period of time to develop that, especially when you’re coming back from injury. Otherwise, you are more vulnerable to that injury.”

A tweak to James’ position could also have helped his continued fitness. The idea of using him in midfield is not new; in the days after Maresca’s appointment, the head coach sent James footage of him playing in midfield when on loan at Wigan Athletic in the 2018-19 season and suggested they could explore that.

It has become increasingly common to see the Chelsea captain playing in a defensive-midfield role, and as well as yielding impressive performances, Anthony suggests the shift might also have helped reduce the strain on his muscles.

“(Wide players) generally have an exposure to more distance of high-speed running and more sprints, more one-v-ones in those areas offensively and defensively. The central positions will generally have less distance of sprints and high-speed running.

“As a midfielder, you’ll have more distance covered, but you’ll likely have fewer offensive and defensive sprints, which are again, slightly more attritional for a soft-tissue injury.”

James himself is also credited for his hard work, with one source close to the player — speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships — saying it is like he lives at the training ground. The individual work he has done includes working with his own external physiotherapist, in addition to the support he is given by Chelsea.

Hand in hand with James’ improved availability has been his growth as a leader, which has been noticed around the club.

“I spoke with him, and I expected more from him in terms of leadership, inside the changing room and for different kinds of things,” Maresca said of James in October 2024. “He’s one of the captains. I expected from him, and his team-mates expected from him, to give always more in terms of leadership in general.”

Naturally, being on the pitch more often has helped James’ leadership, and he has responded well to Maresca’s challenge. As he has grown into the captaincy, he has expressed himself more and his increased comfort in media interviews has been noticed at Chelsea. He is described as having the respect of everyone at the club.

James’ maturity was evident in his post-match interview with Sky Sports on Saturday, when he said Chelsea “have ourselves to blame” for errors that cost them in the 2-1 defeat against Aston Villa.

“Absolutely, yes,” Maresca said when asked in his press conference ahead of the Villa match if James was now playing and behaving like the captain he wanted. “He’s growing in terms of leadership, he’s growing also in terms of (as a) player, because he’s playing more and more minutes.

“We are all happy, first of all, because he can be fit, he can be healthy. And then because we know that he can behave as a leader.”

Chelsea have supported their captain throughout his injury troubles. In September 2022, he signed a contract that runs until 2028. Chelsea’s general policy is not to hold contract talks during the season, wanting players to focus on the campaign, and prefer to do so in summer. Even if James travels to the World Cup in 2026 with England as expected, that does not necessarily mean an agreement could not be reached this summer; Cole Palmer, for instance, signed a new deal in August 2024 after the European Championship.

At a time when Chelsea need strong leadership, James’ continued fitness and growth are surely one of the biggest positives to take from 2025.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/11094644/GettyImages-2224957390-scaled-e1762872425466.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-30 10:15:31.344799

According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, the Bears believe that strongside linebacker Noah Sewell tore his Achilles in their 42-38 loss to the 49ers on Sunday Night Football. He suffered an ankle injury in the third quarter and rode the cart into the locker room.

“#Bears LB Noah Sewell, who has been a key part of the defense, especially with all the injuries to the position, is believed to have torn his Achilles, sources say. He’ll have an MRI to confirm,” Rapoport wrote on X on December 29.

“Right before he was to play his brother, #Lions OT Penei Sewell, Noah is out.”

Sewell has been a core part of the Bears’ linebacker room for much of the 2025 season, missing three games with injuries but otherwise starting in their strongside role. He has 59 total tackles and three tackles for loss on a career-high 409 defensive snaps in 2025.

While the Bears have not yet announced Sewell’s Achilles injury, they will likely place him on the injured reserve list if Rapoport’s report is confirmed through more testing.

The Bears (11-5) will play their regular-season finale against the Detroit Lions (8-8) at home at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday, January 4.

Bears Have LB Depth to Endure Without Noah Sewell

Losing Sewell just two weeks before the start of the 2025 NFL playoffs is not ideal for the Bears, but the good news is they have been here before — for most of 2025, frankly.

The Bears have struggled to field their complete linebacker unit throughout the 2025 season. Middle linebacker T.J. Edwards missed seven of the first 12 games with a slew of injuries, including a hamstring issue that has nagged him since training camp.

Tremaine Edmunds — a 2025 breakout in the weakside role — also spent four games on injured reserve, only just returning for Week 16’s rematch with the Green Bay Packers.

Fortunately for Chicago, the Bears have received quality contributions from the backup linebackers when they have needed them, especially D’Marco Jackson — whom they claimed off waivers from New Orleans after the 53-man roster cutdown in August.

Jackson has played a career-high 249 defensive snaps in his first season with the Bears, recording 42 tackles, two tackles for loss, three pass deflections and a fumble recovery. He also added the first interception and sack of his career in Week 15’s win over the Cleveland Browns, earning him NFC Defensive Player of the Week recognition.

Look for him to step into Sewell’s shoes if the Bears shut down the latter on IR.

Luther Burden III Also Carted Off After Final Play vs. 49ers

The Bears also brought out the medical cart for rookie wide receiver Luther Burden III on Sunday night after he tried to walk off after the final play and dropped to his knees.

Burden had a breakout game against the 49ers, catching eight of his nine targets for 138 yards and a 35-yard touchdown in the first quarter. He is now one of four pass-catchers on the Bears’ roster with at least 40 receptions and 600 receiving yards on the season, and he has the best catch percentage (78.6) among them, hauling in 44 of 56 targets.

While the Bears did not have an update on Burden following the game, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported the following morning that Burden had injured his quad in the loss but that the team does not believe it is a serious injury. Even still, it is unclear whether Burden will need to miss time because of the injury, even if only Week 18’s finale.

“He will undergo additional testing today,” Schefter wrote on X on December 29.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2253876068-e1767033764316.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-30 10:15:35.648359

Matthews, 33, also holds the NFL's longest-active consecutive games started streak.
What makes Matthews' streak unique is that the offensive lineman with the longest such streak since the merger is Matthews' father Bruce, a Hall of Famer who played 19 seasons in the league.
Jake Matthews' streak nearly ended three years ago, and it had nothing to do with an injury.","FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Atlanta Falcons left tackle Jake Matthews left the ""Monday Night Football"" game against the Buffalo Bills in Week 6 with a high ankle sprain. In most cases, such an injury would keep an NFL player out for several weeks.

Not Matthews.

The 12-year veteran went back to doing what he always does when something like this happens. He takes it day-by-day, sets a goal for the following 24 hours and tries to get incrementally more ready to play as the week wears on.

""It's like, I try not to freak out and think, 'Am I going to play in this game?'"" Matthews told ESPN. ""Let's see how Wednesday feels.""

Sure enough, Matthews was back in the starting lineup for the Falcons' Week 7 game against the San Francisco 49ers. It's just what he does. Whether it's injuries or even the birth of his first child, Matthews has proved to be the NFL's Mr. Reliable.

""We know who he is,"" Falcons coach Raheem Morris said. ""We know what he doesn't miss.""

Last week, Matthews started his 193rd straight game, making his streak the fifth-longest since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger among offensive linemen. When he starts Monday night against the Los Angeles Rams, Matthews will tie former Cleveland Browns' lineman Doug Dieken for fourth on that list.

Matthews, 33, also holds the NFL's longest-active consecutive games started streak. Chicago Bears safety Kevin Byard III is a distant second with 162. No NFL player has started as many games in a row as Matthews since quarterback Philip Rivers, who had a 240-game streak when he retired in 2020, before coming back for the Indianapolis Colts last week.

What makes Matthews' streak unique is that the offensive lineman with the longest such streak since the merger is Matthews' father Bruce, a Hall of Famer who played 19 seasons in the league. Bruce started 229 straight games from 1987 to 2021.

Matthews' grandfather Clay Sr. played in the NFL, as did his father, an uncle (Clay Jr.), a cousin (Clay III) and a brother (Kevin).

""Anytime you can play that long, stay that healthy, be that reliable, heal that quickly, recover that well, it's extremely unique,"" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said. ""I think the genetics have to play a factor at some point. Not just his dad, but his uncle, his cousins. It's pretty incredible, and I would love to do a genetic test on their family and then have it line up against my own and see where the gaps are.""

The only game Matthews missed was the second of his career, in 2014. Matthews suffered a leg injury, and at the team's family dinner after the game, Bruce told him he better get his Normatec boots on for recovery, because ""you have to play next Sunday.""

""And he shared that story with me and it was cool,"" Falcons Pro Bowl right guard Chris Lindstrom said. ""Just that approach of like, 'Yeah, you got to get going.' So, I think his mindset and his mind are as powerful as anything.""

Jake Matthews said there's a genetic element to it, but there's also preparation, work ethic, nutrition, his faith and an iron will.

Bruce joked that during his era getting ready for a game consisted of ""an ice bag and how do you feel Sunday morning?"" Now, he sees the kind of work his son does to get ready every week, which includes steam rooms, cold plunges and infrared saunas.

""Obviously starting in the offseason with his workouts, but he's got a whole regimen that he goes through every evening and I'm like, 'Yeah, I don't want to miss any games, but I don't know if I'm that committed,'"" Bruce told ESPN.

Jake Matthews' streak nearly ended three years ago, and it had nothing to do with an injury.

In 2022, Matthews and his wife, Meggi, were set to have their first child, a son named Beckett Thomas. Meggi ended up going into labor early the morning of the Falcons' Thursday night game against the Carolina Panthers -- in Charlotte.

A Falcons security official ended up driving Matthews back to the Atlanta area, speeding down I-85 in a rental car. Matthews got to the hospital in time to help with the delivery process. He got to hold Beckett for 15 minutes and then was driven to owner Arthur Blank's private jet to head back to Charlotte for the game. Matthews arrived about 30 minutes before warmups.

""My wife is a godsend,"" Matthews said. ""She was all-in. She's a competitor, as well.

""She knew the cutoff when I had to leave was 3:30. She was looking at the clock the whole time. You want to talk about streaks and tough decisions and all that. 'Hey, let's see what happens.' And thankfully she made it happen, and I think the streak is more important to her than to me.""

Matthews said that Meggi will ask him once in a while how much longer he thinks he'll play. He is signed to the Falcons through 2028. His response is usually: ""Let's see how this week of practice goes.""

It's not like Matthews is just durable, either. A Pro Bowler in 2018, he has remained a consistently good left tackle for his entire career. This season, he is 14th in the NFL among tackles in pass block win rate (93%).

Matthews said he feels healthy, and while maybe he's closer to the end of his career than the beginning, he believes his knowledge and feel for the game have only continued to get better.

So, any talk of retirement might be premature. Matthews has more games to start. If he starts the final two games of this season, Matthews will be 35 games short of his dad's record. In other words, a little more than two years, if the NFL remains at 17 games in a regular season.

Matthews is not thinking about that, though. If he were prone to such things, he might not be in the situation he is in now.

""I get overwhelmed when I start looking and planning on the future,"" Matthews said. ""So, I'm gonna take it day-by-day.""

Will he just ride it until the wheels fall off?

""I'd love to,"" Matthews said. ""As long as the body can take it. And like I said, I feel great. So, Lord willing, that continues.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1226%2Fr1593821_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 04:58:20.112968

Week 18 will be one to remember as it's the final regular season home game at Highmark Stadium, and with the Bills not winning the division, it could be the last home game in the stadium, period.

""It'll be emotional,"" head coach Sean McDermott said. ""That stadium has been really good to us, it really has. I know I'll miss it.""

Sunday evening's game against the Jets will provide the Bills one more chance to make a lasting memory inside the 53-year-old building.

""We want to win the game. That's number one,"" McDermott said.

With the division out of reach, the Bills can climb no higher than the No. 5 seed in the AFC. Currently, they are the 7-seed but have the highest probability of moving up to the No. 6 seed with a victory over the Jets.

A loss to NYJ and the Bills will stay at 7 with no chance of hosting a playoff game. A jump to 5 or 6, and there's a small chance to host the AFC Championship should the top seeds falter.

As Buffalo begins its Week 18 prep, one of the key decisions from the team will be how they approach resting players while balancing the effort of trying to win and potentially improve their seed. The Bills coaching staff is still sorting through that process, including at quarterback.

""We talked a little bit (Sunday) night,"" McDermott said. ""Haven't had a lot of time just to isolate those situations — Josh Allen included.""

McDermott added that he anticipates having a clearer picture later in the week when practice resumes.

Injury Updates going into Week 18

Speaking of Allen, the quarterback had X-rays on his right foot following Sunday's defeat to the Eagles as he deals with soreness. The X-rays were negative and McDermott shared that Allen appears to be in a better spot physically the day after Week 17 than after the Browns Week 16 game.

""Maybe in a slightly better spot than the early part of last week, like he was. We'll just take it one day at a time and see how he does here through the week,"" McDermott said.

Buffalo released kicker Michael Badgley from the practice squad Monday afternoon with the anticipation of getting back Matt Prater who has been out the last two games with a right quad injury.

""Prater seems to be moving in the right direction. Don't know for sure yet, but feel like we're heading in the right direction there, and he should be back this week,"" McDermott said.

LB Terrel Bernard left the first half of the Eagles game with a calf injury and did not return. He has been ruled out by McDermott for the Jets game.

‘Best in the world’: Byron Murphy II shining for Seahawks’ defense

Trailing 27-10, the Raiders were driving in Giants territory when Smith threw a pass to Tyler Lockett, but was intercepted by safety Dane Belton.

In pursuit of Belton, Smith was inadvertently undercut by teammate Atonio Mafi, who started at left guard in place of Dylan Parham. Smith was helped from the field and went straight to the locker room.

“It looks like he does not have a high ankle sprain, but he sprained his ankle, and so we’ll see what that means,” Raiders head coach Pete Carroll said Monday. “I don’t know right now, but it’s significant, though. … We’ll just go day-to-day and see what’s happening, but it’s going to be hard for him to play, I think. It’ll be a challenge.”

Carroll, Smith and Lockett all reunited with each other in Vegas this year after departing from the Seattle Seahawks since the end of 2023 season.

The Raiders lost 34-10 on Sunday and fell to 2-14 with their 10th consecutive defeat. With the worst record in the NFL and one week remaining, Las Vegas is now in position to land the No. 1 draft pick in 2026.

Smith, who was 20 of 28 for 176 yards with one touchdown and a 69.9 rating, was sacked three times and hurried nine times. Smith has thrown a league-high 17 interceptions this season.

Las Vegas has already shut down defensive end Maxx Crosby, tight end Brock Bowers and safety Jeremy Chinn, and considering this is the second time Smith has left a game this month, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the 35-year-old done for the season.

The Raiders also lost defensive lineman Adam Butler to a biceps injury during the game.

“This is a humbling league and we got humbled tonight,” Rams coach Sean McVay said after a 27-24 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Monday night.

Bijan Robinson rushed for 195 yards, including a 93-yard touchdown, and Zane Gonzalez kicked a 51-yard field goal with 21 seconds remaining as the Falcons recovered after blowing two 21-point leads.

Robinson's 93-yard touchdown run was the longest in Atlanta history and Jessie Bates III scored on a 34-yard interception return. Bolstered by those big plays, the Falcons led 21-0 at halftime and 24-3 early in the second half.

Matthew Stafford recovered from throwing three interceptions to help the Rams (11-5) pull even at 24. Stafford's 11-yard touchdown pass to Puka Nacua with 2:46 remaining tied the game.

“I love the way that we found a way to get back in the game, but we weren't able to close it out,” McVay said.

The Falcons (7-9) extended their winning streak to three games as Robinson also set the team record for most scrimmage yards in a season.

The Rams began the week leading the NFL in scoring and yards and were shut out in the first half. After trailing 21-0 at halftime, the Rams were kept out of the end zone until Stafford's 27-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Ferguson late in the third quarter.

Los Angeles cut Atlanta's lead to 24-17 when Jarred Verse blocked a 37-yard field goal attempt by Gonzalez and returned the recovery 76 yards for a touchdown. It was the Rams' first blocked kick returned for a touchdown since 1986.

Stafford's second interception, on a throw picked off by Atlanta rookie Xavier Watts, gave the Falcons the ball at their 7 in the second quarter. Robinson broke through the line and took off down the sideline, outrunning the Los Angeles defense for the NFL's longest run of the season.

“He’s a special player,” Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said. “What he can do in both the run game and pass game is very unique.”

Watts' second interception, the third thrown by Stafford, stopped the Rams on a fourth-down play from the Atlanta 27 with 9:04 remaining.

Falcons coach Raheem Morris credited cornerback A.J. Terrell and the defense for limiting Nacua to five catches for 47 yards.

“I think the defensive staff did a great job again, limiting a great football player,” Morris said.

Scrimmage yards record

Robinson needed 151 rushing and receiving yards to break William Andrews’ team scrimmage yards record of 2,176 set in 1983. Robinson had five catches for 34 yards, including a 4-yard touchdown reception, to finish with 229 scrimmage yards in the game and 2,255 for the year.

Sudden surge of interceptions

Stafford, who earned his third Pro Bowl honor this season, began the week leading the NFL in touchdown passes and passing yards. He had thrown only five interceptions before his turnover-plagued effort against the Falcons.

Stafford completed 22 of 38 passes for 269 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions. He has a career-best 42 touchdown passes this season.

It was his first three-interception game since Week 1 of 2022.

“It boils down to execution every week, right?” Stafford said. “Either you execute and make the throws or you don’t. And I didn’t do that tonight, so it hurt us and we weren’t able to overcome it.”

Credit to the blockers

Robinson gave thanks to his line and wide receiver Drake London for the key blocks on his 93-yard scoring run. London had a downfield block on a defensive back to help clear Robinson's path.

“It takes everybody for those kind of runs to happen,” Robinson said.

Rams starters will play

McVay didn't hesitate when asked if his starters would rest in Sunday's final regular-season game against Arizona.

“No, we're playing,” McVay said. “We were playing anyway. We need to play.”

The Rams will open the playoffs on the road, an outcome that was set after NFC West rivals Seattle and San Francisco both won on Sunday. They entered the night as the No. 5 seed.
