""I feel like I've been in that spot a lot in my life,"" Stafford said of Saturday's game-winning drive.","With the pocket collapsing late in the first half during a 34-31 wild-card round win over the Carolina Panthers on Saturday in Charlotte, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford hit his throwing hand on edge rusher D.J. Wonnum.

Stafford, an MVP frontrunner and finally a first-team All-Pro, completed only two of his next 10 passes.

He tossed an interception in the third quarter on an underthrown pass and would have been picked off again in the fourth quarter had it not been for two-time Pro Bowl wideout Puka Nacua's superb defensive back impression.

Stafford was mostly on the money in the final frame, though. He completed 12-of-15 passes for 143 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, the second a 19-yard game-winner to tight end Colby Parkinson.

""Yeah, I got a finger bent back,"" the 17-year veteran said postgame, when asked about his right hand. ""They saw it on the TV on the sideline or whatever. I didn't obviously know exactly what had happened.

""It wasn't pleasant. It wasn't great. We'll see what it is. I was obviously able to finish the game and throw it decent. Once the ball's snapped, the adrenaline's pretty good, so we'll hopefully just keep it going.""

Stafford will seemingly be fine, though, as NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Sunday morning that X-rays were negative on the QB's finger.

Stafford entered top five all time in NFL game-winning drives. He engineered his latest on the road in Bank of America Stadium with the Rams' season hanging in the balance.

""He was steady. It was MVP type of stuff, what he did,"" L.A. head coach Sean McVay said of Stafford, who finished with 304 yards and three touchdowns through the air.

""Just good, calm. I thought he redirected a couple of the protections that allowed him not to be hot where we would've been. And on all those plays, he ended up finding completions, and he got a bunch of different guys involved. I thought he saw the field really well. And that's why we're advancing, because of his leadership.""

Stafford went 6 of 7 on that series, which began with the Rams trailing 31-27 and only 2:39 remaining.

The three-time Pro Bowler agreed with his head coach that he was steady. He also said that he was seeing the Panthers' coverages well, and he complimented his offensive line for keeping him clean so he could go through his progressions.

""I feel like I've been in that spot a lot in my life,"" Stafford said of Saturday's game-winning drive. ""And so it brings a smile to my face because I like being there.

After the Panthers took a late fourth-quarter lead on a beautiful pass from QB Bryce Young to the back corner of the end zone where WR Jalen Coker made a great catching while being tackled, the Rams marched down the field and answered with a touchdown of their own that took the lead for good in the final minute.

Back in Week 18, the Panthers had a win-and-in game against their division rival Buccaneers to win the NFC South and secure a home playoff game. Carolina ended up losing that game in Tampa, 16-14, in an ugly game played in the rain. Young outplayed Bucs QB Baker Mayfield, but the Panthers had just 19 total rushing yards and turned it over three times and never got any consistent momentum on offense.

However, due to the mechanics of a three-way tie for the NFC South lead between the Panthers, Buccaneers, and Falcons, Carolina won the division and hosted Los Angeles on Saturday. It didn’t go the way the Panthers hoped, but it was their first playoff game since 2017 and builds some momentum for Young and Panthers HC Dave Canales.

NFL Delivers Punishment to a Carolina Panthers Defender Before the Rams Game

Ahead of the Rams game, the Panthers got the news that one of their players was hit with a fine by the league for his actions against Tampa Bay. Panthers CB Mike Jackson was fined $11,593 for a taunting penalty he received late in the first quarter of that game.

Against the Buccaneers, Jackson had seven tackles. He was sensational for Carolina against the Rams, finishing the wildcard game with three tackles, four passes defensed, and a third-quarter interception that set up the Panthers’ first go-ahead touchdown. Los Angeles continually attacked him on the outside — as they’d rather target him than former All-Pro CB Jaycee Horn — but he stepped up time and time again with big stops and huge plays when his team needed him most.

Carolina Panthers QB Bryce Young Had a Fantastic Postseason Debut

The game didn’t go his way, but Young was sensational in his first postseason action. He’d had an up and down third season in Carolina, having some huge moments — including the fourth quarter of the Panthers’ Week 13 win over the Rams — but also had some struggles, particularly in high-volume passing game scripts.

Against the Rams in the wildcard round, Young went 21 of 40 for 264 yards, with one touchdown and one interception. He also ran three times for 24 yards and a second-quarter touchdown to give Carolina some momentum going into halftime.

The completion percentage and yards per attempt numbers might not jump off the page, but it felt like every time the Panthers needed a big play, Young stepped up. He made big plays downfield when his team needed him, though he and his team ultimately came up just short.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2253835929-e1768096956751.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-11 11:59:29.782249

The Jacksonville Jaguars have the youngest kicker in the NFL who currently holds the league record for longest two made field goals.

Buffalo is banking on Prater being available and effective when the Bills travel to play the Jaguars at 1 p.m. Sunday.

Matt Prater, 41, is considered day-to-day with a quadriceps injury that has kept him out 2 1/2 of the last three games. Bills head coach Sean McDermott called the nagging injury ""unfortunate.""

Meanwhile, Jacksonville's Cam Little has made 20 straight field goals entering the playoffs, including an NFL-record 68-yarder on Nov. 2 and a 67-yarder, the second longest in league history, last week.

Is Matt Prater playing today?

Prater is expected to play in the wild-card game against the Jaguars on Sunday. His was officially questionable on the final injury report. Prater sat out Wednesday's walkthrough, participated in full at Thursday's practice and rested on Friday.

The Bills signed veteran Matthew Wright to the practice squad Tuesday but did not elevate him.

Prater will be the only kicker available. Buffalo could utilize punter Mitch Wishnowsky on kickoffs and choose to attempt 2-point conversions after touchdowns.

Bills running back Ray Davis is the team's unofficial emergency kicker. He made an extra point in the preseason and attempted an onside kick for Buffalo in Week 10. Davis was named first-team All-Pro as a kickoff returner on Saturday.

Prater re-aggravated his right quadriceps injury that kept him out of the previous two games in the season finale.

He made all three of his extra point attempts in the first half but did not play in the second half of the Bills' 35-8 win over the New York Jets. Buffalo went for 2-point conversion attempts on each of its second-half touchdowns and punter Mitch Wishnowsky handled kickoff duties.

""Kind of work with two plans, one where he’s able to go come Sunday and one where he’s perhaps not able to go,"" McDermott said on Monday.

Prater has made 18 of 20 field-goal attempts and 46 of 49 extra points for 100 points in 15 games this season. The 19-year veteran holds the NFL record with 82 field goals of at least 50 yards. He held the league record for longest made field goal, 64 yards, from 2013-2021.

Wright kicked in four games this season for the Titans, Commanders and Texans, going 5-for-5 on field goals and 4 of 4 on extra points. He's made 60 of 68 field goal attempts and 45 of 47 extra points in 33 career appearances.

The Bills signed veteran Michael Badgley with Prater out Weeks 16 and 17, but released him on Dec. 29 after he continued to be plagued with extra point struggles. Badgley played two games with the Bills, missing an extra point in his first game and having an extra point blocked in his second game. The latter complicated the Bills' comeback attempt and ability to tie or take the lead in the final seconds of a 13-12 loss to the Eagles.

Before his injury, Edwards had six tackles and a pass defended. D’Marco Jackson, who started four games in the regular season, came into the game when Edwards exited, and he ended with four tackles on defense with a tackle for loss.

Theo Benedet, who had eight regular-season starts at tackle, came in at left tackle after Trapilo left the game.

Edwards is feared to have suffered a fracture fibula, coach Ben Johnson said after the game, while Trapilo suffered a patellar tendon injury. Both injuries will likely sideline them for the rest of the season, starting with next week’s divisional round game against either the Philadelphia Eagles or Los Angeles Rams.

Edwards was carted off the field in the second quarter with a gruesome ankle injury after his left foot stepped on Packers wide receiver Christian Watson’s foot. Edwards left the field with his leg in an air cast and was later ruled out of the game at Soldier Field.

The game broadcast showed Bears chairman George McCaskey hurrying down the hallway to be with Edwards as he headed to the X-ray room.

D’Marco Jackson, a 2022 fifth-round pick in his first year with the Bears, took Edwards’ place on the field. The Bears were already thin at linebacker, with Noah Sewell placed on injured reserve after suffering an Achilles injury in Week 17 against the San Francisco 49ers. Linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga was unable to suit up for the game due to a concussion.

Trapilo, a rookie second-round pick, was injured late in the fourth quarter. He was able to get off the field on his own but was in obvious pain.

Edwards injury crushing for team and player

Edwards missed seven games this season, so the defense has a backup in Jackson, who’s gotten reps in Edwards’ spot. Not only is there a drop-off in experience, but it continues if the Bears want to be in their base defense. Sewell is on IR, Ogbongbemiga (concussion) is out, so Jalen Reeves-Maybin — brought back to the team late this week — appears to be the third linebacker.

Edwards, who signed a contract extension last March, grew up a Bears fan. This had to be crushing for him to have to leave a playoff game at Soldier Field. A winner of the team’s Piccolo Award last season, he’s respected in the building, and you could tell how much it hurt his teammates to see him have to leave the game. The defense is getting gashed, and losing a starter like Edwards isn’t going to help. — Bears beat writer Kevin Fishbain",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/10205648/AP26011068228524-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-11 09:57:54.375388

""He was steady. It was MVP type of stuff, what he did,"" L.A. head coach Sean McVay said of Stafford, who finished with 304 yards and three touchdowns through the air.

""Just good, calm. I thought he redirected a couple of the protections that allowed him not to be hot where we would've been.

There seems to be a sense that Johnson is going to try very hard to suit up. But it doesn’t sound like a lock that he’ll be ready to go.

The latest update comes from NFL insider Mike Garafolo, who had the following to say on Saturday afternoon (bold emphasis mine):

“Lane Johnson, listed as questionable, and I know we’ve said all week: ‘There is nothing that’s going to keep Lane Johsnon off the field.’ Well, Ian Rapoport and I have been doing our calls today, and there’s some concern he could miss this game. He was limited in practice all week. He looked good in spurts but that’s a tough injury, it’s a painful injury. I would say that this is a legitimate game-time decision.”

No inside information here but I wonder if the Eagles are wondering if they can try to get by with sitting Lane for one more week. The 49ers have the worst pass rush in the NFL with a league-low 20 sacks. Of course, it’s hard to merely assume you’re going to win a playoff game and being too conservative with Lane could come back to haunt the team.

Stafford was able to stay in the game despite the injury and immediately flashed a thumbs-up to Sean McVay after the play. Nonetheless, the veteran quarterback endured some uncharacteristic struggles with his accuracy throughout the third quarter, leading many to wonder about the severity of his potential injury.

Here's what to know about Stafford's hand as the Rams start to look ahead toward the NFL's divisional round.

Matthew Stafford injury update

Stafford was asked about his hand injury during a postgame news conference. He told reporters he ""got a finger bent back"" on the play in question, which led to his reaction on the field.

""They saw it on the TV on the sideline or whatever. I didn't obviously know exactly what had happened,"" Stafford explained. ""It wasn't pleasant. It wasn't great.""

Stafford didn't seem overly worried about the injury being a long-term issue for him.

""We'll see what it is,"" Stafford said. ""I was obviously able to finish the game and throw it decent. Once the ball's snapped, the adrenaline's pretty good. So we'll hopefully just keep it going.""

Nonetheless, Stafford's practice status will warrant monitoring as the Rams prepare for their divisional-round playoff game.

Who is the Rams backup QB?

If Stafford's injury ends up being worse in severity than initially anticipated, Los Angeles would turn to Jimmy Garoppolo to lead it as the team chases a Super Bowl.

Garoppolo, 34, is in his second season with the Rams. He didn't attempt a pass this season but went 0-1 as a starter for Sean McVay's squad last year while completing 27 of 41 passes for 334 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.

Garoppolo has started 64 games across his 12 NFL seasons since being a second-round pick by the New England Patriots in the 2014 NFL Draft. The Eastern Illinois product has a 43-21 career record across those starts and helped lead the San Francisco 49ers to Super Bowl 54. They lost that game 31-20 to the Kansas City Chiefs in what was Patrick Mahomes' first career Super Bowl win.

Rams QB depth chart

The Rams have three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster. Below is a look at the pecking order within the group:

Matthew Stafford

Jimmy Garoppolo

Stetson Bennett IV

Bennett was a fourth-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. He played collegiately at Georgia and helped lead the Bulldogs to two national championships.

Bennett has not yet played a snap at the NFL level but was designated the team's emergency third quarterback for the team's wild-card win over the Panthers.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/11/USAT/88125211007-matthew-stafford-rams-011026.jpg?crop=2191,1233,x220,y123&width=2191&height=1233&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-11 01:13:15.642082

It has been a tough return to the postseason for the Bears, who haven't played a home playoff game since the 2018 season. They faced a 21-3 halftime deficit against the Green Bay Packers, who couldn't be stopped in the first half.

While trying to stage a second-half comeback, something they've done all season, things got a little funky when Williams went down favoring his ankle early in the third quarter.

The quarterback rolled out to his right, hoping to make for a manageable fourth down try. Instead the pass fell incomplete and Williams fell to the turf, favoring that ankle.

Replays showed that the quarterback rolled it after letting go of the ball. He landed awkwardly and appeared to be in pain, but limped off the field. He didn't require a stint in the blue medical tent and returned to action on Chicago's next drive, facing a 21-6 deficit.

The Amazon Prime broadcast mentioned that Williams was not attended to by training staff while on the sideline.

Caleb Williams injury update

Williams didn't miss a play after rolling his ankle and wasn't attended to by the Bears training staff while on the sideline.

It doesn't appear to be an issue that will keep the quarterback out of the game, but it could compromise some of his mobility.

Should that become an issue and force a change at the most important position in sports, Tyson Bagent would be Williams' replacement.

Tottenham’s top scorer in the Premier League this season was taken off after half an hour with the score 1-0 to Villa, holding the back of his left leg.

The north London side have played four games in 2026 already, with only two full rest days between each. The Brazil international has featured in every match this season, scoring seven in the Premier League and once in the Champions League.

“It could look like that,” the head coach said when asked if it was a hamstring injury after the game. “I think there (are) a few injuries across the Premier League.

“I think it’s something for the football authorities to look into as well. We played five games in 13 days. Four in 10, one of the few clubs who did that. And it’s our third time this season. That’s just the most tricky thing. With two days between. We are dealing with it. We’re doing everything we can to compete in it, but that’s a tough schedule.”

Earlier on Saturday, Tino Livramento was forced off with what Eddie Howe said he thought was a hamstring injury, as Newcastle United are facing a similarly relentless schedule.

After going 2-0 down in the first half, Tottenham pulled one back via Wilson Odobert but could not equalise and the game finished 2-1. Their FA Cup third round exit capped off a disappointing week in which they lost to Bournemouth and drew to Sunderland despite going ahead in both games.

The loss of Richarlison has been the fourth injury in this time, as Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Bergvall and Rodrigo Bentancur have also been sidelined.

Tottenham have Dominic Solanke back, however, after an ankle issue that has limited him to only three appearances this season and forced him to undergo surgery. The forward was substituted on in the 83rd minute of Saturday’s FA Cup tie.

Ricky Pearsall Injury Update: Will He Play on Sunday vs. Eagles?

Pearsall re-aggravated his PCL and tweaked his ankle in the 49ers’ 42-38 victory over the Bears in Week 17. Before getting hurt, he led San Fran with 5 catches for 85 receiving yards and looked primed to help his team make a run in the playoffs.

After Pearsall's absence in Week 18, he didn't practice all week, leaving his status in serious question leading up to the biggest game of the season.

Even though Pearsall hasn’t taken any reps in practice, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan expressed that he still has “a chance” to play against the Eagles on Sunday.

Pearsall is a critical piece of the 49ers' passing game, and his presence could swing San Francisco’s chances on Sunday. The team is 8-1 with Pearsall and 4-4 without him this year.

In nine regular-season games during his sophomore campaign, Pearsall hauled in 36 passes for 528 yards. He was targeted 53 times.

San Francisco 49ers' Offensive Outlook for Wild Card Game

Pearsall's questionable status casts uncertainty over the 49ers' receiving corps for Sunday's Wild Card Round showdown.

If the 49ers' stud WR is sidelined, TE George Kittle becomes the premier pass-catching option for QB Brock Purdy. Kittle has been a model of consistency, posting 628 receiving yards and 7 TDs while averaging 11.0 yards per reception (YPR).

Kittle's chemistry with Purdy has been on full display all year. His target share (21.6%, fourth-most), first-read targets (45, sixth-most), and first-read target share (25.3%, third-most) showcase the trust between QB and TE. Without Pearsall, Kittle had 29 receptions for 303 receiving yards and 3 TDs in six games.

George Kittle PrizePicks Projections vs. Eagles: 4.5 Receptions (Goblin), 59.5 receiving yards, 7.5 targets

49ers WR Jauan Jennings also has been a big part of the offense in Pearsall’s absence, posting 28 receptions for 301 yards and 3 TDs in seven outings. Jennings’ 11.7 YPR during the regular season showcases his big-play ability.

If the 49ers are forced to play catch-up without Pearsall, both Kittle and Jennings could carry significant upside.

""Total team effort. Obviously had some mistakes along the way. I turned it over,"" said Stafford.

""So a lot to clean up. But we found a way to win it late,"" he added.

The Rams had entered what proved a nervy, unpredictable and error-strewn clash as overwhelming favorites against a Carolina team that reached the playoffs despite finishing the regular season with an 8-9 losing record.

And the Los Angeles franchise started the NFC's first post-season clash with surgical precision.

Star wide receiver Puka Nacua grabbed all three passes of Los Angeles' opening drive, including a 14-yard touchdown reception.

He then received a lateral pass from Stafford and rushed five yards for his second touchdown and a 14-0 lead.

But the Panthers immediately fought back.

A seven-play, 65-yard drive from kickoff ended with a rushing touchdown for Chuba Hubbard.

The Rams grew nervy, spurning chances to build their lead. Suffering a blow to his hand in the second quarter, Stafford missed seven passes in a row. Nacua dropped a touchdown opportunity.

Quarterback Bryce Young -- chosen by Carolina first overall in the 2023 draft -- showed his athleticism in a 16-yard scramble for a touchdown just before half time.

With pressure mounting in the second half, Stafford saw a pass intercepted, and the Panthers took their first lead of the night with another Hubbard rushing touchdown.

The Rams regained their composure, with Stafford finding Kyren Williams for a no-look TD pass.

But there was a dramatic twist ahead. With barely four minutes left, the Panthers blocked a fourth-down punt to regain possession at the Rams' 30-yard line.

Young found wide receiver Jalen Coker for the go-ahead touchdown.

Finally, Stafford again pulled it back, locating Colby Parkinson for a 19-yard game-winning touchdown.

""I believe in my teammates. I know they believe in me,"" said a relieved Stafford.

Despite the narrow victory, the Rams are among the favorites for this year's Super Bowl, which will be played in California, at the home of their NFC rivals the San Francisco 49ers.

The 49ers will play defending champions Philadelphia in a Sunday wild card game.

Later Saturday, the Chicago Bears host the Green Bay Packers in the latest installment of the white hot rivalry between the NFC North giants.

The Green Bay Packers' All-Pro edge rusher won't be playing in the team's wild-card playoff game against the Chicago Bears on Saturday, Jan. 10, but he's in attendance at Soldier Field.

And he didn't walk into the stadium alone.

Trevon Diggs, the Packers' newest cornerback and good friend to Parsons from their days in Dallas, was there to wait for him.

Parsons, while wearing a brace on his left knee, was using forearm crutches, to assist in his walking.

Diggs, who will be playing in just his second game with the Packers, was rocking an oversized fur coat and leather pants.

The Packers signed Diggs on Dec. 31 after the former All-Pro cornerback was released by the Cowboys on Dec. 30. His signing reunited Diggs and Parsons, who were teammates for several years in Dallas.

The Packers acquired Parsons in late August days before the start of the regular season in a blockbuster trade with the Cowboys. His season, however, was cut short after he suffered the ACL injury last month in a Week 15 game. Despite missing the last three games, Parsons earned his fourth All-Pro recognition in his first five seasons after registering 12.5 sacks.

Micah Parsons injury update

Parsons had surgery to repair his torn ACL on Dec. 29, two weeks after he sustained the injury in the third quarter against the Denver Broncos on Dec. 14.

Parsons hasn't wasted time in attacking his recovery. He shared a video on his social media during a rehab session this week in Green Bay, saying ""One week out! Let’s make the crazy look normal.""

Parsons added that he's getting ""stronger!""

But Parsons isn't sugarcoating his road ahead, though.

In a response to a comment on X on Jan. 9, Parsons wrote that ""this recovery process is incredibly challenging and painful. Every day, I must enter a state of attack mode to endure the excruciating pain. However, I am gradually improving, healing faster than anyone could have anticipated. I feel Gods hands all over me me through this difficult journey.""","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/29/PMJS/86414767007-gan-20250928-lbm-an-4-132.JPG?crop=4958,2790,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-10 21:13:21.157389

Rams inactives today vs. Panthers The Rams have announced their seven inactives for Saturday's game against the Panthers.","On the day where he earned his first All-Pro honor, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford battled through injury and led two fourth-quarter touchdown drives to secure a 34-31 victory over the host Carolina Panthers.

Stafford started the game hot before he appeared to hurt the index finger of his throwing hand in the second quarter. Carolina made the most of some Rams miscues in the first half to keep pace with the NFC West runners-up; Los Angeles held just a 17-14 lead at halftime.

The teams traded field goals in the third quarter and Stafford threw his lone interception of the game to close the frame.

Carolina capitalized to take a 24-20 lead with a Chuba Hubbard touchdown on a short field. Los Angeles took the lead minutes later with a touchdown from Stafford to Kyren Williams.

The Rams looked set for a three-and-out on their next drive but Carolina's Isaiah Simmons blocked the punt and gave the ball back to Hubbard, Bryce Young and company on a short field one again. Young found Jalen Coker to go ahead 31-27 with less than three minutes to go in the game.

But Stafford came through on the ensuing drive with a signature seven-play, 71-yard drive culminating in a pass to Colby Parkinson that the tight end took past the goal line for the game-winning score.

Stafford finished the game 24-for-42 passing for 304 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. Los Angeles now awaits the results of Bears-Packers and Eagles-49ers to determine who they will play in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs.

Here's how it all happened:

Rams vs. Panthers takeaways

Rams survive un-special teams: Los Angeles' five losses in 2025 were by a total of 17 points, a a pair of them featured mistakes on special teams: a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown against Philadelphia and a punt return touchdown allowed against Seattle. This time, the Rams pulled through despite a late blocked punt thanks to Stafford's magic.

Carolina and the Young guns: The 8-9 Panthers were double-digit underdogs at home. After the first quarter, things looked grim for Carolina. Bryce Young shook off an early interception and the Rams' pass rush to put together one of the best performances of his career. Carolina can enter the offseason confident with how things went, even in a loss.

LA reset: Stafford looked to have played through a finger injury. Depending on how things go for the rest of wild-card weekend, Los Angeles could be back in Seattle for a third matchup between the two teams. The Seahawks and their ferocious defense took the weekend off after getting the No. 1 seed. Stafford needs to rest that hand ahead of what could be a dogfight to reach the NFC champonship game.

Panthers-Rams score update: Colby Parkinson secures epic TD catch

Los Angeles needed just two minutes to drive 71 yards on seven plays. Matthew Stafford found tight end Colby Parkinson on the right sideline on first-and-10 from the Panthers' 19-yard line and Parkinson made the twisting catch into the end zone. Harrison Mevis' kick is good and the Rams take the lead again with 38 seconds left.

Rams 34, Panthers 31

Panthers-Rams score update: Jalen Coker puts Panthers ahead late

Carolina's back on top after the blocked punt. Facing third-and-3 from the Rams' 7-yard line, Bryce Young found Jalen Coker in the corner of the end zone for a touchdown. Ryan Fitzgerald knocked through the extra point to give the Panthers a critical four-point lead with 2:39 to go in the game.

Panthers 31, Rams 27

Panthers-Rams update: Isaiah Simmons makes huge play for Panthers

Carolina's defense forced Los Angeles to punt late in the fourth quarter. But instead of getting the ball on their side of the 50, Panthers linebacker Isaiah Simmons blocked the punt to give the Panthers the ball at the Rams' 30-yard line. They're down three points with less than three minutes to go.

Panthers-Rams score update: Stafford finds Kyren Williams for score

Los Angeles answered the Panthers' go-ahead touchdown with one of their own. Kyren Williams converted a critical fourth-and-1 in Carolina territory. Five plays later, he took a pass from Matthew Stafford in for a touchdown from 13 yards out. Harrison Mevis' extra point is good and Los Angeles re-takes the lead with 8:47 to go in the fourth quarter.

Rams 27, Panthers 24

Panthers-Rams score update: Carolina takes lead

Carolina capitalized on Matthew Stafford's interception and went 62 yards in just four plays to score the go-ahead touchdown. Chuba Hubbard notched his second touchdown of the game from three yards out and Ryan Fitzgerald's extra point is good for the Panthers to take a four-point lead.

Panthers-Rams score update: Rams pull ahead with field goal

Matthew Stafford couldn't connect with Puka Nacua on third down from the Panthers' 24-yard line. Rather than go for it, Los Angeles opted to take the go-ahead points. Harrison Mevis made a 42-yard field goal to put the Rams back ahead with just over four minutes to go in the third quarter.

Rams 20, Panthers 17

Panthers-Rams score update: Carolina ties it up in third

The Panthers' offense put together the longest drive of the game by going 59 yards on 13 plays in more than seven minutes of game time. Carolina couldn't convert on 3rd and 7 from the Rams' 32-yard line so the Panthers settled for a game-tying field goal attempt. Ryan Fitzgerald knocked it through from 46 yards out to tie the game with 7:29 left in the third quarter.

Who is the Panthers' backup QB?

Bryce Young is playing well in his playoff debut today after an early interception. If he goes down, the Panthers have three-time Pro Bowler Andy Dalton to take over in a pinch.

Matthew Stafford stats today

The first-team All-Pro got off to a hot start to open the game before cooling off ahead of halftime. Here's how things look at the break:

Completions: 10

Panthers-Rams score update: Bryce Young does it himself

Carolina forced another turnover on downs against the Los Angeles offense to get a chance to score before halftime. The Panthers' offense did just that by driving 81 yards in just five plays. Young dropped back on third-and-10 from the Rams' 16-yard line and got loose for a rushing touchdown. The extra point is good and the Panthers cut the deficit with less than a minute until halftime.

Rams 17, Panthers 14

Panthers-Rams update: Muffed punt gives Rams the ball back

Matthew Stafford missed Davante Adams on third down and the Rams settled for a punt. On the return, rookie running back Trevor Etienne fumbled the ball and Los Angeles takes over in Carolina territory with just under three minutes left in the first half.

Who is the Thiccer Kicker?

Rams kicker Harrison Mevis – aptly nicknamed the ""Thiccer Kicker"" for his stout, 6-foot, 245-pound frame – is in his first season of NFL action after spending time in the UFL in 2025. He spent time with the Panthers in 2024 during the offseason.

What happened to Isaiah Simmons?

The former first-round pick by the Arizona Cardinals signed with the Carolina Panthers' practice squad in late November. He'd signed with the Cardinals after getting cut by the Green Bay Packers during training camp. Simmons was moved to the Panthers' active roster after an injury to linebacker Trevin Wallace.

Panthers vs Rams score update: Harrison Mevis lengthens Rams lead

The ""Thiccer Kicker"" notched a 46-yard field goal to put the Rams up by 10 points with the second quarter nearing five minutes remaining. The Panthers defense held on a short third down to force the kick.

Rams 17, Panthers 7

Panthers vs Rams score update: Chuba Hubbard finds end zone as Carolina answers

Carolina will not be shut out on home turf today. The Panthers' offense took more than three minutes off the game clock with a 65-yard scoring drive powered by a crucial catch by Jalen Coker. Chuba Hubbard ran it in from one yard out. Ryan Fitzgerald knocked through the extra point to make it a seven-point game.

Rams 14, Panthers 7

Puka Nacua stats today

Nacua is putting on a show early vs. the Panthers: He has one touchdown across five catches and is credited with a carry and a touchdown. That's good for 64 yards combined with two touchdowns.

Panthers vs Rams score update: Nacua finds end zone again

The Rams' offense put together another scoring drive with a seven-play, 48-yard march to the end zone culminating in a five-yard score by Puka Nacua. Stafford threw a screen behind the line of scrimmage to Nacua and it's counted as a 5-yard rush for the Rams' star wideout. Harrison Mevis' kick is good and the Rams have a two-score lead early in the second quarter.

Ikem Ekwonu injury update: Panthers LT ruled out with knee injury

Bad news for the Panthers OL: Ekwonu, who went down midway through the first with a knee injury, has been ruled out for the game.

Panthers-Rams score update: Puka Nacua snags touchdown to open scoring

Los Angeles' defense held strong on fourth down to force a turnover on downs. The Rams offense needed just four plays to score as Matthew Stafford found his top target, Puka Nacua, in the middle of the end zone for a touchdown. Harrison Mevis' extra point is good and the Rams take an early lead on the road of the wild-card playoff opener.

We know that Johnson is officially listed as questionable to play after being limited in practice all week.

There seems to be a sense that Johnson is going to try very hard to suit up. But it doesn’t sound like a lock that he’ll be ready to go.

The latest update comes from NFL insider Mike Garafolo, who had the following to say on Saturday afternoon (bold emphasis mine):

“Lane Johnson, listed as questionable, and I know we’ve said all week: ‘There is nothing that’s going to keep Lane Johsnon off the field.’ Well, Ian Rapoport and I have been doing our calls today, and there’s some concern he could miss this game. He was limited in practice all week. He looked good in spurts but that’s a tough injury, it’s a painful injury. I would say that this is a legitimate game-time decision.”

No inside information here but I wonder if the Eagles are wondering if they can try to get by with sitting Lane for one more week. The 49ers have the worst pass rush in the NFL with a league-low 20 sacks. Of course, it’s hard to merely assume you’re going to win a playoff game and being too conservative with Lane could come back to haunt the team.

The former FC Dallas man collided with the post when scoring, with the club confirming a forearm fracture.

""The 23-year-old forward will undergo surgery [Sunday]. Pepi is expected to be sidelined for about two months,"" PSV posted on social media.

This puts his status for the March international break's big games against Portugal and Belgium in the air, but these are games when Pepi will be needed.

We're now only 152 days out from the World Cup kicking off in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which isn't very much time if an injury causes a player to miss a few months. Pepi's injury comes during a good run of form for the striker.

That goal was the fifth consecutive Eredivisie game that Pepi has scored in for PSV as he's pushing for a consistent starting role at the club while also solidifying his place as the number two striker for the USMNT behind Folarin Balogun. A strong change of pace option off the bench for the USMNT, Pepi now has 11 goals and two assists in 22 appearances for PSV in all competitions. He's been especially effective in Champions League play, where he has scored three goals and assisted one more in only 149 minutes of play.

Despite that success, Pepi didn't see it translate to national team play during 2025. Only making one appearance for 15 minutes under Mauricio Pochettino, he's someone who has something to prove in these upcoming matches, which is where any kind of injury can be a concern. Pepi hasn't scored for the USMNT since November of 2024, but as one of the most talented young players in the pool, he'll be pushing for a spot at the World Cup if given opportunities to prove himself.

Johnson hasn't played since Week 11 because of a Lisfranc sprain.

Since the start of the 2016 season, the Eagles are 96-41-1 when Johnson starts. They're 15-27 when Johnson doesn't start, including 3-4 this season.

Johnson appeared in 10 games during the regular season. He got hurt in Week 11 against the Detroit Lions but was never placed on injured reserve.

""Lane's a big difference maker and I know he is working crazy to get himself back and we will see where that is this week,"" Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni said. ""But he's a difference maker. ... He's one of the best that's ever done it. I think I kind of get too much into scheme with that. But yeah, he allows you to do some different things.""

The Eagles are looking to repeat as Super Bowl champions. They will not accomplish that goal without Johnson in the lineup.

A future Hall of Famer, Johnson is a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Eagles. It will be fascinating to see if Philadelphia can win it all again this season. For that to happen, the offense has to wake up.

""The playoffs are fun, man, fun,"" Eagles WR DeVonta Smith said. ""It's kind of the thrill that you get knowing that it's win or go home. I like the thrill of it and I like what's at stake. The games are a little different – the weather is changing a little bit, it's a lot colder and I would say people are more amped up a little bit, maybe.

""You don't try to make it more than what it is. You don't try to get overhyped. It's the reason why you play this game.""

The Eagles were 19th in the NFL in points per game and fifth in points per game allowed during the regular season. They went 11-6 and won the NFC East again.

The NFL playoffs begin with two games Saturday, one of which features the Panthers hosting the Rams. It will be their second meeting this season after the Panthers pulled off the upset with a win over the Rams in Week 13. Let's break down this matchup and highlight three wagers to consider.

Mike Barner's season record: 50-45 (-5.23 units)

Panthers: Spread +10.5 (-110 Caesars), +460 Moneyline (FanDuel)

Game Total: Over 45.5 (-110 Fanatics), Under 46.5 (-118 FanDuel)

Davante Adams (hamstring) is slated to make his return for the Rams after missing the final three games of the regular season. The Panthers don't have any injuries of note among their top offensive skill players.

Panthers vs. Rams Betting Picks

Kyren Williams - Over 64.5 Rushing Yards (-114 FanDuel)

Blake Corum was more involved down the stretch for the Rams, but his presence didn't have a negative impact on Williams. Over the final six games of the season, Williams finished with at least 70 rushing yards five times. With regards to this prop, Willliams posted at least 65 rushing yards in 13 of his 17 games.

When Williams faced the Panthers previously, he ran for 72 yards and one touchdown on 13 carries. The Panthers allowed 4.59 yards per carry to running backs during the regular season, which was the ninth-highest mark in the league. In a game in which Williams could approach 15 rushing attempts, his chances of reaching at least 65 rushing yards are favorable.

Tetairoa McMillan - Over 55.5 Receiving Yards (-114 FanDuel)

Bryce Young threw for at least 200 yards in only four of his 16 games. However, that didn't stop McMillan from reaching 1,000 receiving yards in his rookie season. McMillan was able to remain successful because he had a 25.8 percent target share and received 44.9 percent of the Panthers' air yards. Also helping his cause was his average depth of target of 11.7 yards.

McMillan only received two targets the last time he played the Rams, catching one of them for a 43-yard touchdown. He finished the regular season with at least 73 receiving yards in two of his final three games. Overall, he logged at least 60 receiving yards in a game nine times. Expect him to get more targets his second time facing the Rams, which could help him hit this over.

Bryce Young - Over 0.5 Interceptions (-109 DraftKings)

Young was picked off 11 times during the regular season. That included him throwing at least one interception in five of his last nine games. He wasn't intercepted by the Rams in Week 13, and he even tied his season high with three touchdown passes in that game.

While the Rams didn't pick off Young in their first meeting with the Panthers, they had 16 interceptions during the regular season. That tied them with the Falcons for the sixth-most in the league. If the Rams race out to a big lead early, then the Panthers might be forced to throw the ball more than they'd normally like to in the second half. If that scenario unfolds, there could be even more opportunities for Young to throw a pick. These are appealing odds to take a chance on this wager.

Panthers vs. Rams Prediction

It was shocking that the Panthers defeated the Rams during the regular season. It would be even crazier if they pulled off another win in the playoffs. It does help the Panthers that this game will also be played at home, where they went 5-3 this season. They were only 3-6 on the road. Still, look for the Rams to come out firing and avenge that regular season loss with a lopsided victory.","https://res.cloudinary.com/rotowire/image/upload/ar_16:7,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto:custom_no_override,q_auto,w_800/jmbz2bo8iocncjvonxga.jpg",N,,2026-01-10 17:59:53.594694

Trey McBride's continued rise as a superstar was the highlight of former Rams in the 2025 NFL season.

There were also several rookies finding homes and veterans in key roles across the NFL.

Here's a look at how all former Rams in the NFL fared in 2025:

Trey McBride, Arizona Cardinals

It was a record-setting season for the fourth-year tight end as he set an NFL mark for receptions in a season by a tight end with 126. It's his second 100-plus reception season in a row. McBride had 1,239 yards and a career-high 11 receiving touchdowns.

McBride, considered one of the best tight ends — if not the best — in the NFL, now has 347 career receptions with 3,475 yards and 17 touchdowns. The Cardinals missed the playoffs and will have a new head coach for the 2026 season.

Tory Horton, Seattle Seahawks

It was a productive rookie season for Horton on one of the NFL's best teams before injury shortened his season. Horton was sidelined midseason with a shin injury that is likely to keep him out of the playoffs.

Horton played eight games and the receiver had 13 catches for 161 yards and five receiving touchdowns. He also had 238 punt return yards, including taking one back for a touchdown. Seattle is the top seed in the NFC.

Trent Sieg, Dallas Cowboys

The eighth-year player continued as the starting long-snapper. The 2025 season was his third in the role for Dallas after five with the Raiders.

Adam Prentice, Denver Broncos

The fifth-year fullback was picked in the preseason by the Broncos and has carved out an important role for one of the best teams in the NFL. Prentice has 10 carries for 44 yards and six catches for 53 yards. All are career highs.

The fullback spent the first four seasons of his career with New Orleans. The Broncos are the No. 1 seed in the AFC and have a first-round playoff bye.

Drew Moss, Tennessee Titans

The rookie offensive lineman made the San Francisco 49ers' 53-man roster as an undrafted free agent. He appeared in five games as a reserve lineman before being waived midway through the season. He was claimed by the Tennessee Titans but did not appear in any games with the Titans.

Dom Jones, Cleveland Browns

The rookie defensive back made the Cleveland roster as an undrafted free agent. He went on to appear in eight games in 2025, making five tackles.

Chigozie Anusiem, Las Vegas Raiders

The second-year pro has cycled through several rosters. The defensive back was with Washington's practice squad for much of 2024 before joining Cleveland's practice squad. He was with Cleveland in the 2025 preseason before being waived and then signed to Arizona.

Late in the 2025 season, he was signed off Arizona's practice squad by Las Vegas. Anusiem appeared in three games for the Raiders and recorded one tackle.

Mohamed Kamara, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The second-year pro was waived by Miami (the team that drafted him) in preseason and then signed to Tampa Bay's practice squad. Kamara appeared in three games in the regular season for Tampa Bay but did not record any stats.

Barry Wesley, New Orleans Saints

The offensive lineman joined the Saints in the offseason but did not see the field for the Saints in 2025.

Shaquil Barrett

The longtime NFL sack-master announced his retirement in the summer of 2024 before announcing his intention to return. The Dolphins carried his rights but waived him, allowing Barrett to re-sign with Tampa Bay (where he won a Super Bowl) late in 2024, but he wasn't on the team in 2025 and is now retired.

Michael Gallup

Gallup retired before the 2024 season but attempted a comeback and signed by Washington ahead of the 2025 season. Gallup was released by the Commanders after catching four passes for 40 yards in three preseason games and was not picked up by any team since.

Ryan Stonehouse

The punter was released in preseason by Miami after losing a battle for the spot to Jake Bailey. Stonehouse led the league in gross average yards per punt each of his first two pro seasons, becoming the first player in league history to lead that category in their first two seasons. Stonehouse suffered a bad leg injury late in his second season but returned to punt in 2024. He was not picked up following his release by Miami.

Dequan Jackson

The linebacker has spent time on the Jacksonville and Miami practice squads previously. He was released by Miami in preseason and didn't sign elsewhere.","https://www.coloradoan.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/08/PFTC/88090369007-usatsi-27223270.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-10 16:59:20.997599

Will Kyler Gordon play vs. Packers?

The Bears are expected to get back nickel cornerback Kyler Gordon in time for Saturday night's playoff game against the Packers. Gordon has spent time on injured reserve on two separate occasions this season, most recently for a groin injury that's held him out for the last five games. Chicago is expected to activate Gordon off IR just in time for this wild-card game. But, for now, he's questionable.

Will Rome Odunze suit up in wild-card playoffs?

Just as the defense is getting back a key player, the Bears offense is getting back wide receiver Rome Odunze in time for their most important game of the season. Odunze has missed the last five games with a foot injury, and after attempting a return in Week 15 against the Browns, Odunze reaggravated his foot injury and missed the remainder of the regular season. Odunze practiced all week, including in full on Friday, and he has no injury designation heading into this game.

And along with him, the Bills will be without starting middle linebacker Terrel Bernard and rookie defensive back Maxwell Hairston, as both are sidelined with injuries. However, placekicker Matt Prater and linebacker Shaq Thompson are game-time decisions.

Palmer has been ruled out with an ankle injury after initially being listed as questionable to play against the Jaguars on Sunday Night Football, the team announced Saturday.

27-year-old Palmer is in the first year of his three-year deal with the Bills. It is a contract that counts $11.9 million against the 2025 salary cap. His season never really got into a rhythm after he hurt his ankle in Buffalo’s October 13 loss to Houston.

He started the year strong, hauling in 14 passes for 236 yards over the first six games. But once he returned to the lineup, it was a different story. Over the final six weeks of the regular season, Palmer managed just eight catches for 69 yards and never found the end zone.

Now, as Palmer is out, Buffalo’s available pool of wide receivers for Sunday’s game includes Khalil Shakir, Tyrell Shavers, Brandin Cooks, Gabe Davis, and Keon Coleman.

And then there were 14.

With the regular season in the books, wild-card weekend kicks off with six games spread out across three days. Six teams in each conference square off while the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks, the top seeds of the AFC and NFC, respectively, enjoy their bye weeks.

It’s truly a wide-open postseason featuring numerous contenders but no clear-cut, dominant force of a team.

The action kicks off with two NFC showdowns on Saturday before another three (two in the AFC and one NFC) games take place Sunday. Monday night’s meeting between the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers caps the action.

Here are the most compelling storylines to follow in each of this weekend’s playoff contests.

The vets versus the new kids

No. 5 Los Angeles Rams at No. 4 Carolina Panthers, 4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday, Fox

And so they meet again. It was Week 13 of the regular season. The Rams came to Charlotte, riding a six-game win streak and regarded by many as one of the best teams in football. Given L.A.’s excellence and the seesaw nature of the Panthers’ season, the oddsmakers favored the visitors by 10 points. However, the Rams wound up having an error-plagued day and fell in a 31-28 stunner.

Now, these teams meet again with extremely high stakes. It’s the Panthers’ first home playoff game in 10 years and only their second postseason contest since 2017. They have limped into the playoffs, having lost four of their last five and two straight, but had their path to the playoffs cleared thanks to the Atlanta Falcons defeating NFC South rivals Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New Orleans Saints. It’ll be interesting to see how this young team responds to the moment. On one hand, few expected them to reach this point, so the Panthers shouldn’t be dealing with immense pressure. At the same time, the intensity of the postseason can prove rather overwhelming for first-timers, especially when facing a heavily seasoned team like the Rams, who are making their sixth playoff appearance since 2017.

The Panthers will look to establish their run game to ease pressure on Bryce Young. That recipe served them well last time around. They rushed for a combined 164 yards and Young completed 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions.

Still, they’ll be facing a highly motivated Rams team that hasn’t at all forgotten about their Week 13 shortcoming in Charlotte.

Sean McVay’s squad boasts a dynamic and balanced offense and an imposing defense, and this time, they enter this meeting as 10 1/2 point favorites. Quarterback Matthew Stafford, who led the NFL with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes this season, will play in his 11th career postseason game. He has recorded multiple touchdown passes in eight consecutive playoff games — a feat only previously performed by Aaron Rodgers (nine straight games with the Green Bay Packers) and Joe Flacco (eight with the Baltimore Ravens).

Stafford said that aside from winning, he has one main goal for this rematch with Carolina.

“I’d like to not throw it to their team,” Stafford told reporters this week. “I think that was the story of the game when you think about it.”

If the Rams can avoid self-inflicted mistakes, victory should be theirs.

Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears, 8 p.m. ET, Saturday, Prime Video

After going 1-1 against each other during the regular season (with the home team winning each time), the Packers and Bears face off for the third time since Week 14. Neither enters the postseason on a particularly stellar note. Green Bay has lost four straight, and Chicago has dropped two in a row.

The Bears find themselves in the playoffs for the first time since the 2020 season and the second time since the 2018 season, yet they seek their first playoff victory since 2010, when they reached the conference championship. First-year coach Ben Johnson has seemingly managed to push all of the right buttons while guiding second-year quarterback Caleb Williams and the Bears on this journey of resurgence. Williams, who passed for a career-high 3,942 yards and 27 touchdowns, has posted five straight multi-touchdown games and looks to continue the streak this week while facing a Green Bay defense that is still trying to overcome the loss of Micah Parsons. Williams doesn’t have to do it alone, however. Green Bay has struggled mightily against the run, surrendering an average of 198 rushing yards in the last three games. The Bears’ tandem of D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai could be in for a big day.

Green Bay welcomes back quarterback Jordan Love, who hasn’t played since Week 16, and running back Josh Jacobs (out since Week 17). There’s a good bit of pressure on Love as he enters the fourth playoff game of his career. The Packers moved on from Rodgers following the 2022 season with the belief Love could better elevate the team, but thus far, Green Bay has gone 1-2 in the playoffs and hasn’t reached the conference championship since the 2020 campaign. In his most recent postseason outing, Love threw three interceptions and no touchdown passes in a 22-10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last season.

The previous two meetings came down to the final play of the game, so look for another hotly contested shootout as two of the league’s most talented play-calling head coaches, Johnson and Matt LaFleur, face off.

Allen under pressure; Jaguars rising

Buffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET, Sunday, CBS

It’s still hard to believe that of the AFC’s upper echelon of elite passers, only Josh Allen has reached the playoffs. Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow … all home for the postseason. For years, Mahomes and the Chiefs stood in Allen and Buffalo’s way. In 2023, Cincinnati sent the Bills packing. And Jackson has always given the Buffalo defense fits. With those obstacles removed, the door appears as open as ever for Allen and his team. Because of that, they enter the playoffs under more pressure than ever before.

Allen turned in another MVP-caliber season and certainly is one of the most seasoned quarterbacks in the playoffs. His 13 games (7-6 record) trail only Rodgers’ 22 (12-10 record). From there, the AFC playoff field features a huge drop-off in the experience department as C.J. Stroud has played four playoff games (2-2), Trevor Lawrence (1-1) and Justin Herbert (0-2) just two. Bo Nix lost in his postseason debut last season, and Drake Maye will make his playoff debut this year. The experience should serve Allen well. However, he may be working with one of the most limited supporting casts he has had in years. Yes, James Cook led the NFL in rushing this season, but Buffalo’s receiving unit features no threat capable of consistently winning one-on-one matchups. And the Bills’ defense struggles mightily against the run and ranks near the bottom third of the league in sacks. Therefore, Allen will have to don the cape once again.

Newcomer Jacksonville, which rebounded from a 4-13 record in 2024 to go 13-4 in Liam Coen’s first season as head coach, could pose plenty of challenges for Allen and the Bills, however. One of the hottest teams in the league, the Jaguars have won eight straight, winning those games by an average margin of 19.1 points per game. The Jaguars boast the league’s No. 1 rushing defense, holding opponents to 85.6 yards per contest, which could cause problems for Cook. Jacksonville’s defense also has forced 31 takeaways — the most in the AFC. On the other side of the ball, Jacksonville — led by running back Travis Etienne Jr. — averages 115.1 rushing yards per game. However, the Bills’ greatest weakness on defense is stopping the run. Buffalo gave up 136.2 rushing yards per game — fifth-most in the NFL.

Jacksonville’s offense has thrived under Coen’s direction, averaging 27.9 points per game, and spearheading the attack is Lawrence, the first pick of the 2021 draft, who, rather than blossoming into a generational talent, had instead battled inconsistencies and injury. He has, however, steadily improved in this first season with his new coach, throwing for a career-high 29 touchdown passes and rushing for another nine. A playoff win would go a long way toward changing the narrative surrounding the 26-year-old, while helping him reach the lofty potential once placed upon him.

The longshots versus the champs

San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles, 4:30 p.m. ET, Sunday, FOX

Two of the NFC’s top teams for the better part of the last decade, but also owners of lofty expectations and less-than-ideal situations, face off at Lincoln Financial Field — the 49ers and Eagles.

The visiting 49ers really have no business even being in this game. Injuries have ravaged this team, robbing it of some of its most impactful stars like Nick Bosa and Fred Warner. And yet, Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff have managed to keep their team afloat, plugging in young reserves and positioning them for impactful contributions. The 49ers have gotten healthier on offense as the season has gone along. Quarterback Brock Purdy, who missed eight games with injury, closed out the month of December on a tear, averaging 297.6 passing yards and 3.6 touchdowns per game. And much of San Francisco’s offensive success can be credited to running back Christian McCaffrey, who has rushed for 1,202 yards and 10 touchdowns while also recording 924 receiving yards and seven touchdown catches.

Defensively, the 49ers’ injuries have continued to mount. The 49ers just lost middle linebacker Tatum Bethune to a groin injury after he had filled in admirably for Warner, who has missed the bulk of the season with a dislocated ankle. Now, defensive coordinator Robert Saleh turns to 33-year-old Eric Kendricks to help anchor the defense.

San Francisco braces for an Eagles offense that boasts great weapons like Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, and yet the offense has struggled all season long to live up to its potential and execute consistently. Injuries have hampered the offensive line, and quarterback Jalen Hurts has at times appeared tentative rather than the aggressive passer and scrambler that helped lead the Eagles to victory in the Super Bowl. It’s anyone’s guess which Philadelphia offense will show up Sunday, but the potential for greatness is indeed there. So too is the support of a dominant defense that features playmakers at every level, and because of that Vic Fangio juggernaut, it’s hard to bet against the Eagles.

Battle of the generals

Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots, 8 p.m. ET, Sunday, NBC

Two of the most highly-regarded head coaches in the league face off as Mike Vrabel’s Patriots welcome Jim Harbaugh’s Chargers to Foxboro, Mass. The former linebacker and former quarterback have some similarities in their philosophies. Both have established a strong culture of accountability and discipline. Both pride themselves on toughness, grit and physicality, and their teams have adopted that mindset.

The success of Vrabel’s Patriots has ranked among the biggest stories of the year. He took over a team that went 4-13 in back-to-back seasons and quickly whipped his players into shape. The Patriots have regained a place among the league’s elite and spent the season battling Denver for the No. 1 seed. Meanwhile, Harbaugh directs a resilient bunch that has overcome injuries at key positions, including their starting offensive tackles. A year after going 11-6 to reach the playoffs in Harbaugh’s first season at the helm, the Chargers again posted an 11-6 record and now seek their first playoff victory under Harbaugh and the franchise’s first since 2018.

This could be a shootout between promising young quarterbacks Justin Herbert and Drake Maye. Herbert is making his third playoff appearance and this season has carried his team while playing through injury and also shrugging off the struggles of a battered offensive line to pass for 3,727 yards (ninth-most), 26 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Meanwhile, Maye has put up MVP-caliber numbers in his second pro season. Maye’s 4,394 yards ranked fourth in the NFL, and his 31 touchdowns ranked third. Furthermore, Maye is adept at using his legs to help extend plays and keep defenses off balance. Maye must deliver his heroics while facing a Chargers defense that ranks among the top five in yards and interceptions, and top 10 in sacks, while holding quarterbacks to a league-low passer rating of 75.0.

Both of these offenses strive for balance despite the talent each boasts at quarterback. The Patriots rank sixth in the league with 128.9 rushing yards per game, while the Chargers rank 12th with 121.6 per contest.

Young guns versus aging legends

Houston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers, 8:15 p.m. ET, Monday, ESPN/ABC

In many ways, Houston and Pittsburgh represent opposite ends of the spectrum. The Texans rank among the young ascending teams in the league and are led by 41-year-old head coach Demeco Ryans and Stroud, the team’s 24-year-old quarterback. The Steelers, meanwhile, rank among the oldest in the league and are led by 53-year-old Mike Tomlin, who is in his 19th season, and the 42-year-old Rodgers.

The Texans have reached the postseason for a third straight season, but aren’t satisfied with just being here. They want to make a deep run and bring a long-suffering fan base its first Lombardi Trophy. The Steelers, on the other hand, have gone 17 years since they won their last Super Bowl, and they have worked hard to extend their window of contention and hope for one more championship run before Father Time turns out the lights on this era.

Rodgers has proved he still has something left in the tank, but Pittsburgh has its limitations on offense, particularly when it comes to explosive play-making threats. Fortunately for the Steelers, wide receiver DK Metcalf makes his return from the two-game suspension for his incident with a heckling fan three weeks ago. The Steelers hope that getting their big target back helps reinvigorate the offense.

Protecting Rodgers against the Texans’ ferocious pass rush represents a tall task, though. Houston has the top-rated defense in the league and ranks among the leaders in sacks, with Danielle Hunter (15) and Will Anderson Jr. (12) leading the way. The Texans have held opponents to just 17.4 points per game.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/09154958/GettyImages-2254969683-scaled-e1767991902956.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-10 16:59:43.438567

Quarterback Drake Maye and punt returner Marcus Jones were both voted to the second team at their respective positions.

Maye, 23, started all 17 of the Patriots’ games this season and in his second year as a pro developed into one of its best quarterbacks. Completing 354 of 492 pass attempts, he led the NFL with a completion rate of 72% Maye also threw for 4,394 yards, 31 touchdowns and 8 interceptions.

He also led the league in several other statistical categories such as passer rating (113.5), yards per attempt (8.9), net yards per attempt (7.8), expected points added per play (0.313) and completion percentage above expectation (10.8). Nonetheless, Maye missed out on first-team All-Pro honors to Los Angeles Rams QB Matthew Stafford, who can now be considered the favorite to win the NFL MVP award as well.

Stafford received 31 first-team votes compared to Maye’s 18.

Jones, 27, is in his fourth year in the NFL and continues to be one of the league’s most electric returners. In 2025, he ran back 21 punts for 363 yards and an average of 17.3 yards per return. He also scored a pair of touchdowns, tying the league lead with a group of players including the Tennessee Titans’ Chimere Dike, the eventual first-team All-Pro selection ahead of him.

In total, nine Patriots received All-Pro votes this season. Besides Maye and Jones, wide receiver Stefon Diggs, tight end Hunter Henry, right guard Mike Onwenu, cornerback Christian Gonzalez, safety Jaylinn Hawkins, kickoff returner Antonio Gibson and special teamer Brenden Schooler. Jones also received votes as a slot cornerback.

Last year, two members of the Patriots were voted All-Pros. Brenden Schooler was named first-team special teamer, with Christian Gonzalez announced as a second-team cornerback.

This hand injury won’t linger for Davis, and the Mavs will be debuting a top-10 rookie draft pick (ideally top-3 for their sake).
It’s a huge bummer any time a player suffers a long injury, especially one as great as Davis.","Anthony Davis was the biggest name on the NBA trade block following the Trae Young trade to the Washington Wizards. Now the Mavs star is out indefinitely with a ligament damage in his left hand suffered in Thursday’s loss to the Utah Jazz. Davis could need surgery, and he’s likely to be sidelined beyond the Feb. 5 trade deadline, essentially taking him off the market.

It’s brutal blow for Davis just as he started playing his best ball of the year, but it’s hardly surprising. Davis is one of the most injury prone superstars of this era, and his lack of availability was always going to factor into his trade value just as much as his massive contract. Davis is owed $58.4 million in Dallas next year, then has a $62.7 million player option for the 2026-27 season. He turns 33 years in March.

This injury shouldn’t have a long-term impact on Davis the same way a lower-body injury would. While Mavs fans are bummed to see him go down before a potential trade out of a town, I actually think this could be a blessing in disguise for Dallas for a few different reasons.

Davis didn’t have much trade value right now anyway

Could the Mavs had landed a first-round pick back for Davis in a trade? That’s the big question, and I’m dubious. Instead, the most likely deal out there was from the Atlanta Hawks, and seemed to be headlined by Kristaps Porzingis and Zaccharie Risacher. This move would have cleared up Dallas’ cap sheet long-term with Porzingis on an expiring deal, but it wouldn’t have moved the needle for its long-term roster building plans all that much in my opinion. Risacher, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024, has been wildly disappointing this season, with a −1.8 EPM that ranks in the 35th percentile of all players. My own 2024 pre-draft board doesn’t look very good right now, but I had Risacher ranked outside the top-10, so it was always shocking to see him go No. 1 overall.

There just didn’t seem to be a good deal out there for the Mavs, so this injury isn’t costing them some huge haul of assets.

The Mavs can ethically tank for the loaded 2026 NBA Draft now

Dallas has to make its 2026 first-round pick count. The Mavs do not control their first-round pick in 2027 (top-2 protected to Charlotte), 2028 (swapped to OKC), 2029 (swapped to Houston), or 2030 (swapped to San Antonio). That was the cost of the Mavs trying to build around Luka Doncic, and now all those picks are handicapping the team’s ability to build around Flagg.

The Mavs had to tank this year, but the NBA lottery gods typically don’t reward blatant tankers. Instead, the ping-pong balls tend to bounce the right way for teams dealing bad luck. Look no further than the 2025 lottery results, when Dallas cashed in long-shot odds for Flagg after the Doncic trade, and the Spurs jumped way up to No. 2 after Victor Wembanyama’s season-ending injury. The Mavs now get to check the bad luck box while losing lots of games to improve their lottery position with Davis out. Dallas’ ownership group (the same people who didn’t block the Luka trade) didn’t seem to want to tank, and now the team doesn’t really have any choice.

For all his issues, Davis is still really good, and taking him off the floor is going to hurt the Mavs’ on-court product quite a bit.

If the Mavs traded Davis, the pieces they would have gotten back would have helped them win games to some extent (Porzingis has been awesome this year when he’s been available, for example). If they kept Davis, he would have probably had them pushing for the play-in tournament. This injury essentially ensures that Dallas’ lottery odds will go up more than they would have in any other scenario. Mavs fans, read my new mock draft here.

Now Dallas gets to see Davis with Kyrie Irving, Cooper Flagg, and their 2026 pick

Kyrie Irving will be back at full strength from his torn ACL next year that has sidelined him all season. Flagg will be in his second season and should take a huge leap. This hand injury won’t linger for Davis, and the Mavs will be debuting a top-10 rookie draft pick (ideally top-3 for their sake).

The Mavs can’t tank next season because Charlotte very likely has their pick. They also can’t tank in the three years after that. Dallas’ best move feels like praying for lottery luck, then seeing what Davis and Kyrie can do next to Flagg and their 2026 rookie while tinkering with the pieces around the margins. This plan requires A.J. Dybantsa, Cameron Boozer, or Darryn Peterson to really hit big, but that’s the case for most team-building plans. Luck is a huge part of NBA success. It took a ridiculous amount of luck for the Mavs to land Flagg, and they will need more to build a decent team around him in the West with so many future picks already out the door before he arrived.

Davis has two years under contract after this season. He’s still really good when he’s at his best. Flagg is absolute stud, and Boozer, Peterson, and Dybantsa have a chance to be every bit as good. Dallas could be pretty interesting next year if the chips fall the right way. It’s a huge bummer any time a player suffers a long injury, especially one as great as Davis. This one might eventually work out in Dallas’ favor, though.",https://platform.sbnation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2254729373.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C34.899851784887&w=1200,N,,2026-01-10 18:00:04.932861

Rams (-10.5) at Panthers: The Panthers played their best game of the season against the Rams back in Week 13, when they ran it 40 times for 164 yards, and Bryce Young was efficient when they threw, completing 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards, 3 TDs, and 0 INTs. They successfully shortened the game, won the turnover battle 3-0, and outlasted the Rams in a major upset that would ultimately have NFC seeding implications.

A lot of things had to go right for the Panthers to win that day, and they did. Credit them for making big plays both on offense and defense.

But ultimately, the Rams are simply the far more talented team, and lightning is unlikely to strike twice.

Packers (-2) at Bears: The Packers and Bears both enter the playoffs on losing streaks. The Bears dropped two straight close games to the 49ers and Lions, while the Packers enter the postseason having lost four straight, to the Broncos, Bears, Ravens, and Vikings.

The Packers have lost four major contributors for the season to injuries:

EDGE Micah Parsons: Torn ACL

TE Tucker Kraft: Torn ACL

C Elgton Jenkins: Broken fibula

iDL Devonte Wyatt: Broken ankle

Parsons is one of the best defensive players in the NFL, Kraft was having an All-Pro type of season, Jenkins is one of their two best offensive linemen, and Wyatt is a good starter. It's hard to lose that kind of firepower and make a playoff run.

The players who are still available got to rest their bodies a bit, as the Packers sat starters Week 18, and Jordan Love will return to the field in the playoffs after missing the last two games.

The Bears haven't made the playoffs since the 2020 season and they haven't won a playoff game since the 2010 season. That means that they're not battle tested, but it also means that Soldier Field is going to be rocking on Saturday if the Bears get a lead.

This matchup feels pretty simple to me. The Packers are too banged up to make any kind of playoff run, and the Bears led the NFL with a turnover differential of +22. Love will make some mistakes in front of a hostile crowd, and the Bears advance.

Bills (-1.5) at Jaguars: We're used to seeing the Bills in the playoffs, and despite their lack of a Super Bowl appearance during the Josh Allen era, they have won at least one playoff game every year in each of the last five seasons. I assume that is why they are favored in this matchup over the Jags, who haven't even been to the playoffs since the 2022 season.

But the Bills are unimpressive to me. They have a high-powered rushing attack, and that's about it. They might have the least threatening passing game weapons of any team in the playoffs, and they struggled to stop the run for the vast majority of the season.

Meanwhile, the Jags have won eight straight, with a point differential of +153 (!) in those games, or average margin of victory of 19.1 points. This team is legit, and arguably the hottest team in the NFL entering the postseason.

49ers at Eagles (-5.5): The 49ers' offense was on fire near the end of the season, as they had a six-game winning streak during which they scored 36.7 points per game. And then they got hammered by the Seahawks Week 18 in a 13-3 game that wasn't as close as the score might indicate.

Their offense was a weird study this week. They score points, but when you drill down on some specific areas of their offense, they don't feel super impressive. For example, Christian McCaffrey was second in the NFL in yards from scrimmage, and yet he averaged just 3.8 yards per carry and had his worst broken tackle stats of his career. Also, they love working the middle of the field, which would have been a good thing in years past against the Eagles, but not anymore with the Eagles' star power at linebacker and in slot corner Cooper DeJean.

On the other side of the ball, the injury-depleted 49ers can't rush the passer, they're coming off one of the worst tackling performances of the entire season (league-wide), their small corners are theoretically bad matchups for the Eagles' receivers, and the Eagles are rested while the 49ers were on the wrong end of a physical beatdown a last Saturday against the Seahawks.

The Eagles' offense has been extremely disappointing this season, but they got an ideal first round matchup. Close game, Eagles win, unsatisfyingly.

Chargers at Patri*ts (-3.5): I like the Chargers' defense quite a bit, but the Patriots have scored at least 26 points in each of their last eight games, and at least 23 points in each of their last 14 games. They scored 30 or more points in eight of their games. They're consistent, and occasionally explosive.

The Chargers have major injury issues on their offensive line, and they can't protect Justin Herbert, so at least his stans will have another excuse when he's one-and-done in the playoffs again.

Texans (-3) at Steelers: In my opinion, the Texans and Eagles have the two best defenses in the playoffs, with the Seahawks a close third.

However, the Steelers' style of play could match up well against Houston. Aaron Rodgers gets the ball out quickly, which should help offset the Texans' awesome pass rush duo of Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter to some degree. And on the back end, Derek Stingley (oblique) and Kamari Lassiter (ankle/knee) are both on the injury report.

I like the Texans to win, but I think it'll be a close game that could go either way. Against the spread, I'll take the Steelers and the 3 points.",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/USATSI_19886062_EKtroOe.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 16:59:50.906838

Kyle Shanahan said Green has a foot injury that happened during practice, which is why he was added to the injury report.

Shanahan also said Pearsall wasn’t able to do anything during Friday’s session, while Williams was limited. Since Pearsall has played all season, Shanahan said there is still a chance he could suit up on Sunday, despite not practicing during the week.

Despite being listed as questionable, Shanahan said his mind has not changed about playing Cowing this weekend: “Jake’s just different. It was his first practice this year, just this week,” citing how Cowing not practicing all year plays a part.

Shanahan said the 49ers could “possibly” make multiple maneuvers with the roster outside of the two elevations from the practice squad, given all of the injuries.

Shanahan said he has not been told whether they will open Fred Warner’s practice window with a win.

Shanahan was asked a hypothetical question: If it were a playoff game, would Ricky and Dee be out? He said, “Last week wasn’t a playoff game, and I didn’t look at it any different. I’d say there’s no different in this week and last week.”

If Winters can’t play, Garret Wallow will make his first start. Shanahan said the 49ers were fortunate to get Wallow off the Broncos’ practice squad: “If he does have the possibility to start, we feel very good about him.

Omarion Hampton Injury Update: Will He Play on Sunday vs. Patriots?

This isn’t the first time Hampton has been hampered by an ankle issue. Back in Week 5’s 27-10 loss to the Washington Commanders, he sustained a sprain that led to him not returning until Week 14.

Over the next four games, the first-round pick averaged 57.8 rushing yards and 14 receiving yards while adding 3 total TDs. Right when he started to look like the player the Chargers took 22nd overall last April, he got banged up again.

Fortunately, it doesn’t appear to be anything too major. Hampton was listed by Los Angeles as questionable for Sunday, but he plans to play. This comes after he missed practice on Wednesday and Thursday before progressing to limited participation on Friday.

Given the importance of the playoffs, Hampton and the Chargers seem to be making the most of the situation in a win-or-go-home scenario.

Chargers’ Offensive Outlook for Wild Card Round vs. Patriots

The primary player who could be affected by Hampton’s expected return is RB Kimani Vidal. He's the Chargers’ leading rusher, pacing the field with 155 carries for 643 yards and 3 TDs. He also hauled in 16 passes for 136 yards and another score.

Los Angeles and their promising rookie face a tall task on Sunday. The Patriots allowed the fifth-fewest rushing yards to RBs (1,311) in the regular season. Additionally, per SumerSports, their -0.05 EPA per play on defense ranks 11th.

Hampton being available might also assist QB Justin Herbert. Among signal-callers with 250+ plays, he trailed only Buffalo Bills superstar Josh Allen in rushing yards with 498 from Weeks 1-17. In Weeks 6-13, without Hampton, he went over 30 rushing yards three separate times.

Two Hampton-specific things that can come to Herbert’s aid are tackle evasion and receiving. Per NFL Pro, despite being contacted on 52.4% of his carries this year, the first-year man forced a missed tackle on 29.8% of tries. Of 64 RBs with 50+ rushes in 2025-26, his 12.32% target share was 10th.

On Steichen, the questions center on why he wasn't able to squeeze more out of the Colts down the stretch.
NFL ownership is a big job, and the Colts' new owner is making some big bets early in her tenure.","INDIANAPOLIS -- Jim Irsay gained a reputation as one of the NFL's most prominent -- and eccentric -- owners during his decades presiding over the Indianapolis Colts.

But after his death last year, his daughters emerged from their dad's substantial shadow and began to develop identities of their own. Oldest daughter Carlie Irsay-Gordon -- the team's principal owner and the public face of the organization -- has only recently come into the national consciousness, largely for her habit of watching and charting games from the sideline while listening to coaches on a headset.

She has come to be known as an open-minded, ever-present owner who believes in learning the granular details of every aspect of the organization, from special teams to scouting.

But, with this week's decision to retain embattled general manager Chris Ballard and coach Shane Steichen after a collapse of historic proportions, Irsay-Gordon's short tenure might come to be defined by something else: Her big gambles.

The Colts finished 2025 with seven straight losses, raising expectations among the team's fan base that structural changes might be coming after a fifth consecutive season of missing the postseason.

Instead, Irsay-Gordon and her sisters, Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson, are doubling down on their current leadership and the men's ability to ""replicate"" the magic the team briefly captured during it's fast start to the season that was derailed by crippling injuries. The Colts finished 8-9 and missed the playoffs, becoming the first team since the 1995 Raiders to miss the postseason after an 8-2 start.

""We experienced a lot of progress, which gives us optimism for the future and the direction we are heading as a team,"" Irsay-Gordon said.

Problem is, the bets the Colts are making could be considered risky given who they're betting on.

They're betting on Ballard, who has a losing record as a general manager despite consistently solid draft results and an ability to build competitive rosters. His failure to find a long-term answer at quarterback alone might have doomed him long ago in some organizations.

They're betting on Steichen, who is a highly respected offensive coach who has gotten a lot out of quarterbacks with limitations but hasn't found a way to get the Colts across the finish line in late-season games when the playoffs were at stake.

And they're betting on quarterback Daniel Jones, the centerpiece of Ballard and Steichen's 2026 plan despite his upcoming free agency in the spring and the ruptured Achilles tendon injury he will be rehabbing for months to come -- perhaps even into next season.

When it comes to Ballard in particular, Irsay-Gordon said she considered the entirety of his nine-year tenure, during which Ballard's teams have made the playoffs twice and won just a single postseason game. But Ballard's willingness to alter his approach to team-building last season serves as the basis for Irsay-Gordon's confidence that he can re-create the team that looked primed for a deep playoff run two months ago.

Ballard, Irsay-Gordon said, ""was able to adapt and change the way as far as how he works on the roster and assembles the roster, and we believe that he is capable of replicating that next season.""

Ballard used free agency much more aggressively last spring and executed a midseason trade for star cornerback Sauce Gardner that represents the boldest trade of his career as a GM. Irsay-Gordon seemed to support the approach and suggested she'd like it to continue. But that means green-lighting some high-stakes moves for an executive with a very mixed track record.

On Steichen, the questions center on why he wasn't able to squeeze more out of the Colts down the stretch. Granted, their top two quarterbacks were unavailable -- Jones and Anthony Richardson Sr. both finished the season on injured reserve. The Colts were also missing top cornerbacks Gardner and Charvarius Ward, as well as defensive tackle DeForest Buckner.

Even Irsay-Gordon acknowledged the shortcomings.

""Adversity struck,"" she said, ""but no matter what the circumstances are, we have to be able to find a way to win and finish games.""

Even so, Irsay-Gordon seems to be willing to bank on Steichen's ability to overcome this flaw next season.

And then there is endorsement of the plan to proceed with efforts to re-sign Jones and prepare for next season with an intention of him being the starting quarterback. Achilles injuries require lengthy rehabilitation, and players still can experience initial limitations in their mobility even after returning.

Jones also has a long injury history that must be taken into account if the Colts entertain a multiyear contract. There is some belief within the organization that Jones could be a long-term solution at quarterback for a team that has had different opening-day starters in eight of the past nine seasons.

""[Jones] knew he had something to prove and I think he did a great job,"" Irsay-Gordon said. She added, ""we've had a drought [at quarterback] and we were able to really show that we're able to execute at a high level on the field. ... It was promising what he was able to do.""

Is the quarterback plan flawed? Irsay-Gordon declined to comment on Jones' injury.

That's a good thing",Christian Clark,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6959049/2026/01/10/anthony-davis-injury-mavericks-draft-pick/,"For the third time in his 11-month tenure with the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony Davis is going to miss an extended stretch of games.

Davis’ injury makes it clear which direction the Mavericks need to go.","For the third time in his 11-month tenure with the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony Davis is going to miss an extended stretch of games.

Davis’ latest injury occurred late in the fourth quarter Thursday against the Utah Jazz when he suffered ligament damage in his left hand trying to defend Lauri Markkanen’s drive to the basket. He will see a hand specialist to determine if he needs surgery, yet he’s expected to be sidelined for several weeks even if that procedure is not necessary, a league source told The Athletic.

Where does this leave the Mavericks and Davis, whom Dallas was trying to trade before he went down again? The consensus among NBA personnel The Athletic contacted Friday was that Dallas won’t be able to trade Davis before Feb. 5. Davis’ trade value was already low because of his contract (he is owed $58.5 million next season and holds a $62.8 million player option in 2027-28) and his durability concerns. This hand injury only lowers his trade value.

If there’s any silver lining for Mavericks fans, it’s that their team should not be good for the rest of this season. The Mavericks have gone 10-10 with Davis in the lineup this campaign and 4-14 without him. That the Mavericks have played at an 18-win pace without Davis this season is a good thing.

Why? After this year, the Mavericks don’t have outright control of their own first-round pick again until 2031. That means it’s absolutely critical they are able to draft a franchise building block this June.

Last spring, the Mavericks were gifted the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card for the disastrous Luka Dončić trade when they won the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes. Flagg, who turned 19 last month, has been one of the best teenagers to ever put on an NBA uniform. He scored 42 points when Dallas visited Utah in December and narrowly missed becoming the youngest player ever to record a triple-double in Thursday’s rematch between the teams in Salt Lake City.

As good as Flagg already is, the Mavericks will need to put more elite young talent around him to have a chance to be competitive with their I-35 neighbors to the north (Oklahoma City Thunder) and the south (San Antonio Spurs).

The Thunder used 22- and 24-win seasons to put championship talent around their face of the franchise, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. They drafted Josh Giddey at No. 6 in 2022 and later flipped him in a trade for defensive ace Alex Caruso. Then, in 2023, Oklahoma City chose Chet Holmgren with the No. 2 selection. Holmgren doubles as one of the NBA’s best rim protectors and a hyper-efficient complementary offensive player.

Meanwhile, the Spurs, who are second in the West behind the Thunder, have picked in the top four in each of the last three drafts. They chose Victor Wembanyama No. 1 in 2023, Stephon Castle No. 4 in 2024 and Dylan Harper No. 2 in last year’s draft.

The Mavericks need to find a running mate for Flagg in this year’s draft. As unfortunate as Davis’ latest injury was, the reality is his absence helps Dallas’ chances of having a high lottery pick and possibly leaping into the top four again, where it could find its own version of Holmgren or Castle.

As of Friday evening, the Mavericks (14-24) had a 26.3 percent chance of winding up with a top-four selection. No matter how poorly they play the rest of the way, it will be difficult for them to finish with a worse record than teams like the Indiana Pacers (7-31), Washington Wizards (10-27), Brooklyn Nets (11-24), New Orleans Pelicans (9-31) or Sacramento Kings (8-30).

Without Davis, though, it’s in play for the Mavericks to have a worse record than the Jazz (13-24, and in need of a poor finish because they must surrender their pick to the Thunder unless it falls in the top eight) or the Los Angeles Clippers (14-23, and who owe their pick to the Thunder no matter what happens).

Davis’ injury makes it clear which direction the Mavericks need to go. The best teams in their conference were built with multiple high-level lottery picks.

The Mavericks can resume trade talks for Davis this summer. For the next four months, the best thing they can do is be bad, which won’t be difficult without their $54 million player in the lineup.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/10003235/GettyImages-2255008401-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-10 14:59:52.126528

The Steelers WR owns a three-inch height advantage over Stingley, but that alone doesn't guarantee he'll find success.
The Texans' story in 2024 centered on their beleaguered offensive line, an obvious weakness Houston attempted to address in 2025 but never quite figured out entirely.

On paper, Houston owns a slight offensive advantage, but observers of both teams will admit neither boasts an explosive attack.","For all of their offensive struggles, the Houston Texans remain an imposing force in the AFC because of a relentless defense that strikes fear in the hearts of the opposition. Their SWARM defense -- an acronym created by head coach DeMeco Ryans that stands for special work ethic and relentless mindset -- has lived up to the mantra in 2025, posting the lowest average yards allowed per game (277.2) in the NFL and narrowly missing out on finishing as the league's best scoring defense at 17.4 points per game allowed. The unit has carried Houston back to the postseason, where the Texans hope to advance beyond the Divisional Round for the first time in franchise history after falling to Baltimore and Kansas City in each of the last two seasons. In order to get there, they must first clear Pittsburgh on the prime-time stage.

At long last, Pittsburgh seemed to be hitting its stride offensively in Week 14 and finally opened up the air attack by relying on its big-bodied go route master Metcalf in a 27-22 win over Baltimore. Two weeks later, Metcalf got into an altercation with a fan in Detroit and was suspended for the final two games, robbing Rodgers of his best target. Since then, the Steelers have trudged through a six-point output in an upset loss to the Browns -- which included a goal-to-go scenario in which they certainly could have used Metcalf for a back-corner fade -- and edged past the Ravens in Week 18 in a game in which running back Kenneth Gainwell finished as Pittsburgh's leading receiver. Simply, the Steelers need Metcalf and will be ecstatic to welcome him back at the perfect time when they face the NFL's top defense that includes an elite corner in Derek Stingley Jr.. The Steelers WR owns a three-inch height advantage over Stingley, but that alone doesn't guarantee he'll find success. His presence, however, increases the Steelers' chances of finding some; Houston cannot simply load the box to stop running back Jaylen Warren (or Gainwell) with Metcalf also on the field.

The Texans' story in 2024 centered on their beleaguered offensive line, an obvious weakness Houston attempted to address in 2025 but never quite figured out entirely. The unit is better than it was last season -- C.J. Stroud has taken only 23 sacks after going down 52 times in 2024 -- and Stroud isn't making as many pressure-related mistakes as he did a year ago; however, they're still far from a rock-solid unit when it comes to pass protection. The running game isn't a well-oiled operation, either: Houston ranks 22nd in rushing yards per game and the team's leading rusher, rookie Woody Marks, is averaging just 3.6 yards per carry. If there's an area in which the Steelers can capitalize, it's with their front seven, a group that includes a rather deep pass-rushing corps headlined by T.J. Watt (who returned from a lung injury in Week 18) and should be able to find success on third-and-long. If the Texans need points late, it's going to be an uphill battle. They'll have to focus on getting the ball out quickly and control time of possession, or hope their defense can help them win the field position battle and take some of the load off their offense in order to have the best chance to win.

On paper, Houston owns a slight offensive advantage, but observers of both teams will admit neither boasts an explosive attack. Houston has the edge defensively, meaning we could be in for a low-scoring affair in Pittsburgh -- which also means the outcome might rely heavily on the right feet of Pittsburgh's Chris Boswell and Houston's Ka'imi Fairbairn. In a typical year, that wouldn't be an issue for Steelers fans; Boswell has been ultra reliable over the course of his 11 seasons in Pittsburgh. But Boswell posted his lowest field goal conversion percentage (84.4) since 2022 this season, and although it didn't end up hurting them, Steelers fans might still have visions of Boswell's missed extra point that opened the door for the Ravens to nearly win in Week 18's de facto AFC North title game. Fairbairn, meanwhile, has been absolute nails in 2025, proving to be one of the most reliable point producers on the Texans roster by routinely drilling kicks attempted at or near the edge of his range. Inside of 50 yards, he's a perfect 35 for 35 this season and has posted a 91.7 conversion rate overall (his four misses came from 50-plus yards, but he's converted 9 of 13 such attempts). It's not the most seductive note in a playoff game, but we all know these games can often rest on the foot of a kicker -- and we're in for a battle of stalwarts on Monday night.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/c6erc8drag6xvxjdiqaz,N,,2026-01-10 12:14:04.316934

Packers player to watch

QB Jordan Love: He hasn't played in a game since a helmet-to-helmet hit from Chicago's Austin Booker in the second quarter of the Dec. 20 Packers-Bears game sent him into concussion protocol. Love was cleared before Green Bay's regular-season finale, but the Packers opted to rest him for the playoffs. Love has nine touchdown passes and only two interceptions in six games against the Bears.

Bears player to watch

QB Caleb Williams. The Bears envisioned deep playoff runs on a regular basis when they drafted Williams with the No. 1 overall pick last year. They hope this is just the start. Williams threw for a franchise-record 3,942 yards with 27 touchdowns and just seven interceptions. Though his completion percentage ranked last among qualifying leaders, he became more and more comfortable in coach Ben Johnson's system.

Key matchup

Chicago's running backs against Green Bay's defensive line. Though the Bears' run game emerged as one of the best this season behind a retooled line, it was hard to tell against Detroit. Chicago managed just 65 yards rushing, with D'Andre Swift held to 40 yards on 10 attempts and rookie Kyle Monangai finishing with 14 yards on six carries. With Swift running for 1,087 yards and Monangai adding 783, the Bears were the only team with two 750-yard rushers. Green Bay struggled to stop the run in recent weeks, with Devonte Wyatt (ankle) and then Micah Parsons (knee) suffering season-ending injuries. The Packers gave up 150 yards rushing to the Bears in their most recent meeting and then allowed Derrick Henry to run for 216 yards and four touchdowns in a 41-24 loss to Baltimore.

Series notes

The Packers are 30-7 against the Bears counting the playoffs since the start of the 2008 season, with the past four games coming down to the wire. In 2024, both came down to field-goal attempts by Chicago's Cairo Santos on the final play - one that got blocked and one that was successful. This season, Green Bay hung on to win 28-21 in Week 14 at Lambeau Field when Keisean Nixon intercepted Williams in the end zone with 22 seconds remaining. Chicago returned the favor two weeks later, rallying from 10 down in the final two minutes of regulation before Williams threw a 46-yard touchdown to DJ Moore in overtime. This is the third playoff game between the longtime rivals - all in Chicago. The Bears won a Western Division playoff game over the Packers 33-14 at Wrigley Field on Dec. 14, 1941. The Packers beat the Bears 21-14 in an NFC championship game at Soldier Field on Jan. 23, 2011.

While the Bears and Packers have the longest rivalry in the NFL, dating back to 1921, with the Packers holding a 109-97-6 edge, this is only the third time the Bears and Packers have played each other in the playoffs.

The last time they met in the postseason, the Packers beat the Bears 21-14 in the NFC Championship in 2011, going on to win Super Bowl XLV. In 1941, the Bears beat the Packers 33-14 in the Western Division championship, before going on to win the NFL Championship game against the Giants.

Rome Odunze and Kyler Gordon expected to return from injuries

Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze, who has missed the past five games with a foot injury, has no injury designation for Saturday night, and is expected to play, although he said he might have some plaing time limitations.

""For me, I'm looking to be out there as much as possible, and make as many plays as I can. At the end of the day, it's all or nothing for this game, and until the Super Bowl, until the end of the season. So I want to contribute as much as possible, and put everything that I have out there on that field,"" he said on Wednesday.

Bears nickel cornerback Kyler Gordon is listed as questionable for the game after missing the past five games with a groin injury. Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen has said he expects Gordon to be part of the game plan.

""It gives us another playmaker. Obviously, it's been unfortunate we haven't had him much this season,, but he was a guy coming into the season that we were really excited about, and I feel like he can help us make some plays and help us win,"" Allen said.

Jordan Love to be back under center for Packers

Quarterback Jordan Love, who was knocked out of the Week 16 game against the Bears with a concussion, will get the start on Saturday.

Wicks was a limited participant throughout the week, but head coach Matt LaFleur stated in press conferences that Wicks had not yet fully passed through the protocol.

Beyond Wicks, the Packers have five questionable players on their injury report this week, after making nearly 30 transactions (or over 30, depending on how you count them) over the last two weeks to make up for their injury situation. Those questionable players are quarterback Malik Willis (shoulder/hamstring), right tackle Zach Tom (back/knee), defensive lineman Warren Brinson (foot), linebacker Nick Niemann and safety Javon Bullard (knee).

LaFleur has previously stated that Willis will be available this week, along with confirming that Bullard is “okay” after his injury. Tom was also a player that LaFleur said the expectation was that he would play, but he missed Thursday’s practice with a rest day, a sign that the tackle potentially had a setback.

Niemann was called up from the injured reserve this week. If he can’t go, expect practice squad linebacker Jamon Johnson to take his place on special teams. Brinson is a bit of an unknown, as he was able to finish the game against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 18. It was a surprise that he was listed as questionable during yesterday’s final injury report of the week.

Without Wicks, the Packers will have Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, Matthew Golden and Jakobie Keeney-James available at the receiver position against the Bears. Five is a low number to carry on gameday at the position, at least for Green Bay, but with the potential of Johnson and a tight end (Packers only have two on the 53-man roster) coming up from the practice squad to play on Saturday, the potential to add a sixth receiver as the roster stands now is limited.

The Green Bay Packers will go on the road to take on the Chicago Bears in the NFL Playoffs for just the third time in the century-old rivalry. The team that wins this weekend will continue their season for at least one more week, while the loser’s season will end.

The Packers are 1-1 against the division champion Bears this season, winning the first matchup at Lambeau Field and losing the second at Soldier Field.

Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love was knocked out of the second game against Chicago with a concussion after a helmet-to-helmet hit. Saturday will mark his first in-game action since.

Love told reporters this week that he isn’t worried about being rusty after missing two games, and he’s “excited” for the matchup. He said big games like this one are “what you want as a player.”

“It’s win or go home. Everybody knows what’s at stake,” he said. “The intensity will be there. The emotions will be there. It’s a rivalry game and a playoff game.”

Love has led Green Bay to the playoffs in each of his first three seasons as the team’s starting signal-caller. But this year’s Packers team is coming into the matchup with more than a dozen players on injured reserve, including star pass rusher Micah Parsons.

The Packers traded two first-round draft picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark for Parsons at the start of the season. Parsons tore his ACL in mid-December, after becoming the first player in NFL history to record at least 12 sacks in each of his first five seasons on Thanksgiving Day.

Green Bay rested most of its starters last week in a 16-3 loss to the Minnesota Vikings to end the regular season on a four-game losing streak.

Running back Josh Jacobs, who has dealt with a lingering knee injury for much of the latter part of the season, did not play in Minnesota. He told reporters this week he feels “pretty good” after the week off.

“I’m not gonna say I like not playing, but obviously these moments and these types of games (are) where it really matters the most,” he said of Saturday’s contest. “It’s going to be fun, and I like that I’m going to be able to hit the ground running.”

Green Bay faces a resurgent Chicago team led by first-year head coach Ben Johnson and quarterback Caleb Williams, a former first overall draft pick. Under Johnson, the Bears ranked 6th in total offense this season.

Packers head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters this week that Williams is a “dynamic” player who’s difficult to defend.

“He is dynamic back there (with) his ability to make people miss, get out of the pocket (and) make throws from in the pocket,” LaFleur said. “I think he’s playing really, really good football right now.”

Chicago won the NFC North division title with a record of 11-6. Green Bay secured a wild card playoff spot with its record of 9-7-1. The Packers haven’t won the NFC North since 2021.

Green Bay last faced the Bears in the playoffs in 2011. The Packers won that matchup 21-14 en route to winning Super Bowl 45. Before that, the Bears won the lone playoff matchup between the rivals in 1941, one week after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

At a press conference this week, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley acknowledged the added weight of facing the Bears in the postseason.

“This is one of the biggest rivalries in all of football, one that I have watched for a very long time,” he said. “(It) did not end the way we wanted the last time we played there. I am going to do everything in my power to focus on every minute that I have to give this organization and our players everything I got to go win this game.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25342014215132-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:14:12.425102

When the NFL decided not to place the Houston Texans in the Saturday 4:30 p.m. ET window to open wild-card weekend, a spot famously named “Shakey’s Game” by Bill Simmons and Cousin Sal, the league proved that nothing is truly sacred. The Texans have made the playoffs eight times in their young history, and all eight times, they played in that window.

This year, Houston will play on Monday night instead, against Pittsburgh, to cap off a weekend-long football extravaganza (which also includes the College Football Playoff semifinals!).

Three of the six games on wild-card weekend feature a quarterback making his playoff debut. Traditionally, debutants have not performed well against the spread. It has been one of the most widely cited trends in recent years; playoff-rookie quarterbacks are 20-39-1 (34 percent) against the spread and 20-40 straight up since 2002, per Action Network. This week, the trend will be tested by Bryce Young, Caleb Williams, and Drake Maye, who all play at home.

Here are my thoughts on all six games, including best bets. All lines are from FanDuel as of Thursday morning.

Los Angeles Rams at Carolina Panthers (+10.5)

The regular-season meeting between these two teams was decidedly weird because Matthew Stafford threw multiple first-half interceptions (including a pick-six). The Rams were stuck playing from behind, and Carolina leaned heavily on the run game, with 35 combined attempts for Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard. That type of game is pretty unlikely to repeat.

Panthers defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, formerly of the Rams, will have a considerably healthier roster for this game than he did for the first meeting. Star corner Jaycee Horn, safety Tre’von Moehrig, and linebacker Christian Rozeboom didn’t play last time. The Panthers probably won’t turn Stafford over three times again, but they should improve on their 7.6 yards per play allowed from that game.

My main concern for Carolina in this matchup exists on the other side of the ball. How will the team consistently score? For a month now, this offense has been pretty anemic.

The Panthers established an early-season formula that really worked for them by running the ball at one of the highest rates in the league. In the first nine weeks, Carolina had the sixth-most efficient run offense by EPA per rush.

Since Week 10, that plan has failed to continue producing dividends. The Panthers are still running the ball at one of the highest rates in the league (when compared to expected pass rates), but the offense has not maintained those impressive early-season efficiency levels. Their run game has dipped to 23rd in EPA per rush. You can definitely throw the ball on the Rams’ secondary, but how much faith do we have in Bryce Young to do that if he’s playing from behind and forced into clear passing situations?

One of my favorite ways to evaluate quarterback performance is to look at how efficient a passer is in obvious passing downs. Of 45 quarterbacks with at least 100 attempts, Young finished 33rd in success rate on third or fourth down with 5-plus yards to go. For comparison, Stafford finished 13th in the same metric.

Home underdogs of seven-plus points have fared very well in the last 15 years of NFL wild-card history. Remember the Beast Quake? Tebowing? Taylor Heinicke going toe-to-toe with Tom Brady? This has all the makings of a potential Backdoor Bryce cover with a late score, just like Carolina’s Week 18 loss to the Buccaneers.

Verdict: Bet under 46.5 (–110)

Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (+1.5)

If the season’s first two games between these two are any indication, football fans are in for more late-game drama in this battle for NFC North supremacy. The market ratings on these two teams have changed considerably since the Packers were a 6.5-point home favorite on December 7. Green Bay pulled off a red zone stand in the final minute, won by seven, and claimed first place at 9-3-1. It was the last regular-season game they’d win. The injuries and losses piled up from there, and now the defense is borderline unrecognizable compared to the group that was as reliable and balanced as any in the league for the first three months.

The Micah Parsons injury, especially, swung the market against the Packers, who ended up an underdog in the second meeting between these two teams, on December 20. Fast-forward three weeks, and we have the same teams in the same building, and it’s priced as an effective toss-up. The market took note of the Bears’ horrid defensive showing against the 49ers in Week 17, as well as how Chicago followed that up at home with a dud against the already-eliminated Lions in Week 18.

The biggest challenge in assessing this game is trying to figure out what the Packers defense is at this point. Even before Parsons went down, the Packers were not exactly posting excellent defensive metrics week to week.

Defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley has dialed up the blitz rate in recent weeks to try to generate more pressure without Parsons, but it’s left the back end of the defense more vulnerable to the big plays they were so elite at preventing for the majority of the season.

Chicago’s revamped offensive line is graded among the league’s best this season, and as a result, Caleb Williams should have plenty of time to create the big plays out of structure that have defined his sophomore season.

With neither of these defenses generating much pressure on the opposing quarterback, this ought to be a higher-scoring game than the last meeting at Soldier Field. Add in the potential for some light snow to coat the field at the benefit of the offenses, and there should be more points scored than the market currently indicates.

When in doubt and dealing with two relatively even teams, I will take my chances with the superior passing offense. In this game, that is the Packers, who rank second in EPA per dropback.

Verdict: Bet Packers ML (–112)

Buffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars (+1.5)

On paper, this is the most evenly balanced and highest-projected-scoring game of the first round of the playoffs. With Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow, and Patrick Mahomes out of the playoffs, Josh Allen may never get a better chance to reach the Super Bowl. To do that, he’ll have to overcome one of the worst overall rosters he’s had throughout his time in Buffalo. The Bills have had issues stopping the run at the second and third levels all year long. Their defense gives up explosive plays constantly. The offense lacks players who can separate at an elite level, and this was on full display when they played high-quality secondaries like the Texans’ and Eagles’ and could barely move the ball and score.

It’s hard to imagine this team actually lifting the Lombardi Trophy in February unless Allen goes on a generational run. This matchup is favorable on paper for the Jaguars for a few reasons.

Jacksonville’s run defense has been quietly elite this year. The Jaguars rank seventh in rush success rate allowed and third in EPA per rush. Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady has a tendency to fall a little bit too in love with the run game, and the result is an offense that isn’t actually as efficient as one with Josh Allen at quarterback should be. Allen has done plenty to bail them out on the money downs (he has elite numbers in obvious passing situations), but it’s still a difficult tightrope to walk.

The Jaguars are better on script than the Bills. The Jaguars are tied for fourth in the NFL in first-half points per game, while Buffalo is 10th. The Jaguars like to begin games by throwing the ball, whereas Buffalo looks to establish James Cook and the running game. Only the Jets and Ravens ran the ball more often in the first half this season than Buffalo. The Jaguars, meanwhile, actually passed the ball in the first half at the fifth-highest rate. If Brady tries to match the Jaguars offensively by running into the teeth of Jacksonville’s defense, that may not go well for Buffalo. There’s no reason Brady shouldn’t unleash his superhuman quarterback early, but will he?

For all the talk of the Patriots’ easy schedule, Buffalo’s schedule doesn’t get enough press. Like the rest of the AFC East teams, the Bills benefited plenty from a favorable schedule of opponents. They did have a few tricky matchups against the Texans, Eagles, and Chiefs as a “reward” for finishing first in the division last year, but overall, they faced the second-easiest schedule in the NFL by DVOA this season.

Verdict: Lean Jaguars +1.5

San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (–4.5)

Even though the Niners offense was in supernova form for most of the final seven weeks, the 13-3 loss to Seattle at home last Saturday exposed some real cracks ahead of a road playoff game against one of the league’s best defenses.

Since Brock Purdy returned from injury in Week 11, he ranks second in the NFL in quarterback efficiency. Four of those last seven games came against bad defensive opponents (the Cardinals, Colts, Titans, and Bears), and the 49ers averaged 42 points per game in those four. However, when San Francisco stepped up in class and played much tougher defenses (Cleveland and Seattle), its performance dropped off considerably. In two games against the Browns and Seahawks, the Niners managed only 252 and 173 yards, respectively.

The market opened the Eagles as a three-point favorite on Sunday once the matchup was confirmed, and it’s been mostly one-way action toward the Eagles since then. These two teams are also trending in opposite directions injury-wise, as the Eagles are expected to have star right tackle Lane Johnson back, while the 49ers are even more injured now than they were a couple of weeks ago. Trent Williams and Ricky Pearsall are both questionable to play, and the linebacker situation is dangerously thin following the season-ending injury to Tatum Bethune.

Williams is one of the most impactful players in the entire sport, but in this matchup, Pearsall is just as important. The Eagles are elite at defending tight ends and grade out well against top receivers thanks to their linebackers, as well as Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell in coverage. The Eagles’ biggest defensive weakness is against no. 2 wide receivers (where Pearsall would slot in); they allow the second-most yards per game against that position. This is not a favorable matchup at all for George Kittle, who was injured prior to the Week 18 loss in which he put up a measly 29 yards. Now, Kittle faces the defense that allows the second-fewest yards per game (28.6) to tight ends.

Offensively, the Eagles have one of the most fascinating profiles in the league. We’ve all watched them enough to know that their offense is not aesthetically pleasing, but under the hood, it’s also very unusual. The Eagles have the most efficient red zone offense in the NFL, but they also feature the fifth-highest three-and-out rate in the league. You would naturally expect these two numbers to balance each other out across an entire season, but they really haven’t. Which number do you believe is more signal and less noise? I would personally say that the red zone number is noisier and not something I would bet on to continue, especially since Philly was actually worse in the red zone last season despite a more effective tush push and a better overall offense.

The 49ers are super vulnerable over the middle of the field right now due to all of their linebacker injuries, but are the Eagles the team to actually exploit that? Philadelphia seldom throws over the middle in this Kevin Patullo offense. On paper, this is a very favorable matchup for Dallas Goedert, but the Eagles haven’t committed to regularly featuring him week to week.

The Niners should play a ton of zone coverage and force the Eagles to be methodical. With the Eagles offense typically showing up for only one half a game, and with the concerns about the Niners’ offensive matchup here, this could be a low-scoring battle controlled by the Philly defense.

Verdict: Bet under 44.5 (–110) and George Kittle under 59.5 yards (–110)

Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots (–3.5)

At this point, I’m sure that Patriots fans are tired of hearing about how easy their schedule was. I get it. You can only play the teams you’re matched up against, and the Patriots did everything they were supposed to do and more against that weak schedule. At the same time, it’s difficult to make a proper judgment of them relative to their AFC playoff peers. They played only two games against teams with winning records all season long—their two matchups against Buffalo. Drake Maye could quite possibly win MVP, but he went up against the easiest schedule of opposing defenses by DVOA.

The key battle in this game will be Maye’s surgical ability to push the ball down the field—the Patriots lead the league in offensive explosive play rate—versus a defense that has allowed the second-fewest plays of 20-plus yards in the entire NFL. Curiously, Chargers coordinator Jesse Minter’s defense has seriously struggled when facing teams that can efficiently run the ball. When they were on the road against Jacksonville, or even facing a team like the pre-collapse Colts, we saw the limitations of their defense against those types of teams.

But New England hasn’t really had a consistent running game at any point this year. It has hit some big plays but is mediocre on a down-to-down basis. The Patriots will unleash Maye as a passer, and they’ll score points, but Justin Herbert should be able to match him against a considerably vulnerable secondary.

The Chargers’ offensive line is their biggest liability due to the injuries, but it’s not like the Patriots have an elite pass rush to exploit this. New England finished the regular season right around league average in pressure rate (12th overall, 15th in the second half of the season).

Verdict: Bet Chargers +3.5 (–110) and over 46 points (–110)

Houston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers (+3)

The market opened with the Texans as a 2.5-point favorite on Sunday after Tyler Loop’s field goal sailed wide right. It jumped straight to three overnight, and the Texans peaked as a 3.5-point favorite before it settled into its current position.

The Steelers’ recent playoff performances have been shambolic, but there is a huge gap between the 2022 Chiefs, 2023 Bills, and 2024 Ravens and this version of the Houston Texans. The Steelers usually limp into the playoffs and draw a vastly superior foe with an elite quarterback and an excellent offense that can expose the limitations of the Steelers’ defensive scheme. That’s not the case with Houston’s inconsistent offense that still has issues keeping C.J. Stroud clean in the pocket. Pittsburgh has struggled against quality run games, too. Houston doesn’t have that at all. Even though Woody Marks has given them some more juice out of the backfield at times this season, the Texans finished the year 30th in rushing success rate.

Pittsburgh’s offense allows the lowest pressure rate in the NFL because Aaron Rodgers is getting rid of the ball so fast that the opposing pass rush can’t really get there in time. As a result, Rodgers also has the lowest average depth of target in the NFL. The Texans are the best pass defense overall, and that’s also true for passes within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage. Houston plays so aggressively downhill that the door is cracked open for Rodgers to leverage that against them and create an explosive play or two. Otherwise, it’s really hard to see Pittsburgh sustaining long and methodical drives in this game, but maybe it can hit enough big plays with the return of DK Metcalf to keep this game competitive. Personally, I think it will.

Verdict: Bet Steelers +3 (–110)

Even before Davis hurt his left hand, there were concerns throughout the league about his long history of durability issues.","The Dallas Mavericks are likely to be without Anthony Davis for several weeks, at a minimum, after he suffered ligament damage in his left hand in Thursday’s game against the Utah Jazz, a league source told The Athletic.

In a statement, the team announced that Davis is “currently seeking multiple opinions” after medical imaging revealed the diagnosis. Davis is expected to meet with a hand specialist, the league source told The Athletic. It’s unclear if Davis will need surgery but he is expected to miss extended time even if he decides a non-surgical route to recovery is best.

Davis, 32, was injured Thursday while trying to prevent Utah Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen from driving to the basket. Davis’ left hand got scrunched up against Markkanen’s body. As Davis exited the floor, he doubled over in pain.

Before Davis’ latest injury, the Mavericks were actively exploring the trade market for him. The Athletic reported earlier this week that the Atlanta Hawks and the Toronto Raptors were two of the teams that had registered interest in him. Davis’ left hand injury reduces the odds the Mavericks are able to move him before Feb. 5, which could force Dallas to resume its efforts to trade him this summer.

Davis, whom the Mavericks acquired in the Luka Dončić trade last February, has played in 31 games in Dallas while missing 42 games. He missed close to six weeks last season with a left adductor strain, then was out for most of November of this season while he recovered from a left calf strain. He is owed $58.5 million next season and holds a $62.8 million player option in 2027-28.

Even before Davis hurt his left hand, there were concerns throughout the league about his long history of durability issues. He has played in at least 70 games just once in the previous eight seasons.

The Mavericks, who were forced to play the final 2:08 of Thursday’s game without Davis, lost 116-114, falling to 14-24 this season. They are in 11th place in the Western Conference as the midpoint of the regular season approaches.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.
MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.
That's Martenzie Johnson from ESPN and Andscape, talking about the NFL playoffs that kick off tomorrow.","A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

NFL playoffs kick off tomorrow, with really no team looking like a lock to make their way to Santa Clara, California's Super Bowl 60. Let's get into it with Martenzie Johnson of ESPN and Andscape. So, Martenzie, I mean, what are you looking at in this playoffs, which, to me, looks wide open for the first time in a while?

MARTENZIE JOHNSON: Yeah. Honestly, A, if you're a fan of parity in the NFL, this is the NFL playoffs for you because, as you said, it's wide open this year. And it's because of one reason, A, and one reason only - the Kansas City Chiefs did not make the playoffs.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. They're the big - they've been, like, this big wall that every team has had to go through to try and, you know, win a Super Bowl and they've always seemed to, like, shut everyone down. So, like, it's weird. The team that's not in the playoffs is the team that everyone's kind of looking at.

JOHNSON: Yeah, exactly. But if you want to talk about the teams that are in the playoffs, there's two I'm looking at, specifically. Neither of which is the No.1 seed - Denver Broncos or the Seattle Seahawks. It's actually the Philadelphia Eagles, who are the defending champions. We're talking about the Chiefs, but the Eagles did win the Super Bowl last year. And on the other side, the Buffalo Bills, who, I believe, are the 6 seed.

And they've always run into that buzzsaw of either the Kansas City Chiefs or the Baltimore Ravens. But lucky enough for Josh Allen...

MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).

JOHNSON: ...He doesn't have to worry about either of those teams this year. So this is why I think this is finally the year for the Bills. Unfortunately, for the Bills, Josh Allen has a leg injury that prevented him from playing in the last week of the season.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.

JOHNSON: But beyond that, I still like the Bills.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And you know what? That leads right into the next thing I was going to ask you, Martenzie, because the two quarterbacks that have the most to prove are probably Josh Allen of the Bills and also Jalen Hurts of the Eagles because, like, to get into that elite tier of, like, Mahomes and Brady, Jalen Hurts has to win multiple Super Bowls. He's got one in the books. He needs another.

JOHNSON: Yeah. And Jalen, if you've watched the Eagles, then you know he hasn't looked great.

MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).

JOHNSON: In fact, he's had two games...

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.

JOHNSON: ...This season, A, where he didn't complete a pass in the second half. That's unheard of for the NFL where passing is a premium. That's all they want to do.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.

JOHNSON: But the Eagles have one of the best defenses in the league and they still have Saquon Barkley. They still have A.J. Brown. They still have DeVonta Smith. So he might have not looked good in the regular season, but I've seen Jalen Hurts in two Super Bowls playing against those same Chiefs that we're talking about and he has looked excellent. So he might not good - might not look good in the regular season, but I trust that man when it comes to the playoffs.

MARTÍNEZ: All right. So the Eagles and Bills are your two teams getting to the Super Bowl. Like, if you had to pick, like, a dark horse team, none of those two teams, some - another team that might make a run, what team would it be? Please say Chargers. Please say Chargers. Please say Chargers. Please say Chargers (laughter).

JOHNSON: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, A.

MARTÍNEZ: You know how many times I've heard I'm sorry from people I've asked that question?

(CROSSTALK)

JOHNSON: And that's one of the reasons why. They don't have a offensive line. But I'm going to say the Houston Texans...

MARTÍNEZ: Oh, wow.

JOHNSON: ...Which might be a surprise to some, because if you watched the early part of the season, you saw that they started off two and four. They lost their quarterback, C.J. Stroud, for a couple games due to a concussion. But, A, out of nowhere, they won 10 of their last 11 games...

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.

JOHNSON: ...Nine of their last games. They have one of the best defenses in the league. And their quarterback, which you want in a quarterback, A, he does not turn the ball over, in C.J. Stroud. And Nico Collins, a wide receiver, he's not a household name but he's one of the best in the NFL.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And if the Texans do win that game that's against the Steelers, that could be Aaron Rodgers' last game in the NFL. I mean, he's always kind of talking about it being the last game and that might be the last one, if indeed, he loses that one. We'll see, though. That one's going to be a good one. All right. That's Martenzie Johnson from ESPN and Andscape, talking about the NFL playoffs that kick off tomorrow. Martenzie, thanks a lot.

JOHNSON: Thank you, A.

Star right tackle Lane Johnson is expected to return after missing seven games with a foot sprain.

In contrast, the San Francisco 49ers are dealing with significant injuries to several key players.

PHILADELPHIA − An entire regular season was building for this point as the Eagles begin their playoff run with an NFC Wild Card Playoff Game against the 49ers on Jan. 11.

That's because unlike their counterparts, the Eagles are rested and almost healthy.

Star right tackle Lane Johnson is listed as questionable to play on the Eagles' final injury report of the week after missing seven games with a foot sprain. He was listed as a limited participant in practice all three days this week.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

""Obviously, Lane's a phenomenal football player,"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. ""So anytime he's on the field, you are pumped about that. He's continuing to grind through and he's a warrior. He does everything he can possibly do to be out there with us.""

The rest of the starting offensive line had a much-needed pseudo bye week in the regular-season finale against the Commanders on Jan. 4, despite the 24-17 loss that cost the Eagles the No. 2 seed, and thus a second-round home game if the seedings hold through the first round.

Still, is that more important than being healthy going into the playoffs?

In this case, assuming Johnson plays, the Eagles will have 21 out of 22 starters available against the 49ers, the only absentee being rookie safety Drew Mukuba, who broke his fibula against the Dallas Cowboys on Nov. 23 and is on injured reserve.

That's not an accident, especially against the 49ers, who could be missing several key players.

""At the end of the day as a head coach, you have to make sure you're doing the things to make sure your guys are fresh while also making sure they're ready for that football game, and making sure that their skills are being sharpened and ironed out every single day of the week,"" Sirianni said. ""There's always a balance with that.""

That includes the players who aren't injured, specifically quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley.

Both have had a lighter workload this season, whether that's by design or the way games have played out, as Sirianni has said often. Still, Hurts has clearly run less than he has in the past, with only 421 yards on 105 carries. His previous career lows for a full season were 605 yards (2023) and 139 carries (2021).

Barkley, meanwhile, had 317 touches during the regular season compared with 378 last season. Barkley's counterpart on the 49ers, Christian McCaffrey, led the NFL in touches with 413 this season.

Barkley's production dipped from rushing for 2,005 yards in 2024 to 1,140 this season. Then again, he did appear to get stronger as the season went along. Barkley went from averaging 3.3 yards per carry in the first seven games, to 4.7 in the last nine games that he played in.

""I’m excited to get the run game going,"" Barkley said. ""But the most important thing is winning football, and however it looks. That’s the best thing about the playoffs. If we win every game the way we won against Buffalo (13-12 on Dec. 28), no one is going to care.

""No one is going to feel like we didn’t do enough on offense. ... That’s my favorite thing about the playoffs − stats don’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning the game, and I’m excited about that.""

It's a different story for the 49ers. They were already without their two best defensive players in edge rusher Nick Bosa and linebacker Fred Warner, and star left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall missed the Jan. 4 game against Seattle.

And the 49ers had to play their starters in that game in hopes of getting the No. 1 seed. The 49ers lost linebacker Tatum Bethune for the season and could be without his counterpart in Dee Winters, both injured during the Seahawks game.

Williams, Pearsall and Winters were all listed as questionable for the game. Pearsall didn’t practice at all this week.

As for Johnson's possible return, these were his first practices since he suffered the Lisfranc sprain on Nov. 16 against the Detroit Lions.

Johnson, of course, is considered one of the top tackles in the NFL. And his presence allows the Eagles to expand their blocking schemes, which should open up holes for Barkley to run through, and create more time for Hurts to pass or enable him to find a crease to run himself.

""You guys know Lane. Everybody knows Lane. He’s a Hall of Famer; he’s a stud,"" center Cam Jurgens said. ""That speaks for itself, and having him back in the room is just awesome from his personality. He makes the room a little lighter. We love having him in there. He means so much to us.""

The Bears will get back wide receiver Rome Odunze, while the Packers were hoping to get wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks back from a concussion.

As for offensive skill players, the Packers look to be healthier than usual after a Week 18 game where they were able to rest starters. Josh Jacobs got some much-needed time to rest his knee, while Jordan Love got an extra week coming out of concussion protocol.

Tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle), cornerback Renardo Green (foot), defensive end Keion White (groin), linebacker Luke Gifford (quad), linebacker Dee Winters (ankle) and receiver Jacob Cowing (hamstring) were all listed as questionable, coach Kyle Shanahan announced Friday.

“We’re going to Round 1 of the playoffs, playing as good of football as we can, being as prepared as we can and cutting it loose for three and a half hours,” a terse Shanahan said when asked about the mood of the team while dealing with the injuries.

Some of those injuries loom large for the 49ers, who hit the road to play the Eagles, 1:25 p.m. Pacific in Philadelphia. The 49ers had a chance at the No. 1 seed, which would’ve given them a first-round bye and an extra week to heal up, had they been able to defeat the Seattle Seahawks last Saturday at Levi’s Stadium.

Instead, the 49ers played their worst offensive game of the season and dropped to the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoffs.

Trent Williams

Williams practiced Thursday and Friday after straining his hamstring on the first offensive snap of the Week 17 win over the Chicago Bears, as he tried to chase down Bears linebacker T.J. Edwards during his pick-six.

Williams missed the finale against the Seahawks but was listed as a limited participant during the final two sessions of the week.

Ricky Pearsall

Pearsall, who missed six games in the middle of the season with a knee injury, didn’t practice this week after missing the season finale against Seattle while being listed with knee and ankle injuries. He missed two of the last three games, and appeared to aggravate the injury against the Bears during his five-catch, 85-yard performance. The 2024 first-round draft pick was among the league leaders in yards per catch (16.4) during his four games before the initial knee injury.

Shanahan said Pearsall still has a chance to play Sunday despite not practicing at all this week.

Renardo Green, Dee Winters and others

Green, who missed Weeks 16 and 17 with a neck injury, landed on the injury report with a foot issue that came up during Friday’s practice.

“He zinged something today,” Shanahan said.

If Green can’t go, Darrell Luter Jr. would likely be the top option to replace him.

White has appeared in all nine games since the 49ers acquired him in a trade with the New England Patriots in late October. He’s played 57% of the snaps while replacing Nick Bosa and first-round draft pick Mykel Williams on the edges of the 49ers’ defensive line.

If Winters can’t play, the 49ers could be forced to rely on players they added late in the season. Veteran Eric Kendricks, who signed Dec. 22, could play “Mike” linebacker next to Garrett Wallow, who was added Dec. 8.

On the other side of that, Pearsall and Winters did not participate in any of the practices this week.
Asked whether Pearsall and Winters would have been ruled out for a non-playoff game, Niners coach Kyle Shanahan demurred on Friday afternoon.
Receiver Jacob Cowing, who opened his practice window this week, is also listed as questionable but will not be activated for Sunday, according to Shanahan.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Despite a handful of key players battling injury this week, the San Francisco 49ers did not rule any of them out in advance of Sunday's NFC wild-card showdown against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Left tackle Trent Williams (right hamstring), receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle) and linebacker Dee Winters (ankle) are among six Niners on the active roster that the team is listing as questionable for Sunday. Linebacker Luke Gifford (quad), defensive lineman Keion White (groin) and cornerback Renardo Green (foot) are the others.

Not all questionable designations are created equal, however. Williams, who injured his hamstring on the first offensive snap of a Dec. 28 win against the Chicago Bears and didn't play last week against the Seattle Seahawks, appeared to be trending in the right direction this week.

Williams did not practice on Wednesday but was a limited participant on Thursday and Friday. On the other side of that, Pearsall and Winters did not participate in any of the practices this week. Williams told reporters Friday he will be a game time decision but is ""confident"" he will play Sunday.

Pearsall was also injured in the Chicago game and did not play against Seattle. Winters sustained his injury against the Seahawks.

Asked whether Pearsall and Winters would have been ruled out for a non-playoff game, Niners coach Kyle Shanahan demurred on Friday afternoon.

""I don't know,"" Shanahan said. ""It's a big hypothetical. Last week wasn't a playoff game, and I didn't look at it any different. I would say there's no difference in last week and this week.""

Like Williams, White also appeared to progress as the week went on. He didn't practice on Wednesday or Thursday but was limited on Friday. Gifford and Green went the opposite direction as Gifford participated on Wednesday but not Thursday or Friday and Green was added to the injury report Friday with a foot issue.

The uncertainty on the injury front could leave the 49ers particularly thin at linebacker. San Francisco already placed Tatum Bethune, the replacement for middle linebacker Fred Warner (ankle), on injured reserve earlier this week with a torn groin. If Winters and Gifford can't play, the Niners would likely start veteran Eric Kendricks and Garret Wallow against the Eagles.

Kendricks joined the Niners on Nov. 26 while the team claimed Wallow off waivers on Dec. 8. Veteran linebacker Kyzir White, who signed to the practice squad earlier this week, is also expected to be available with Curtis Robinson the only other healthy option on the active roster. Jalen Graham is another option to be elevated from the practice squad.

Shanahan said the lack of healthy linebackers could force the Niners to make multiple roster moves on Saturday beyond the two standard practice squad elevations.

""Depending on how that goes, we would possibly have to do that,"" Shanahan said. ""You're only allowed to have two elevations, so if we needed more than that, we'd have to make a roster move.""

While Shanahan said Monday that a potential Warner return wouldn't come until the NFC Championship Game at the earliest, Warner was seen doing some work on the side this week for the first time since fracturing his right ankle in Week 6. Shanahan said he hasn't yet been told that Warner could open his 21-day practice window next week if the Niners were able to beat Philadelphia.

Receiver Jacob Cowing, who opened his practice window this week, is also listed as questionable but will not be activated for Sunday, according to Shanahan.

Now, the 49ers will wait and see how their long flight to Philadelphia goes before making final determinations on their injured players. After playing three games in 13 days, Shanahan said having a full week of preparation plus an extra day (the Niners played Seattle last Saturday), was beneficial.

""I think it really added up,"" Shanahan said. ""Seeing the players on Wednesday, we all kind of joked that it felt like we just came back from a bye week because it kind of did. It was our first time having a normal routine in about three weeks and just getting away for a little bit. I think guys felt much more rested as the previous three.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0711%2Fr1357459_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 23:58:49.153312

Bills at Jaguars (1 p.m.
49ers at Eagles (4:30 p.m.","The 2025 NFL playoffs kick off with a six-game slate as part of NFL Super Wild Card Weekend. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos secured first-round byes as the top seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively, and 12 other teams will be fighting to advance to the Divisional Round next week. Many teams were able to rest starters in Week 18 to get healthy for the playoffs, but there are still some notable injuries that bettors should keep in mind for these six wild card games. Here, we break down those injuries as well as the latest NFL betting lines from DraftKings Sportsbook. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Rams at Panthers (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)

LAR WR Davante Adams (quad, will play)

Despite missing three games to close out the year, star Rams receiver Davante Adams led the NFL in receiving touchdowns with 14. Los Angeles dropped two of those three games without Adams to fall out of the race for the NFC West and No. 1 seed in the conference. Now, Adams will return for Saturday's matchup with the Panthers, who beat Los Angeles 31-28 in Carolina at the end of November.

Los Angeles is a 10.5-point favorite. The total is 45.5.

Packers at Bears (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)

GB QB Jordan Love (concussion, will play)

GB QB Malik Willis (shoulder and hamstring, questionable)

GB WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion, out)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, will play)

The Packers get Jordan Love back after he was banged up to close out the year, though his backup, Malik Willis, is questionable to suit up behind him. Additionally, receiver Dontayvion Wicks is out for Green Bay after a 332-yard season. As for Chicago, the Bears will get receiver Rome Odunze back after a foot injury cost him considerable time late in the season. Odunze missed the final five games of 2025 after tallying 661 yards and six touchdowns over 12 games.

Green Bay is a slight 1.5-point favorite on the road here, and the total is 44.5.

Bills at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET, Sunday)

BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, will play)

BUFF RB Ty Johnson (ankle, questionable)

This matchup sees the No. 1 rushing offense in the Bills face off with the Jaguars' No. 1-ranked run defense. That will be a key matchup to watch, and Buffalo receiving back Ty Johnson is questionable. He had 263 receiving yards and five total touchdowns as the backup to NFL rushing leader James Cook. The good news for the Bills is Josh Allen's favorite target is back, as tight end Dalton Kincaid is off the injury report after missing considerable time with a nagging knee injury.

Buffalo is a 1.5-point road favorite. And at 51.5, this total is the highest of the entire six-game Wild Card Weekend slate.

49ers at Eagles (4:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)

SF OT Trent Williams (hamstring, questionable)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, questionable)

After missing nearly half of the season, star Philadelphia right tackle Lane Johnson appears to be on track to return to the lineup on Sunday as he practiced this week and is listed as questionable. The 49ers are also hoping to get their star tackle back as left tackle Trent Williams is questionable after missing Week 18. Second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is also questionable. He's missed eight games in 2025.

The Eagles are -6 on the spread and the total is 44.5.

Chargers at Patriots (8 p.m. ET, Sunday)

LAC RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, questionable)

NE WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring, questionable)

The Chargers have been utterly decimated by injuries on offense this year, particularly at running back and offensive line. Star rookie back Omarion Hampton missed eight games this year but still compiled 737 scrimmage yards and five touchdowns in nine games. He's questionable for this contest with an ankle injury, though he told reporters he expects to play on Sunday. As for the Patriots, explosive receiver Kayshon Boutte is questionable. He cooled off after a three-week stretch with four touchdowns, but Boutte can take the tops off of defenses for Drake Maye.

New England is favored by 3.5 points. The total is 45.5.

Texans at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

PITT RB Jaylen Warren (illness, TBD)

The final injury report for this Monday showdown doesn't come out until Saturday, but one big name who missed practice this week is Steelers starting running back Jaylen Warren. Warren is dealing with an illness, per the report, which is likely a better sign than a different injury. Warren had 958 rushing yards in his first full season as the Steelers' lead running back.

Houston is favored by 3-points. The total is 38.5 -- the lowest of the first round.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/09/df4cbc0c-03b2-4b5b-ba37-e863ffb135a9/thumbnail/1200x675/0268f50b718554674000b06327917327/omarion-hampton.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 20:01:09.194875

Here are the notable injury updates and the injury reports for each of the six playoff teams this weekend.

Bears WR Rome Odunze back for Packers game

Caleb Williams will get a weapon back for his first NFL playoff game, with Rome Odunze off the injury list and ready to return. The second-year wide receiver has been out since Week 13 with a foot injury.

“I’m planning on playing,” Odunze said Wednesday. “But I’ve been planning on playing for weeks.”

Odunze was the Bears' leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown receptions when he exited the lineup. He said Wednesday his stamina isn't fully back yet, but he's confident he can help.

""As long as I have the option to be out there and contribute, I’m going to give it my all,"" Odunze said. ""I believe I can make a difference.”

[NFL injury updates live]

Cornerback Kyler Gordon is also expected to play against the Green Bay Packers after missing the final five regular-season games with a groin issue. He is currently listed as ""questionable.""

""He looked good yesterday. We'll see what it looks like again today both him and Rome, you know,"" said head coach Ben Johnson. ""It's good to have them both back out there. They're excited. They're moving around well and we'll see if they can help us out this weekend.""

49ers LT Trent Williams hopeful to play

San Francisco 49ers left tackle Trent Williams was a limited participant during practice on Thursday and Friday, after sitting out on Wednesday with a hamstring injury he suffered in Week 17.

Williams usually rests on the first day of practice during a game week, but head coach Kyle Shanahan clarified that wasn't the case, saying the All-Pro was still hurt. Williams said Friday he's confident he can play on Sunday.

Receiver Ricky Pearsall did not practice Friday, but was spotted on a side field this week. Shanahan said Wednesday that Pearsall aggravated the PCL injury that has limited him this season during Week 17.

Lane Johnson questionable for Eagles

Lane Johnson (foot) has been listed as questionable for the Philadelphia Eagles' Sunday meeting with the San Francisco 49ers. Johnson was limited in practice this week after being out since Week 11 with a Lisfranc injury.

“Lane’s a big difference maker, and I know he is working crazy to get himself back, and we will see where that is this week,” head coach Nick Sirianni said this week. “But he’s a difference maker. … He’s one of the best that’s ever done it. I think I kind of get too much into scheme with that. But yeah, he allows you to do some different things.”

Allen won the FedEx Air award last year in addition to the Most Valuable Player Award. Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase was last year's FedEx Ground award winner.

In 2025, Allen finished with 4,247 total yards and 39 total touchdowns. He was the only player in the NFL with 3,000+ passing yards & 500+ rushing yards.

Here are just a few of Allen's accomplishments throughout this season:

Week 1 vs. Ravens: Became the first player in NFL history to have 250+ passing yards & 2+ rushing TDs in any single quarter of any single game. His 251 fourth quarter passing yards marked the most by a QB in a win since 1996.

Week 9 vs. Chiefs: Established a new franchise record (88.5%) for completion percentage in a game.

Week 11 vs. Buccaneers: First player in NFL history with 3+ passing & 3 + rushing TDs in multiple career games. Also tied Cam Newton (75) for the most rushing TDs by a QB all-time (regular season only).

Week 14 vs. Bengals: Recorded his 50th career game with 1+ passing & 1+ rushing TDs, extending his NFL record.

Week 17 vs. Eagles: Recorded his 300th career total touchdown, becoming the fastest player in NFL history to reach the mark (127 games).",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/v7zgpibxtoz3t0xvkkhk,N,,2026-01-09 21:58:40.561213

Nose tackle Khyiris Tonga has been ruled out for the wild card after staying sidelined for a third straight week due to a foot injury, head coach Mike Vrabel announced during his Friday press conference.

But elsewhere, wide receiver Kayshon Boutte, offensive tackle Thayer Munford Jr. and outside linebacker Harold Landry III all close in on the playoffs with questionable game statuses.

Here’s the final injury report ahead of Sunday’s 8 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.

Since sustaining a foot injury in December against the Baltimore Ravens, Tonga has been a non-participant for nine consecutive practices. A third matchup among the No. 2 seed’s inactives is ahead. The all-purpose defensive tackle’s inaugural campaign in Foxborough has brought 24 tackles along with a pair of stops for loss, a pair of quarterback hits and a pair of batted passes. He stands with 337 snaps on defense, 14 snaps on offense and 65 snaps on special teams.

Head coach Jim Harbaugh’s side has ruled out two and listed six others as questionable, including the reigning No. 22 overall pick from the University of North Carolina.

The Patriots added Boutte to the injury report midway through the week. The perimeter wideout, listed as a limited participant, previously missed two games in November because of a hamstring injury and finished the campaign with 33 catches for 551 yards and a career-high six touchdowns.

Additional questionable designations reside on the offensive line and off the edges. Munford, who has made two starts in jumbo sets and tallied 100 offensive snaps since rejoining the AFC East champions, sat out Thursday’s practice due to a knee issue. And Landry has continued to practice in a partial capacity due to a knee issue of his own. New England’s sack leader had been ruled out for back-to-back games to end the regular season before ramping up for the playoffs.

Rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson, who was not in attendance for Friday’s practice due to personal reasons, will go without a game designation versus the Chargers. The same green light goes for rookie left guard Jared Wilson and veteran inside linebacker Robert Spillane. Concussion protocol and an ankle injury had kept the starters off the field since Week 16 and Week 13, respectively. Returns are on deck after upgrading to full.

Martinelli, 24, dropped the ball on Bradley, who then shuffled slightly to ensure he was on the pitch.
After receiving treatment on the pitch, Bradley was taken off on a stretcher and left the stadium on crutches with his left knee in a brace.
“I don’t know Gabriel Martinelli but he comes across as a nice guy,” Slot said in his post-match press conference.
But it doesn’t look great if Conor has the injury which we fear he might have.","Gabriel Martinelli is not expected to face further action from the Football Association after the Arsenal forward attempted to push injured Liverpool full-back Conor Bradley off the pitch during Thursday’s Premier League fixture.

Bradley, 22, landed awkwardly on the touchline as he tried to clear the ball in stoppage time of the 0-0 draw. He immediately appeared in physical pain and grabbed his knee as he fell to the ground. Martinelli, 24, dropped the ball on Bradley, who then shuffled slightly to ensure he was on the pitch. The Arsenal forward grabbed the Northern Ireland international by the shoulder and neck and pushed him back towards the touchline.

Martinelli was shown a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor. Given the incident was spotted by the on-field referee and action taken during the game, the Brazil international is not expected to face any retrospective disciplinary sanctions from English football’s governing body.

After receiving treatment on the pitch, Bradley was taken off on a stretcher and left the stadium on crutches with his left knee in a brace.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said at full time he would speak to Martinelli, who subsequently apologised on social media and stated he had not been aware of the severity of Bradley’s injury

“Knowing Gabi, if anybody knows Gabi, he’s an incredible, lovely guy, and probably he didn’t realise what happened,” Arteta told a post-match press conference. “I will have a word with him now to understand that, but probably he didn’t recognise what happened.”

The incident triggered a mass confrontation between the two teams and both Martinelli and Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate were shown yellow cards.

“Conor and l have messaged and l’ve already apologised to him,” Martinelli wrote on Instagram. “I really didn’t understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment.

“I want to say I’m deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.”

Liverpool head coach Arne Slot explained Bradley would undergo scans to determine the full extent of the injury but said he “fears the worst” for the right-back.

Slot also said he believed Martinelli did not realise the seriousness of Bradley’s injury and was sympathetic to the Arsenal player’s frustrations given how common time-wasting and feigning injury is in the latter stages of matches.

“I don’t know Gabriel Martinelli but he comes across as a nice guy,” Slot said in his post-match press conference.

“I think the problem for him is, and it’s a problem in general in football, that there is so much time-wasting and players pretending they are injured in the final parts of the game. You can then sometimes be annoyed if you want to score a goal that you think the player is time-wasting.

“I cannot ask of Gabriel Martinelli in the 94th minute when it’s so emotional for him to understand he is playing Liverpool – a team when we played Leeds and a player was held but didn’t go to the floor, or played West Ham United and my players try to drag (Lucas) Paqueta out of a situation where he was getting a second yellow card.

“I’m 100 per cent sure that if he knew what the injury might be that he would never do (what he did). But it doesn’t look great if Conor has the injury which we fear he might have.

“I think when we see the video we both probably think the same, but we have to wait on the scans if it’s that bad.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/08183630/GettyImages-2254687410.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-09 21:58:48.795839

Before perhaps one of the most unpredictable playoffs we've ever seen get underway, we'll have to account for injuries -- who is suiting up and who isn't for their respective teams -- this weekend. Every team playing in the wild card round, except for the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers who play on Monday night, has released their final injury report with game statuses. Let's take a look at who is in, who is out and whose status is still up in the air.

All wild card weekend NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.

Saturday

Los Angeles Rams at Carolina Panthers

Rams: G Kevin Dotson (ankle), WR Jordan Whittington (knee) OUT; TE Terrance Ferguson (hamstring), CB Josh Wallace (ankle) QUESTIONABLE

Panthers: G Chandler Zavala (calf) OUT

The visiting Los Angeles Rams will be without starting right guard Kevin Dotson (ankle) after he didn't practice all week. That's a big blow for the Rams as Dotson was Pro Football Focus' third-highest ranked guard in the NFL with an 86.4 offensive grade this season. Wide receiver Jordan Whittingham (knee) was also ruled out after not practicing all week.

The good news for the Rams is 2025 NFL receiving touchdowns leader Davante Adams, with 14 this season, is back after missing the last three games with a hamstring injury. Adams practiced fully all week and does not have a game status, meaning he is good to go. His eight career playoff receiving touchdowns are the most by an active NFL wide receiver.

Carolina Panthers guard Chandler Zavala (calf) was ruled out despite practicing fully all week.

Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears

Packers: WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion) OUT; S Javon Bullard (knee), DL Warren Brinson (foot), LB Nick Niemann (pectoral), RT Zach Tom (back/knee), QB Malik Willis (right shoulder/hamstring) QUESTIONABLE

Bears: S C.J. Gardner-Johnson (concussion), LB Amen Ogbongbemiga (concussion), DE Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (concussion) OUT; CB Kyler Gordon (groin), LT Braxton Jones (knee) QUESTIONABLE

The Green Bay Packers ruled out one player, wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks (concussion), after he practiced in a limited fashion all week. The rest of the Packers' questionable players -- safety Javon Bullard (knee), defensive lineman Warren Brinson, linebacker Nick Niemann (pectoral) and quarterback Malik Willis (right shoulder/hamstring) -- with the exception of right tackle Zach Tom (back/knee) were limited practice participants all week. Tom practiced in a limited fashion on Tuesday and Wednesday before being given a rest day by head coach Matt LaFleur on Thursday.

The host Chicago Bears will be without three players because of concussions after all three didn't practice at all this week: safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson, linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga and edge rusher Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. Two players who have been on injured reserve, left tackle Braxton Jones (knee) and cornerback Kyler Gordon (groin), are attempting to come back off of injured reserve and are listed as questionable. Jones practiced fully this week while Gordon was limited on Tuesday and Wednesday before practicing fully on Thursday.

Sunday

Buffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars

Bills: LB Terrel Bernard (calf), CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle), S Damar Hamlin (pectoral) OUT; RB Ty Johnson (ankle), WR Joshua Palmer (ankle), K Matt Prater (right quad), LB Shaq Thompson (neck) QUESTIONABLE)

Jaguars: LT Cole Van Lanen (knee) QUESTIONABLE

The Bills ruled out both linebacker Terrel Bernard (calf) and cornerback Maxwell Hairston (ankle) after they each didn't practice all week. Safety Damar Hamlin (pectoral) was unable to make a return off of injured reserve after being a limited practice participant all week. He was ruled out. Running back Ty Johnson (ankle) is questionable after practicing in a limited fashion for the first time all week on Friday. Wide receiver Joshua Palmer (ankle) is questionable after not practicing all week. Kicker Matt Prater (right quad) is questionable after fully practicing on Thursday and then not practicing on either Wednesday or Friday. Linebacker Shaq Thompson (neck) is questionable after practicing all week in a limited fashion.

The host Jaguars have just one player with a game status on their injury report: left tackle Cole Van Lanen (knee) is listed as questionable. He didn't practice on Wednesday or Thursday, but he was a limited practice participant on Friday.

Eagles: RT Lane Johnson (foot), OLB Azeez Ojulari (hamstring), OL Brett Toth (concussion) QUESTIONABLE

San Francisco 49ers left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) is listed as questionable after practicing in a limited fashion on both Thursday and Friday. Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) is questionable after not participating in practice at all this week.

Philadelphia Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson (foot) is questionable after being a limited practice participant all week. Edge rusher Azeez Ojulari (hamstring) is questionable after practicing fully all week, and offensive lineman Brett Toth (concussion) is questionable after practicing for the first time this week on Friday in a limited fashion.

Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots

Chargers: WR KeAndre Lambert-Smith (hamstring), S Kendall Williamson (ankle) OUT; RB Omarion Hampton (ankle), OT Austin Deculus (oblique), OLB Bud Dupree (hamstring), TE Tucker Fisk (ankle), S Elijah Molden (hamstring), LB Del'Shawn Phillips (hamstring) QUESTIONABLE

Patriots: DL Khyiris Tonga (foot) OUT; LB Harold Landry III (knee), WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring), OT Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) QUESTIONABLE

""Yeah, that's the plan,"" Hampton said on Friday, via The Athletic, when he was asked if he expects to play on Sunday.

Offensive tackle Austin Deculus (oblique) practiced limited on Thursday and fully on Friday and is listed as questionable. Edge rusher Bud Dupree is questionable after practicing in a limited fashion for the first time all week on Friday.

These are my picks for awards, from Most Valuable Player to Coach of the Year. As is clear, I don’t care if people—many who might not even watch the games and/or will stat watch or use borderline meaningless things like EPA—think any of these picks are “out there.”

MVP: Bo Nix, Broncos

2025 NFL MVP is going to Matthew Stafford or Drake Maye. No doubt they had excellent seasons. But Broncos quarterback Bo Nix is my pick. I went in depth with my reasoning here if you have time for a 10-minute YouTube video, but to sum:

First, Nix’s 2025 season actually stacks up nicely with Lamar Jackson’s 2023 MVP campaign:

And keep in mind that Jackson had a stronger supporting cast—plus the No. 1 defense in football. For as high-upside as the Broncos defense is, especially in terms of sacking the quarterback, I think it’s fair to say that Baltimore’s unit under Mike Macdonald (which took the ball away twice as much) was a better group.

Stafford had two costly performances in losses to the Panthers and Falcons, and MVP winners very rarely come from teams that didn’t win the division (granted, the NFC West uncommonly stacked).

Maye played one of the easiest schedules in NFL history—with just one win over a team with a winning record and a bad performance with two turnovers and five sacks taken in the only non-Bills matchup with a winning team (the Steelers).

There were no such performances from Nix where it cost his team. Some games might not have had the prettiest passing numbers. For example, take Week 18, when the Bronco secured the No. 1 seed. Sean Payton and company knew they would dominate defensively, so there was no need for the offense to try to light up the scoreboard. Nix played smart football, keeping some drives moving with his legs in a game he was under a lot more pressure than you’d expect. Being the least sacked quarterback in the league has more to do with his play than anything.

But when Nix was needed—like lighting up the Packers, or picking up the defense when it couldn’t get off the field at Washington, or when he helped put up 33 fourth-quarter points in an insane comeback versus the Giants in a game the other side of the ball mostly struggled—he came through.

In wins over the Eagles, Texans, Chiefs (once when Patrick Mahomes played), and Packers, the second-year quarterback stepped up his game and played like a clear Most Valuable Player.

Nix had seven game-winning drives total, including five fourth-quarter comebacks.

Stafford and Maye had one game-winning drive each. That’s certainly not some determining factor for MVP—not even close. But it speaks to the value Nix brought to his team in 2025.

This is the criteria for Most Valuable Player: “The award honors a player who had the most valuable season.”

It’s not about, “if this player would’ve been here” or “this player has the best stats.” It’s the player who had the most valuable season, and Nix has a strong case while helping Denver win 14 games, taking the AFC West and the AFC’s top seed.

If this was a few decades ago, I bet Nix would be getting legitimate MVP talk. But the ultra-negative sports media machine isn’t going to let that happen this quickly after they said the guy couldn’t play over the past year-plus.

Unfortunately, dominant mainstream and consensus groupthink would paint the idea of Bo Nix as the NFL MVP as a complete joke. They said the same thing when Josh Allen was playing like an MVP earlier in his career, remaining in constant denial until he kept up that level of play year after year before finally winning MVP last season.

Offensive Player of the Year: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks

Stepping up as the clear No. 1 wide receiver in Seattle, Jaxon Smith-Njigba posted a monstrous 119/1,793/10 line for the No. 1 seed in the conference. The scorching start to the season, when it looked like Calvin Johnson’s single-season record was at serious risk of being broken, set the tone—and he didn’t slow up much from there. JSN had at least both four receptions and 72 yards in every game except for one (a 26-0 win over the Vikings when the offense didn’t have to do a ton), breaking out as undoubtedly one of the top weapons in football. The speed and pace which Smith-Njigba runs his routes allows him to get open and do serious damage to opposing secondaries, as he did all 2025.

Defensive Player of the Year: Myles Garrett, Browns

This one needs little explanation, with Myles Garrett breaking the single-season sack record with 23.0. While he was going to be Defensive Player of the Year regardless, the Browns star certainly cut it close—getting shut out in Week 17 before finally breaking the record in the final minutes of the Week 18 win against the Bengals. The former No. 1 overall pick commands rare attention from opposing offenses, so to still be able to finish plays with sacks as much as he does is super impressive.

Offensive Rookie of the Year: Harold Fannin Jr., Browns

There are several players who had Offensive Rookie of the Year type of seasons, but I don’t understand why Harold Fannin Jr. isn’t getting more recognition for the year he had. From the jump, Fannin was a versatile, productive piece for Cleveland—displaying the skillset that made him a steal in the third round. Fannin caught a pass in all 16 games (he missed Week 18 due to injury), was the difference in his final game with a touchdown catch in the Browns’ upset win over the Steelers, and ended with 72 receptions for 731 yards and six touchdowns as a tight end—along with another score on the ground. It was extremely close between Tetairoa McMillan, who hit 1,000 yards receiving, and Fannin for my ultimate selection; but I opt for the consistency of Fannin.

Defensive Rookie of the Year: James Pearce Jr., Falcons

Respectfully, this award might speak to how media narratives and groupthink take over, with the voters going overwhelmingly for Browns rookie linebacker Carson Schwesinger, who racked up 156 total tackles, 2.5 sacks, and two interceptions in Jim Schwartz’s defense. But James Pearce Jr.’s rookie campaign is being totally discounted, probably in part because many of the narrative drivers thought the Falcons were dumb for trading their 2026 first-round pick to draft him. Pearce had 10.5 sacks for Atlanta, becoming the first rookie to do so since Micah Parsons—and the 37th rookie in history with double-digit sacks. The Tennessee product was explosive off the edge getting pressure and finishing at the quarterback for an Atlanta defense that showed major flashes of top-level play when at their best—and Pearce along with fellow rookies Jalon Walker and Xavier Watts boosted them.

Comeback Player of the Year: Christian McCaffrey, 49ers

Comeback Player of the Year has other options like Dak Prescott and Aidan Hutchinson (and even Philip Rivers given that return to the field after five years), but Christian McCaffrey had his 2024 season totally derailed by injury—and he bounced back to play every game while handling 413 touches for the 49ers. Ironically, with San Francisco so injured throughout the season, McCaffrey was a steady force available for all 17 games. He ran for 1,202 yards and 10 touchdowns while adding 102 receptions for 924 yards and seven receiving scores. CMC is the Comeback Player of the Year.

Coach of the Year: Mike Macdonald, Seahawks

This was the most difficult award to pick in my opinion, with all of Ben Johnson (winning the stacked NFC North in Year 1 is highly impressive), Kyle Shanahan (12 wins with all those injuries), Mike Vrabel (taking the Pats from one of the worst records in the league to 14 wins), Liam Coen (immediately getting the Jags to play his style of ball and go 13-4 while winning the AFC South), and Sean Payton (toppling the Chiefs in a division that also includes the Chargers, and with a somewhat limited supporting cast on offense and the J.K. Dobbins injury) as definite worthy picks. However, the Seahawks went 14-3 to win the NFC West while fending off the 12-win Rams and 49ers, doing it with a new quarterback and a defense that was awesome and saved its best for last in the deciding game for the division and the No. 1 seed in the conference.",https://wolfsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/harold-fannin-jr-offensive-rookie-of-the-year-browns-steelers.jpeg,N,,2026-01-09 22:58:33.696323

Johnson was limited for all three practices this week. The team probably would’ve liked to see him get at least one full session in. Lane might start at right tackle anyway but it doesn’t seem like a lock at the moment. The expectation is that’ll try to play at less than 100%. If he can’t go or has to leave the game early, it’ll be Fred Johnson in his place once again.

Toth missed practice on Wednesday and Thursday before being upgraded to limited participation on Friday. There’s a chance he could clear concussion protocol in time to play on Sunday. If he’s not cleared, the Eagles will be without their top backup at the interior offensive line positions. Matt Pryor and Drew Kendall will move up the depth chart in that case.

The Eagles opened Ojulari’s 21-day practice window to return from injured reserve earlier this week but there’s no indication they’re in a rush to activate him to the roster when they already have ample edge rusher depth.

Carter and Goedert were notably upgraded to full go on Friday after being limited on Wednesday and Thursday.

The Eagles have until 4:00 PM Eastern on Saturday to temporarily elevate up to two players from the practice squad to play on Sunday. Long snapper Charley Hughlett will be one of those elevations.

Smith unexpectedly retired from football on October 13. Alexander was placed on this list on November 12.

The Eagles opened Ojulari’s 21-day practice window to return from IR on January 7. Mukuba is eligible to return from IR but presumably not healthy enough to play. Practice windows to return from IR were previously opened for Lampkin and Hinton but the Eagles did not activate them before they closed, thus ending their seasons. BVS, Wilson, and Okoronkwo suffered season-ending injuries.

Seems to me like San Francisco is trying to lean into competitive advantage by being as vague as possible with their injury report.

Williams was limited for the second day in a row. 49ers reporters noted he was working off to the side, away from the team’s other offensive linemen. Seems like he might try to play but it might be a stretch. The point spread for this game opening at Eagles -3 and moving to Eagles -6 suggests Williams might not play.

Pearsall did not participate in practice this week. It’s pretty rare for players to play after not practicing at all leading up to the game. Guessing he won’t suit up, which hurts the 49ers’ offense.

Winters also did not participate in practice this week. Gifford was limited on Wednesday but missed practice on Thursday and Friday. With that in mind, it looks like the 49ers will start Eric Kendricks and Garret Wallow at off-ball linebacker. Two players who’ve barely played at all this season.

Green was unexpectedly added to Friday’s report with a foot injury. Would be tough for an already banged up Niners defense to lose a starting CB on short notice.

White was upgraded to limited on Friday. He might be able to suit up.

Cowing was full go in practice all week so he might be activated from injured reserve to help make up for the potential Pearsall absence.",https://platform.bleedinggreennation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2026/01/imagn-26690309.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.743314999773%2C100%2C78.513370000455&w=1200,N,,2026-01-09 18:02:38.286172

The Jaguars are a good team, but the Bills should move on and secure their first road playoff win since McDermott arrived.","The Buffalo Bills will have an opportunity for a full-circle NFL playoff moment Sunday when they take on the Jacksonville Jaguars on the road in the AFC’s wild-card round.

EverBank Stadium was where the Bills played their first postseason game after breaking the infamous 17-year playoff drought. This is also the first time they’ve played the Jaguars in the playoffs since that fateful day in 2017, a Bills loss.

If ever there was a place for them to win their first road playoff game under coach Sean McDermott, it’s Jacksonville. But to do that, they’ll need their best assets ready to go.

Buffalo’s injuries have dictated its season. Injuries are never an excuse, and they happen to every team, but the Bills have been going through it this season. According to Sports Info Solutions, Buffalo had the third-highest number of games missed due to injury in 2025, with 297, and they are atop the AFC rankings. For context, that is almost double what the Jaguars have incurred this year (150).

Injuries during games were common, but the less common scenarios were what caused frustration. There was the pregame calf injury for defensive tackle DaQuan Jones that left the Bills short-handed against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 6. Not to mention all the mid- and late-week practice injuries the Bills had to contend with during the season that wound up costing players at least a game or two.

There wasn’t a single day during the 2025 regular season when the Bills had all 53 members of their active roster available and practicing. Out of a possible 34 practice squad elevations to get through the game, the Bills used 33.

The defense has been the most impacted, by far. One of its star players, Ed Oliver, played in only three games this year and remains on injured reserve. The Bills lost key rotational pass rusher Michael Hoecht after just two highly impactful games to a season-ending torn Achilles tendon. And though the Bills haven’t incurred many other season-altering injuries, adding up all the little stuff has impacted their progress.

The only defensive tackle who didn’t miss at least one game due to injury or suspension was rookie Deone Walker. The Bills were without Oliver for 14 games, Jones missed four and rookie T.J. Sanders missed five, and those are just the main ones.

At linebacker, Terrel Bernard missed five games, and Matt Milano and Shaq Thompson missed four — none occurred in the same game.

The defensive backs saw top cornerback Christian Benford miss two games and nickel corner Taron Johnson miss three. Safeties Taylor Rapp and Damar Hamlin had their regular seasons end in October, and even Jordan Poyer missed two games to end the regular season.

But as the Bills get closer to the postseason, things are looking up for the first time in a long time on the injury front.

Although Oliver isn’t returning this week, the Bills are talking like he’s getting close. And though they didn’t give a target date, the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter by the day. The Bills opened the 21-day practice window for Hamlin, their reserve safety, and even if it isn’t this week, Hamlin could be back into a special teams role before long.

On top of those, all of the recent injuries that cost players games are looking up.

Poyer, who became an indispensable part of the starting lineup when he took over in Week 8, missed the last two games with a hamstring injury. Poyer certainly seemed optimistic about his chances to play, and that’s putting it lightly.

“I feel good. I feel ready to go. I feel ready to play. I’m excited to play,” Poyer told The Athletic.

Jones, a key defensive starter all season, has also missed the last two games after aggravating a calf injury from earlier in the year. Though he wasn’t as outright in saying he’d be playing Sunday, there was a certain insinuation.

“Listen, if we had a game that we had to play to continue our season, I’m playing in ’em,” Jones told The Athletic on Wednesday. “It was just really for rest — make sure I’m good to go for, you know, the game that truly mattered at this point.”

Tight end Dalton Kincaid appears to be following the same track as last week, as he was limited all week before playing against the New York Jets. When Kincaid is healthy and in the lineup, he is vital to the passing attack.

Heck, even the kicker situation is looking up. Matt Prater aggravated a quad injury that cost him two games, and it forced the Bills to sign kicker Matthew Wright to the practice squad just in case. However, Prater was a full participant Thursday, which is a positive sign.

Even if Prater can’t go, the Bills will at least have a kicker in Wright, who has had a good record in Jacksonville. Wright has made 15 of his 17 field goal attempts at EverBank Stadium during the regular season, and he didn’t miss a kick over his last five games played there.

Not to bury the lede, but quarterback Josh Allen is as healthy as he could be and is moving around extremely well during practice. This is a change from previous weeks, when Allen at least favored his injured foot. But with almost two weeks off from game action, the Bills are likely to have the full Allen experience for the playoffs.

Still on brand, the Bills have a handful of injuries to contend with this week. But in each of those cases, it’s not putting them in a worse position with the player who would be taking up the injured player’s usual role.

Linebacker Terrel Bernard, who began the year as the starting middle linebacker, hasn’t been spotted on the practice field for the past two weeks because of a Week 17 calf injury. Though Bernard has struggled this season, Thompson has been an upgrade for the Bills when he’s had to play a full complement of snaps.

Rookie cornerback Maxwell Hairston, who has been splitting series with veteran Tre’Davious White as the co-running mate to No. 1 corner Christian Benford, injured his ankle against the Jets. However, despite having a pair of interceptions, Hairston has been outplayed by White since the arrangement began in late October. The biggest concern about an injury to Hairston is the depth behind Benford and White.

Running back Ty Johnson hasn’t practiced yet this week because of an ankle injury from Week 18 and has been their go-to third-down back during the season. But Ray Davis is a more-than-capable fill-in, and Johnson’s potential absence might just mean more James Cook — and more of the 2025 NFL rushing leader is never a bad thing.

Wide receiver Joshua Palmer has also been unable to practice with an ankle injury, though his standing on the receivers depth chart has plummeted in recent weeks. Palmer was one of three receivers the Bills used prominently in their get-through-it-and-rest-the-starters Week 18 game against the Jets. Palmer’s minimal time, if he misses, would likely move snaps toward the top three of Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks and Tyrell Shavers even more. Then there’s Gabe Davis, who will be bringing what he called “a little extra” when going up against the Jaguars, his 2024 team.

Although it isn’t perfect from an injury perspective, as it hasn’t been for the entire season for the Bills, they might just be the most meaningfully healthy they’ve been all season, just when they need it the most.

Projected practice squad elevations: DE Andre Jones Jr., LB Baylon Spector

Projected inactives: WR Joshua Palmer, TE Keleki Latu, OT Tylan Grable, DT Larry Ogunjobi, LB Terrel Bernard, CB Maxwell Hairston, S Jordan Hancock

Prediction: Bills 29, Jaguars 24

The Bills head into their wild-card matchup against a Jaguars team that is one of the hottest in the NFL. The Jaguars’ eight-game win streak is the fourth longest of the 2025 season and the second-longest active streak, behind only the Houston Texans’ nine. Going into Jacksonville and defeating this team won’t be a small feat. It’s likely to be a tight game, but some things are working in the Bills’ favor.

When the Bills are on offense, the health of Kincaid and the emergence of Cooks can contribute against a zone-heavy Jaguars defense that can be picked apart through the air. Even still, the Bills will need their running game to become the two-dimensional attack they so crave. The Jaguars have a very good run defense, with standouts like defensive tackle DaVon Hamilton and linebacker Foyesade Oluokun, who can challenge an offense. The Jaguars played a similarly structured Denver Broncos team recently, though, which, like the Bills, boasts one of the best offensive lines in the league. The Broncos also busted a few explosive runs from R.J. Harvey, who has similar acceleration to Cook, with Cook being the superior all-around player. The Bills should be able to move the ball and put up points against this Jaguars defense.

On defense, the Jaguars will be a big challenge to the Bills’ unit, which has played far better as of late. Jacksonville has several skill players who can impact the game. The Bills will need to be gap sound against a solid rushing team, and they have to be wary of the explosive runs that Travis Etienne and Bhayshul Tuten are capable of, though it helps that the Bills are likely to have Jones back in the lineup at defensive tackle.

One of the most difficult decisions the Bills might have is which receiver between Brian Thomas Jr. and Jakobi Meyers they’ll choose to make Benford, their top cornerback, travel with. Thomas is the big-play threat, but Meyers has quickly become an impact piece to their offense. Taron Johnson will also have his hands full with slot receiver Parker Washington. One injury to monitor is to Jaguars left tackle Cole Van Lanen, who didn’t practice Wednesday or Thursday because of a knee injury. If Van Lanen can’t go, it will likely put backup tackle Walker Little in the game and give the Bills defensive end a plus matchup. And when Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence is pressured, his impact goes down significantly.

Ultimately, I think the Bills will win in a close game that might come down to the final possession — whether that’s the Bills scoring a go-ahead touchdown or the Jaguars being denied a late-game go-ahead opportunity. Despite some of the Jaguars’ great parts, the Bills should be able to find success, most notably in their rushing game against some of Jacksonville’s rotational defensive linemen. The Jaguars are a good team, but the Bills should move on and secure their first road playoff win since McDermott arrived.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/08224148/GettyImages-2252397764-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-09 20:01:40.639811

However, that decline hasn't prevented the Jaguars from winning their last eight games.","Three must-know storylines

Who helps Allen overcome his road playoff woes? Bills quarterback Josh Allen is 0-4 in road playoff games in his career, the last three losses taking place in Kansas City (K.C. eliminated Buffalo from the postseason in four of the last five seasons). Buffalo's heartbreak hasn't fallen squarely on Allen, who surpassed 270 total yards of offense in all four of his career road playoff games, averaging 351.0 yards per game, including a postseason career-high 397 yards against the Chiefs in the 2021 Divisional Round. The Jaguars have allowed 270-plus total yards to seven different quarterbacks in 2025, so Allen could be primed for a productive outing as long as his sore foot holds up. But which pass catchers step up for him has been a week in, week out mystery. Buffalo is one of six teams that didn't have a player with 725-plus receiving yards. Khalil Shakir led the receiving corps as Allen's go-to option on short passing plays while tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox produced in Buffalo's often-used 11-personnel scheme. The lack of a deep threat for Allen in 2025 has been glaring. Second-year wideout Keon Coleman underwhelmed and Josh Palmer struggled to stay healthy and build a rapport, leading the Bills to bring back Gabe Davis and add veteran Brandin Cooks late this season. Tyrell Shavers has shown flashes downfield but remains a situational threat. It's not to say one of Allen's receivers has the ability to break out against the Jaguars' pass defense, which can be seen as the unit's soft spot (218.1 yards per game; 21st in NFL) -- the question is who will help get the Bills' star QB out of this postseason road slump. Allen has won at least one playoff game in five straight appearances, the longest streak in league history by a player without reaching the Super Bowl in that span, per NFL Research. Allen's playoff shortcomings figure to be a constant underlying storyline during Sunday's game, especially with his archnemesis (Chiefs) out of the running, but before furthering that discussion, the reigning MVP must first do something he's never done in the playoffs: win on the road. He's shown up consistently despite the results, but who also rises to the occasion is the prevailing question.

Watch out for Jacksonville's X-factors. The Jaguars joined the 2025 Patriots and 1999 Colts as the only teams in NFL history to win 13-plus games in the following season after losing 13-plus games -- an impressive turnaround facilitated by Liam Coen. Jacksonville's rookie head coach and offensive play-caller has been a revelation who has unlocked Trevor Lawrence, who posted a career-high 38 total touchdowns while leading a Jaguars offense that averaged a franchise-record 27.9 points per game in 2025. Coen's influence has brought a persistent passing offense to Jacksonville that is peaking at the right time. Lawrence has spread the ball to a solid wide-receiving trio in Parker Washington, Brian Thomas Jr. and Jakobi Meyers, who was acquired in a midseason trade. Tight end Brenton Strange served as Lawrence's security blanket. Washington led the team with 847 yards off 58 receptions, 17 of which have been for 20-plus yard gains. The Jaguars' home run hitter comes into Sunday hot with 347 receiving yards and two touchdowns in his last three games, but his play-making isn't limited to offensive play. Washington brought his 2025 touchdown total to seven with a pair of scores on punt returns, becoming the first player to have 750-plus receiving yards and multiple punt return TDs in a single season since DeSean Jackson did it in 2009. Washington is a sneaky X-factor the Bills must keep an eye on, but Jacksonville's kicker is another key element who could come into play. Cam Little made the two longest field goals in NFL history this season, a record-breaking 68-yarder in Week 11 and a 67-yard FG in Week 18. A kicking weapon like that is a scary proposition for opposing teams, especially at the end of each half and potentially overtime.

Divergent ground attacks could shape outcome. James Cook, Buffalo's most reliable offensive playmaker outside of Allen and the NFL's rushing champion in 2025, will lock horns with the league's top-ranked defense against the run -- the 10th such matchup of bests in NFL playoff history, per NFL Research. The Jaguars yielded 85.6 yards per game on the ground and 68.0 YPG to running backs; that kind of dependability often pigeon-holed opposing offenses and created opportunity for a defense that forced 31 takeaways (23 interceptions, nine fumbles; 2nd in NFL). The Bills, of course, led the league in rushing with Josh Allen and Ray Davis also producing. Meanwhile, stopping the run has been a struggle for the Bills defense all season (allowing 136.2 YPG) and that's been somewhat of a shock from Sean McDermott's team. Jacksonville began the season with a balanced attack, leading Travis Etienne to his third 1,000 yard campaign, but running the ball consistently has been an issue as of late with Etienne averaging 3.6 yards per carry since Week 10. However, that decline hasn't prevented the Jaguars from winning their last eight games. Not allowing Jacksonville to find its ground groove on Sunday will be crucial for the Bills, who boast the league's top passing defense and thrive on controlling games by keeping their offense on the field with Cook rushing and Allen making back-breaking plays.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/dibb9ceeozsyzxdsjvq1,N,,2026-01-09 21:58:52.889311

Vrabel's goals were to win the AFC East, host home playoff games, and compete for championships.","The Patriots are preparing to host their first home playoff game in six seasons when they welcome the Chargers to Gillette Stadium, and New England's roster is in relatively good shape for Sunday night.

On Friday, New England ruled out NT Khyiris Tonga (foot) and listed WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) OLB Harold Landry III (knee), and OT Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) as questionable for Sunday night's Wild Card matchup. Although being down their run-stuffing nose tackle is notable, Tonga is the lone Patriot on the active roster who doesn't have a chance to play on Sunday night. Given that we're heading into the 19th week of the season, that's encouraging.

​That said, Tonga's absence will be felt on both sides of the ball, as it has been since he suffered his foot injury in a Week 16 win over the Ravens. The big nose tackle hasn't played since exiting the win in Baltimore after having significant roles on the interior defensive line and as a short-yardage blocker in jumbo packages offensively. Without Tonga in recent weeks, the Patriots have relied on defensive tackles Christian Barmore, Cory Durden, Eric Gregory, and practice-squad elevations Jeremiah Pharms Jr. and Leonard Taylor III, while standout DT Milton Williams returned from injured reserve in Week 18.

Williams played 26 snaps in his first game action since suffering a high-ankle sprain in a Week 11 win over the Jets. In those 26 plays, Williams logged a tackle for loss against the run and one quarterback pressure, while helping free up Barmore for a 1-on-1 rush on a second-quarter sack. Williams' return gave the Patriots defense a huge boost, as he is an impact player who can shed blocks and make plays in the backfield.

On Sunday night, the hope is that the defense will get a similar bump from the returns of captains Robert Spillane and Harold Landry III. Spillane's last snaps came before New England's bye week in a Week 13 win over the Giants. Since then, the starting linebacker has been sidelined due to an ankle injury. Spillane won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's night's game, meaning he is expected to play. Earlier this week, Spillane spoke about his potential return, adding that returning for the playoffs was his goal.

""Yes sir,"" Spillane replied when asked if he'll be ready to play on Sunday night. ""It was always a goal to be ready for Week 1 of the playoffs. It means everything to be out there. Obviously, you want to be a factor in these games. So that's the major goal this week: get healthy, be a good teammate, do whatever I can to be out there Sunday.""

During his multi-week absence, LB Jack Gibbens stepped into Spillane's role as the Patriots starting MIKE linebacker. Gibbens made the most of the opportunity, flashing impressive instincts in coverage while also logging five run stuffs. However, Spillane still leads the Patriots with 18 run stuffs despite playing in only 13 games. The captain is by far the team's best run-stopping linebacker and is the primary signal-caller on the field.

Along those same lines, the team hopes a few weeks of rest will do edge rusher Harold Landry III some good, after the captain sat out the final two games of the regular season. Landry has been managing a knee injury that dates back to a scare in a Week 6 win over the Saints. After playing through the injury for several weeks, the Patriots decided to shut Landry down after clinching a playoff berth. Before the injury, Landry had a 2.7% sack rate and pressured opposing quarterbacks on 10.7% of his pass rushes. Since the injury, Landry has been registering a sack on 1.8% of his rushes with a 7.3% pressure rate. If the rest does wonders for Landry, his playoff performance could be closer to the player he was to start the season.

With a trio of starters returning to the lineup, the Patriots defense should improve. They already got impact plays from Williams in his return, and now Landry and Spillane are expected to return. In particular, the hope is that the run defense returns to form. In the first 10 weeks, New England's defense was fourth in rush EPA allowed. Without some of their top defenders down the stretch, the Patriots defense finished their last six games ranked 21st in rush EPA. Hopefully, getting the defense back to mostly full strength allows New England to exploit a weakness in the Chargers along their offensive line.

Offensively, WR Kayshon Boutte popped up on the injury report with a hamstring injury this week. After practicing in full on Wednesday, Boutte was limited in the last two sessions and is officially questionable. The Patriots are already thin at wide receiver without veteran Mack Hollins, who is on injured reserve. New England's fully healthy wideouts are Stefon Diggs, Kyle Williams, DeMario Douglas, and Efton Chism III. Hopefully, Boutte, who has been a productive outside deep threat, will be able to suit up on Sunday night, which seems to be the plan barring anything unforeseen.

The Patriots also have some unknowns along the offensive line heading into Sunday night due to injury and illness. During the week, starting RT Morgan Moses and C Garrett Bradbury both missed practices due to illness. The expectation is that both will play, but New England is still unsure about the status of third tackle Thayer Munford Jr., who missed Thursday's practice due to his knee injury.

Munford Jr., who has played the jumbo tight end role for the Patriots over the last several weeks. In their last four games, New England has played 56 snaps with six offensive linemen on the field, third-most in the NFL, and Munford has been the primary extra offensive lineman. In those six O-Line packages, the Patriots are averaging 8.3 yards per play with 11 explosive plays, so one would expect that OC Josh McDaniels would like to have the jumbo package at his disposal in the postseason.

If he can't go, backup tackle Vederian Lowe, who has also been battling an illness, could be the sixth offensive lineman this week. New England could also turn to top backup Ben Brown in that role. Either way, the jumbo tight end has been an important role in the Patriots offense over the last month, so Munford being questionable to play isn't an insignificant injury.

At left guard, head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed that rookie Jared Wilson will start on Sunday night. On Friday, Wilson shed his red non-contact jersey at practice, indicating that Wilson cleared concussion protocol. Wilson has started all 13 games he's been healthy in this season and Vrabel told reporters on Friday that the rookie will get the start now that he has cleared concussion protocol after some discussion about sticking with Brown.

As for Los Angeles, the big injury question for the Chargers is the status of rookie RB Omarion Hampton (ankle). Hampton returned to practice in a limited capacity on Friday and is officially questionable for Sunday night due to his ankle injury. The first-round rookie is Los Angeles's lead-back when healthy, but has battled injuries in his first season. Hampton told reporters in Los Angeles that he plans to play on Sunday, but the Chargers will likely lean on RB Kimani Vidal if the talented rookie is out.

Along with hosting their first home playoff game since 2019, New England is aiming to check another box in Mike Vrabel's to-do list when he took over as head coach in January. Vrabel's goals were to win the AFC East, host home playoff games, and compete for championships. In his first season as head coach, the Patriots won the division and will host a home playoff game, so next up on the checklist is winning playoff games, adding extra validity to the Patriots terrific 14-3 regular season.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/yfitxzdrilyeir1kdw3a,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:16.076249

Hampton, the Chargers' first-round rookie, has seen his season hindered by injuries. He was placed on injured reserve after the Chargers' Week 5 loss to the Washington Commanders with a fracture in his left ankle. He returned in Week 14 against the Eagles, only to sustain an injury to his other ankle in Week 17 against the Houston Texans.

""It's definitely been different, but it's something I've just got to keep getting treatment on and bounce back from,"" Hampton said of the injuries.

Hampton said he wasn't sure about the severity of his injury, but it occurred early in the fourth quarter against Houston when he was tackled by linebacker Henry To'oTo'o. Despite the injury, Hampton stayed in the game, finishing with 29 rushing yards, a touchdown, and 31 receiving yards.

""I definitely didn't want to give up on my team,"" Hampton said. ""I just wanted to help my team out as much as I could, so I kept my head down and kept playing.""

Hampton got off to a slow start early in the season but quickly became one of the Chargers' most important offensive pieces after veteran running back Najee Harris suffered a season-ending Achilles rupture in the first half of the Chargers' Week 3 game against the Denver Broncos.

With Harris sidelined, Los Angeles leaned heavily on Hampton, who broke out with a team-high 129 yards from scrimmage and his first NFL touchdown in a 23-20 win.

Prater missed two games with a quad muscle injury, returned to play in the season finale last week against New York, but aggravated the injury and could not finish the game.

It’s possible that Wright may get the call if the Bills don’t want to risk losing Prater during the game. Another option could be to use a practice squad elevation on Wright to serve in an emergency capacity if the 41-year-old Prater were to get hurt again during the game.

“There’s multiple things we’re trying to balance,” McDermott said. “We’ve dealt with a lot of injures this year, so nothing new having to balance some of those things. But we’re on top of it.

Having to use a game-day roster spot on a backup kicker is obviously not ideal, but there’s no tomorrow in the postseason and it might not be a bad idea because the Bills can’t afford not having a kicker in a game of this magnitude, especially one that is expected to be close and could come down to a do-or-die kick.

Good news on Buffalo Bills injury report

Based on their practice status during the week, it looks like safety Jordan Poyer and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones, who were both inactive last week, will return. And linebacker Shaq Thompson and tight end Dalton Kincaid, who were also limited each day, are also ready to go.

Thompson was held out last week while Kincaid played because he had missed several games and needed a tuneup heading into the postseason, and he caught three passes for 48 yards.

Here we are, with the Pittsburgh Steelers being the first team to challenge that assertion.

Houston makes its third consecutive trip to the postseason and is pursuing its third straight win in the wild-card round. Pittsburgh will try to avoid losing a wild-card playoff game for the third year in a row, looking to Aaron Rodgers to lift the Steelers to the divisional round for the first time since the 2017 season. Rodgers last played in the postseason in 2022, finishing his second-to-last season with the Green Bay Packers.

Previous meeting this season

These two teams did not face each other during the regular season. The last time Houston played Pittsburgh was during the 2023 season (unless you count the 2024 preseason), DeMeco Ryans’ first as the Texans’ head coach. Kenny Pickett was the Steelers’ quarterback and Najee Harris started at running back then.

C.J. Stroud threw for 308 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Nico Collins tallied 7 receptions for 168 yards and two scores in Houston’s 30-6 rout at home.

The Steelers have had a clean injury report throughout the week, with only Jaylen Warren missing practice time due to illness. However, Pittsburgh apparently believes the team’s leading rusher will recover in time for Monday night’s kickoff.

The Texans had two starters miss practice this week, cornerback Kamari Lassiter and left guard Tytus Howard. Lassiter tied for the team lead with four interceptions and was third with 91 tackles, while Howard started 16 games this season.

The head coaches

Strangely, Ryans might be the more secure coach in this matchup. The Texans are ascendant in his third season as he’s built the best defense in the NFL. Losing in the wild-card round might take some shine off that status, but Houston is clearly building a contender. Pittsburgh seemingly avoided a difficult decision by winning its regular-season finale to clinch the AFC North and a playoff berth. Yet if the Steelers lose badly to Houston, Tomlin and the team may mutually decide that it’s time for a change.

Key player for the Steelers

Pittsburgh needed a reliable starting quarterback, which is what led the team to sign Rodgers. But making it to the playoffs hasn’t been the issue. The Steelers qualified for the postseason in five of the past six seasons. With Rodgers, the hope was that he had one more vintage season left to advance further in the playoffs. But he threw for five total touchdowns while averaging 247 passing yards in the Steelers’ final five games. Is he capable of more against a defense that allowed 277 yards per game and has been unbeatable in its past nine games?

Key player for the Texans

Befitting their status as the NFL’s top defense, the Texans have standouts among their front seven and secondary. As mentioned above, four players had four interceptions. Defensive end Danielle Hunter led the team with 15 sacks. Yet the most disruptive player is on the opposite end of the line from Hunter, edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. The third-year pro has provided the stellar production Houston anticipated after making him the No. 3 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. The Steelers are surely aware that Anderson has 20 tackles for loss and 23 quarterback hits this season. Rodgers could see a lot of him on Monday night.

Prediction

Pittsburgh’s reward for winning the AFC North and making the playoffs is meeting the team nobody supposedly wanted to play. (Whether the Texans have the NFL’s most ferocious defense is a discussion that should include the Denver Broncos.) Additionally, the Steelers backed into the postseason, advancing thanks to Ravens kicker Tyler Loop shanking a 44-yard field-goal attempt wide right as time expired.

Houston’s defense may also be acclaimed because it compensates for a subpar offense. The Texans ranked No. 18 in total offense and averaged 24 points per game. Quarterback C.J. Stroud threw for 200 yards or fewer in three of his past five games. That might give the Steelers a chance. But Houston’s strength is too much to overcome.

Stafford led the NFL with a career-high 46 touchdown passes and 4,707 passing yards this season.

The 37-year-old quarterback overcame an offseason back injury and potential trade talks.

WOODLAND HILLS, CA. – Los Angeles Rams guard Steve Avila still finds it surreal that he’s teammates with Matthew Stafford.

“There are times like I'm like, ‘Wow, that's Matthew Stafford.' Like, I was 9 years old when he got drafted,” Avila told USA TODAY Sports. “It is awesome. I mean, especially just with the season that he's had, and just being able to be a part of that is just amazing.”

Avila’s elementary school recollection of Stafford might make the 37-year-old feel old, but the quarterback’s performed this year like an aging fine red wine.

Stafford led the NFL and broke a franchise record with a career-high 46 touchdown passes to just eight interceptions. Those 46 touchdowns are the second-most thrown in a single season by an NFL quarterback age 37 or older. Additionally, he became the third player in NFL history with at least 45 touchdown passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season, according to NFL Research. His 4,707 passing yards also topped the league.

Stafford threw four touchdown passes in Week 18 alone and became third player in NFL history with multiple touchdown passes in 15 games in a season. He earned his fourth career player of the week honor for his performance in the team’s season finale.

'He is the MVP'

The Rams quarterback’s statistics indicate he’s defying Father Time, and he might’ve just capped off the best regular season of his career.

Stafford is the frontrunner to win MVP, courtesy of BetMGM as of Jan. 4. For all his plaudits, the Super Bowl 56 champion and three-time Pro Bowler has never won the award.

Rams players believe the award should be added this year to Stafford's already impressive resume.

“He is the MVP. There's no ifs ands or buts about it,” Rams running back Blake Corum told USA TODAY Sports. “The season he’s had is ridiculous. The career he's had is just tremendous.”

MVP voting for the regular season concluded on Monday. The recipient of the award won’t be revealed until the NFL Honors ceremony on Feb. 5.

“I hope everybody has their head screwed on right and knows exactly that he's the most valuable person in the league,” Avila said.

Stafford had a humble response when asked by USA TODAY Sports about his MVP candidacy and diverted the credit to the team.

“As far as being a candidate, I just wanted to play as good as I possibly can this year like I do every season,” Stafford said. “Obviously, I have great football players around me and coaches around me that give myself and our offense a chance and opportunity to succeed. We were able to do that.”

Stafford: 'I didn't know if I would get there'

What makes Stafford’s stellar year even more impressive is what he’s overcome this season – a campaign that almost didn’t happen.

The Rams granted Stafford’s agent permission to speak to other teams about a trade last February, before the sides agreed to a contract restructure later that month. But a subsequent aggravated disk in his back would cause Stafford to miss most of training camp.

“There were some lean moments. It was touch and go there for a little bit,” Stafford recalled. “A lot of treatments and things that I did to try and help myself get to this point. I didn't know if I would get there but I went out there and it was wait and see, let's see what happens. Luckily it turned out pretty good.”

Pretty good is an understatement. Stafford started all 17 regular-season games, led the NFL in passing yards and touchdowns and is an odds-on favorite to win MVP.

Stafford’s now about to embark on another playoff journey in his fifth season as the Rams QB. Following a 2021 blockbuster trade with the Detroit Lions, Stafford led the Rams to a Super Bowl title his first season in Los Angeles. Stafford and the Rams have their sights set on another Lombardi Trophy, and maybe some additional hardware for the trophy case along the way.

“What a guy that you just watch that is totally present. He's enjoying the moment and I think that's when we're at our best. I think this team has taken on a lot of the great traits, the toughness mentally and physically, and just the overall enjoyment for the chance to go compete, but also the ability to celebrate your teammates. He's elevated everybody that he's around, but it's been really impressive,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “I wouldn't say I'm surprised though. This has been consistent for him over the five years that we've been together. I’m just grateful to be able to have the opportunity to be partnered up with him.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/08/USAT/88077152007-usatsi-27933520.jpg?crop=4193,2359,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-09 16:01:02.110120

Here are the final game statuses for the week:

Questionable: RT Lane Johnson (foot), OL Brett Toth (concussion), OLB Azeez Ojulari (hamstring)

As the Eagles held their final practice Friday ahead of hosting the 49ers in the wild-card round on Sunday, all 53 players on their active roster were practicing.

The two players who were not practicing on Thursday — LG Landon Dickerson (rest) and OL Brett Toth (concussion) — returned, which means all 53 players were there.

It also means that the Eagles should have 21 of 22 starters available against the 49ers on Sunday, assuming Johnson (foot) makes his return. While Johnson is officially listed as questionable, things during the week have seemed to be trending toward a return.

Meanwhile, the 49ers have a lengthy injury report heading into this game:

Johnson (foot) was practicing again on Friday for the third straight day after missing the last seven weeks with a Lisfranc sprain he suffered on Nov. 16 against the Lions. Johnson has been limited the first two days of the week. In addition to Johnson, the other three players who were limited on Thursday — DT Jalen Carter (hip), TE Dallas Goedert (knee) and TE Grant Calcaterra (ankle) — were all practicing again too and none of them have game statuses.

The only starter who won't be available for the playoffs is rookie safety Drew Mukuba, who fractured his ankle in late November and needed surgery.

The Eagles’ health going into the playoffs, especially against a banged-up 49ers team, should not go unnoticed. They had 22 of 22 starters available for Super Bowl LVII and had 21 of 22 available for Super Bowl LIX last year. The Eagles, as an organization, are proud about how healthy they have been in recent seasons.

“There's two things that need to happen,” head coach Nick Sirianni said earlier this week. “You've got to have your players available, and you do different things to make sure that happens throughout the year, but it is so important that you continue to get better as the season goes on. I think our guys have a great balance and we do a good job of balancing that intensity at practice. There's no [lack] of intensity at practice; When we're out there, we're ripping it, but I think our guys know how to practice, they know how to practice efficiently. We've had a tendency of getting better while also having guys healthy. We continue to tweak the process of what we do. Great people in this building to help us make decisions. There's a lot that goes into that.

“Then you've got guys that are truly committed to this game because they love this game and they want to be the best versions [of] themselves they possibly can be. You could have all the resources in the world [and] if the guys aren't using them, it's for nothing.

The Chargers have a very balanced passing attack, with four receivers between 641 and 741 pass yards this season.
The Chargers and Patriots each rank in the top half of the league of rushing yards and yards per carry, but they've taken different routes to get there.
New England has leaned more on the run game down the stretch, with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson filling big roles.
Like the Chargers, the Patriots' run blocking has been spotty at times, but the return of Campbell last week boosted the offensive line.","Drake Maye turned in an MVP-caliber season in Year 2, meshing well with new offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, a revamped offensive line and a new cast of receivers. Maye's downfield touch and accuracy, along with his scrambling ability, has made New England's offense a bear to defend, racking up more than 300 yards in every game and scoring 23 or more points in their past 14 games. It's also impressive how Maye has avoided turnovers, with only 11 on the season -- three games with two turnovers, five games with one and nine with zero giveaways. Stefon Diggs is the go-to guy in key situations, and they're a bit thin at wide receiver with Mack Hollins out. But Maye has good options at tight end with Hunter Henry and Austin Hooper, and they've used RBs Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson more as pass catchers recently. Having left tackle Will Campbell back in Week 18 also appeared to upgrade the offensive line. The Chargers are mostly excellent defensively, with more INTs (19) than pass TDs allowed (16) in 2025. Coordinator Jesse Minter operates a disciplined, zone-heavy and opportunistic unit. He will try to confuse Maye by disguising coverage pre- and post-snap, and Los Angeles has a pass rush that can get home, led by Tuli Tuipulotu, Khalil Mack and Odafe Oweh -- all rested and ready to pursue. Safety Derwin James is an X-factor in the middle of the Chargers defense whom the Patriots must respect, although tight ends have done some damage against them late in the season.

Justin Herbert has been a miracle worker at times for the Chargers, finding ways to thrive in spite of injury and poor protection up front. He sat out Week 18, protecting his broken left hand, and now the question once again is how good his protection will be against New England. Jamaree Salyer, the team's third left tackle this season, sat out the past two games with a hamstring injury, though he's luckily off the injury report. The Patriots will need a disciplined rush; Herbert has been terrific outside the pocket as a thrower and scrambler, able to get out of trouble and sting defenses, but he also has been sacked three or more times in 10 of his 16 starts. The Patriots' sack percentage (6.64%, 20th) doesn't tell the whole story, as their pressure rate (35.9%, per Next Gen Stats) ranks 10th, and it's possible they get Harold Landry (knee; questionable) back. New England also has generally kept the big plays under wraps this season, allowing only 42 passes of 20-plus yards (tied for seventh-best) and only three plays of 40-plus (tied for second). The Chargers have a very balanced passing attack, with four receivers between 641 and 741 pass yards this season. Keep an eye on rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden II, who has shaky hands but explosive ability, especially against a New England defense that has struggled to contain good receivers at the position. The Patriots will give up some catches with their zone-heavy scheme, but between limiting explosive pass plays and having eyes on mobile quarterbacks, reducing their scramble potential, the Chargers might have to work their way up and down the field more gradually.

The Chargers and Patriots each rank in the top half of the league of rushing yards and yards per carry, but they've taken different routes to get there. The Chargers hope to have Omarion Hampton back from injury -- the running back is questionable due to an ankle injury but said he expected to play -- and Kimani Vidal has added a layer of explosiveness to the backfield. However, the blocking hasn't always allowed them to thrive consistently. Justin Herbert's scrambling has helped to give those rushing totals a cosmetic boost at times, too. The Patriots' run defense looks good on the stat sheet, allowing only 101.7 yards per game (sixth), but they've been carved up a bit late in the season by the likes of Breece Hall, Derrick Henry and James Cook. The return of defensive tackle Milton Williams appeared to help the run defense last week, and the Patriots are set to get linebacker Robert Spillane (foot) back from injury (though defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga will miss). New England has leaned more on the run game down the stretch, with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson filling big roles. Stevenson has been on a heater of late, averaging 9.6 yards per carry and scoring six TDs in his past four games, and Henderson is the big-play dynamo with four TDs of 50-plus yards this season. Like the Chargers, the Patriots' run blocking has been spotty at times, but the return of Campbell last week boosted the offensive line. The Chargers' run defense has been very good this season, with Saquon Barkley the last one to really hurt them back in Week 14, but the Patriots likely will be patient with the run game and keep pounding away, especially if they gain an early lead.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/snucdj6enzp0op5heg9v,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:31.186880

Can Robert Saleh's zombie crew keep the Eagles offense spiraling, or will Hurts & Co. get back on track to jumpstart their postseason run?","Sunday afternoon's bout at Lincoln Financial Field will feature two seasoned playoff opponents. Either the Eagles or 49ers have represented the NFC in the Super Bowl in each of the last three seasons (Eagles in 2024 and 2022; Niners in 2023).

The wild-card bout marks the playoff rematch of the 2022 NFC Championship Game. Hopefully, Brock Purdy can stay healthy for more than one series this time. On that day, the Niners QB tore his UCL on the first drive of the game, and the Eagles steamrolled to a 31-7 win. That game feels eons ago.

Sunday, both Philly and San Francisco enter with a host of questions.

Kyle Shanahan's club is a MASH unit, particularly on defense, after losing stars Nick Bosa, Fred Warner and many others, sapping the unit of its potency. Offensively, Trent Williams is dealing with a hamstring injury, and receiver Ricky Pearsall has been dealing with a PCL issue for the bulk of the season.

The Eagles have injury concerns of their own, most significantly along the offensive line, but the main question for the reigning Super Bowl champs is whether Nick Sirianni's offense can finally hit a groove heading into the postseason tournament after frustrating inconsistencies have plagued the unit all campaign. Does the offense have enough to beat good teams? The Eagles went 2-3 and averaged 19.4 points per game against teams with a .600+ win percentage in 2025. Against teams under .600, they went 9-3 and averaged 23.5 PPG.

The Eagles are 5-0 at home in the playoffs under Sirianni, 0-2 on the road and 1-1 in Super Bowls (neutral site). The 49ers have reached the NFC Championship Game in each season they have made the playoffs under Shanahan, and San Francisco is 6-0 in Wild Card/Divisional Round games since 2019.

1) Can the Eagles offense take advantage of a banged-up 49ers D?

The Eagles have scored 22.3 points per game in 2025 (19th in the NFL and the fewest in the Nick Sirianni era) and averaged 311.2 total yards per game (24th in the league and the third-fewest of any playoff team).

Given the names on the Eagles offense, the numbers are mind-numbing. An offense with Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith shouldn't be so easily slowed. Offensive line issues have been a major factor in the spiral, as the Eagles fell from the top unit last season. With Lane Johnson set to return and others getting rest last week, the hope is that Philly's blocking will improve during the playoff run.

The unimaginative offense run by Kevin Patullo has earned the ire of Philly fans. It's been particularly predictable in the passing attack, which averaged 194.3 pass yards per game, good for 23rd in the NFL and the second-fewest among playoff teams (Carolina, 179.3).

Inefficiencies on early downs and predictable passing routes led the Eagles offense to a league-high 28.1% three-and-out rate in 2025.

Hurts hasn't been the quarterback who steamrolled through the playoffs last year, with a trove of missed passes peppering his season. However, his ability to protect the football has been key to the Eagles' success in close games. Philly is 11-2 when Hurts doesn't have an interception this season (0-3 in games with one or more).

Fortunately for the Eagles, they'll face a Niners defense that struggles to get after the quarterback, ranking last in the NFL with 20 sacks and creating just six interceptions, tied for the second-fewest. San Francisco is the first team to make the playoffs in a season with 20 or fewer sacks and fewer than 10 INTs.

The 49ers' inability to disrupt the passer has left their secondary vulnerable. Since Week 5, San Francisco has allowed 358.6 yards per game, seventh-most in the NFL, and 253.2 passing yards per game, third-most. In the first four weeks of the season, the Niners allowed 280.5 yards per game and 165 pass yards per tilt.

Can Robert Saleh's zombie crew keep the Eagles offense spiraling, or will Hurts & Co. get back on track to jumpstart their postseason run?

2) High-powered 49ers offense vs. Eagles' menacing D

Upon Brock Purdy's return in Week 11, the Niners offense was a buzzsaw, averaging 35.7 points per game from Weeks 11-17, before getting waylaid by the top-seeded Seahawks in Week 18 sans all-world left tackle Trent Williams. Purdy ranks third in total TDs (19) and passer rating (105.6) since his return.

With the starter under center, the Niners offense is a blitzkrieg, able to dice up defenses with play-action over the middle and on intermediate routes. Using a diverse set of playmakers, from Christian McCaffrey out of the backfield to Jauan Jennings, Kendrick Bourne and Ricky Pearsall (when healthy), San Francisco's passing attack is lethal when it gets rolling. The 49ers went 23 consecutive drives without punting at one point down the stretch.

The key matchup Sunday will be tight end George Kittle against a stingy Eagles D. Purdy has a 140.6 passer rating when targeting the TE this season, tops of any duo with at least 40 connections. Seemingly, whenever Purdy gets into trouble or needs a big play, he looks for Kittle. That combination will be tested Sunday against an Eagles defense that has allowed the lowest passer rating on targets to tight ends this season (72.2).

Vic Fangio's defense has played at a championship level this season and has been particularly menacing since acquiring Jaelan Phillips at the trade deadline. Since Week 10, the Eagles have allowed 15.6 points per game, the fewest in the NFL.

It's a D with little weakness. Phillips and Jalen Carter can disrupt the passer, Zack Baun patrols the middle and corners Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are smothering. Mitchell has allowed a 41.7 completion percentage in coverage in 2025, tied for first in the NFL. DeJean, meanwhile, allowed just a 48.8 completion percentage defending the slot, the lowest in the league with a minimum of 30 slot targets. Philly has generated at least one takeaway in nine straight games and allowed a single passing TD over the past four tilts.

If there is one area to quibble with Fangio's unit, it's that the defense has been run on at times this season, allowing 124.4 rush yards per game, 22nd in the NFL. Will a Niners run game that hasn't been very efficient this season, ranking 24th with 106.9 yards per contest, be able to exploit that tender spot in an otherwise impenetrable dragon?

3) Which running back will blast off?

Saturday will mark the fourth playoff matchup all time between the previous two AP Offensive Player of the Year winners: Saquon Barkley won in 2024, Christian McCaffrey in 2023.

McCaffrey has been the 49ers' workhorse, leading the NFL with 413 touches this season, 44 more than any other player (Jonathan Taylor, 369). Returning from last season's injury, McCaffrey generated 1,202 rushing yards on 311 totes. The concern for the Niners' rushing attack has been consistency. McCaffrey generated just 3.9 yards per carry, the lowest in his career since his rookie campaign (3.7). The splash runs have been few and far between, with CMC earning just 11 rushes of 15-plus yards and three over 20 yards.

The best all-purpose weapon in football is a matchup nightmare. His 924 receiving yards on 102 catches gave McCaffrey 2,126 scrimmage yards this season, second in the NFL (Bijan Robinson, 2,298). CMC generated 12 games with 100-plus scrimmage yards, tied for the most in the NFL (James Cook), and 10 games with 100-plus scrimmage yards and at least one touchdown (most in the NFL). Philly allowed 639 receiving yards to running backs, seventh-most in the NFL, so expect Brock Purdy to look for CMC often on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Barkley, coming off a 2,005-yard 2024 season, didn't earn a Pro Bowl nod as the Eagles offense was stuck in the mud. The dynamo generated 1,140 rushing yards on 280 carries (4.1 YPC) with seven touchdowns. The big difference this season is that the massive runs have been absent from the offense. In 2024, Barkley earned 17 rushes of 20-plus yards and a whopping seven of 40-plus. In 2025, he had just four rushes of 20-plus yards and three going 40 or more yards. Part of the lack of explosives has been play-calling, and another is blocking concerns, with linemen not getting to the second level as regularly as they were a year ago.

Like many backs who lead the league in carries, as Barkley did a year ago with 345, things started slowly. From Weeks 1-13, the RB averaged 61.7 rushing yards per game, 3.7 yards per carry on 16.5 totes per tilt. However, he's found a groove in recent weeks. Over his past four games, Barkley has averaged 100.0 yards on 20.5 carries per game for a 4.9 yards per carry average. With Lane Johnson and others along the Eagles' line hopefully healthier, we could see a return of 2024 Barkley in the 2025 playoffs.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/rvz5r2omqikwe8t5jsjw,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:34.460678

The NFC North rivals split the season series, and the tape really tells a story. So, let's take a deeper look at both teams, using the previous games to place our top bets.

Matt Bowen breaks it down and offers his take, and Liz Loza, Pamela Maldonado, Eric Moody, Ben Solak and Seth Walder share their best bets, analysis and DFS plays to help you get in on the action.

Note: Odds provided by DraftKings Sportsbookand subject to change.

When the Packers have the ball

Bowen: I expect the Packers to be methodical in their approach, using the running game and taking the throws that are available when Jordan Love sees zone coverage. However, when the Bears play their man schemes, the Packers can cash in. In the Week 14 game, Love completed 9 of 13 passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns versus man coverage.

Edge: Packers.

Best bet: Christian Watson can create numbers on out routes and quicks, but we want to see the big throws that get him loose on deep over routes and posts. Watson has 80 or more yards receiving in three of his last five games, with 89 yards (on just four catches) versus Chicago in Week 14. Take Watson over 54.5 yards receiving (-113).

When the Bears have the ball

Bowen: Bears coach Ben Johnson wants to run the ball and deliver body punches in the second half of football games. We've seen it. But that also sets up quarterback Caleb Williams on play-action throws out of multiple-tight-end sets, and this Green Bay pass rush has declined sinceMicah Parsons'knee injury.

Edge:Bears.

Best bet: Colston Loveland has emerged as a priority target for Williams, catching at least six passes in back-to-back games. Plus, given the zone-heavy tendencies of the Packers defense, Loveland can operate as an underneath outlet and work the seams. I'm going Loveland over 4.5 receptions (+105).

Staff picks, best bets and props

Bears +1.5 (-112)

Maldonado:Chicago controls pace with the run game, forces turnovers at the highest rate in the league and closes games late. Green Bay moves the ball but struggles to finish drives, especially under pressure. The Bears' fourth-quarter edge makes them the side to take.

Caleb Williams 34+ pass attempts (+142)

Moody: Williams has averaged 34.5 pass attempts per game over his last 10 contests and recorded at least 34 attempts in both meetings against the Packers earlier this season. With these teams familiar with one another, this matchup has the potential to turn into a high-scoring game, especially with Green Bay dealing with multiple defensive injuries. The Bears will look to exploit this.

Williams UNDER 31.5 pass attempts (-112)

Solak: The Bears have had to dig their way out of two multi-score holes against Green Bay this season, and, accordingly, those two games have demanded 35 and 34 pass attempts from Williams. If this game, with a spread of only 1.5 remains a closer contest that allows Chicago to play their preferred style of offense, Williams won't need to drop back nearly as much. And with his receiver room returning to full health, more completions will become big gains, leading to fewer attempts overall.

Williams OVER 21.5 rushing yards (-112)

Loza:Williams averages 4.5 carries (QB16) and nearly 23 rushing yards per contest (QB8). He ripped off 30 rushing yards when he last faced a Parsons-less Packers defense in Week 16 (he had only 15 rushing yards at Green Bay, with Parsons on the field, in Week 14). Green Bay's defense has allowed an average of 32 rushing yards per game since Parsons was injured in Week 15. Williams should find some scrambling room and flirt with at least 25 rushing yards Saturday.

Montez Sweat UNDER 0.25 sacks (-140)

Walder: Sweat's 4.8% pass rush win rate ranks 50th out of 52 qualifying edge rushers. That's probably underselling his ability a little bit because it might not capture some of his pocket-pushing ability, but still, there's a reason why the Bears have struggled with their pass rush all year. But it gets worse. Jordan Love has just a 4.3% sack rate this season, seventh-lowest among quarterbacks. And while I'm making this bet either way, if Zach Tom is active, this bet becomes even more attractive. Tom, who Sweat figures to align opposite most often, ranks sixth in pass block win rate among tackles. My model prices this under at -233.

Daily fantasy tips for DraftKings Captain Showdown

Loza's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): D'Andre Swift ($13,800). The Bears recorded the fifth-most rushes over the regular season. Ben Johnson figures to stick to that script versus a banged-up Packers defense. Despite Kyle Monangai's emergence, Swift has remained the Chicago's RB1, averaging 15.5 touches per game and 13 fantasy points per contest from Weeks 10-18.

Also in my lineup: Colston Loveland ($6,400). The rookie has emerged over the back half of the regular season, drawing at least five looks in every game since Week 12. He also leads the team in red zone opportunities (13). Chicago's receiving corps can be tricky to predict, but Loveland's robust number of high-value targets make him a solid ceiling pick.

Maldonado's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): Caleb Williams ($15,900) has rushing upside with scramble ability. Even when his throwing accuracy wavers early, volume and four-quarter aggression create ceiling outcomes. His legs matter more than efficiency.

Also in my lineup: DJ Moore ($8,400)is Williams' first read in big spots. When pressure hits, targets funnel his way. Moore's role spikes late in the game, giving him a reliable floor with shots at scores.

Moody's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points):Kyle Monangai ($4,200) is a nice value option and comes at a lower cost than Swift. Monangai has put together an impressive rookie season, and while his usage has been inconsistent, Monangai is an explosive runner. The Packers' defensive front has struggled late in the regular season, and Monangai could find success running behind a Bears offensive line that finished fifth in run-block win rate.

Also in my lineup:Luther Burden III ($6,600) closed the regular season on a strong note, averaging 5.4 targets per game over his last seven games. He also flashed significant upside, highlighted by a 30.8-point performance in Week 17 against the 49ers. Whether or not Rome Odunze plays, Burden profiles as an excellent DFS value at this price.'

Solak's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): Josh Jacobs ($14,400). Expect ownership to come in low on Jacobs, who has been quiet for the last month as he's dealt with nagging injury. But he's off the injury report this week for the first time in over a month, and the Packers will look to run the football and shorten the game against a Bears offense that has struggled to consistently put up points against them in the first half. Should be a heavy volume day for a player most of the field passes on.

Also in my lineup: Colston Loveland ($6,400). Despite leading the Bears in target share over the back half of the season, Loveland is priced below all three of the Bears' starting receivers in showdown. I think the return of Rome Odunze and emergence of Luther Burden III will lead to more distributed production among the wideouts, while Loveland's role as a reliable stick-mover with red zone utility will go untouched. He'll be heavily owned, but rightfully so.

Walder's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): Jordan Love ($15,600). I think this is going to be a high-scoring, back-and-forth battle where the quarterbacks are going to put up big numbers. The reason? Pass protection. Both of these team rank in the top six in pass block win rate, the Bears rank 31st in pass rush win rate and the Packers are even worse than that if we only look at their pass rushing snaps without Micah Parsons on the field. Love, and his stats, will be the beneficiary.",https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2026/0108/r1598211_1296x729_16-9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-09 16:01:21.427872

For Purdy, Jones, Adrian Martinez and Kurtis Rourke, a favorite pastime is kicking around various conspiracy theories with Lombardi serving as de facto traffic cop.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- For six weeks from early October to mid-November, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy wasn't sure how his injured right big toe would feel when he woke up most mornings.

As the Niners began preparing for Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals, Purdy was finally ready to return. The only potential complication? Backup Mac Jones had not only kept the Niners afloat but thrived in Purdy's stead, leading the team to five wins in eight starts and leaving outside observers wondering whether he should continue starting.

Inside the 49ers' quarterback room, there was no such consternation. The job belonged to Purdy and, as long as he was healthy enough to play near the standard he'd set on his way to landing a five-year, $265 million contract in May, he would reclaim the role.

There was no need for emergency meetings or big declarations from coach Kyle Shanahan, quarterbacks coach Mick Lombardi or anyone else in the organization.

Early in the week, Purdy simply told Jones he was back. Jones responded by welcoming him back and launching into things he'd seen from Arizona's defense in the Week 3 game he started in Purdy's place.

""For me to be able to see that and feel that in a real way, I'll always be appreciative of that,"" Purdy told ESPN. ""Sometimes in this business you can make it weird. But he did not.""

That small moment set the 49ers on a course for big things as they finished 12-5, earned the NFC's No. 6 seed and now will face the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday (4:30 p.m. ET, Fox) in the wild-card round. None of it would have been possible without Jones and Purdy teaming up to form the league's best one-two quarterback tandem.

According to ESPN Research, the Niners are the first team to make the playoffs after having multiple quarterbacks start at least eight games each since the NFL expanded to eight divisions in 2002.

Buoyed by Shanahan's quarterback-friendly system and the fun-loving environment of the QB room and the locker room overall, Jones has resuscitated his career. Save for a rough Week 18 outing against Seattle, Purdy finished the regular season playing some of his best football after returning from injury. Together, they've thrown touchdowns, created personalized handshakes, discussed conspiracy theories and danced their way back to the postseason stage.

""We spend so much time together and it's such a long season and there's a lot of pressure situations, a lot of things you've got to talk about,"" Shanahan said. ""And when you're in a small room with people all year long, if you're irritated with each other, it makes the year a lot harder. ... It's been a really cool room.""

Neither Purdy nor Jones has played enough to merit award consideration, but their combined production resembles the résumé of a Most Valuable Player candidate.

Jones and Purdy started eight and nine games, respectively, and combined to rank fifth in the NFL in QBR (68.4) and passing yards (4,157), third in completion percentage (69.3%) and fourth in touchdown passes (33). The two -- who first met on Purdy's 2017 recruiting visit to Alabama when Jones was a redshirt freshman and occasionally throw together in Florida in the offseason -- enjoy that success because of their bond.

""When a starting quarterback goes down, sometimes that could be the season,"" Purdy said. ""He stepped right in and kept the ship rolling. ... It wasn't just 'Let's squeeze by' wins. He looked great doing it. And he's been ready still even since I came back.

""To have two guys who can go in and play at a high level, there's nothing better.""

JONES' JOURNEY TO San Francisco was more circuitous than many anticipated. After the Niners passed on him in favor of Trey Lance after trading up to the No. 3 pick in the 2021 NFL draft, Jones went to the New England Patriots. He played well as a rookie but struggled in his final two seasons there. He was then traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars for a 2024 sixth-round pick and was Trevor Lawrence's backup last season. Jones started seven games, including the final five when Lawrence went on injured reserve, and finished with a 36.6 QBR, which would have ranked 31st in the NFL had he qualified.

Entering free agency for the first time in March, Jones had some ideas about what he wanted. He prioritized practical matters including a proven quarterback system such as Shanahan's and the chance to learn from a successful signal-caller like Purdy.

Jones, who noticed that Sam Darnold's career revitalization had begun in San Francisco, touched base with Purdy about the possibility of teaming up during their shared offseason workouts in Jacksonville, where Jones is from and Purdy spends time working with throwing coaches Tom Gormely and Will Hewlett.

Beyond the X's and O's, Jones also wanted his third NFL stop to provide something his previous two hadn't: the chance to be himself and rediscover the joy he had playing football in college.

""You want to be the same guy you are on the field as you are off the field because if you have to change, it's not going to be good because you're thinking about things you're not supposed to think about,"" Jones said.

A post shared by San Francisco 49ers (@49ers)

Jones, who said he wasn't allowed to listen to music before games in previous NFL stops, found himself on social media searching for videos of the 49ers' Bumpboxx entrance on game days. He watched players such as left tackle Trent Williams leading the Niners out of the tunnel with hip-hop blaring from a speaker and pictured himself dancing near the front of the line.

""New England runs things different over there,"" said receiver Kendrick Bourne, who played with Jones in New England and now with the Niners. ""It's a different system. It's more militant. And here it's more relaxed. ... The Patriots taught us a lot, but here it allows you to prevail in who you are.""

A FaceTime call with Shanahan sealed Jones' decision. It was validated weeks later when, after a spring practice, Jones watched Shanahan break down film of that day's workout.

Jones sat in awe as Shanahan offered insight on all three phases of the game in painstaking detail. Jones eagerly took notes on all of it, saying he treated every day like a rookie starting from scratch in case his number was called.

Little did Jones know that just two games into the season, he would need to put that study to use.

Stepping in for an injured Purdy against New Orleans in Week 2 might have been a recipe for disaster for most backup quarterbacks in a new system. But Jones' approach, paired with the repeated message from Lombardi to embrace all that comes with playing the most high-pressure position in sports, allowed him to settle in quickly after a shaky first quarter.

Jones threw for 279 yards and three touchdowns in a win. Purdy would return two weeks later before aggravating the toe injury in a Week 4 loss to Jacksonville, opening the door for Jones to build on what he'd learned.

Williams gave Jones the invitation he'd wanted ever since he joined the 49ers, asking him to move to the front of the Bumpboxx line.

""You can just tell that's his vibe,"" Williams said. ""That's Mac. Mac has got a lot of flavor to him. ... I could see him itching to, he wanted to, he might as well.""

After eight starts, Jones ranked second in the NFL in passing yards per game (268.9), ninth in completion percentage (69.6%) and 10th in yards per attempt (7.4). His 63.8 QBR still ranks eighth among quarterbacks with at least eight starts.

The Niners went 5-3 with Jones, leaving them in the playoff mix with the backup reestablishing his value as a potential starter for another QB-needy team in 2026 should San Francisco receive a worthwhile trade offer. But because Jones signed a two-year, $7 million deal, the Niners have the option of keeping their quarterback depth in place for another year.

""I've put some thought into it, but I just feel like I want to finish this year really strong and not get distracted by things that are out of my control,"" Jones said. ""I definitely feel like I got the train back on the tracks, and I'm going to work very hard to continue that. I don't know what's going to happen, and I'm on a two-year deal, so that's really all I can say about it. But I do believe that I played good football, and the scary part is I can play even better. I believe that.""

WALK INTO THE 49ers' quarterback room during normal business hours and the conversation will almost certainly be a deep discussion of fundamentals, the game plan or an opponent. In the few minutes before those meetings start, there's no telling what the topic du jour will be.

""If we had a podcast in our quarterback room, we would definitely break the internet,"" Jones said, laughing. ""We're very focused on doing our job, but the first five, 10 minutes, sometimes we get a little wild.""

For Purdy, Jones, Adrian Martinez and Kurtis Rourke, a favorite pastime is kicking around various conspiracy theories with Lombardi serving as de facto traffic cop. The moon landing is a popular debate, not so much because anyone believes the conspiracies, but in the delicate ecosystem of the room, it's always important to have opposing viewpoints.

Shanahan even occasionally joins in the fun, offering stories from his coaching and playing career that can lighten the mood before everyone gets down to business. Rourke, a rookie seventh-round pick out of Indiana who is on the non-football injury list, said the group has talked about ""pretty much everything you could imagine"" in those pre-meeting discussions.

All of it is meant to provide levity to a job that requires plenty of monotony, and it creates a closeness that can bring joy in the tedium.

""The best way I can describe our room is it's more like a friend group rather than just a work group,"" Rourke said.

That has manifested in many ways this season. When Purdy was out and Jones was starting, Purdy stayed tuned into the playcalls, regularly offering his teammate tips on even the tiniest bit of minutiae.

During installation periods at practice, Purdy would notice things such as Jones using a cadence that wouldn't pair with a certain motion, a seemingly small matter that could throw off the timing of an entire play.

""He kind of would catch me,"" Jones said. ""A lot of guys, maybe they wouldn't have said something or whatever. They wouldn't have thought to think, 'Let's help this guy out a little bit and make sure that he's doing it how I did it so that it runs the same way.'""

According to Purdy, that has been a two-way street with Jones finding ways to help him, too. Whether it's offering insights on how certain coordinators like to defend certain plays or Jones ensuring that Purdy is properly hydrated, he has jumped back into the supporting role headfirst.

When the 49ers beat the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 22, Jones checked that Purdy, who was playing through a triple-digit fever, the chills and sinus issues, was drinking plenty of fluids and taking IVs. Purdy threw for 295 yards and five touchdowns in what Jones jokingly called his ""flu game.""

""We've gotten along great in terms of having each other's backs,"" Purdy said. ""Our relationship is legit and real and authentic in terms of building each other up.""

The dynamic extends to Rourke and Martinez, too. Rourke, who is out for the year with a knee injury suffered in college, has watched Purdy closely, noting that the starter has carved out a successful path despite being the last pick in the draft.

Jones has done similar for Martinez, who has bounced around various practice squads and the UFL since going undrafted out of Kansas State in 2022. Late in a Nov. 2 win against the New York Giants, Jones pulled himself from the game, approaching Martinez on the sideline and telling him to go in. Martinez kneeled out the clock, logging his first regular-season snap.

""He didn't have to do that,"" Martinez said. ""And for me to get my first snap in that way, I mean, it meant a lot. He just kind of made the call and I was ready to go.""

LATE IN THE third quarter of the Niners' Nov. 30 win against the Cleveland Browns, Purdy faked a handoff to running back Christian McCaffrey and raced off the left side for a 2-yard touchdown. Purdy immediately dropped the ball and broke out the Dougie, the dance named for 1980s rapper Doug E. Fresh and brought back into the mainstream by the 2010 song from Cali Swag District ""Teach Me How to Dougie.""

Purdy has never shied away from celebrations, but dancing had rarely been part of the repertoire. As it turns out, Purdy has long annoyed his wife, Jenna, by regularly practicing in their kitchen, but never did it out on the field. In the following weeks, Purdy made it a staple, drawing laughter and support from teammates.

""When you see a quarterback that can get the tedious work done and be super serious, but then when we're successful let his hair down and celebrate a little bit, it's not something that you come across too often,"" Williams said. ""It energizes everyone else.""

In Purdy's case, it shows not only that there has been much to celebrate but also that he feels comfortable and confident after the injury.

Since Purdy took over as San Francisco's starter in 2022, the only quarterback in the NFL with a better QBR than his 69.8 is Buffalo's Josh Allen. Before the season finale against Seattle, teammates believed Purdy was playing his best football since returning, and that confidence remains entering the postseason. That he has done it without the usual cast of household names next to him, save for McCaffrey and tight end George Kittle, only bolsters that confidence.

In San Francisco's final seven games, Purdy ranked fourth in QBR and ninth in passing yards per game, and he accounted for 19 total touchdowns, third most in that span. Those numbers came despite a three-interception performance against the Carolina Panthers and a 22.8 QBR against Seattle, the fifth worst for a game in his career. The Niners went 6-1 in that stretch and locked up the playoff berth.

""He's a special football player,"" McCaffrey said. ""He's one of the best quarterbacks in the league and somebody who can make a play on any given snap. He's grown in the sense that now he might be a little more comfortable dancing and all that stuff.""

For the 49ers to make a run in the postseason, Purdy and the offense will have to bounce back from their season-ending stinker against Seattle. Without defensive ends Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams, and linebacker Fred Warner (at least for now), the defense is just trying to hold it together. It's Purdy & Co. who will be asked to carry the freight for any deep playoff run.

Should Purdy have a setback, Jones is staying prepared. Either way, the two quarterbacks their teammates call ""Glock Purdy"" and ""Mac-10"" (Jones and Purdy provided the offensive line with T-shirts with those monikers and have a custom handshake with each other paying homage to the nicknames), will be leading the way and leaning on each other.

What happens after the season remains to be seen but neither quarterback wants this ride to end any time soon.

""People ask me about it, I get it,"" Jones said. ""But at the same time, I'm dialed in. I love the guys here and don't want to be a distraction. I know that I possibly could be needed at a very critical part of the season, and so your job as the backup quarterback is to save the season. If I have to do that, I know I'm going to be ready.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0108%2Fr1598062_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 10:00:43.664321

The Giants finished 13th in total offense (333.5 ypg), 17th in points per game (22.4).","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- One of the final players to make it into the locker room before the New York Giants closed out their 2025 season last Sunday was injured wide receiver Malik Nabers.

He was moving slowly with a single crutch tucked underneath his right arm pit. His right knee was held in place by a bulky brace.

It was a little bit jarring to see Nabers like this 9+ weeks after surgery.

""I had a lot messed up in my knee,"" Nabers said the day following the injury.

But the talented wide receiver who was injured in Week 4 against the Los Angeles Chargers insists he's doing well. The outlook is positive.

""Successfully healed. Successfully operated on,"" Nabers said. ""But it's going to take a little bit of time for everybody. My injury is different from somebody else. My body reacts different.

""I was walking with a cane before I could see a doctor. Then they told me I could get off it. So now I don't got to do it. Just taking precautions to make sure the injury is healed.""

Nabers admitted originally it was a hard pill to swallow. After exploding onto the scene with 1,204 receiving yards as a rookie, he didn't make it through his first game with rookie Jaxson Dart at quarterback.

It forced some introspection.

""It's tough. It's hard. For myself, I needed this,"" Nabers said. ""I needed to get back to where I once was. Get that hunger. It's a blessing in disguise that I don't really see yet. I had a talk with (quarterback) Jameis (Winston) and I kept asking him, 'Why did it happen to me? Why did it happen to me?' And he said, 'Why not you? Why not go back to the bottom and find your way back to the top?'

""I'm taking that in my mind, taking that in my head and attacking rehab as much as I can. Doing what I can.""

Now the question is when Nabers will be healthy enough to get back on the field. Right now, that is unknown, even if the start of the regular season is 11 months post-surgery.

He wasn't ready in early January to commit to Week 1.

""Not really sure,"" he said of his expected return. ""If my body doesn't feel right, then I'm not going to go out there.""

While Nabers isn't quite sure when he's going to be back, rookie running back Cam Skattebo is aiming at the summer.

""Training camp for sure is the goal,"" Skattebo said on Monday.

Skattebo suffered an open tibia fracture, ruptured deltoid ligament and dislocated his right ankle in October against the Philadelphia Eagles. But he's already been seen jogging in the team facility and says his rehab is on track.

Right now, it's all about getting full movement back in his foot. That's not so easy given the extent of the injury.

""Getting my dorsiflexion in the foot is the main thing obviously,"" Skattebo said. ""I was stuck in a boot for eight weeks. Just strengthening it up. I broke my bone and dislocated my ankle. So anything you can imagine to get the ankle moving again is what I have to get up.""

That the injury wasn't worse considering how it looked is incredible. Skattebo, however, said he tried to get up and didn't really feel the pain when it was first injured. By the time he was in the X-ray room, it was already back in place.

There isn't a doubt in the mind of the fourth-round pick out of Arizona State that he will return to the same level.

""That's not even a question,"" Skattebo said. ""I'm going to be back. I played seven games in the NFL and I got hurt. There's a long road ahead but that is not going to stop me.""

The Giants finished 13th in total offense (333.5 ypg), 17th in points per game (22.4). They were 28th in total defense (359.5 ypg) and 26th in points per game allowed (25.8). Nobody would have predicted that split at the start of the season.

The offense was supposed to be the concern, but it was the defense that was a disappointment. There is no way around it considering the money and assets invested. The Giants' two most expensive free agent signings were on that side of the ball along with their top draft pick (Abdul Carter third overall).

Now the defense did improve dramatically over the final five games under interim coordinator Charlie Bullen. They were 10th in total defense during that time allowing 298.4 yards per game, one spot ahead of the Houston Texans and one behind the Denver Broncos.

Based on the results and the talent, there seems to be a belief that the problem was in the coaching. General manager Joe Schoen even pointed out that the talent on that side should be enticing for whoever takes over.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0107%2Fr1597736_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 09:00:30.188418

(5) Rams at (4) Panthers

Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET | Fox | LAR -10.5 (46.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Rams: Los Angeles is expecting WR Davante Adams to return. He has not played since aggravating a left hamstring injury in Week 15. The Rams have missed him most in the red zone, as nine of his league-leading 14 receiving touchdowns have come in goal-to-go situations. According to ESPN Research, the Panthers have allowed only five passing touchdowns in goal-to-go situations this season, which is tied for the fewest in the NFL. ""[Adams is] such a great player,"" QB Matthew Stafford said. ""I just have to put it in the ballpark and let him go do his thing."" -- Sarah Barshop

What we're hearing on the Panthers: As big as this game is for QB Bryce Young, it's bigger for the running game that had 19 yards last week and only 99 the week before. Carolina needs the balance it had in its Week 13 win over the Rams, in which the Panthers ran 40 times for 164 yards. That opened it up for Young, who had three TD passes -- including two on fourth-and-short. -- David Newton

Stat to know: The Rams rank second in run block win rate (74.1%), while the Panthers are 32nd in run stop win rate (26.2%) and 26th in EPA allowed per designed run. It all sets up for a game where the Rams won't have to take as many risks because they should have success on the ground with Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. But they will be without Kevin Dotson (ankle injury), who ranks 24th out of 62 qualifying guards in run block win rate. -- Walder

Bold prediction: Panthers WR Tetairoa McMillan will go off for 100-plus yards in his first career postseason game. McMillan had only one catch for 43 yards in the first contest against the Rams as the Panthers ran the ball a ton. But on a trailing script in this game, he'll shine. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Panthers WR Jalen Coker. He has a touchdown catch in three of his past five games, including one in Carolina's win over the Rams. If the Panthers are going to upset L.A., Coker will have to create explosive plays as a boundary target for Young. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: OVER 46.5. The over cashes if Carolina scores early and forces a competitive game. The Rams can score 30-plus, while any early Panthers success prevents coach Sean McVay from slowing the tempo. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: The Rams have been one of the NFL's least penalized teams over the past six seasons, and in 2025, they committed the fewest in the league (5.5 per game). Referee Clete Blakeman's crew threw an average of 14.4 flags per game. -- Seifert

(7) Packers at (2) Bears

Saturday, 8 p.m. ET | Prime Video | GB -1.5 (45.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Packers: Green Bay has the advantage in playoff experience. The Packers are in for the third straight season, although they've won just one game of their previous two appearances. ""You still go out there and get beat regardless of if you got hella experience or not,"" safety and defensive captain Xavier McKinney said. Coach Matt LaFleur said, ""Ultimately, it's about what you do on that day."" -- Rob Demovsky

What we're hearing on the Bears: Chicago wants to avoid another slow offensive start after getting outscored 47-21, running 66 fewer plays, losing the time of possession battle by 10:43 and going 2-for-12 on third downs in the first halves of their past three games. It has been an especially common trend against the Packers this season (Chicago trailed 14-3 and 6-0 at halftime in both regular-season games). ""The biggest thing with us playing complementary football is us getting out to that fast start, having urgency right from the first snap and being able to go out and execute the plan, execute the openers and be able to go put points on the board,"" offensive coordinator Declan Doyle said. -- Courtney Cronin

Stat to know: Both QBs should have all the time they need. The Bears lead the league in pass block win rate (73.6%), and on plays without Micah Parsons on the field, the Packers have just a 28.1% pass rush win rate. On the flip side, the Bears also have almost zero pass rush (28.8% PRWR, 31st) while the Packers rank sixth in pass block win rate (69%). -- Walder

Bold prediction: The Bears will hit a trick play on the first drive. They almost had one against the Packers in Week 16 -- a fourth-and-goal direct snap to RB Kyle Monangai that went over his head. Johnson will have another wrinkle for his first postseason game as coach, and Chicago needs to get out to a faster start in this game. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Bears TE Colston Loveland. He has topped 90 receiving yards in each of his past two games. He has the alignment versatility to work multiple levels of the field in coach Ben Johnson's offense. Look for Loveland to see steady volume from QB Caleb Williams versus the Packers' zone-heavy defense. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: Bears +1.5. Chicago runs efficiently, forces turnovers and closes better late. Green Bay moves the ball but stalls when it matters. Take the team built to survive discomfort. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: Referee Adrian Hill missed two games because of a leg injury, but overall, his crew threw the second-most flags among the 17 crews (17.9). The Bears led the NFL with nine flags for roughing the passer, four more than the next team, but Hill's crew called only three such penalties. -- Seifert

(6) Bills at (3) Jaguars

Sunday, 1 p.m. ET | CBS | BUF -1.5 (45.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Bills: Coach Sean McDermott has never won a road playoff game in his Bills tenure (0-5). In the four games with QB Josh Allen, the Bills' defense has been the statistical difference on the road versus at home (33.5 points per game allowed on the road and 19.8 allowed at home). The team is embracing this challenge. ""Being able to just have that mentality of it's you and your guys versus everybody else. We embrace that, and I mean, we're excited. We could play anywhere,"" DE Greg Rousseau said. -- Alaina Getzenberg

What we're hearing on the Jaguars: The headlines might be about the QBs, but this game likely will be decided on the ground: the Jaguars' top-ranked run defense versus the league's leading rusher in James Cook III. The Jaguars didn't allow a 100-yard rusher in the regular season. ""It's a challenge at every level of the defense, and the running back obviously is elite,"" defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile said. ""Cook does a tremendous job of finding cracks. You look at some of the stuff on tape, there's nowhere to go, and he pops through there."" -- Mike DiRocco

Stat to know: The Jaguars have a 67.8% pass block win rate, which ranks ninth best but is by far the best for a Jaguars team with QB Trevor Lawrence under center. A part of that solution? Cole Van Lanen, who took over at LT in Week 13 and has a 92% pass block win rate, which is 22nd best at the position and an upgrade over Walker Little. -- Walder

Bold prediction: Bills WR Gabe Davis, who played for the Jags in 2024, will score a touchdown in his revenge game. The Bills use Davis as a short-yardage and red zone threat because of his 6-foot-2, 225-pound frame. If they can't run the ball in and need to drop back, Davis will be Allen's preferred target. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Bills CB Taron Johnson. His ability to get to depth in Buffalo's foundational zone coverages is key versus a Jaguars passing game that features deep in-breaking concepts. Here, Johnson can close the intermediate windows, which will limit Lawrence's explosive play ability. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: UNDER 51.5. Buffalo allows the fewest opponent plays per game and has a run-heavy offense. The Jaguars' offense is efficient but not fast. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: Referee Brad Allen's crew threw the fewest flags per game this season (12.9). That could help the Jaguars, who were the NFL's third-most penalized team (9.3 per game). The Bills were tied for the sixth fewest at 6.8 per game. -- Seifert

Injuries: Bills | Jaguars

Maldonado's pick: Bills 27, Jaguars 20

Moody's pick: Jaguars 31, Bills 27

Solak's pick: Jaguars 23, Bills 21

(6) 49ers at (3) Eagles

Sunday, 4:30 p.m. ET | Fox | PHI -4.5 (44.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the 49ers: In an alternate universe, Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio would be working with coach Kyle Shanahan. Fangio spent time with the 49ers during the 2022 offseason, and Shanahan planned to hire him when all signs pointed to DeMeco Ryans leaving (he did to Houston). But Fangio signed with Miami in 2023, then joined the Eagles in 2024. Now, Shanahan faces the task of scoring against a Fangio-led defense that ranks fifth in points allowed per game (19.1). ""[Fangio], schematically, he has always been the best to me,"" Shanahan said. ""... Has a very sound scheme that he doesn't need to change up very much. It just naturally changes with how he does his coverages, how he does his fronts, the personnel groupings he does. He's very good at getting a beat on what you're trying to do and making you adjust."" -- Nick Wagoner

What we're hearing on the Eagles: Philadelphia was equally respectful toward Shanahan. Fangio was complimentary of Shanahan's scheme and his ability to call plays, and noted how ""everything's packaged well together"" and is purposeful on offense for San Francisco. The 49ers use motion on 70% of their offensive plays, the third most in the NFL. ""It's an offense that challenges your eyes and your discipline,"" LB Jaelan Phillips said. ""If you let all of the moving pieces affect you, that's when they take advantage of people."" -- Tim McManus

Stat to know: Since Week 7 -- the week after LB Fred Warner's ankle injury -- the 49ers are allowing opponents a 47% success rate on designed runs (third highest). Though the Eagles haven't been nearly as successful on the ground this season as they were in 2024, San Francisco's defense could present the opportunity for RB Saquon Barkley to have a big game. -- Walder

Bold prediction: Niners DE Bryce Huff will get a key sack. Huff is the 49ers' best shot at edge pressure, and he has a quick first step that can challenge Eagles LT Jordan Mailata. Huff has been struggling mightily as of late but expect an impassioned performance here. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Eagles S Reed Blankenship. He will be asked to play a two-way role in the secondary, limiting the middle-of-the-field targets in the 49ers' route tree, while also filling the alleys to cut off RB Christian McCaffrey in the run game. Blankenship had 53 solo tackles and one interception this season. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: 49ers QB Brock Purdy UNDER 1.5 passing touchdowns. The Eagles allow a league-low passing touchdown rate. And Fangio defenses historically suppress red zone passing efficiency, supporting Purdy's under. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: The 49ers were the second-least penalized team in the NFL (six per game), but they're tied for the most flags for unnecessary roughness (10). Overall, referee Alan Eck's crew threw the NFL's second-fewest flags per game this season (13). -- Seifert

Injuries: 49ers | Eagles

Maldonado's pick: Eagles 24, 49ers 20

Moody's pick: 49ers 20, Eagles 17

Solak's pick: 49ers 24, Eagles 17

(7) Chargers at (2) Patriots

Sunday, 8 p.m. ET | NBC/Peacock | NE -3.5 (46.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Chargers: QB Justin Herbert has been playing through a fractured left hand since Week 13, but he said this week that his hand feels the best it has since the injury. Herbert and other key starters rested in Week 18, a decision he said proved beneficial. ""I'd say definitely not taking hits on it last week was probably pretty helpful,"" he said. -- Kris Rhim

What we're hearing on the Patriots: QB Drake Maye said the Chargers don't allow many explosive plays by keeping everything in front of them, and that they are a top-five defense in forcing three-and-outs. So a point of emphasis for the Patriots is to sustain drives and then capitalize on one-on-one matchups. ""One-on-one, I like our guys. Ball placement, I like giving them a chance to go make a play. At the same time, be patient. Don't be bored being efficient and executing underneath and letting things come to you,"" Maye said of the approach against the Chargers. -- Mike Reiss

Stat to know: The Patriots' average of 8.7 air yards per attempt ranks second most in the NFL. But that makes for an interesting matchup against the Chargers' defense, which allows opponents just 5.0 air yards per attempt (third lowest). Los Angeles achieves that by being the most two-high heavy (57%) defense and the league's most zone-heavy defense (70%). -- Walder

Bold prediction: Chargers RB Omarion Hampton will shine on 20-plus carries and 100-plus yards against a poor Patriots run defense, especially if DT Khyiris Tonga (foot) can't go. The Chargers need to run the ball to protect their offensive line and control pace, and Hampton has looked good since returning from his ankle injury. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Patriots TE Hunter Henry. His ability to uncover and work the seams gives the Patriots an edge in the red zone. Henry has five red zone touchdown receptions this season, including two in his past three games. He should be a priority target for Maye. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: Patriots -3.5. New England is top five in point differential, points per drive on offense and defensive points allowed per drive. Since Week 10, the Chargers' offense ranks bottom three in yards per play, success rate, explosive play rate and points per drive. That gap supports the margin. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: Patriots CB Carlton Davis III was flagged six times for defensive pass interference, second most in the regular season. But the Chargers haven't been great at drawing pass interference and have had only four called against their opponents, second lowest. -- Seifert

Injuries: Chargers | Patriots

Maldonado's pick: Patriots 24, Chargers 17

Moody's pick: Patriots 27, Chargers 24

Solak's pick: Patriots 20, Chargers 14

Walder's pick: Patriots 26, Chargers 23

(5) Texans at (4) Steelers

Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET | ESPN/ABC | HOU -3 (39.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Texans: Coach DeMeco Ryans has the utmost respect for Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin, saying he has ""done it for a long time"" and pointing out how Tomlin sends encouragement his way. However, based on Monday's news conference, Ryans will use the heavily slanted coverage toward the Steelers as a rally cry. He showed slight annoyance at the number of questions he received about Pittsburgh by sarcastically saying, ""Y'all excited about the Steelers."" In the 2024 playoffs, he used the pro-Chargers coverage as motivation for the team before its 32-12 win in the wild-card round. -- DJ Bien-Aime

What we're hearing on the Steelers: The offensive line will face its greatest challenge of the season in the pass-rush tandem of Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter (29.5 sacks combined). ""Both of them just present major threats,"" LT Dylan Cook said. ""It's more so their changeups. We all know they're kind of power guys, but they both have really good spin moves. They both have really good motors, good hand usage."" The line has played well since Cook joined the group a month ago, giving up only two sacks in each of the past three games. -- Brooke Pryor

Stat to know: There is perhaps no game more relevant for the Steelers' ultra-quick average time to throw of 2.62 seconds (fastest in the NFL) than this one. That's because of the edge rushers they are facing: Anderson recorded 62 pass rush wins this season (second most), and Hunter delivers plenty of disruption as well. Pittsburgh might be uniquely suited to mitigate that threat because of Rodgers' quick release -- though standout DBs Derek Stingley Jr., Kamari Lassiter and Jalen Pitre will surely know that, too. -- Walder

Bold prediction: The Steelers will get shut out in the first half. There's so much hype for the Texans' pass rush, but it's the secondary's ability to create turnovers and minimize YAC that will lead to quick three-and-outs in this one. Houston can sustain long drives to control the clock, too. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Anderson. He can play a difference-making role, setting an edge to limit the Steelers' outside zone run game, while also creating chaos as a pass rusher to disrupt Rodgers' rhythm. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: Texans -3. The Texans allow the second-lowest points per drive and force the most field goals per drive. Pittsburgh can score only with short fields, so the cleaner defense will cover in this game. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: The outcome of this game could depend on whether the Steelers can keep the Texans' pass rush off Rodgers. But he has helped the Steelers avoid harmful holding penalties by getting the ball out quick. They were flagged only 14 times for it, tied for the second fewest this season. -- Seifert

Injuries: Texans | Steelers

Maldonado's pick: Texans 23, Steelers 20

Moody's pick: Texans 21, Steelers 17

Solak's pick: Texans 24, Steelers 13

Quentin Lake made 23 tackles in his first three playoff games, and he believes that the Rams’ experience will matter in Charlotte and beyond.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — When the Los Angeles Rams lost Quentin Lake to a dislocated elbow in mid-November, their defense suffered and slumped.

Lake is returning for the wild-card round, and the Rams (12-5) are hoping he’s a key to a long playoff run.

As for Lake himself, he’s just eager to get back to work as the do-it-all defensive back who has become the unlikely engine driving a precocious young defense.

“I’m ready to go throw my elbow in there, have fun, fly around and help this team win again,” Lake said Thursday.

After several weeks to recover from surgery, Lake will be back in uniform when the Rams visit the Carolina Panthers (8-9) on Saturday in the first game of the NFL postseason. He wasn’t in uniform Nov. 30 when the Rams made their first trip to Charlotte, and his absence was felt in that game — and in every game the Rams have played since he went down nearly two months ago.

“He’s got this presence where you just feel better,” coach Sean McVay said.

Lake’s job is big and complicated, but the former sixth-round pick from UCLA has grown into the role filled by Jalen Ramsey during Los Angeles’ Super Bowl championship run four years ago.

Lake usually plays the “star” position in the schemes utilized by McVay and his past three defensive coordinators. The job requires him to line up frequently as a slot cornerback in coverage, but also to contribute heavily to the Rams’ run defense in the box.

He earns his “Captain Q” nickname by leading the defense on the field, making sure his teammates on the NFL’s least expensive defense are lined up correctly — and keeping a cool head amid the late-game pressure that will only be ratcheted up in the postseason.

“It’s extremely important,” defensive coordinator Chris Shula said of Lake’s return. “He’s a great player, whether you’re just talking about scheme-wise or all the things that he does for us. Really what he brings to the team as far as from a physicality, from communication and the questions he’s asking, it’s awesome to have him back.”

Lake’s importance can be measured by what happened while he was out.

The Rams fell to the bottom quarter of the NFL in scoring defense, yards allowed per play and big plays allowed, among several metrics. Los Angeles yielded 28 points per game in its final six outings, dropping the defense into the middle of the pack in the final NFL standings.

Lake showed his leadership qualities when asked about the Rams’ defensive play during his absence. Los Angeles went 3-3 in its final six games.

“We had a lot of guys come in for my spot that did great things,” Lake said. “At the same time, my job is, how can I come back and really help this team? That’s it. I don’t really look at, hey, what was happening when I was out, what wasn’t happening, the difference between when I was in and when I wasn’t. I was just focused on getting back, and luckily the team gave me a shot to come back and play meaningful football.”

Lake has known about big-time football pressure his whole life: His father, Carnell, played on several playoff teams and reached the Super Bowl during his decade as a dominant defensive back for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Quentin Lake made 23 tackles in his first three playoff games, and he believes that the Rams’ experience will matter in Charlotte and beyond.

“The playoff atmosphere is amazing,” Lake said. “Guys either rise to the occasion, or they sink to the level of their training, and I know we have a lot of guys that are built for it. Guys that when the pressure and the moment is big, they rise to the occasion.”

NOTES: RG Kevin Dotson has been ruled out this week due to his injured ankle, an absence that compromises the Rams’ rushing attack and overall offensive structure. Dotson got hurt when Seahawks LB Derick Hall stepped on him last month, earning a one-game suspension. The game in Carolina will be the third straight missed by Dotson. … Rookie TE Terrance Ferguson is questionable for Saturday after injuring his hamstring in practice last week, but he participated in parts of Thursday’s practice after missing the first two workouts this week. … CB Josh Wallace (ankle) is also questionable.

In other injury news, linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga (concussion) and defensive end Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (concussion) were also ruled out.
Here’s the full Bears injury report:","LAKE FOREST, Ill. — Bears slot cornerback C.J. Gardner-Johnson suffered a concussion during a Week 18 loss to the Detroit Lions. The veteran was down on the field for a while, and then skipped the sideline injury tent and headed straight for the home locker room. He hasn’t been on a football field since.

He missed the entire practice leading up to Saturday’s NFC wild-card round playoff against the Green Bay Packers, so it was no shock to see him ruled out on the official Bears injury report.

The Bears are fortunate to a reinforcement working his way back to action. Kyler Gordon was designated to return from his second injured-reserve stint on Monday and he worked through through each part of the practice week. Offensive lineman Braxton Jones, also designated to return of IR, is questionable.

He was formally listed as questionable, standard procedure for players on IR even when the plan is to activate him before kickoff.

Receiver Rome Odunze will return after five games missed with a foot injury. He did not receive an injury designation. Neither did receiver DJ Moore (knee) or offensive tackle Ozzy Trapilo (quad) who were limited this week.

Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen said Gordon is part of the plan for Saturday, though the Bears needed to see how Gordon would respond to practice activity. He dealt with a hamstring injury earlier in the season, but a groin issue has sidelined him lately. He was set to return prior to the Week 14 contest at Green Bay during pregame warmups.

In other injury news, linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga (concussion) and defensive end Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (concussion) were also ruled out.

A 1-0 Flyers lead, thanks to a goal from Konecny in the first minute of the second period, eventually evaporated.
Tocchet didn’t offer any insight into when either of those two could return, either, when pressed for an update Thursday morning.
Emil Andrae, relegated to the Phantoms to start the season, has returned and played a generally steady game on the blue line.
“It’s just next man up right now,” Owen Tippett said, “and we’ve got to find energy and find ways to win.”","PHILADELPHIA — The circumstances under which Travis Konecny exited the Philadelphia Flyers’ 2-1 overtime loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday night at Xfinity Mobile Arena were peculiar. Konecny was on the ice as the buzzer sounded to end the second period and even did the intermission interview with NBC Sports Philadelphia’s Ashlyn Sullivan moments later.

Then he entered the Flyers dressing room. He didn’t come back out. A 1-0 Flyers lead, thanks to a goal from Konecny in the first minute of the second period, eventually evaporated.

Coach Rick Tocchet explained what happened with Konecny. Kind of.

“Something was bugging him, I guess, early on,” Tocchet said. “I think he fell, or something. I don’t know the whole details.”

Konecny did appear to come into contact with one of the on-ice officials before the game began, but nothing appeared off when the puck dropped. After a scoreless (and low-event) first period, Konecny got open in the high slot early in the second, received a pass from Christian Dvorak and flicked a top-shelf wrister past Dennis Hildeby to give the Flyers a 1-0 lead just 55 seconds in. It was the game’s only goal for the first 54 minutes.

Konecny has been hot lately. In the last 19 games, he’s the Flyers’ leading scorer with 21 points (nine goals, 12 assists), shaking off a rough start in which he was turning the puck over far too often while trying to learn the intricacies of what Tocchet wanted him to do when he or his teammates had the puck.

“He would just pass it into piles of people. … Now, I just feel he’s making better decisions,” Tocchet said Wednesday at practice.

Not having Konecny for any amount of time would be a substantial blow, particularly on top of the Flyers’ already missing two other key players — winger Bobby Brink and defenseman Jamie Drysdale — who both suffered concussions Tuesday night in the Flyers’ 5-2 win over the Anaheim Ducks. Tocchet didn’t offer any insight into when either of those two could return, either, when pressed for an update Thursday morning.

The sprint to the Olympic break in February is on. Philadelphia has 14 more games in 27 days, beginning with Saturday’s match against the Tampa Bay Lightning. It’s a stretch that could make or break their season. How they handle these absences, however long they might last, will be vital.

“The depth is going to get challenged,” Tocchet said, speaking as if he expects the Flyers to be short-handed for at least a little while longer. “Stay with the structure, things like that. It’s really the next-guy-up mentality. You hear it all the time, but it’s true.”

Fortunately for the coach, getting contributions from depth players is one of the reasons the Flyers have remained in the thick of the playoff race with a 22-12-8 mark, including a 5-2-1 record in their last eight.

Denver Barkey, recalled from the Phantoms last month, played in his ninth straight game and nearly converted a breakaway chance in the first period Thursday, hitting the crossbar. He continues to look like an NHL player. Carl Grundstrom, essentially given away by the San Jose Sharks in an October trade, has seven goals and has become a key penalty killer lately, too. Emil Andrae, relegated to the Phantoms to start the season, has returned and played a generally steady game on the blue line.

Other depth guys seem to be trending in the right direction, too. After a nightmarish first half of the season, Garnet Hathaway has looked rejuvenated since re-entering the lineup Jan. 3. He threw a pair of devastating hits in the Anaheim game and, on Thursday against the Maple Leafs, put together an outstanding shift on the penalty kill in which he prevented Toronto from moving the puck through the neutral zone. He later sold out to block an Oliver Ekman-Larsson shot in which the blade of his skate popped off upon impact with the puck. Travis Sanheim had to help Hathaway get back to the bench on one foot.

“I can’t go back and change the first half. I wish I could, but I can’t,” said Hathaway, who is still scoreless in 36 games. “I’m trying to go day by day. I’m trying to help this team win games, be productive. I think the last few games I’ve played to my identity more than I have before that, and that’s what I need to rely on.”

Another player popping lately is rookie Nikita Grebenkin. He was effective in the Ducks game, scoring an empty net goal that put the game away, assisting on a Cam York score in the second period and recording three shots on goal. He was noticeable again on Thursday while playing against his former team, too.

Tocchet has been impressed.

“Played hard. Played really hard,” Tocchet said of Grebenkin. “He was moving his feet. He had a lot of motion tonight. I thought he played really well.”

Said Hathaway: “We have a deep team. We have guys that have contributed when they get in, up and down the lineup. You can’t replicate those guys we’re missing with one player.”

Still, if the Flyers are going to survive, something that will have to drastically improve is the power play, which entered the evening 30th in the NHL. They went 0-for-3 against Toronto, two of which came in the third period when they could have salted the game away, including nearly a minute of five-on-three time with less than eight minutes to go.

Instead, Sanheim’s missed shot resulted in a short-handed rush the other way after it became a five-on-four, and Scott Laughton, playing in his first game as a visiting player in Philadelphia, ripped a shot past Dan Vladar to tie the score at 1. Easton Cowan’s overtime winner on a two-on-one earned the Leafs the extra point.

“Keep trying to get better each day and hope that we can start putting some in,” Sanheim said of the power play. “It’s a big part of good teams, and something that we obviously have got to be better at.”

Though the ending wasn’t what the Flyers wanted, particularly in that they had a Trevor Zegras breakaway opportunity and a pair of two-on-one chances in overtime, Tocchet gave them credit for working hard and finding a way to hold a lead for most of the night. They fought through a game that didn’t have nearly the same kind of emotion as Tuesday’s tilt with Cutter Gauthier and the Ducks, and against a streaking team that improved to 6-0-2 in its last eight.

There could be greater challenges in their immediate future, however, considering who might not be available.

Boutte missed two weeks back in November due to a hamstring injury. It's not clear if this injury is related. Boutte also missed Week 17 with a concussion, but was cleared and returned for Week 18.

Outside of the three games he's missed Boutte has been one of Drake Maye's most trusted and reliable targets this year, especially on deep balls. He had 33 catches for 551 yards and six touchdowns this season.

The Patriots are already without another outside receiver in Mack Hollins, who was placed on IR last week. If Boutte can't go it could mean a bigger role for rookie Kyle Williams.

Introduction

Wayne Gandy (“Gandy”) played fifteen years in the National Football League (“NFL”) as an offensive lineman with multiple teams. Six years after he retired, he filed a worker’s compensation claim in California naming the Rams. It was later amended to include his other NFL employers, the Pittsburgh Steelers (“Steelers”), New Orleans Saints (“Saints”) and Atlanta Falcons (“Falcons”), creating the conundrum of which Defendant should be liable for Gandy’s workers compensation injury claim in California. The trial Judge declined to exercise jurisdiction over the non-California teams per Labor Code 3600.5(c) and (d). The California Workers Compensation Appeals Board, (“WCAB”), overruled the trial judge and opined that California had jurisdiction over the other named defendants per Labor Code 3600.5(a) since applicant once played for a California team. The Atlanta Falcons, appealed to the California Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal reversed the WCAB, holding that California lacked jurisdiction over the Falcons per Labor Code Section 3600 (c) and (d). Gandy v. The Atlanta Falcons, et al, California Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division Three, Case No. G064622, (WCAB Case. No. ADJ1010126), (10-7-2025)). The case was remanded back to the WCAB for further proceedings, consistent with the Court of Appeal opinion.

Background

Gandy was the 15th pick in the first round of the 1994 draft by the Los Angeles Rams. He went on to play 15 seasons as an offensive linemen in the NFL, with the Los Angeles Rams in 1994, St. Louis Rams 1995-1998, Pittsburgh Steelers 1999-2003, the New Orleans Saints, 2003-2005, before ending with the Atlanta Falcons, 2006-2009. Playing offensive line in the NFL carries substantial well-documented physical and long-term health risks. Linemen are generally the largest players on the field, playing in the “trenches”, often involved in high impact collisions. Gandy himself was listed as 6’6” and 315 pounds. With the combination of mass, leverage and force at the line of scrimmage, no one disputes the risk of injury involved.

‘

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

The battle over [California] Workers’ Compensation cannot be understood without looking at the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). In fact, the NFL-NFL Players’ Association have express provisions in the CBA structuring worker’s compensation. The CBA states, in Article 41: “Section 1. In any state where workers’ compensation coverage is not compulsory or where a Club is excluded from a state’s workers’ compensation coverage, a Club will either voluntarily obtain coverage under the compensation laws of that state or otherwise guarantee equivalent benefits to its players under the compensation law of the state in which his Club is located.

Section 2. states: “A Club that has the legal right to reject coverage under the workers’ compensation law of its state. Moreover, any Club may be excluded from those laws if it elects to do so. However, if a Club elects to reject or be excluded from coverage under the compensation law of its state, it must nevertheless guarantee benefits to its Players in the manner provided in Section 1 above. “

Flowing from the collectively bargained provisions in Sections 1 and 2 above, the NFL and the NFL Players Association agreed on uniform contract language that steers workers compensation claims to the team’s home state. These provisions were created to prevent players from filing claims in states like California where cumulative trauma claims were more likely to succeed and benefits were more generous.

For the NFL and team owners, the CBA functions as the central risk management tool providing predictability in limiting liability to one team, one state and one workers’ compensation system. One might ask why the NFL Players’ Association agree to jurisdictional limits on where claims could be filed. As part of the bargaining process, the players received other benefits including higher minimum salaries, and expanded injury protections during and post career outside of workers’ compensation.

The CBA is more than a labor peace document. It is the mechanism through which risk is allocated and legal exposure is managed. Thus, the NFL and team owners fight to control [California] workers’ compensation benefits became as important as over the field of play.

The California Worker’s Compensation Process Begins

On September 14, 2015, six years after his NFL career ended with the Falcons, Gandy filed a lawsuit in California for workers’ compensation benefits. The cause alleged was a cumulative trauma injury throughout his NFL career from 4/25/1993 to 2/27/2009, involving injuries to his head, brain, face, neck, trunk, multiple other body parts and nervous system. The lawsuit initially only named the Los Angeles Rams who are a California based team and the St. Louis Rams since he continued to play under his California contract with the St. Louis Rams. Applicant also played seven games in California while with the St. Louis Rams.

The suit was later amended to include the Steelers, Saints and Falcons whom applicant played for over the last decade of his NFL career. Gandy played 2 games in California while playing for the Steelers and Falcons respectively. He also played 4 games and spent 1 week of practice in California with the Saints.

Pursuant to Labor Code 5500.5(a), liability for a cumulative trauma injury is limited to the employers who employed the worker during the one-year period immediately preceding the date of injury (LC 5412), or the last date of injurious exposure, whichever occurs first. Under Labor Code 5412 the date of injury is defined as the first date someone suffers both disability (i.e. missed time from work, medical treatment beyond first aid, or disability payment), and knows the disability is work related.

Based on the pleadings, per Labor Code 5500.5, the last year of injurious exposure would be 2/27/2008 to 2/27/2009. The Falcons would be the lone defendant in the last year of injurious exposure, if California jurisdiction extends to applicant’s employment with the non-California teams including the Falcons.

LABOR CODE 3600.5

Labor Code Section 3600.5 was enacted in 1955 to clarify and expand coverage for California employees injured outside the State and to limit California benefits for out of state employees temporarily working in California. The intent was partly to reduce workers’ compensation insurance costs for employers.

Pursuant to Labor Code Section 3600.5 (a) California employees injured outside the State are entitled to California worker’s compensation benefits. (b) out of state employees temporarily working in California are exempt if covered by any another state’s workers’ compensation system.

In 2013, there was a significant amendment, AB 1309, later codified as Labor Code 3600.5 (c)(d) specifically targeting professional athletes. The amendment applied to claims filed after September 15, 2013, and injurie occurring after January 1, 2014. It exempted certain out-of-state professional athletes from California’s cumulative injury provisions if: they were1) hired outside of California worked temporarily in California for less than 20% of his her/duty days during the year immediately preceding the last day of work for that employer, the employer provides reciprocal workers compensation coverage under another state’s law.

Labor Code Section 3600.5 (c) states that professional athletes hired outside of CA are exempt from cumulative injury claims if covered by any another state’s workers’ compensation system. (d) if a professional athlete has both California and non-California employers, the claim is exempt when all of the employers in the last year of work as a pro athlete are exempted unless: 1) the pro athlete has worked 2 or more seasons for a California based team or 20% or more of his/her duty days in California or for a California based team and 2) has worked fewer than seven seasons for any teams other than a California based team.

Before 2013, California allowed cumulative trauma claims even for athletes who played only a few games in the State. This attracted voluminous claims from retired athletes who had minimal California ties because: California recognizes cumulative trauma injuries and California has a long statute of limitations for filing such claims. The increased number of claims created financial strain on California teams and insurers and clogged the WCAB with cases that had little connection to California.

TRIAL COURT/RECONSIDERATION

Gandy’s case proceeded to trial in June 2019 on three issues: 1) whether California has jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim; 2) whether jurisdiction should be exercised in light of the Choice of Law & Choice of Frum clauses in Gandy’s contracts with the Falcons and Saints (Mckinley v. AZ Cardinals, 78 Cal Comp Cases 23 (2013); and 3) whether Gandy’s claim against the Falcons was barred by the statute of limitations.

The trial Judge held the Falcons were exempt because they provided workers’ compensation insurance coverage for Gandy under the laws of another state, and that such insurance provided coverage for Gandy in California and Atlanta for all relevant time Gandy was working for the Falcons.

On Reconsideration, the WCAB determined jurisdiction extends to any athlete who ever signed a contract in California or with any California based team. Hansell v. Arizona Diamondbacks 87 Cal Comp Cases 602 (2022). The WCAB has jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim because he signed a contract for his first season in the National Football League with the Los Angeles Rams, a California based team. Any choice of law/forum selection clause should not be enforced. The legislature did not intend for 3600.5(c) and (d) to apply to athletes who have been hired in CA by at least one employer during the CT period. Counsel for the Falcons petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of review which was granted.

APPELLATE COURT DECISION

The Court of Appeal performs review de novo, starting with the statutory language. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation v. WCAB 17 Cal 5th 510,520 (2025). If there is a conflict, the statutes should be harmonized. If the statutes can’t be reconciled, the later enactments supersede earlier ones, and more specific provisions take precedence over general ones. State Dept. of Public Health V. Superior Court 60 Cal. 4th 940, 955 (2015).

California workers’ compensation is solely a creation of the legislature and fundamental subject matter jurisdiction is limited by statute. In the absence of a statute affirmatively conferring subject matter jurisdiction over a claim to the WCAB, it lacks authority to adjudicate the claim.

The legislature in fact explicitly addressed the issue posed by Gandy’s claim of what happens when a pro athlete is hired by both California and non-California teams over the course of his employment and suffers a cumulative trauma injury. Labor Code 3600.5 (d) exempts claims when all the professional athlete’s employers in his/her last year of work are exempt under 3600.5 (c) unless: 1) the pro athlete has worked two or more seasons for a California based team or worked 20% or more of their total career duty days for a CA based team AND 2) the pro athlete has worked for fewer than seven seasons for any non-California based teams.

Gandy fails both provisions. Of his 15 NFL seasons, only one was with a California based team, less than 20% of his total career duty days were performed in California and he played more than 7 seasons with non-California teams given his 14 seasons with the St. Lous Rams, Pittsburgh Steelers, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons.

CONCLUSION

California Labor Code § 3600.5(c) and (d) significantly restricts the ability of professional athletes to bring workers’ compensation claims in California for cumulative trauma or occupational disease when they have been hired outside the state and are only temporarily working in California, provided their employer has valid out-of-state workers’ compensation coverage that applies to their California work. These provisions, as interpreted by California courts and the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB), are designed to prevent “forum shopping” by athletes with minimal California contacts, while preserving access for those with substantial California ties (e.g., multiple seasons with California teams or significant duty days in California). This way players with long-term, significant California contacts like Joe Montana, and LaDanian Tomlinson, are still protected under California workers’ compensation law.

Legal professionals handling these cases must carefully analyze the athlete’s employment history, contract formation, and the scope of coverage under other states’ laws to determine jurisdiction and the proper forum for claims. Pennsylvania and Louisiana both have reciprocal extraterritorial provisions which should exempt them from California jurisdiction for purposes of workers’ compensation like the Falcons. The St. Louis Rams are not so lucky since Gandy continued to play for the St. Louis Rams under his California contract.",https://sportslitigationalert.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/cropped-sla-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-09 06:58:15.428242

Lake is returning for the wild-card round, and the Rams (12-5) are hoping he’s a key to a long playoff run.

As for Lake himself, he’s just eager to get back to work as the do-it-all defensive back who has become the unlikely engine driving a precocious young defense.

“I’m ready to go throw my elbow in there, have fun, fly around and help this team win again,” Lake said Thursday.

After several weeks to recover from surgery, Lake will be back in uniform when the Rams visit the Carolina Panthers (8-9) on Saturday in the first game of the NFL postseason. He wasn’t in uniform Nov. 30 when the Rams made their first trip to Charlotte, and his absence was felt in that game — and in every game the Rams have played since he went down nearly two months ago.

“He’s got this presence where you just feel better,” coach Sean McVay said.

Lake’s job is big and complicated, but the former sixth-round pick from UCLA has grown into the role filled by Jalen Ramsey during Los Angeles’ Super Bowl championship run four years ago.

Lake usually plays the “star” position in the schemes utilized by McVay and his past three defensive coordinators. The job requires him to line up frequently as a slot cornerback in coverage, but also to contribute heavily to the Rams’ run defense in the box.

He earns his “Captain Q” nickname by leading the defense on the field, making sure his teammates on the NFL’s least expensive defense are lined up correctly — and keeping a cool head amid the late-game pressure that will only be ratcheted up in the postseason.

“It’s extremely important,” defensive coordinator Chris Shula said of Lake’s return. “He’s a great player, whether you’re just talking about scheme-wise or all the things that he does for us. Really what he brings to the team as far as from a physicality, from communication and the questions he’s asking, it’s awesome to have him back.”

Lake’s importance can be measured by what happened while he was out.

The Rams fell to the bottom quarter of the NFL in scoring defense, yards allowed per play and big plays allowed, among several metrics. Los Angeles yielded 28 points per game in its final six outings, dropping the defense into the middle of the pack in the final NFL standings.

Lake showed his leadership qualities when asked about the Rams’ defensive play during his absence. Los Angeles went 3-3 in its final six games.

“We had a lot of guys come in for my spot that did great things,” Lake said. “At the same time, my job is, how can I come back and really help this team? That’s it. I don’t really look at, hey, what was happening when I was out, what wasn’t happening, the difference between when I was in and when I wasn’t. I was just focused on getting back, and luckily the team gave me a shot to come back and play meaningful football.”

Lake has known about big-time football pressure his whole life: His father, Carnell, played on several playoff teams and reached the Super Bowl during his decade as a dominant defensive back for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Quentin Lake made 23 tackles in his first three playoff games, and he believes that the Rams’ experience will matter in Charlotte and beyond.

“The playoff atmosphere is amazing,” Lake said. “Guys either rise to the occasion, or they sink to the level of their training, and I know we have a lot of guys that are built for it. Guys that when the pressure and the moment is big, they rise to the occasion.”

NOTES: RG Kevin Dotson has been ruled out this week due to his injured ankle, an absence that compromises the Rams’ rushing attack and overall offensive structure. Dotson got hurt when Seahawks LB Derick Hall stepped on him last month, earning a one-game suspension. The game in Carolina will be the third straight missed by Dotson. ... Rookie TE Terrance Ferguson is questionable for Saturday after injuring his hamstring in practice last week, but he participated in parts of Thursday’s practice after missing the first two workouts this week. ... CB Josh Wallace (ankle) is also questionable.

Without this acceptance, rehab becomes doubly difficult, as the mind works against the body’s healing process.
The Stoic mindset A key aspect of NFL resilience is the “Stoic” approach: focusing on what can be controlled.
Final word Recovering from an NFL injury is a process that combines mental and physical resilience.
The recovery process isn’t just about getting back to where they were, but about evolving into a more mentally durable and focused athlete.","In the high-stakes environment of the National Football League (NFL), an injury is not just a physical setback; it’s a profound threat to an athlete’s identity, career, and mental stability.

While the torn ACL or fractured ankle grabs attention, the real battle begins in the weeks that follow. For athletes whose lives are defined by physical dominance and team camaraderie, being sidelined triggers an “identity crisis.”

The sudden halt of their routine, the absence of the locker room atmosphere, and the uncertainty of their future contract can lead to psychological distress. Just as people use tools like the best apps for anxiety relief to manage stress, athletes must rely on their mental playbook to navigate the emotional rollercoaster of rehabilitation. Resilience in the NFL isn’t just about healing physically; it’s about the “mental playbook” players use to get back to the field.

The initial psychological impact of injury

When an injury occurs, players often experience a mourning process similar to the stages of grief. Suddenly, they’re separated from teammates and the adrenaline-filled rhythm of the season.

This isolation can lead to feelings of irrelevance or fear of being replaced while they are away. The first step in resilience is acknowledging this emotional shock.

Coaches and sports psychologists agree that the most successful recoveries begin when a player accepts their new reality rather than fighting it.

By moving past the “why me?” phase and focusing on the road ahead, athletes can better manage their emotions and avoid spiraling into a negative mental state. Without this acceptance, rehab becomes doubly difficult, as the mind works against the body’s healing process.

The power of micro-goals

A daunting nine-month recovery timeline can feel insurmountable for any player. To manage this, they break the recovery into small, achievable milestones—called micro-goals. This technique is commonly used to manage stress, tracking small wins to maintain focus.

In the NFL training room, micro-goals might include standing without crutches, regaining motion, or completing a set of exercises without pain. Each small success triggers dopamine, keeping players motivated and preventing “rehab fatigue” that often sets in during the middle phase of healing.

These micro-goals help athletes see progress, no matter how small it may seem, providing psychological momentum to keep going.

Visualization and mental reps

While the body is healing, the mind must stay sharp. Elite athletes use visualization and “mental reps” to keep their cognitive reaction times intact during physical absence. By watching game film and mentally running through plays, athletes keep their neural pathways active. Research shows that the brain fires similarly during visualization as it does during actual performance. This mental rehearsal helps players stay “game-ready” for when they return. For a quarterback, this might involve visualizing the opponent’s blitz patterns; for a linebacker, it’s “seeing” the gaps in the offensive line before they open. This technique prevents “mental rust” and ensures that their tactical awareness remains intact when they return to the field.

Finding strength in vulnerability

Resilience isn’t just a solo effort—it’s a team effort. The most durable players are those who build a “support squad” made up of sports psychologists, family, and fellow injured teammates. There’s a growing culture in professional football that encourages players to share the emotional struggles of rehab rather than internalizing stress.

By opening up about their frustrations, players can process setbacks without letting them break their spirit. Sharing the burden with their support system reminds them that, even though they are sidelined, they are still valued members of the team. This sense of belonging is vital for maintaining mental health during recovery.

The Stoic mindset

A key aspect of NFL resilience is the “Stoic” approach: focusing on what can be controlled. Injured players can’t control their team’s depth chart or how quickly they heal, but they can control their nutrition, sleep quality, and effort during rehab.

By focusing on these controllable factors, they eliminate anxiety about the uncertain future. This sttitude shifts players from being “victims” of circumstance to active participants in their recovery. The Stoic mindset serves as a psychological anchor, helping athletes avoid despair and stay focused on the progress they can control.

The return to play: overcoming the fear of re-injury

The final stage of resilience is overcoming the fear of re-injury. Physical clearance is only half the battle; the real challenge is regaining the confidence to play without hesitation. After an injury, there’s a natural instinct to protect the injured area.

Overcoming this fear requires gradual exposure to contact and trust in the rehab process. Through “confidence-building” drills, players slowly ramp up the intensity of their training, allowing their brain to gather evidence that the body is strong enough to handle the physical demands of the game.

When a player stops thinking about the injury and begins reacting instinctively, that’s when they fully reclaim their place on the field.

Final word

Recovering from an NFL injury is a process that combines mental and physical resilience. By breaking down recovery into small goals, staying mentally sharp through visualization, and leaning on a strong support system, athletes can successfully navigate the toughest parts of rehabilitation.

Physical healing alone isn’t enough to ensure a successful return; mental conditioning is just as crucial. The recovery process isn’t just about getting back to where they were, but about evolving into a more mentally durable and focused athlete. True strength comes from the mind, and the resilience cultivated during recovery is what allows athletes to thrive under pressure when they return to the game.",https://nfldraftdiamonds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/49f49770-8f74-11f0-9f6b-36bf999072c0.webp,N,,2026-01-08 22:58:44.724941

(AP) — When Brock Purdy walked off the field following his first playoff trip to Philadelphia, his future was in question.
He won in his return to Philadelphia in 2023 when he helped San Francisco reach the Super Bowl and leads the 49ers back to Philadelphia to take on the Eagles (11-6) on Sunday in a wild-card matchup.
When I look at his resume and how well he’s played throughout his entire career, he’s a special football player.
... He’s always played with that swagger and that energy.” But Purdy and the San Francisco offense struggled in the regular-season finale with the No.
The Niners managed one field goal in a 13-3 loss as Purdy was held to 127 yards on 27 attempts.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — When Brock Purdy walked off the field following his first playoff trip to Philadelphia, his future was in question.

Purdy had gone from the last pick of the 2022 draft to an improbable starting quarterback in the NFC title game for the San Francisco 49ers in a span of nine months only to tear a ligament in his right elbow on his opening drive of a loss.

“You tear your UCL, the ligament that you use as a quarterback, as a thrower, obviously you start thinking about your future and things and coming back from the injury and it was at the end of the year so I was questioning will I be back in time, will I be the guy come the start of the season? Stuff like that,"" Purdy said Thursday. ""But now we’re moved on and ready to go.”

Purdy returned from the major surgery and proved his late-season run as a rookie wasn't a momentary flash, establishing himself as the franchise quarterback for the 49ers (12-5).

He won in his return to Philadelphia in 2023 when he helped San Francisco reach the Super Bowl and leads the 49ers back to Philadelphia to take on the Eagles (11-6) on Sunday in a wild-card matchup.

Purdy's concerns this week are with Vic Fangio's defense featuring stars such as Jalen Carter, Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean, and a tough Philadelphia crowd instead of the elbow which has been completely healed since 2023.

“Obviously, we know Philly from being there and their environment, their fans, all the things,” Purdy said. ""It’s getting prepared for that right now rather than having flashbacks or anything like that. I already went there in 2023 and played after what had happened in ’22. So, I feel like that’s out of the way and ready to move on.”

Purdy recovered from that injury to become an AP NFL MVP finalist in the 2023 season when he set a franchise record for yards passing and helped the Niners reach the Super Bowl before losing in overtime to the Chiefs.

After the Niners struggled to a 6-11 record last season, they are back in the postseason again with another visit to Philadelphia on Sunday for the wild-card round.

The season hasn't been an easy one for Purdy, who was rewarded for his early success with a five-year, $265 million contract extension in May. Purdy injured his toe in the season opener and missed the next two games.

He returned and struggled in a Week 4 loss to Jacksonville before sitting out the next six games because of the injured toe. He returned in Week 11 and quickly got back to his old form, leading San Francisco to six straight wins including back-to-back five touchdown games in prime-time wins over Indianapolis in Chicago in Weeks 16 and 17.

That's the type of performance the 49ers have grown used to seeing from Purdy.

“I’ve got to say, when he showed up from the first game he played, he looked pretty incredible in that game too,” running back Christian McCaffrey said. ""He’s never gotten enough credit. When I look at his resume and how well he’s played throughout his entire career, he’s a special football player. He’s one of the best quarterbacks in the league. ... He’s always played with that swagger and that energy.”

But Purdy and the San Francisco offense struggled in the regular-season finale with the No. 1 seed, a first-round bye and home-field advantage on the line against Seattle. The Niners managed one field goal in a 13-3 loss as Purdy was held to 127 yards on 27 attempts.

Offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak said that has served as motivation this week.

“We got punched in the mouth,” Kubiak said. “We didn’t play good and we got beat. That’s what happened. I think our guys were a little pissed off. I think they were disappointed. We were all disappointed in how we played and how we coached. It wasn’t our best.”

Injury update

The Niners got some good news on the injury front with Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams back at practice for the first time since injuring his hamstring on the opening snap in Week 17.

Receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle) remains out but was able to do some running on the side. Linebacker Luke Gifford (quadriceps) didn't practice after being limited on Wednesday. Defensive lineman Keion White (hamstring, groin) and linebacker Dee Winters (ankle) also remained out.

Tight end George Kittle (ankle), defensive tackle Jordan Elliott (knee) and defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) were also limited.

Linebacker Fred Warner, who has been out since injuring his ankle in Week 6, was able to do some running on the side for the first time during an open portion of practice to reporters.

Stroupe took to X, formerly Twitter, to post an old photo of Mahomes working out from May 1, 2021. The last time he posted that photo, which was on Instagram, he captioned it, “It’s personal.” However, he captioned it by putting the NFL on notice.

“Remember the last time they said he would never be the same[?]” he asked, also posting a variety of emojis along with his caption.

Of course, Stroup is likely referring to Mahomes’ previous toe injury, which required surgery after the 2020 NFL season concluded. He suffered the injury in the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Cleveland Browns.

That year ended with disappointment as well. The Chiefs were blown out by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl 55 in Tom Brady’s final Super Bowl. In 2025, the Chiefs went 6-11 and missed the playoffs, and Mahomes tore his ACL in Week 15.

Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes’ injury occurred in Week 15

Mahomes suffered his torn ACL injury during the fourth quarter in a game against the Los Angeles Chargers. Gardner Minshew would fill in for Mahomes, and he tore his ACL the following week. Chris Oladokun, a seventh-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, and Shane Buechele finished the season under center.

Before his injury, Mahomes was averaging 256.2 yards per game, throwing for 3,587 yards. He also passed for 22 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Mahomes also rushed for 422 yards (a career-high) and five touchdowns.

Now, Mahomes is rehabbing his torn ACL and LCL injuries after getting surgery to repair them. Hopefully, he will be back in time for the first game of the 2026 NFL season. The Chiefs are going to hope to get back to the top of the mountain after five Super Bowl appearances under Mahomes.

Fellow offensive linemen Vederian Lowe and Garrett Bradbury remained sidelined due to illnesses, as well, while defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga’s absence continued because of a foot injury.

Previously listed as a limited participant, Munford marked the fourth absence for the AFC East champions on Thursday. Since being signed back off the practice squad of the Cleveland Browns in November, the bookend has seen 100 snaps on offense and 30 snaps on special teams. A pair of starts have been notched along the way while reporting as eligible. Fellow linemen in Lowe and Bradbury have now missed consecutive sessions due to a sickness going around the locker room. As for Tonga, the three-phase nose tackle has not practiced since missing consecutive games to end the regular season.

Four Patriots practiced in a limited capacity on Thursday. Boutte would find himself among them. The wide receiver has been added to the injury report due to a hamstring injury. He missed Week 10 and Week 11 with a hamstring injury and later had a stint in the NFL’s concussion protocol, finishing the slate with 33 catches for 551 yards and a career-best six touchdowns. Elsewhere, a rookie starter at guard as well as a captain and sack leader at outside linebacker continued to be limited for New England. As for Austin, the cornerback has yet to be activated from injured reserve after having his 21-day practice window open on New Year’s Eve.

A handful of veterans graduated to full participation outside Gillette Stadium on Thursday. Moses and Jennings both sat out the previous session due to illnesses.

Bradley left the stadium on crutches with his left knee in a brace.
Slot told Sky after the match of his fears for the 22-year-old, who has played 21 matches across all competitions this term.
“I don’t know Gabriel Martinelli but he comes across as a nice guy,” Slot said in his post-match press conference.
But it doesn’t look great if Conor has the injury which we fear he might have.","Arne Slot has said he “fears the worst” over the knee injury Conor Bradley suffered in Liverpool’s goal-less draw at Arsenal.

The Northern Ireland full-back will under scans to determine the extent of the damage after being stretchered off deep into second-half stoppage time. Bradley left the stadium on crutches with his left knee in a brace.

Slot told Sky after the match of his fears for the 22-year-old, who has played 21 matches across all competitions this term.

Arsenal substitute Gabriel Martinelli had enraged Slot’s players by throwing the ball at Bradley and then attempting to shove him off the pitch as he lay in obvious discomfort awaiting treatment.

“I don’t know Gabriel Martinelli but he comes across as a nice guy,” Slot said in his post-match press conference.

“I think the problem for him is, and it’s a problem in general in football, that there is so much time-wasting and players pretending they are injured in the final parts of the game. You can then sometimes be annoyed if you want to score a goal that you think the player is time-wasting.

“I cannot ask of Gabriel Martinelli in the 94th minute when it’s so emotional for him to understand he is playing Liverpool – a team when we played Leeds and a player was held but didn’t go to the floor, or played West Ham United and my players try to drag (Lucas) Paqueta out of a situation where he was getting a second yellow card.

“I’m 100 per cent sure that if he knew what the injury might be that he would never do (what he did). But it doesn’t look great if Conor has the injury which we fear he might have.

“I think when we see the video we both probably think the same, but we have to wait on the scans if it’s that bad.”

The Eagles listed two players under DID NOT PARTICIPATE: Landon Dickerson and Brett Toth.

The Eagles have commonly rested Dickerson on Thursdays since he’s been playing through injury all year long. He’ll be ready to start at left guard on Sunday.

While Toth did not practice, he was seen watching the action from the sideline. This development points to him progressing through the concussion protocol, though it still seems like he’s on track to miss Sunday’s game. He could be ready to suit up for the Divisional Round next week, if applicable.

The Eagles listed four players under LIMITED PARTICIPATION: Lane Johnson, Jalen Carter, Dallas Goedert, and Grant Calcaterra.

Johnson, Carter, and Goedert were limited for the second day in a row.

Johnson seemed to be moving well during the media-attended portion of practice. It seems like he’s going to suit up on Sunday. We’ll find out more about his playing status on Friday’s final injury report.

The thinking here is that the Eagles are managing Carter and Goedert to help get them to Sunday.

Calcaterra was upgraded from DNP on Wednesday to limited on Thursday. Eagles fans aren’t exactly dying to see him play but he might be out there as the No. 2 tight end.

The Eagles listed four players under FULL PARTICIPATION: Nakobe Dean, Marcus Epps, Jaelan Phillips, and Azeez Ojulari.

Dean and Epps were upgraded from limited on Wednesday to full go on Thursday. They’re ready to play, which is good news.

Phillips and Ojulari were full go for the second day in a row. Phillips will start and Ojulari will likely remain on injured reserve for now.

SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS INJURY REPORT (THURSDAY)

The 49ers have three changes from their Wednesday injury report:

Christian McCaffrey was upgraded to full participation after resting on Wednesday.

Trent Williams was upgraded to limited after missing Wednesday’s practice due to his hamstring injury.

Luke Gifford was downgraded to not practicing after being limited on Wednesday.

Williams practicing is obviously the big development for the Niners. Guessing the 37-year-old is going to try to play through his hamstring injury. If he does suit up, we’ll see if he can make it through the game. Always risk of a hammy flaring back up.

Gifford’s absence points to the 49ers being down to Eric Kendricks and Garret Wallow starting at off-ball linebacker. Those two players have combined for 90 defensive snaps played for San Francisco this season. So, yeah, the 49ers are really thin at linebacker.

In other news, second-year wide receiver Ricky Pearsal didn’t practice for the second day in a row. He’s on track to miss Sunday’s game, which is bad news for the 49ers’ offense. Pearsal is their best big play threat at receiver.

We’ll find out more about the 49ers’ injury situation when they issue their final injury report on Friday afternoon. It’ll also be worth paying attention to any roster moves they may or may not make prior to Saturday’s 4:00 PM deadline.

Looking into my crystal ball, I give you the slate of winners for the 2025 season.

Most Valuable Player: Drake Maye, QB, New England Patriots

Back in training camp we were wondering if Matthew Stafford’s back would allow him to make it through the first month of the season. Now, here the 37-year-old stands, the NFL’s leader in passing yards (4,707) and touchdowns (46) while directing the top-rated Los Angeles Rams offense and a team that ranks among the favorites to win the Super Bowl. Any other year, Stafford would be a slam dunk for MVP. And yet, there is another.

Maye took a massive leap forward in Year 2 and has served as the catalyst for the Patriots’ surprising success. Passing for 4,394 yards, 31 touchdowns and just eight interceptions, Maye registered some big-time performances down the stretch to help New England earn the AFC’s No. 2 seed. He’s also used his legs to buy time and escape pressure behind a shaky offensive line and has run for 450 yards and four touchdowns.

Josh Allen also has delivered another MVP-worthy season while leading a Buffalo Bills team that offers probably the weakest supporting cast he has had in years. But Maye’s season has been pretty special.

Offensive Player of the Year: Christian McCaffrey, RB, San Francisco 49ers

The Seattle Seahawks’ third-year wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba delivered one of the most dominant single-season performances in NFL history. His 1,793 receiving yards (on 119 catches and 10 touchdowns) rank eighth on the all-time list. The Rams’ Puka Nacua’s 129-catch (league-high), 1,715-yard, 10-touchdown season makes him worthy of consideration as well. And the Atlanta Falcons’ Bijan Robinson delivered one of the most dynamic and well-rounded campaigns with 1,478 rushing yards and seven touchdowns on 287 carries and 820 receiving yards and four touchdowns on 79 catches.

But McCaffrey truthfully is deserving of MVP honors given the way his production (1,202 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns and 102 receptions for 924 yards and seven touchdowns) kept the 49ers afloat despite two different injury-induced absences to quarterback Brock Purdy, a six-game absence for tight end George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall’s eight games missed to injury and an entire season missed by Brandon Aiyuk. McCaffrey’s 413 touches led the NFL, as did his total touchdowns.

Defensive Player of the Year: Myles Garrett, DE, Cleveland Browns

Garrett ranks among the most unstoppable forces the league has ever seen. After averaging 12.8 sacks per season and recording 14 in both 2024 and 2023, Garrett turned in his most impressive season yet, setting the single-season sack record with 23. New York Giants linebacker Brian Burns turned in a stellar season with 16.5 sacks and 67 tackles. And Houston Texans defensive end Danielle Hunter also impressed with 15 sacks and 54 tackles. But the gap between Garrett and the pack is significant.

Offensive Rookie of the Year: Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Carolina Panthers

The Arizona product is a truly polished young player who quickly developed into the go-to guy for Bryce Young and just got better as the season progressed, finishing the year with 70 catches for 1,014 yards and seven touchdowns. His yardage set a Carolina rookie receiving record. For much of the year, it seemed as if McMillan and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Emeka Egbuka were in a neck-and-neck race for the top rookie honor, but McMillan pulled away to top his counterpart’s 63 catches for 938 yards and five touchdowns.

New Orleans Saints quarterback Tyler Shough also made a strong push for the award, completing 67.6 percent of his passes for 2,384 yards, 10 touchdowns and 6 interceptions and winning four of his last five games.

Defensive Rookie of the Year: Carson Schwesinger, LB, Cleveland Browns

The second-round pick out of UCLA turned in a rookie season that saw him record 156 tackles (sixth-most in the NFL), 2.5 sacks and two interceptions while helping anchor Cleveland’s top-five defense. Schwesinger faced competition from Atlanta safety Xavier Watts (five interceptions, 96 tackles) and Philadelphia linebacker Jihaad Campbell (80 tackles, a forced fumble and an interception), but Schwesinger’s impact has been undeniable.

Comeback Player of the Year: Dak Prescott, QB, Dallas Cowboys

Sidelined for the second half of last season by a right hamstring tear that required surgery to reattach the tendon to the bone, Prescott thundered back by throwing for 4,552 yards, 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions while completing a league-high 404 passes. The Cowboys boasted the second-most prolific offense in the league. If not for the lack of support that he received from Dallas’ porous defense, Prescott very well could have led his team on a playoff run.

McCaffrey — limited to four games in 2024 by Achilles tendon and knee injuries — is another strong candidate after playing all 17 games and producing at such a prolific rate this season. Also worthy of the honor: the Detroit Lions’ Aidan Hutchinson, who recovered from a broken leg to record 14.5 sacks (fourth-most) while playing all 17 games this season.

Most Improved Player of the Year: Trevor Lawrence, QB, Jacksonville Jaguars

After battling significant inconsistencies the last several seasons and seeing another challenging campaign (2024) end after 10 games because of a shoulder injury, Lawrence entered this season with loads of questions about whether he could ever live up to the billing of a true franchise quarterback. But Lawrence’s first season under Liam Coen has translated into immense growth. The quarterback ranked sixth in the NFL with 4,007 passing yards while completing 60.9 percent of his passes for 29 touchdowns and 12 interceptions and posting his best passer rating (91.0) in four seasons. Lawrence also rushed for a career-high nine touchdowns.

Coach of the Year: Mike Vrabel, New England Patriots

He took a listless team that had deteriorated on Bill Belichick’s watch and continued its spiral in one season under Jerod Mayo, and in one season’s time, Vrabel has elevated the quarterback, gotten the defense right and has quickly restored the Patriots to one of the leading teams in the league. The Patriots boast the third-best offense, a top-10 defense and an impactful special teams unit and now appear to have as legitimate a shot at contending for a Super Bowl as anyone.

The competition was thick this year. The 49ers’ Kyle Shanahan easily could have taken this honor home after keeping his team afloat despite a swarm of injuries that would have wrecked any other organization. Ben Johnson took the Chicago Bears’ job last winter and now has Caleb Williams playing like a franchise quarterback as Chicago won its first division title in seven seasons. Coen took a 4-13 Jaguars team and pulled off a turnaround that saw them post a 13-4 record and win the AFC South after closing the season on an eight-game winning streak, winning those games by an average of 19.1 points per game.

Assistant Coach of the Year: Klint Kubiak, OC, Seattle Seahawks

Plenty of assistant coaches have delivered impressive results this season. In Denver, Vance Joseph directs a championship-caliber defense. Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniel took Maye to another level and has masked the deficiencies of a subpar offensive line to direct a top-five offense. In Los Angeles, DC Chris Shula’s Rams defense also appears capable of leading a Super Bowl march.

But Seattle offensive play-caller Klint Kubiak may have delivered the most impressive and surprising body of work in his first season with the Seahawks. From helping Sam Darnold further elevate his game, to turning Smith-Njigba into one of the most dangerous weapons in the league and giving Seattle an offense capable of perfectly capitalizing on the opportunities provided by a championship-caliber defense, Kubiak takes the cake.

Executive of the Year: John Schneider, GM, Seattle Seahawks

Schneider has repeatedly positioned the Seahawks for success, building a Super Bowl champion in the 2013 season, revamping the team once that window closed and now elevating the franchise to a 14-3 record this season and the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. A year after getting the head coaching hire right with Mike Macdonald, Schneider made what looked like big gambles, moving on from DK Metcalf and Geno Smith, and he continued rolling the dice by signing Darnold.

Each move wound up being right, and Schneider and the Seahawks have been rewarded. Robust draft classes have produced key contributors all over the roster, and trades and free agent signings have further fortified this team. Now, Seattle heads into the postseason with the No. 1 seed in the NFC and looks every bit the part of a Super Bowl contender.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/07193205/GettyImages-2246101162-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-08 19:02:14.605019

Last year, the club utilized the franchise tag and signed Tee Higgins to a long-term deal. This year, Trey Hendrickson hits the open market after a contentious year battling the organization for a long-term contract and battling a lingering injury.

Beyond Hendrickson’s situation as the headliner, the Bengals boast 15 unrestricted free agents and one restricted.

The Bengals currently project to have $69 million in cap space for 2026, ranking eighth in effective cap space entering the offseason, according to Over The Cap.

There’s also a small list of potential cap cuts that could add another $5 million to $15 million to the available total. Look for more discussion of those players in the near future.

For now, here’s a look at the Bengals’ free-agent class this offseason with analysis and what I’ve gathered on whether they’re expected to return or sign elsewhere. There’s always a surprise return or two each offseason, but this should provide a solid ballpark of where Cincinnati is headed with its free agents.

Starting level decisions

Trey Hendrickson

Position: Edge rusher

Age (start of camp): 31

Career cash: $97.2M

Last deal: One year, $29M extension

Status: Unrestricted free agent (UFA)

Key stat: Over his last four seasons, Hendrickson posted a pressure percentage of at least 17 percent, in the top 10 among NFL defensive linemen each year. Dating back to 2019, no defensive lineman age 31 or older has posted a pressure percentage higher than 17.1, according to TruMedia.

Where it stands: Hendrickson had core muscle surgery in December and is expected to be fully healthy by the start of free agency. At long last, he can hit the open market outside the constraints of the Bengals. The only way that changes is if they apply a franchise tag with the idea of trading him to receive better (or earlier) draft compensation. Zac Taylor was asked about there being a path to Hendrickson coming back this week and said, “There’s always a path.” He said that because he had to, because there is no path here. It’s actually kind of funny envisioning what the real-life version of that path would be. My best answer would be to Google the Darien Gap. Bridges have been set on fire here, so there’s no realistic return to Cincinnati for 2026 in the plans. When they let him walk, the team would likely receive a 2027 third-round compensatory pick.

Chance of return: 1 percent

Joseph Ossai

Position: Edge rusher

Age (start of camp): 26

Career cash: $11.4M

Last deal: One year, $6.5M

Status: UFA

Key stat: Out of 59 qualifying edge rushers this season, Ossai ranked 50th in true pass set win rate, a highly predictive stat to future success. His overall productivity (five sacks and 29 pressures) offers a rosier view. But there’s still not an overwhelming indication of a larger breakout incoming.

Where it stands: Ossai is still young, and the last two years have been the best of his career. Somebody will be interested. There’s valuable production and a league desperate for it. His injury history raises a red flag after taking a prove-it deal last year, but it feels like somebody will be willing to give Ossai multiple years and $10 million per year, given his age and production. The more important aspect for Cincinnati is that Ossai doesn’t feel like a piece that fits where they are in the defensive line rebuild. Murphy and Shemar Stewart both fit in the mold of a second pass rusher at this point. They could use a No. 1, or someone with a higher chance of becoming one. Ossai isn’t that, so that money probably goes elsewhere. A return to the Bengals feels unlikely, but the door will always be open for a surprise.

Chance of return: 20 percent

Geno Stone

Position: Safety

Age (start of camp): 27

Career cash: $16.7M

Last deal: Two years, $14M, then accepting a pay cut to $4.9M in 2025

Status: UFA

Key stat: Stone ranked 61st out of 66 qualifying safeties this year in missed tackle rate (18.5%). This after also ranking 61st out of 66 safeties in 2024 (17.7%).

Where it stands: Coaches have consistently given Stone credit for work off the field, communication, and aligning the defense properly during games. All that’s fine, but the inability to take proper angles and make tackles has been a centerpiece of the Bengals’ defensive ineptitude the last two years. That’s not all Stone’s fault. Poor play from the line and linebackers has forced him to come up and make too many tackles in space, already not his strength. Coming from Baltimore and signing in Cincinnati, Stone was a third safety. He’s largely played like a third safety for the Bengals, who forced him to take a pay cut and stay the starter this past offseason. Stone’s market won’t be much, which leaves open the possibility he returns in a cheap, reserve role as a player with experience and knowledge in the system. Even that requires squinting to see happen.

Chance of return: 15 percent

Cam Taylor-Britt

Position: Cornerback

Age (start of camp): 26

Career cash: $8.1M

Last deal: Rookie contract

Status: UFA

Key stat: Taylor-Britt only managed two starts this season. He was made a healthy scratch for the Week 7 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers after moving in and out of the cornerback rotation throughout the last two years. He was benched by both coordinators he played for, Lou Anarumo and Al Golden.

Where it stands: Taylor-Britt went on injured reserve after going down in Week 11 with a Lisfranc injury to his foot. He says he is expected to be healthy for next season, but participation in an offseason program would be in jeopardy. He is also spending five days in jail this week for a charge of reckless driving and driving without a license that occurred last year. That’s a fitting end to an up-and-down four seasons in Cincinnati. There was a point where Taylor-Britt was on a Pro Bowl track, but he could never find consistency to stay reliable on or off the field. That was maddening for both defensive staffs. The organization gave him time to find maturity and settle in. It just never came. He was playing better football following his healthy scratch, which he dubbed a “wake-up” call, but how does that project in the long run? He’s open to a change of scenery, but wasn’t closing the door on a return. If he did come back, it would be in a reserve role behind starters DJ Turner and Dax Hill, now entrenched as pieces to build around on the outside. He’s willing to play in the slot, but he’s probably best suited to start fresh elsewhere.

Chance of return: 20 percent

Noah Fant

Position: Tight end

Age (start of camp): 28

Career cash: $34.1M

Last deal: $2.8M

Status: UFA

Key stat: Fant had three fumbles returned for touchdowns — the most by a non-quarterback for Cincinnati in a single season. The Bengals allowed nine return touchdowns this year, tying the most in franchise history. There will be an offseason focus on cutting that number, and those three plays will be hard to get past inside the building.

Where it stands: The Bengals turn over tight ends every year. They are also still stocked in the room. Drew Sample and Mike Gesicki are both under contract. Plus, 2024 fourth-round pick Erick All missed all of this past season trying to recover from multiple ACL surgeries, so there’s also hope he could fill the gap after the Bengals staff fell in love with his game as a rookie. Fant never developed into what they hoped this past season, so this seems like an easy parting of ways.

Chance of return: 10 percent

Dalton Risner

Position: Guard

Age (start of camp): 31

Career cash: $14.8M

Last deal: $1.2M

Status: UFA

Key stat: Risner said he thought he played the best football of his career, and Pro Football Focus agreed. Not only did he earn the highest individual PFF grade of his seven-year career during his first season with the Bengals, but his raw pass-blocking efficiency numbers were also career-bests. He protected for 261 true pass sets this season, allowing one sack and just three quarterback hits, via PFF.

Where it stands: Everyone seems to want Risner back, and they aren’t afraid to say it. Ted Karras and Amarius Mims made impassioned pleas in recent weeks. Zac Taylor spoke about how well he’s meshed into that room. Risner admitted a desire to return and get a deal done before free agency begins in March. He’s made a habit of waiting out the market in recent seasons, and that’s part of what caused him to still be on the street when the Bengals signed him in August. Will the Bengals, who often devalue the guard position, be able to find the common ground on what he’s worth before another team plucks him away? That’s the biggest question, but there’s an obvious desire on all sides to make a return happen.

Chance of return: 75 percent

Tanner Hudson

Position: Tight end

Age (start of camp): 31

Career cash: $6.3M

Last deal: $1.3M

Status: UFA

Key stat: Over the last three seasons, Hudson owns the fourth most completions from Joe Burrow on third down. Not only that, but he specializes in working underneath against zone coverage. TruMedia has Hudson leading the team in success percentage per route against zone coverage over the last three years (17.7%). That’s higher than Ja’Marr Chase, Mike Gesicki or anyone else. As much as teams play zone and turn attention to the other receivers, there’s a sweet spot for Hudson’s skill set that meshes well with Burrow.

Where it stands: Hard to imagine Hudson wanting to play anywhere else or being valued more than he is in Cincinnati. Feels like an easy deal to get done even before free agency gets underway in a similar range as last year’s deal, perhaps with a bump in pay.

Chance of return: 90 percent

Joe Flacco

Position: Quarterback

Age (start of camp): 41

Career cash: $185.5M

Last deal: One year, $4.3M

Status: UFA

Key stat: During the six games Flacco started for the Bengals, Cincinnati ranked fifth in the NFL in points per drive at 2.44. That would rank in the top 10 of the NFL across the entire season. Flacco enjoyed one of the best stretches of his career statistically. He posted 0.04 EPA per dropback during his time with the Bengals this season.

Where it stands: Flacco doesn’t want to retire. He wants to play again next year. The question surrounds his options. He discussed the ability to be “selective” on Monday. There’s a good chance somebody views Flacco as a bridge quarterback for a young pick. He proved he can show up and perform like a total pro the moment he walks into a building. He made fans of everyone in Cincinnati — players, coaches and staff alike — for how his time went. The Bengals would love to have him back. Flacco did not discount the idea. There’s also the thought he could hang out with his family and, if an injury occurred, pick up the phone to come play. The Bengals will need to figure out a backup quarterback, but Flacco’s situation is so unique that it’s hard to know exactly where he lands. It does sound unlikely he signs in March to be Burrow’s backup, though. Any return would be a circumstantial waiting game.

Chance of return: 33 percent

Reserve level free agents

QB Jake Browning

Where it stands: There’s not much coming back from what went wrong with Browning during his three-game stretch as a starter this season. It made sense to prioritize him as a backup because the team had confidence he could do the job after what happened in 2023 when he kept the Bengals relevant following Burrow’s wrist injury. For similar reasons, it’s hard to see a path ahead here because of how poorly things went this time. Browning will have options because teams everywhere are searching for quarterbacks with quality experience. He’s shown that. Doubt that happens in Cincinnati, despite being almost universally liked internally.

Chance of return: 8 percent

G Cordell Volson

Where it stands: Volson missed the season with a shoulder injury sustained in August. Offensive line coach Scott Peters was excited to work with Volson, but it never came to fruition. It’s not impossible Volson returns to Cincinnati to compete for a backup role. His knowledge of the system, Peters and his teammates could help. It’s more likely he finds a change of scenery to compete.

Chance of return: 40 percent

CB Jalen Davis

Where it stands: Davis spent the first half of the season on the practice squad. Once he entered the lineup as the starting nickel inside Dax Hill and DJ Turner, the back end (and defense as a whole) stabilized. There’s a reason Davis was on the practice squad. His physical skills aren’t on the same level as others at the position, but his knowledge of the game and awareness popped off the tape down the stretch. His leadership was noted by staffers even before his promotion. They will want him back, and there’s no reason to believe Davis leaves in what should be an easy deal to get done.

Chance of return: 90 percent

S Tycen Anderson

Where it stands: A four-year special teams ace, there will be a push to keep him around. There’s clearly little trust he could play safety, considering he was never elevated over Stone this year, but he’d seem the ideal fourth safety to play if needed and dominate on special teams. His impact is limited slightly under the new rules with less need for speed on the dynamic kickoff, and there’s less punting in the NFL than ever. That said, he’s a solid piece. There will be interest in bringing him back. Keep an eye out for a team looking to make a big impact on special teams to potentially swoop in here, though. Reminiscent of Clayton Fejedelem and Cethan Carter in the recent past.

Chance of return: 55 percent

CB Marco Wilson

Where it stands: Wilson has fans in the building, hence his return last year. He could come back and be thrust into a competition, but more than likely, the Bengals will be looking to upgrade the depth here. He won’t be a priority, but could come back for the league minimum.

Chance of return: 50 percent

OG Lucas Patrick

Where it stands: With so much talk about the chemistry of the offensive line becoming a strength, Patrick figures into that mix as well. The 10-year veteran never ended up assuming the starting role that landed in the lap of Jalen Rivers and then was assumed by Risner. That doesn’t take away from the value he brings. Not only would he provide depth at guard, but he also serves as backup center to Karras — a spot where they currently have no realistic solution with little momentum behind 2024 seventh-rounder Matt Lee. This would be a league-minimum type of agreement.

Chance of return: 47 percent

LB Brian Asamoah

Where it stands: He joined the team in late October after being released by the Raiders, and the 26-year-old opened eyes on special teams. He could certainly return for camp and see if he can latch on in the back of the linebacker group.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/07163728/GettyImages-2243666298-scaled-e1767821880909.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-08 21:59:18.956325

Packers coach Matt LaFleur said it’s due to the field conditions being better than on their practice field.

Zach Tom injury update

Packers right tackle Zach Tom didn’t participate in the Jan. 8 practice.

LaFleur said during his pre-practice news conference that it’s a rest day. Tom missed the past three games of the regular season after exiting the Broncos game Dec. 14 with knee and back injuries. LaFleur said earlier this week that he expects Tom to be available for the wild-card matchup against the Bears.

“He’s looked good in practice,” LaFleur said Jan. 8. “But we’ll see. Like I tell you all the time, we’ll give him up to game time. If he can go, he’ll be out there.”

Packers receiver Dontayvion Wicks is still in the concussion protocol, per LaFleur.

Here are the notable injury updates and the injury reports for each of the six playoff teams this weekend.

Bears WR Rome Odunze back for Packers game

Caleb Williams will get a weapon back for his first NFL playoff game, with Rome Odunze off the injury list and ready to return. The second-year wide receiver has been out since Week 13 with a foot injury.

“I’m planning on playing,” Odunze said Wednesday. “But I’ve been planning on playing for weeks.”

Odunze was the Bears' leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown receptions when he exited the lineup. He said Wednesday his stamina isn't fully back yet, but he's confident he can help.

""As long as I have the option to be out there and contribute, I’m going to give it my all,"" Odunze said. ""I believe I can make a difference.”

Cornerback Kyler Gordon is also expected to play against the Green Bay Packers after missing the final five regular-season games with a groin issue. He is currently listed as ""questionable.""

""He looked good yesterday. We'll see what it looks like again today both him and Rome, you know,"" said head coach Ben Johnson. ""It's good to have them both back out there. They're excited. They're moving around well and we'll see if they can help us out this weekend.""

49ers get LT Trent Williams back at practice

San Francisco 49ers left tackle Trent Williams was seen in uniform at the start of Thursday's practice. The All-Pro sat out Wednesday as he's been dealing with a hamstring injury suffered in Week 17.

Williams usually rests on the first day of practice during a game week, but head coach Kyle Shanahan clarified this wasn't the case.

""No, he's still hurt,"" Shanahan said Wednesday. ""Hopefully, he'll be better and can get something in tomorrow, but I'm not sure where he'll be at tomorrow yet.""

Receiver Ricky Pearsall was also spotted, seen on a side field but in uniform. Shanahan said Wednesday that Pearsall aggravated the PCL injury that has limited him this season during Week 17.

Bills K Matt Prater (right quad) practices Thursday

Matt Prater did not practice on Wednesday, but the Buffalo Bills kicker was a full participant on Thursday after injuring his right quad against the New York Jets in Week 18.

Matthew Wright, who played four games this season with the Houston Texans, Washington Commanders and Tennessee Titans, was signed to the practice squad in case Prater cannot kick.

The 41-year-old Prater was 18-for-20 on field goal attempts and 46-for-49 on extra points during the regular season. He has not missed a field goal since Week 9 against the Kansas City Chiefs.

The Miami Dolphins fired their head coach after four seasons, the team announced on Thursday.

McDaniel ends his tenure with a 35-33 record and two playoff appearances in four seasons as head coach.

""After careful evaluation and extensive discussions since the season ended, I have made the decision that our organization is in need of comprehensive change. I informed Mike McDaniel this morning that he has been relieved of his duties as head coach,"" Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a statement. ""I love Mike and want to thank him for his hard work, commitment, and the energy he brought to our organization. Mike is an incredibly creative football mind whose passion for the game and his players was evident every day. I wish him and his family the best moving forward.""

The 2025 season began as the worst for the Dolphins since McDaniel's arrival. The team started 0-3 and picked up its first win of the year against the New York Jets on Monday Night Football in Week 4, a game in which it lost star receiver Tyreek Hill for the season with a devastating knee injury.

From there, the team blew late leads in back-to-back defeats against the Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Chargers. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa called out the Dolphins' ""leadership"" following their Week 6 loss to the Chargers, saying some players had been late or skipped meetings in prior weeks.

Following Tagovailoa's comments, the Dolphins traveled to Cleveland and got demolished 31-6 by the previously 1-5 Browns. However, they followed that up with a four-game winning streak in Weeks 10-14 before ultimately losing three of four games to finish out 7-10.

The Dolphins hired McDaniel in February 2022 to replace former head coach Brian Flores. McDaniel had spent one year as offensive coordinator with the San Francisco 49ers before making the leap to a head coaching position.

The hiring of McDaniel in 2022 coincided with the Dolphins' trade for Hill, and both aided Tagovailoa in getting the team to the playoffs at 9-8, the same record it had with Flores in 2021. The team fell 34-31 against the Buffalo Bills in the wild card round, which featured rookie Skylar Thompson at quarterback in place of Tagovailoa, who was in the NFL's concussion protocol.

McDaniel helped guide the Dolphins to an 11-6 record and another playoff berth in 2023, but their season ended in another wild card flameout, this time against the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs in frigid Kansas City.

The team went 6-5 in Tagovailoa's 11 starts in 2024, but the team went just 2-4 in games he missed and failed to make the playoffs at 8-9.

Looking to the Dolphins' future, Tagovailoa signed a franchise-record four-year, $212.4 million contract in July 2024. He has $54 million in guaranteed money and a $99.2 million dead cap hit for 2026, but he does not have any guaranteed money in his deal after next season. On March 15, $3 million of his 2027 salary becomes guaranteed, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.

On top of McDaniel's exit, the Dolphins also have a vacancy at general manager after they parted ways with Chris Grier midseason.

Many of the names, however, have not changed for the 49ers. Neither has much of the bitterness judging from the last two meetings.

The first came in the NFC Championship game in January 2023. Back then, 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, that year's Mr. Irrelevant in the NFL draft, was completing his rookie season going from third string to starter after injuries to Jimmy Garoppolo and Trey Lance, the No. 3 pick in 2021.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

Yet the Eagles knocked Purdy out of the game early with an elbow injury. Then his backup, Josh Johnson (remember him from last week leading the Commanders past the Eagles?) left with a concussion. Purdy tried coming back in the game, but was unable to throw. And the 49ers took some snaps with Christian McCaffrey as the quarterback.

It added up to a 31-7 Eagles demolition that put them in the Super Bowl.

The following season, the Eagles came into their Dec. 3, 2023, matchup with the 49ers with a 10-1 record, seemingly poised to make it back to the Super Bowl. And they took a 6-0 lead after the first quarter.

That's when Purdy got going, leading the 49ers to a 42-19 win.

During that game, Eagles chief of security Dom DiSandro was banished from the sideline after a skirmish between the two teams. DiSandro shoved 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw after he threw down Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith after a catch on the sideline.

That also started the Eagles' 1-6 collapse to end the 2023 season.

So here the two teams are again, facing each other in the playoffs. The Eagles still have Purdy, McCaffrey and star tight end George Kittle to worry about.

But the 49ers will look much differently on defense. Star edge rusher Nick Bosa and linebacker Fred Warner are out with injuries. And Warner's replacement, Tatum Bethune, was lost for the season after an injury last week against the Seahawks. Fellow linebacker Dee Winters, also injured against the Seahawks, might not play either.

Then again, the Eagles' offense hasn't exactly been a juggernaut this season. And the Eagles defense will have their hands full against the 49ers offense, especially if left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall are able to return from injury.

""There are a lot of familiar faces,"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. ""There are a bunch of guys that are really good players. This is why they’re still playing.""

Added Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who coincidentally had the same role with the 49ers a decade ago: ""Everything they do is with a purpose and they do a really good job of it. Obviously, Purdy operates it very well, McCaffrey's an elite back. They got a good group of receivers (and) Kittle at tight end.""

Martin Frank

Here comes the referendum on offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. If the Eagles can't outscore a 49ers' defense reeling from injuries, well, it's hard to see Patullo coming back next season. And really, the Eagles should have all of the advantages on offense: They're rested, healthy, at home, and seemingly ready to unleash QB Jalen Hurts and RB Saquon Barkley. Still, it's the Eagles' defense that will make the difference − again.

The pick: Eagles 30, 49ers 17

Greg Giesen

The 49ers' defense gave up 38 points to the Bears, 27 to Phillip Rivers and the Colts and 24 to the lowly Titans. I have no faith in San Francisco being able to stop the Eagles' offense. The only question is if the Eagles will ease up if they get a big lead. Thankfully, the game will be close.

The pick: Eagles 31, 49ers 20

Kevin Tresolini

Three years after their ill-fated NFC title game trip to Philly, the 49ers return for a wild-card round encounter in which the hosts are poised to again send them home hurting and humbled. The well-rested and big-play-capable Saquon Barkley could have a successful day against a San Francisco defense that has struggled to stop the run. The Eagles' defense has been too unyielding of late to underestimate and should be rarin' to rumble after a week watching.

The pick: Eagles 20, 49ers 16

Tom Rimback

How's this for a take that could cause me to lose my NFL pundit credentials? Kyle Shanahan is the most overrated offensive mind in the National Football League. Yeah, the Eagles squandered a shot at getting the No. 2 seed. Not great. All the great Shanahan did was score three points with the top seed and a bye on the line − at home. Three points!

The pick: Eagles 40, 49ers 6

Michelle Ganassi

Could this be the year I get my all-Pennsylvania Super Bowl? As a proud member of the Yinzer nation, I need to point out that Tomlin has not lost a Monday night game at Heinz Field (yes, I know that is not the name). But I digress. The Eagles have a tough matchup against the 49ers. But I think the 49ers' injuries, coupled with the Eagles' defense, will help them squeeze out another win at home.

The pick: Eagles 14, 49ers 7

Brad Myers

Remember the last time the 49ers played a playoff game in Philadelphia? It will be a little tougher for the Eagles this time because San Francisco will have a quarterback. But the Birds still win.

The pick: Eagles 17, 49ers 16

Tom Moore

This is another toss-up game for the Birds, whose defense must continue excelling to advance in the playoffs.

The pick: Eagles 20, 49ers 17

Tom McGurk

If 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy doesn't experience nightmares about facing the Birds' defense leading up to the game, he'll surely have them on the long flight back to San Francisco. The Eagles will set the tone with their defense and post a big sack total. And don't be surprised if the Birds get another home game next week.

The pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 12

Bob Jordan

Jalen Hurts hasn't thrown a pass in a game since Dec. 28. Not saying his first pass is going right to a 49er, but Bill Belichick never liked resting his starters in New England before the playoffs, once saying, ""It’s tough to go to your team and say, ‘Well, we’re not gonna play you guys over here, but the rest of you get out there. We don’t really care about you. If you get hurt, that doesn’t matter, but these six or seven guys we’re going to protect.’""

The pick: 49ers 20, Eagles 17

Bert Bainbridge

Simply put: The 49ers won't be able to overcome all of their injuries, especially on the defensive side of the ball, as the Birds cruise to the second round in their title defense.

The pick: Eagles 31, 49ers 17

Brandon Holveck

The Eagles force at least one turnover, giving Nick Sirianni's offense a short field for one of its two scores as Vic Fangio's defense swallows the limping 49ers.

The pick: Eagles 14, 49ers 10

Tom Haines

Counting on the Eagles defense to not only stifle the Niners high-powered offense, but to create some turnovers, giving the Birds' anemic offense some short-field opportunities.

The pick: Eagles 23, 49ers 20

Campbell missed four games with a knee injury before returning in Week 18. The rookie offensive tackle played 45 snaps in Sunday’s 38-10 win over the Miami Dolphins, putting him on track to play in New England’s first-round postseason showdown against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Campbell discussed his time away from the team with Alex Francisco on “Patriots Unfiltered.”

“It was terrible,” Campbell said. “The first time I ever missed games in my life, so watching from the sideline is not fun.”

However, the 22-year-old is relieved that he didn’t sustain a more significant injury that cost him the playoffs. Campbell initially feared a bad diagnosis after exiting New England’s Week 12 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.

“Whenever I first went down, the first thing I thought about was that I was down for the year,” Campbell said. “I automatically thought the worst when they started grabbing at my knee. No matter how long I had to sit out, I was just grateful and thankful that I was able to come back at some point.

“That makes you not take anything for granted, especially when the game’s never been taken away from you before. When it happens, you kind of don’t know what to do with yourself for a little bit. But I’m just glad to be back.”

Drake Maye and the Patriots are also glad to have Campbell back in the fold. The No. 4 pick began his NFL career by grading 32nd among eligible tackles on Pro Football Focus, allowing five quarterback hits and sacks in 782 snaps.

""So hopefully, returning him to the fold we get the benefits of all the things that I've just discussed.","The Steelers began their preparation for Monday night's Wild Card game against the Houston Texans, practicing at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.

The Steelers start the week a healthy group, with no major injuries coming out of last week's win over the Baltimore Ravens.

""In-game, we got some bumps and bruises associated with play that may limit some people at the early portions of week,"" said Coach Mike Tomlin. ""Thankfully we came out of it relatively well.""

One player who did miss practice on Thursday was running back Jaylen Warren, who is dealing with an illness.

Players who returned to the field last week, including linebacker T.J. Watt and receiver Calvin Austin III, among others, came out of the game without any issues.

""Everyone that returned to action last week from T.J. to Isaac Seumalo to Calvin Austin, James Pierre, Brandin Echols all were able to participate without any steps backwards,"" said Tomlin. ""So, thankful for that.

""Relatively healthy group as we lean in on a single elimination tournament.""

While he didn't miss the last two games because of an injury, the Steelers will get one of their key offensive weapons back on Monday night with the return of receiver DK Metcalf after he missed the last two games due to his suspension.

""Certainly, awesome to have DK back,"" said Tomlin. ""We're not going to exhale and think that DK automatically with his presence is going to be a difference or the difference.

""Football is the ultimate team game. It's going to require great effort from all parties involved, but certainly excited about doing it with him.

""I know that he's happy to be back. He's happy to be in this tournament. He's ready to go to work.""

In Metcalf's absence, Tomlin did see others step up and take advantages of opportunities, which will help the team moving forward.

""I think sometimes when you're lacking significant players it's opportunities for others to show what they're capable of and to accelerate growth and development and cohesion in other areas,"" said Tomlin. ""Adam Thielen for example is a new acquisition for us and he made some significant plays for us in recent weeks, and that cohesion has probably been accelerated.

""Scotty Miller is a guy that's always ready to make plays for us. He is not always given an opportunity, but certainly in the two years he's been here he's been a credible play maker when called upon. He's displayed some of that in some significant moments over the last several weeks as well.

""Our running backs have been a major component of our pass game in recent weeks. Maybe not down the field, but their ability to turn short into longer has bridged a gap for us in a lot of ways.

""I think we lead the league in yards after catch as a collective for the season. I think the running backs are central to that.

""And I think we all grow as strategists. I think as a collective, a coaching staff, when you're faced with adversity, it's important that you pivot.

""There is an expiration date on adjustments and certainly we had to make some adjustments. We felt the effects of it in Cleveland. It was reasonable to expect us all to be better. The players themselves, us as strategists, and I think we displayed that.

""So hopefully, returning him to the fold we get the benefits of all the things that I've just discussed. Our adaptability, the growth of individuals, the growth of continuity in new individuals, and you couple that with his presence, hopefully we are all continually collectively better.

Odunze has been dealing with a stress fracture in his foot since late October. His final action of the regular season came in Week 13 when the Bears beat the Eagles 24-15 and Odunze logged two catches for 8 yards.

After being ruled out against the Packers the following week, Odunze attempted to return against the Cleveland Browns but suffered a setback with his injury during pregame warmups that led to him being a late scratch. The Bears then shut Odunze down for the remainder of the regular season.

""I know he wants to be out there and helping,"" Bears coach Ben Johnson said Dec. 7. ""It's hard to tell him no sometimes. He just wants to be out on the field competing and contributing and helping our team win. So there may be a case where we have to protect him from himself a little bit and just make sure we get him right and he'll be able to help us down the road.""

Offensive coordinator Declan Doyle intimated that Odunze could have a smaller role than normal Saturday night. Odunze admitted that he is not in ""peak shape"" right now but said he has worked to keep his conditioning level where it needs to be.

""There might be some limitations; those are still to be discussed,"" Odunze said. ""For me, I'm looking to be out there as much as possible. Make as many plays as I can. At the end of the day, it's all or nothing for this game to make it to the Super Bowl until the end of the season. I want to contribute as much as possible and put everything that I have out there on the field. That's my mentality. Obviously the trainers and everybody has the scientific and the correct way of going about things. I respect those [opinions] too. It's going to be a little bit of clash at hand because of those things.""

Wide receivers DJ Moore (knee) and Jahdae Walker (illness), left tackle Ozzy Trapilo (quad), and cornerbacks Nick McCloud (illness) and Jaylon Jones (ankle) do not have injury designations for Saturday's game. Cornerback Kyler Gordon (groin) and offensive tackle Braxton Jones (knee) were full participants during Thursday's practice and await being activated off injured reserve. Both are listed as questionable.

The Packers, meanwhile, listed six players as questionable, including starting right tackle Zach Tom (back/knee), defensive back Javon Bullard (knee) and backup quarterback Malik Willis (right shoulder/hamstring).

After practicing on Tuesday and Wednesday, Tom did not practice on Thursday. Coach Matt LaFleur said they were giving him the day off from practice.

""He's looked good in practice,"" LaFleur said of Tom. ""Like I tell you all the time, we'll give him up 'til gametime, and if he can go, he'll be out there.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559694_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:03:04.995010

And I feel very good about Daniel Jones and where he's at, where he's going.
But I think Daniel Jones has got a really bright future here in Indianapolis.""
Jones' injury is not the only variable, as he will be a free agent in the spring.
""The history of guys coming back has been pretty good, and they've been older than Daniel,"" Ballard added.","INDIANAPOLIS -- Colts general manager Chris Ballard is on the clock if owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon is to be believed. Now, as he plots his next moves to get Indianapolis back to the playoffs and end a five-year drought, he plans to lean heavily on quarterback Daniel Jones to get them there.

That was one of the clear takeaways from Ballard's season-ending news conference Thursday, when he said the franchise strongly believes Jones can be the possible answer to its franchise quarterback void.

""I'm looking at him both near and long [term],"" Ballard said of Jones, adding, ""When you're chasing the quarterback all the time, it makes it very hard. Your margin for error really shrinks down. And I feel very good about Daniel Jones and where he's at, where he's going. Yes, he's got the Achilles. But I think Daniel Jones has got a really bright future here in Indianapolis.""

The Colts have been on a lengthy search for quarterback stability, fielding a different Week 1 quarterback in eight of the past nine seasons. Their 2023 first-round pick, Anthony Richardson Sr., faces an uncertain future after being benched temporarily last season, losing a preseason position battle with Jones in 2025 and suffering what would be a season-ending orbital fracture in October.

Jones joined the Colts last spring after an embattled six-year stint with the New York Giants and led them to an 8-2 start. But he sustained a torn right Achilles tendon in December, an injury that helped quicken the team's historic collapse with a season-ending seven-game losing streak.

Jones' injury is not the only variable, as he will be a free agent in the spring. The injury could complicate negotiations, but Ballard said he isn't concerned.

""Of course"" it will have an impact, Ballard said of the injury, ""but we'll work through that.""

Ballard's strong advocacy echoes the stance of coach Shane Steichen, who is perhaps the loudest voice at Colts headquarters on the merits of keeping Jones in the building. Together, Steichen and Jones helped generate historic offensive production in the first half of the season, when the Colts were on pace to shatter several franchise records.

As for the wisdom of relying heavily on Jones given his serious injury, Ballard said, ""It's a legitimate question. And you never know. I'm not a doctor and I'm not God in terms of knowing what the future's going to hold in his healing.""

""The history of guys coming back has been pretty good, and they've been older than Daniel,"" Ballard added. ""Daniel's 28 years old. He's a pretty freaky talent in terms of athletic ability. So I do feel confident he will make it back. Will he be the version you saw [in 2025] right away? Maybe not, but he's still going to be really good.""

Ballard's news conference was his first since the Colts traded for star cornerback Sauce Gardner in November, a deal that has been questioned in the months since given the way the season ended. Ballard sent two first-round picks and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to the New York Jets for Gardner, a two-time first-team All-Pro, with the idea that he could be an additional piece for a deep playoff push.

But Gardner joined Jones, cornerback Charvarius Ward, defensive tackle DeForest Buckner and other key players in suffering late-season injuries. Gardner struggled with a calf injury, effectively playing 2½ games' worth of snaps for the Colts, but Ballard defended the chance to add a 25-year-old top-tier cornerback.

""I kept asking myself, 'Look, would we get this guy in the draft?' Well, maybe we get a little luck. But you're talking about a premier guy who's been at Pro Bowls,"" Ballard said.

As for his own future, which was in question given the team's results, Ballard said he had multiple hourslong discussions with Irsay-Gordon in the past week that probed how he planned to move forward. He will be in the final year of contract next season and is on notice that improvement is expected.

""It starts with me,"" Ballard said. ""And until we win -- until we win big, win a division, go far into playoffs -- there's going to be doubt. That's real. I don't run away from that. I don't shy away from that.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1207%2Fr1586311_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 19:02:33.428604

Jacobs missed all of Week 12’s action against the Minnesota Vikings. He played the remaining five games of the year before taking off Week 18, another Vikings game, going into the playoffs.

Over the first nine games of the year, prior to his injury, Jacobs had played 68 percent of the offense’s total snaps. He only hit that number in any individual game one time since returning to the field, Week 14 against the Chicago Bears. Since that first Bears game, the Packers have been 0-4.

The Chicago Bears received good news as several key players are expected to return for their wild-card game against the Green Bay Packers.

Wide receiver Rome Odunze and cornerback Kyler Gordon appear poised to play, bolstering both the offense and defense.

The Bears will be without nickel cornerback C.J. Gardner-Johnson and rotational pass rusher Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, who are both in concussion protocol.

Receivers DJ Moore and Jahdae Walker, along with left tackle Ozzy Trapilo, have been cleared to play.

The Chicago Bears (11-6) shared their final injury report ahead of a wild-card matchup against the Green Bay Packers (9-7-1), where there were notable injuries and updates on both sides.

For the Bears, there's some good news regarding notable starters and prominent contributors. Wide receiver Rome Odunze and cornerback Kyler Gordon appear poised for a return to action, which will be key in defeating the Packers. Receiver DJ Moore and left tackle Ozzy Trapilo have been removed from the injury report and are good to go.

Here's a closer look at the injury report for the Bears entering Wild Card Weekend, as well as final game designations for Chicago and Green Bay:

Good news

Wide receiver Rome Odunze was a full participant during Thursday's practice and was not given an injury designation for Saturday night. That's a good indication that the former first-round wideout will be back in the lineup against the Packers.

Cornerback Kyler Gordon, who's missed most of the season with injury, is gearing up for a return from injured reserve. Gordon practiced all week, including in full on Thursday, and he's officially questionable. It sounds like Gordon is doing all he can to play Saturday night.

Rookie left tackle Ozzy Trapilo, who was sidelined last week with a quad injury, participated in full on Friday and is slated to be back along Chicago's offensive line for Saturday night.

Receivers DJ Moore (knee) and Jahdae Walker (illness) have also been cleared for Saturday night's game, which gives quarterback Caleb Williams his full arsenal of weapons.

Offensive tackle Braxton Jones, who's been on injured reserve most of the season, had a full week of practice and is gearing up for a return to the roster. He'd likely be the second or third option at left tackle behind Trapilo.

Reserve defensive backs and special team contributors Nick McCloud and Jaylon Jones do not have injury designations for Saturday night. And assuming Gordon can't go, with C.J. Gardner-Johnson sidelined, it would be McCloud getting the nod in the slot.

Bad news

The Bears will be without nickel cornerback C.J. Gardner-Johnson, who remains in concussion protocol. He's been ruled out and will not be on the field Saturday night. The hope is Kyler Gordon is able to suit up, as he's gearing up for a return from IR.

Chicago's pass rush is already lacking production, and they'll be without rotational piece Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, who has been ruled out with a concussion.

The Bears will also be without linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga (concussion), who is a core special teams contributor.

In April 2021, near his parents York County home, deputies said Phillip Adams shot Dr. Robert Lesslie; his wife, Barbara Lesslie; two of their grandchildren, Adah, 9, and Noah, 5; and two HVAC workers at the house, James Lewis and Robert Shook of Gaston County, N.C.

Adams, 32, died later that day after he shot himself as deputies surrounded his parents’ house, the York County sheriff’s office has said.

But after a Boston doctor said in December 2021 that Adams had brain injuries consistent with concussions that could come from football, Adams’ father, Alonzo, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Orangeburg County. The Adams family sued the NFL, NFL Properties, and South Carolina State University, where Phillip Adams played college football.

The lawsuit claims Adams suffered financial and emotional losses from his football injuries. He played in the NFL from 2010 to 2015 with the San Francisco 49ers, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, Oakland Raiders, New York Jets and Atlanta Falcons, after starring at S.C. State and Rock Hill High School.

The NFL and S.C. State have denied Adams’ claims of negligence, court documents in the case show.

The NFL and the college both sought to have the case dismissed, but South Carolina state court Judge Charles McCutchen ruled Wednesday the case filed in South Carolina civil court can move forward in Orangeburg County, documents show.

McCutchen ruled that Rock Hill’s Craig Wilkerson and Gedney Howe IV of Charleston, lawyers for the Adams family, showed enough to keep the negligence lawsuit going.

The lawsuit alleges the NFL was “engaging in activity which caused concussion and head trauma to Phillip Matthew Adams and latent neurological damage, illnesses, and decline that arise from those head impacts.”

Wednesday’s ruling in state court comes after a federal judge earlier refused to dismiss the case before it was sent to state court.

Timing and brain injury called CTE

Adams’ family claims in the lawsuit he suffered from concussions and had chronic traumatic encephalopathy — a brain condition called CTE sometimes found in former football players that is caused by repeated head trauma.

The judge ruled in favor of the family about the timing of the lawsuit. Adams had not played in the NFL for years when he died.

Yet the Adams family did not know and could not know Adams had CTE until after his death, because the disease can only be found in the brain after death.

“The statute of limitations not only did not run out prior to Plaintiff bringing his claim for negligence, Plaintiff had no legal right to sue for the wrongful death of Decedent until after Decedent’s death, and the diagnosis of CTE was only able to be made posthumously,” McCutchen wrote.

What happens next?

The judge also declined to issue a “summary judgment” that S.C. State sought that would have taken the college out of the case.

The judge also compelled the NFL to send Adams’ lawyers several documents about the NFL’s business practices in South Carolina, including all contracts and agreements entered into by the NFL Properties regarding the failed Carolina Panthers headquarters and practice facility that was supposed to be built in Rock Hill but failed.

Davante Adams Injury Update: Will Rams WR Play in Wild Card Game vs. Carolina?

The injury report lists Adams with a hamstring injury, and his status looks hopeful after being a full participant at Tuesday’s practice. Furthermore, coach Sean McVay said on Monday he expects Adams to be available.

Los Angeles’ veteran wideout hasn’t made a full appearance since Week 13, as he posted snap shares of 42.9% and 45.8% in Week 14 and 15. In his last full outing, Adams recorded 4 catches, 58 receiving yards, and 2 receiving touchdowns on 5 targets. Despite dealing with an injury late in the regular season, the six-time Pro Bowler still led the league with 14 receiving touchdowns.

PrizePicks is projecting 4 receptions, 55.5 receiving yards, and a 13-point fantasy score.

With the Rams’ scoring machine expected to return to the lineup, how could this impact the team’s fantasy football outlook?

Rams’ Fantasy Football Outlook

According to PlayerProfiler, Adams sports a lofty 35.6% red zone target share, and his 24.8% target share (14th) and 1,444 air yards (11th) point to a healthy workload.

He averages 8.1 targets, 4.3 receptions, 56.4 receiving yards, and 1.0 receiving touchdown per contest. The former Fresno State Bulldog has been a red zone monster, racking up 11 receiving touchdowns over his last eight games. If Adams returns, his fellow pass catchers' will likely see fewer scoring opportunities.

Adams and Rams WR Puka Nacua could dominate the receiving workload, boasting 166 and 114 targets this season. The next-highest mark is only 56 targets from Parkinson.

Over Week 17 and 18, the Rams’ tight ends stepped up to the plate, most notably Colby Parkinson, who totaled 6.0 targets, 4.0 receptions, and 53.5 receiving yards per game in the split. For context, he averages only 3.7 targets, 2.9 catches, and 27.2 receiving yards per contest on the season. PrizePicks projects Parkinson to have 19.5 receiving yards for Saturday.

Rams rookie TE Terrance Ferguson also posted 2 receptions and 54 receiving yards per game in Week 17, compared to his 0.8 catches and 16.5 receiving yards per contest on the season.

In short, this passing attack could be a two-man show on Saturday.

Adams is tracking to make his return at the perfect time, giving the Rams’ receiving corps a touchdown magnet. With Los Angeles’ standout WR2 back in action, the Rams’ tight ends production could take a step back on Wild Card Weekend.

Every week, I will review each team’s updated minutes per game to see which players are seeing the court more or less than in previous weeks. With this information in hand, I’ll try to discuss any relevant fantasy risers or fallers; players who we should be adding off waivers or removing from our teams.

The charts below are also great for exploring on your own. You can track the minutes over the last three, five, and ten games, and for the entire season, to see which trends stand out to you.

All of this data was made accessible by Kyle Bland, who is incredibly talented and also extremely generous. Be sure to follow him to check out all of his baseball data as well.

Atlanta Hawks

Well, it’s official, Trae Young is now a member of the Washington Wizards. My colleague Kurt Helin covered the fallout from that trade, so check that out. Young has missed the last six games with a quad injury that will probably magically heal when he arrives in Washington. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has been a top-70 player in the last six games that Young has been out, and stands to benefit the most in a trade since he could become a starter. Onyeka Okongwu and Dyson Daniels would also continue to be top-50 players now that Young is no longer in town.

Boston Celtics

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Derrick White36.135.835.5Payton Pritchard34.934.134.3Jaylen Brown34.634.534.4Anfernee Simons23.92624.2Sam Hauser23.923.722.7Neemias Queta23.924.624.3Luka Garza20.921.321.6Jordan Walsh20.61615.9Hugo González14.315.821.6

The Celtics’ situation has remained steady, and they have been much better than many expected. For fantasy purposes, the only truly relevant players are Derrick White, Jaylen Brown, and Payton Pritchard. It’s best not to hunt on the margins for others.

Brooklyn Nets

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Michael Porter Jr.35.235.533.7Day’Ron Sharpe30.624.721.2Noah Clowney30.128.228.5Egor Dëmin28.829.729.3Terance Mann24.825.926.1Ziaire Williams23.624.421.2Danny Wolf23.323.822Cam Thomas23.22221.5Nic Claxton23.127.628.6

The Nets got both Egor Dëmin and Terance Mann back last week and have become a feistier team of late, thanks to their strong defense. They’re still not a particularly good team, and really only Michael Porter Jr. and Nic Claxton have much fantasy value. Claxton missed two games this week for personal reasons, and Day’Ron Sharpe stepped up in his absence, but it seems like Zaire Williams would be the player who gains the most playing time if/when Porter Jr. gets traded. Dëmin is also developing pretty nicely as a rookie and shooting the ball well of late.

Charlotte Hornets

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Brandon Miller33.733.532.8Miles Bridges3333.930.1Kon Knueppel31.231.929.8Moussa Diabaté29.528.929.4Sion James2626.224.7LaMelo Ball25.626.626.3Collin Sexton22.224.321.9PJ Hall18.818.216.6Tidjane Salaün16.818.120.3

Ryan Kalkbrenner has now missed nine straight games, which has led Moussa Diabaté to be a top 100 player, while averaging 31 minutes a game over the last two weeks. We also saw Tidjane Salaün starting to come into his own a bit before an ankle injury caused him to miss a couple of games. This team has four intriguing young players, but I’m not sure the fit with all of them is particularly great. I’m curious to see if the Hornets make a move at the deadline.

Chicago Bulls

The Bulls remain without Josh Giddey (hamstring) and Coby White (calf), and I discussed all the repercussions of this in a video last week. Jalen Smith has also now missed a few games with a concussion, which has led to an increase in minutes for Patrick Williams. Smith’s name has also come up in trade rumors, so Williams could have more consistent playing time if that happened, especially as Zach Collins (toe) remains sidelined.

Cleveland Cavaliers

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Donovan Mitchell34.133.331.9Evan Mobley33.531.629Darius Garland32.431.531Jarrett Allen31.729.526.1Sam Merrill29.326.826.7Jaylon Tyson25.525.824.9Craig Porter Jr.24.623.520De’Andre Hunter23.823.924.3

On one hand, Darius Garland is starting to look healthier, which is great news for the Cavaliers. On the other hand, Max Strus (foot) was ruled out for yet another month and won’t return until the middle of February at the earliest. That should continue to lead to more minutes for Dean Wade, who has supplanted De’Andre Hunter in the starting lineup, but Wade is also dealing with a minor knee contusion of his own. Jarrett Allen has been paying off his uptick in minutes and has been a top-90 player over the last two weeks, so we can hope that role continues.

Dallas Mavericks

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Anthony Davis37.237.233.1Cooper Flagg35.435.236.3Max Christie33.331.728.2Naji Marshall29.128.629.9Brandon Williams24.926.324.2P.J. Washington23.227.429.9Klay Thompson20.921.422.4Daniel Gafford17.620.317.8Ryan Nembhard15.616.120.3

Except for their few season-ending injuries, the Mavericks have been pretty healthy of late. Anthony Davis continues to be rested here and there, and we do expect him to be traded, but he’s been a top-60 player over the last two weeks, and he and Cooper Flagg work well with one another. Brandon Williams continues to own the starting point guard role and has been a top-100 player over the last two weeks, averaging 19 points, 4.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.0 steals per game.

Denver Nuggets

We know that Nikola Jokić will miss a month due to a knee injury, and Cameron Johnson is still sidelined. However, the Nuggets have gotten back both Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun this week. I covered the fallout of that in a video.

Detroit Pistons

The Pistons had been one of the healthiest teams in the league so far this season, but now they are dealing with injuries to Jalen Duren (ankle), Tobias Harris (hip), and Caris LeVert (knee). I covered the ripple effects of that in a video this week.

Golden State Warriors

Draymond Green has been battling an ankle injury, as well as his own boredom and ejections, over the last few weeks. He remains a borderline top-100 player in fantasy basketball because he contributes a little bit across the board, but there’s no “buy low” type of situation here. Other than that, this team is driven by Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler, along with a collection of other players who occasionally contribute.

The Rockets lost Alperen Sengun to an ankle injury right after he was battling a calf injury. Steven Adams, who was also battling his own ankle injury, should see the biggest uptick in minutes and usage, but Jabari Smith Jr. will also be relied on more. He’s been a top 100 player over the last two weeks, averaging 15 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 1.0 blocks per game. I covered all the ripple effects of the Sengun injury in a video this week.

The Packers are relatively healthy aside from Isaiah Jackson (concussion), who wasn’t playing much anyway, and Bennedict Mathurin, who will now be sidelined for “a while” with a thumb injury. We also know the Pacers aren’t trying as they look to add a top-three pick to a roster that will be getting back Tyrese Haliburton next season.

Just after the team got Derrick Jones Jr. back, he’s now sidelined for the next six weeks with a Grade 2 MCL sprain. James Harden has also been dealing with a shoulder injury that caused him to miss one game, but Kawhi Leonard has been electric this season and is a top-five player in all of fantasy basketball over the last two weeks. Ivica Zubac returned over the weekend and was up to 33 minutes in his last game, so he should return to his regular role after missing five games. That pushed Brook Lopez back to the bench and cut into minutes and usage for John Collins.

Last week, we covered the injuries to Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura, so little has changed for the Lakers this week. This remains a two-man team with Luka Doncic and LeBron James, and LeBron in particular has really come on of late, pushing up top-20 value over the last two weeks.

Ja Morant has missed the last three games with a calf injury, Cedric Coward has missed the last two with an ankle injury, and Brandon Clarke remains sidelined with a calf injury. Oh, and Zach Edey is still out for another week, and Ty Jerome is probably out another week or two. Did I miss anything? Morant had actually been turning the corner before the calf injury, averaging 23.5 points, 7.8 assists, 2.3 rebounds, and 1.3 steals over the last two weeks. The Grizzlies had lost most of those games, but that’s another story. There’s a chance we see this team fully healthy by the middle of this month, and that could be fun.

Tyler Herro returned after missing 11 games with a toe injury, and I recorded a video on the fallout from that this week. We should note that Jaime Jaquez Jr. has missed the last two games with an ankle injury, so even though Herro did come back, this team is not at full strength. When they are, I think we see Nikola Jović take a hit in both his minutes and usage.

The Bucks are fully healthy right now (well, aside from Taurean Prince being out), so the minutes allotment of late is what we should expect going forward. It’s been nice to see Ryan Rollins remain productive with both Kevin Porter Jr. and Giannis Antetokounmpo playing nearly 30 minutes a game. Rollins has remained a fringe top-50 player over the last two weeks with Giannis back. I’m still a bit confused why this team traded for Myles Turner when he is not really bringing much to the table, but that’s a conversation for another time. Kyle Kuzma has seen a drop in his minutes and production with this team healthy.

Terrance Shannon is out for a couple of weeks with a foot injury, and while that doesn’t really impact the rotation, he’s an intriguing young player. Everything else is pretty much status quo here, and it’s interesting to see Naz Reid continue to be productive and a fringe top-100 player in fantasy leagues despite this team being fully healthy and him playing fewer minutes.

Herbert Jones missed seven games with an ankle and then returned for one game and sat out the second game in a back-to-back. We should expect him to ramp back up in the coming weeks. Trey Murphy III also had a historically good week, which I covered in a video here, but then he sat out the second game in the back-to-back as well, so Bryce McGowen got some extra usage. Saddiq Bey has missed the last four games with a hip injury, but nobody really stepped up to fill his spot. It’s really just been Murphy III, Derik Queen, and Zion Williamson. Of course, Dejounte Murray could be back in a week or two, so that could make things interesting.

Josh Hart has missed seven games with an ankle injury, and, boy, does this team need him. In addition to his defense, the team has sorely lacked the toughness and grit that he brings when he’s on the court. They did rebound nicely in a win over the Clippers on Wednesday, and it seems that Mike Brown has started to shorten his rotation a bit after the losing streak, which led to fewer minutes for guys like Tyler Kolek and Kevin McCullar Jr. We know who the studs are here, and that’s unlikely to change.

The Thunder are battling a CVS receipt list of injuries, but none of them seem overly serious. Isaiah Hartenstein has missed the last six games with a calf injury, Alex Caruso has missed the last two with a back injury, and Jaylin Williams has been out since December 13th with a heel injury. This team is plenty deep, so they’ve been able to transfer the minutes around, but, from a fantasy perspective, really only Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren, and Jalen Williams can be counted on regularly, with Ajay Mitchell also hanging around as a fringe top-100 player.

Jalen Suggs returned last week from his hip injury and then suffered a knee injury that will keep him out indefinitely. We’ve already seen how the Magic disperse their minutes without Suggs, but I covered it in more detail in a video this week. We could also get Franz Wagner back this weekend, so that would be a big boost for the Magic and a big hit to Tristan da Silva’s or Jase Richardson’s minutes.

Kelly Oubre Jr. returned on Wednesday for the first time since November 14th. He played just 20 minutes, but we should expect that number to rise in the coming weeks. With Oubre back, we saw Jared McCain play just 10 minutes, and Quentin Grimes was down to 26, which is a little dip from where he was previously. We should expect those three to siphon some minutes off of each other, but it will be curious to see if Oubre will supplant Dominick Barlow in the starting lineup. Grimes is the only fantasy-relevant player that Oubre would impact, but it’s a situation to monitor.

The Suns are inching closer to getting Jalen Green back from a hamstring injury, and it will be interesting to see how he fits into this team. Collin Gillespie has been a top 75 player in fantasy basketball over the last month, averaging 13.8 points, 5.2 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.9 steals. It would make sense that he loses some minutes when Green returns, but it’s really hard to take him off the court. Green’s minutes would then have to come at the expense of Jordan Goodwin, who has been solid in a reserve role this season. Grayson Allen also returned for two games after missing 11 games with a knee injury, so the Suns have kept his minutes pretty low for now. We’ve also seen Dillon Brooks be a fringe top-100 fantasy player without Green on the court. It’s hard to see that continuing when Green comes back and soaks up usage.

The Blazers have been without Jrue Holiday and Jerami Grant for a while now, but both of them could return this weekend. That would take away a lot of the playing time for Caleb Love and move both Siddy Cissoko and Kris Murray back into smaller roles.

Keegan Murray will be sidelined for three weeks with a back injury, and the Kings will likely remain without Domantas Sabonis for another two weeks. That will lead to increased playing time for Precious Achiuwa, but the offensive burden is going to be taken on by Zach LaVine, who returned from an ankle injury, Russell Westbrook, and DeMar DeRozan. Maxime Raynaud is playing tons of minutes and is a great story, but he’s not a great fantasy asset.

Devin Vassell has missed five games with an oblique injury, which has led to Julian Champagnie getting plenty more run, including a tremendous performance against the Knicks on New Year’s Eve. Victor Wembanyama is still having his minutes monitored, but he’s been productive, and the Spurs are winning, so we may have to assume that continues, which is why Luke Kornet continues to see solid minutes. More minutes than Dylan Harper, who has clearly taken a backseat in the Spurs’ trio of talented guards.

We now have five games with RJ Barrett back from his knee injury, so it’s clear how this Raptors’ rotation is shaking out. Jamal Shead, Ja’Kobe Walter, and Ochai Agbaji have seen their minutes decrease while Collin Murray-Boyles continues to play good minutes and has actually been a borderline top 100 fantasy player over the last two weeks. That could also be due to the Raptors being cautious with Jakob Poeltl’s back. Barrett has settled in, averaging 20.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in his five games back, and both he and Immanuel Quickley remain top-75 fantasy assets alongside Brandon Ingram and Scottie Barnes, who should be an All-Star.

Not much to see with this Utah team. Ace Bailey returned after missing five games with a hip injury, but he will likely take a while to have his minutes ramped up. Jusuf Nurkić has been a real asset for the Jazz lately, and this team is feisty. I recorded a video this week covering Nurkić and also the Jazz conundrum about whether to tank or risk losing their first-round pick.

WR Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle)

Limited:

TE George Kittle (ankle)

LB Luke Gifford (quad)

Kyle Shanahan doesn’t have a strict rule about playing players who haven’t practiced all week. It’s dependent on the player, according to Shanahan: “Whether they’ve done it before. What is the history of the player and stuff like that?”

Wednesday isn’t a rest day for Williams, as it typically was during the regular season. Shanahan is hopeful that Williams will be better on Thursday and can get some work in, but wasn’t sure as of today.

As for Pearsall, Shanahan said he reaggravated his PCL injury during Week 17’s game after acknowledging the 49ers didn’t have any physical practices last week. Pearsall is in the same boat as Williams.

White was one of two pass rushers to produce last week. He’s the team’s best interior pass rusher. White’s absence from the game would be a big blow to the 49ers’ rotation up front.

Shanahan said Kyzir White will practice today. Shanahan noted that what he sees will determine how they use White. With Winters out, there is a starting spot available. Shanahan shared that Brandon Staley helped influence the decision to sign White, calling him smart and instinctive. White played for Gus Bradley, the 49ers’ current assistant head coach, from 2017 to 2020 when Bradley was the defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers.

This is the first normal week of practice for the 49ers since the first week of December. The 49ers get an extra day this week. They looked like a team playing its third game in 13 days under the national spotlight.

Odunze was on track for a second-year breakout with the Bears before his foot injury, having become a clear focal point of head coach Ben Johnson’s new offensive system.
While the status of Odunze is bound to draw the most attention, the Bears also have a few other receivers they must clear from the injury report before playing the Packers.
While he will have Thursday’s practice to earn a clean bill of health, the Bears could rule him questionable on the injury report if he remains limited.
No other Bears wide receivers are listed on the injury report.","Chicago Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze seems to have every intention of playing against the Green Bay Packers in the wild-card round of the playoffs.

According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Odunze has been recovering from a stress fracture in his left foot that sidelined him for the final five games of the regular season and forced the Bears to punch their playoff ticket without one of their top playmakers.

He initially played through the pain for several weeks after injuring his foot in October, but he missed his first career game in Week 14 and then had a setback during pregame warmups before Week 15’s game that prompted the team to shut him down for longer.

Throughout Odunze’s injury, though, the Bears have expressed optimism that keeping him out in recent weeks would improve his chances of playing for them in the playoffs. And according to Odunze himself, that is still very much the plan against the Packers.

“I’m planning on playing, but I’ve been planning on playing for weeks,” Odunze said after practice on Wednesday, January 8, via The Chicago Tribune’s Brad Biggs.

Rome Odunze Was Breaking Out Before Foot Injury

The Bears have managed in the passing game without Odunze in the lineup, but getting him back on the field against the Packers would provide a massive boost — especially if he manages to pick back up right where he left off when he first injured his left foot.

Odunze was on track for a second-year breakout with the Bears before his foot injury, having become a clear focal point of head coach Ben Johnson’s new offensive system. He caught 20 passes for 296 yards and five touchdowns in his first four games alone and was still the team’s leader in receptions (44), receiving yards (661) and targets (90) heading into Week 16’s game against the Packers — after he’d missed two games.

Even if Odunze is not back to full strength, he can help against the Packers.

The question now is whether the Bears will clear Odunze. He returned to practice for the first time in three weeks on January 2 for Week 18’s final walkthrough for Detroit and has maintained his limited participation through the first two practice days of the wild-card round; although, the Bears have only held one practice in the short week.

The Bears must decide whether Odunze will carry an injury designation into the wild-card game against the Packers after January 8’s final practice, but they can also wait to make any decisions about his status until game day, so long as they don’t rule him out.

Will Bears Have All WRs Available Against Packers?

While the status of Odunze is bound to draw the most attention, the Bears also have a few other receivers they must clear from the injury report before playing the Packers.

The Bears have listed veteran wide receiver DJ Moore as a limited participant for each of their first two practice days after adding him to the injury report with a knee injury at the start of the week. While he will have Thursday’s practice to earn a clean bill of health, the Bears could rule him questionable on the injury report if he remains limited.

The Bears also have undrafted rookie wide receiver Jahdae Walker — who has taken on a larger role in the last month — on the injury report with an illness, but that seems to be trending in the right direction. He went from an estimated non-participant on Tuesday to a full participant in Wednesday’s first actual practice for the Packers.

Of course, he’d never say as much — that would imply the defense can’t carry its weight — but one of the NFL’s top quarterbacks is at least capable of willing the Green Bay Packers to victory with his right arm if need be.

“There’s nobody else I’d rather have than Jordan,” coach Matt LaFleur said.

Just a coach fluffing up his quarterback? Or would the lie detector needle barely budge, if at all?

LaFleur’s statement isn’t as far-fetched as some might think. Love trailed only Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye in MVP odds entering Week 15. Love lit up the AFC’s top seed in the first half that week before the Packers’ season unraveled in the second half — first with Micah Parsons tearing an ACL and then with a blown 9-point lead while the Denver Broncos had Love under siege. That 8-point defeat spearheaded Green Bay’s four-game losing streak to close the regular season.

Love suffered a concussion midway through the second quarter the next week at Soldier Field and hasn’t played since. Rust? The 27-year-old isn’t concerned about it as he waltzes into the same stadium Saturday night for a wild-card round bout between the No. 7 seed Packers and No. 2 seed Chicago Bears. Perhaps it should be the Bears who are concerned instead, given Love’s ascension this season into, or at least near, the top tier of the league’s most important position.

“I like the look in Jordan’s eye,” offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich said. “He’s hungry. He’s ready.”

Love is no stranger to playoff football going into his third postseason. He sautéed the Dallas Cowboys in his first playoff game two years ago as the No. 7 seed before stumbling late against the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round and then again in Philadelphia during last year’s wild-card round. Nobody’s excusing those performances from No. 10. They weren’t good enough. But the 2025 season has been his best yet, even after extended stretches of brilliance in 2023 and 2024.

This season, Love ranked second in expected points added per dropback behind only Maye, sixth in passer rating, fifth in completion percentage above expectation, ninth in on-target percentage and tied the Philadelphia Eagles’ Jalen Hurts for the fewest interceptions (six) among players with at least 400 passes (via TruMedia and Next Gen Stats). Love also ranked fifth in average intended air yards per target among players with at least 400 attempts, so it’s not like he was Charlie Checkdown, either. The numbers support what the eye test also indicates: Love might not be the league’s best quarterback, but he’s not far off, either.

“He’s a big reason why I even decided to come (to Green Bay). I believed in him before I even seen him on a day-to-day basis,” running back Josh Jacobs said. “Seeing him on a day-to-day basis, just the way he works and the type of leader he is and his throwing ability is crazy. … He’s just one of those guys, man. He’s a special player, and I can’t wait for him to be able to have this opportunity to show the world.”

You’d be hard-pressed to find a quarterback with a more fitting temperament for the upcoming moment. There aren’t many more cliché descriptions of a player than calm, cool and collected, but Love’s headshot sits next to those words in the dictionary. Love’s mother and late father were police officers and saw some gruesome things on the job, but they put that aside at home to raise Love and his three sisters. Love’s father was a youth pastor at their church, too.

“There’s so many situations that came up with kids at church and just different upbringings of people and things that might (be) going on with their family, and you just gotta be calm,” Love told The Athletic last season. “Seeing him kind of react to any situation and find an answer for it or solution for it definitely has helped me in my life and football, and it’s like being a quarterback. You plan for certain things to go right on a play and you gotta react to what the defense is doing and be as calm as possible and just kind of have a solution for everything, so it definitely applies on the football field.”

Added Jacobs: “He’s kinda who he is, which is the thing I love the most about him, because the moments are never too big. He’s never really rattled in those situations.”

Soldier Field is going to be loud. The Packers might be down 7 late in the game needing Love to make a play. If anything, he won’t be flustered. His penchant for trudging on through adversity in college and the NFL is in part what convinced general manager Brian Gutekunst that Love was worthy of a $220 million payday on the eve of 2024 training camp. His ability to throw from any platform, whether a play stays on schedule, is a bonus. He’s also protected the ball far better this season than in his first two as a starter, an encouraging sign considering he threw five interceptions over the Packers’ last two postseason losses. That’s the full package you need to win a playoff game.

“It’s win or go home,” Love said. “Just gotta go out there, play your best ball and execute at a high level or else you’re going home.”

But can Love pick up where he left off after more than 2 1/2 games sidelined? Bears defensive end Austin Booker and Love collided heads on that Saturday night in early December, dealing Love his first documented concussion in the NFL. Jacobs said this week that a lot of players took Booker’s hit on their quarterback personally, even if Love appeared to lower his head into it. Nonetheless, the Packers didn’t clear Love from concussion protocol until after their Week 17 loss against the Baltimore Ravens, and Love didn’t play in Week 18 with nothing at stake against the Minnesota Vikings.

The Packers ratcheted up practice intensity last week knowing many starters wouldn’t face the Vikings. Love has been practicing since before the Ravens game, and the Packers were preparing for him to start that week. He can’t simulate taking hits in practice, but he said games sometimes feel slower than practice. It’s not like he’s missed a boatload of time, either, so he doesn’t expect Saturday night to shock his system.

“I don’t have any concern about that,” Love said bluntly in an uncharacteristically short answer to a question about potential rust.

“He’s looked great, man,” wide receiver Jayden Reed said. “J-Love is J-Love … faith is extremely high for him. I’ve never lost hope or anything in J-Love. I know the work he puts in every day. It’s going to show out there on Sunday, Saturday, whatever day we play.”

“He’s the biggest part of our offense,” wide receiver Christian Watson said. “Just to have him back, I think it’s only gonna elevate everybody else’s game.”

Though Love has proven he’s one of the game’s most talented quarterbacks, playoff success raises that status to another stratosphere. To be universally considered elite, he needs to take the Packers on a deep run. Their best chance of making one, given deficiencies on defense and special teams, is for Love to carry them.

Now is his chance to put the team on his back.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/07195729/GettyImages-2254626546-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-08 15:01:27.043050
