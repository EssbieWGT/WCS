In a season already defined by roster attrition, the Commanders lost rookie wide receiver Jaylin Lane early in Saturday’s Week 16 clash against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Lane suffered an ankle injury in the first quarter and was initially listed as questionable to return. Unfortunately for Washington, the medical staff quickly downgraded him to OUT, ending his night before it really began.

Lane made his presence felt almost immediately before the injury. On the opening kickoff, Eagles returner Will Shipley coughed up the football, and Washington recovered deep in Philadelphia territory to set up an early field goal. While reports gave conflicting accounts on the specific recovery scrum, Lane was in the mix on special teams, an area where he has been a bright spot for head coach Dan Quinn. Just last week, Lane scored a touchdown off a fumble recovery against the New York Giants.

The Packers lost Jordan Love in the second quarter, when the quarterback exited the pivotal contest with a concussion.

With first place in the NFC North on the line, Green Bay had to turn to Malik Willis in relief of Love. Chicago prevailed in overtime, 22-16, and Green Bay has to hold its breath down the stretch.

There are just two games left in the regular season and no timetable for Love's return to action. It could be a big blow to a team that came into the year with Super Bowl aspirations, especially after losing Micah Parsons for the season with a torn ACL in Week 15.

Here's what to know about the Packers quarterback.

What happened to Jordan Love?

Love suffered a concussion in the second quarter of the Packers' Week 16 contest against the Bears.

Austin Booker delivered the hit on Love with 8:16 remaining in the first half. The defensive lineman lowered his head, connecting with a helmet-to-helmet hit on the quarterback, who also appeared to lower his head in preparation for the collision.

The hit prompted a 15-yard penalty on Chicago for roughing the passer, but the trade-off was Green Bay losing their starting quarterback for the game.

Love remained on the ground after the play with his eyes closed and his helmet dislodged.

Trainers quickly tended to Love, who ran off the field under his own power and into the blue medical tent. A short time later, the quarterback was taken to the locker room.

Jordan Love injury updates

Love was ruled out of Week 16 with a concussion.

He was initially listed as questionable to return, but failed to gain clearance for a return to play. Love completed 8 of 13 passes for 77 yards before leaving the game.

The Packers had a 3-0 lead over the Bears when he exited.

How long is Jordan Love out?

Love doesn't have a timetable for a return to play.

The quarterback is at the mercy of the league's concussion protocol and will have to clear all five steps before getting back into game action.

Head coach Matt LaFleur didn't have an update after the contest, leaving Love's status uncertain moving forward. Despite playing on Saturday, they won't have the added benefit of extra rest heading into Week 17, when they'll play another Saturday game.

It's not easy to clear the protocol and return to play in the same week. Without a timetable, there's a risk that Love's absence could potentially extend into the postseason.

Green Bay is clinging to the final playoff spot in the NFC, but remain in a good spot with two games to go.

What is concussion protocol in the NFL?

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury. It's a five-step process that a player has to clear before they can return to play. Those steps are, as defined by the NFL:

Symptom limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

Before a player enters the protocol, they are evaluated on the sideline. The tests are conducted by the team's physician and unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant. The evaluation includes observing any ""no-go"" symptoms, which are things like loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia and more, in addition to history of concussions, other signs/symptoms and video review.

At that point, a neurological exam is conducted and the player is escorted to the locker room if the sideline evaluation leaves any doubt.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/21/USAT/87871094007-jordan-love-122125.jpg?crop=2993,1684,x472,y175&width=2993&height=1684&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-21 10:59:41.347517

On the first drive of the second half, Mariota pulled up after running toward the sideline and is now questionable to return.

On a third-down play, Mariota escaped the pocket and threw the ball away after trying to buy some extra time. Eagles defensive lineman Jordan Davis was in pursuit when Mariota finished the play awkwardly. As Washington sent the punt unit out, Mariota was in clear discomfort on the sideline.

During the Eagles' ensuing possession, backup quarterback Josh Johnson warmed up while Mariota jogged off the field and toward the locker room.

The Commanders reported that Mariota was evaluated for a concussion during a brief stint in the injury tent. While Mariota cleared the concussion protocol, he is still being evaluated for a right hand injury.

Before exiting the game, Mariota completed seven of his 14 passing attempts for 95 yards. He only had one rushing attempt, which lost a yard.

With star quarterback Jayden Daniels sidelined for most of the season, Mariota has now started eight games. Entering Saturday, Mariota had completed 62.0% of his passes for 1,600 yards, 10 touchdowns and seven interceptions while adding 298 yards and a score on the ground.

Johnson, 39, replaced the injured Mariota, and it marks his first real action of the 2025 season. Johnson, who has played for an NFL record 14 teams, registered appearances in two games, but he didn't attempt a pass in either one.

Johnson hasn't taken meaningful snaps since the 2021 season when he started a game for the Baltimore Ravens. In 47 career games (and nine starts), Johnson has completed 58.1% of his throws for 2,297 yards, 13 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.

In a season where health has often dictated outcomes across the NFL, Buffalo’s updated injury report represents one of its most encouraging developments in weeks.

Tight end Dalton Kincaid headlines the group of returning contributors. After missing practice on Wednesday and Thursday due to a lingering knee issue, Kincaid was a full participant on Friday, signaling he’s ready to go. His availability restores a critical element to Buffalo’s offense, especially in the middle of the field where his route-running and hands have been sorely missed.

Buffalo stabilizes special teams and fortifies both trenches

Punter Mitch Wishnowsky will also suit up despite being limited earlier in the week with a right knee injury. That news brought relief to Bills decision-makers, particularly after Buffalo had to add a substitute placekicker to the practice squad with Matt Prater sidelined. Wishnowsky’s return is notable, as he’s already the third different punter the team has used this season.

Packers players were divided on whether the hit was a dirty play or just part of the game.

CHICAGO – Depending which Green Bay Packers player you talked to, the helmet-to-helmet hit that knocked quarterback Jordan Love out of the game with a concussion was either dirty or part of the game.

With 8 minutes, 15 seconds left in the Chicago Bears’ 22-16 overtime victory, defensive end Austin Booker was flagged for a roughing-the-passer penalty after the front of his helmet hit the front of Love’s helmet as he sacked him for a 7-yard loss. Booker had been called for a roughing-the-passer penalty against Love on the third play of the game, but that one did not involve a hit to the head.

Most of the players on the field didn’t see the second hit in real time because they were involved in the play, but some of them saw the replay later.

“I felt like it was cheap,” left guard Aaron Banks said.

Banks said he thought Booker should have been ejected from the game.

“That’s bull[expletive],” he said. “But he’ll get what’s coming to him.”

Banks was presumably talking about a large fine for the two penalties.

The big question for the NFL will be whether he lowered his helmet and tried to use it as part of the tackle. The video showed that he did duck his head some, but Love also lowered his head, which caused the contact to be direct to his forehead.

Love is in the NFL’s concussion protocol, so he was off limits to reporters.

Coach Matt LaFleur did not address whether he thought the hit was intentional.

The game started out with an unnecessary-roughness penalty on linebacker D’Marco Jackson, who jumped on top of a scrum and grabbed kick returner Bo Melton around the neck. There was lots of pushing and shoving throughout the game.

Running back Emanuel Wilson said contact happens and there are times there is no intent to injury somebody, but he said the hit Booker put on Love wasn’t ordinary.

“It’s a physical game,” Wilson said. “Defensive players are going to try to knock people’s heads off. I didn’t see the first penalty. but I just know that second hit was unacceptable.”

Safety Javon Bullard said he didn’t know if there was intent behind Booker’s two penalties but he said the rules are clear on hitting quarterbacks.

“I know the rules and it’s unfortunate for him [Love], but I don’t think he was intentionally trying to hurt nobody,” Bullard said.

Left tackle Rasheed Walker didn’t say it was dirty, but he said the right penalty was called.

“He hit him head-to-head and he put his full body weight on him,” Walker said. “He was playing hard.”","https://www.packersnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/21/PMJS/87867582007-mjs-packers-19-3.jpg?crop=5236,2947,x0,y564&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-21 11:00:07.885264

The Lions announced on Saturday that they have put the talented defensive back on the injured reserve, ahead of the team's Week 16 matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Ford Field in Detroit.

Here's the update from the Lions via a social media post on X, formerly Twitter:

“Lions announce roster moves:

Placed S Kerby Joseph on Reserve/Injured. Activated OL Christian Mahogany from Reserve/Injured. Elevated OL Kingsley Eguakun and TE Giovanni Ricci from the Practice Squad to the Active/Inactive list.”

The Steelers game will be Joseph's ninth missed game in a row because of a knee issue. He last saw action on the field in Week 6's road game against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.

Detroit appeared to have held on to the hope that he could still make it back to the field for the Steelers game, as they did not put him on the injured reserve last week. But it's now clear that Joseph will spend at least the rest of the regular season on the sidelines.

In the six games he's played in the 2025 season, the 25-year-old Joseph recorded three interceptions, four passes defended and 19 combined tackles for the Lions, who continue to miss the NFL's leader in defensive picks in 2024. Last season, Kerby amassed nine interceptions in 17 games. He turned one of those INTs into a touchdown while adding 83 combined tackles and a quarterback hit.

After wrapping up their practice week Saturday afternoon, the Niners ruled out both key starters as Pearsall is battling a right knee injury while Green has been working through a neck issue.

Pearsall, who did not practice any of the three days this week, will not travel with the team to Indianapolis as he continues rehabilitation in the Bay Area.

""Ricky will stay back,"" coach Kyle Shanahan said. ""He was close but not close enough.""

Green's week was a bit more up and down. He was listed as a limited participant in each of the three practices but wore a blue no-contact jersey on Friday before shedding it on Saturday.

""His neck has been bothering him since the [Titans] game and it just didn't get any better,"" Shanahan said. ""So, we have to shut him down for this week.""

Like Green, Pearsall suffered his injury in last week's win against the Tennessee Titans. Pearsall came off with a low ankle sprain following a hip-drop tackle on San Francisco's opening offensive snap. Titans safety Kevin Winston Jr. was fined $23,186 for the tackle on Saturday.

Pearsall returned and played the rest of the way until limping off with what Shanahan has called an ""irritation"" of the posterior cruciate ligament injury that kept him out for six games earlier this season.

Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson are expected to pick up most of the slack opposite wideout Jauan Jennings in Pearsall's absence. Bourne needs 1 receiving yard to trigger a $500,000 bonus for reaching 500 receiving yards on the season.

Darrell Luter Jr. is the likely replacement for Green. He started against Jacksonville in Week 4, also replacing Green in that game.

Elsewhere on the injury front, the Niners list defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos as questionable. He is on injured reserve with a hamstring strain but practiced twice this week and Shanahan said the team will decide on whether to activate him on Monday.

Rookie linebacker Nick Martin landed on injured reserve Saturday with a concussion, which could open a spot on the 53-man roster for Gross-Matos.

Washington Commanders’ Stats and Insights for Week 16 Team: The Washington Commanders snapped an eight-game losing streak with a 29-21 win over the New York Giants.","The Washington Commanders are enduring a difficult season. They are 4-10 and sit third in the NFC East. Moreover, they have been officially eliminated from playoff contention. While many attribute the struggles to the team’s overall performance, some fans have placed the blame on quarterback Jayden Daniels.

However, the former second overall pick dislocated his left elbow during the Commanders’ 31-0 loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 14. As if things were not bad enough, the injury added to the mounting physical toll he has endured this season.

Jayden Daniels’ Injury Details

The injury against the Vikings was not the only one Daniels suffered this season. He sustained a knee sprain in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers. Another injury followed in Week 7 when the Commanders faced the Dallas Cowboys.

In Week 9, Daniels dislocated his elbow in a game against the Seattle Seahawks. Even after that setback, Washington initially intended for him to play the final five games of the season. But he was ruled out ahead of the Week 15 matchup against the New York Giants.

Now, the team does not expect him to play in the remaining games. As reported by Ian Rapoport on X, league sources indicated the Commanders have decided to shut down the rookie quarterback for the final three contests, shifting his focus to supporting Marcus Mariota.

What Is the Update on Daniels’ Injury?

The NFL insider later provided an update on Tuesday that included Daniels’ own perspective.

Rapoport wrote on X, “Speaking today, Jayden Daniels told reporters, ‘I don’t want to miss games at all. I’ve been frustrated this whole season, missing games. I want to be out there to help my teammates as much possible. It’s been a frustrating year.'”

Although Daniels will not appear in games, he is expected to remain active in practice. Head coach Dan Quinn said the decision was a “part medical and part team” call, aimed at allowing Daniels to recover while participating in limited work and enter the offseason as healthy as possible.

“I’ll be out there practicing whatever they need me to do,” Daniels said, responding to the proposal. “If I gotta do scout team, I’ll have fun with that and give the best looks.”

While the optimism is encouraging, Commanders fans will not see the promising quarterback take the field again this season. Based on his current performance, Daniels ranks 26th in PFSN’s Quarterback Impact metric with a score of 71.7.

Washington Commanders’ Stats and Insights for Week 16

Team: The Washington Commanders snapped an eight-game losing streak with a 29-21 win over the New York Giants. It was the second time this season that Washington scored more than 27 points after having seven games over 27 points last season.

QB: Marcus Mariota’s PFSN Quarterback Impact (QBi) grade over the last four games has been a C or C+, which has ranked him between 11th and 19th for the week.

Offense: The Commanders are tied for the third-best percentage for touchdowns per red zone trip. They have found the end zone in 66.7% of the time when they get into the red zone.

Defense: Washington has allowed opponents to gain 4.7 yards per rush this season. It is the sixth highest in the league.

Another was Love's frustrating day against the Broncos defense. The 27-year-old quarterback completed 24-of-40 passes for 276 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.

The Broncos were keyed in on the Packers quarterback from the start. Early in the first quarter, safety Talanoa Hufanga took things a step too far in an incident involving Love, which resulted in a fine for Hufanga.

On the Packers' first offensive drive, Love scrambled to convert a fourth-and-1 with 9:41 remaining in the first quarter.

Hufanga ran him out of bounds, but as he returned to the field, the Broncos defender pushed Love's head against the ground. No flag was thrown on the play.

On Saturday, just hours before kickoff of the Bears-Packers game, the NFL announced in its weekly gameday accountability report that Hufanga had been fined $11,593 for the incident, citing ""unnecessary roughness.""

Hufanga will have the opportunity to appeal the fine, but based on the replay, the evidence is hard to ignore. He may not be able to get away without a punishment, like Broncos teammate Zach Allen did following a separate incident with Love.

The Packers played most of the game without Love, who left with a concussion during the second quarter.

Love was dropping back to pass when he was hit in the backfield by Chicago defensive end Austin Booker. Love was lowering his head as Booker made the tackle, and the two players made helmet-to-helmet contact.

The Packers quarterback lay on his back on the field as he was attended to by trainers before he went to the blue medical tent on the sideline. He was then taken back to the locker room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.

Love was replaced on the drive by Malik Willis, who led Green Bay to a field goal on the possession. Love had completed 8 of 13 passes for 77 yards before exiting.

Willis finished the game 9 of 11 for 121 yards and one touchdown. He also ran 10 times for 44 yards.

The Bears trailed 16-6 with under three minutes to go in the fourth quarter but forced the extra period with two late scores before Caleb Williams found D.J. Moore on a 46-yard pass for the game-winning touchdown.

Per NFL’s Next Gen Stats, Chicago’s win probability dipped to as low as 0.5% in the fourth quarter before they rallied in the final minutes.

Green Bay took a 6-0 lead into halftime before the Bears finally got on the board with a field goal on their first drive of the second half. Late in the third quarter, the Packers scored the first touchdown of the game on a perfect pass from Willis to Romeo Doubs.

The teams then traded field goals on their next three possessions, with the Bears ultimately cutting Green Bay’s lead to 16-9 with one minute and 59 seconds to go. Only having two timeouts left, Chicago called an onside kick after its last field goal, and the Bears recovered it after Doubs couldn’t corral the ball.

Williams then led an eight-play, 53-yard touchdown drive capped by a 6-yard touchdown pass to Jahdae Walker on fourth down.

In overtime, the Packers had the ball first but couldn’t convert on a 4th and 1 from inside Chicago territory after Willis fumbled the snap. Four plays later, Williams connected with Moore for the winning score.

Saturday’s game was a key one for both sides. The win solidified the Bears’ hold on first place in the NFC North, as they improved to 11-4. Green Bay fell to 9-5-1 with the loss, with the 8-6 Detroit Lions hot on their tail for the final playoff spot in the conference.

Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap

Bears

What did the Bears prove with the win? If the Bears have proven one thing this season, it's that they're a resilient group. The Bears have six wins after trailing in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter, the most such wins in a season since the 1970 merger. Saturday's win gives them a 96% chance to make the postseason for the first time in five years. Josh Blackwell recovered an onside kick after the Bears made it a one-score affair ahead of the two-minute warning, and that gave Chicago one last opportunity for its offense to come alive after a stagnant three quarters. Undrafted rookie Jahdae Walker came through in the biggest moment of the game with a late touchdown to send the game into overtime, and that's where Caleb Williams finished it with a 46-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore.

Most surprising performance: Without receivers Rome Odunze (foot) and Luther Burden III (ankle), Walker was given an opportunity and proved how important it is to stay ready. Walker's first career catch went for a first down, and it was his touchdown late in the fourth quarter that forced overtime. Walker is the only rookie undrafted free agent on the Bears' 53-man roster. His performance highlights how vital the Bears' depth is on offense.

Troubling trend: The Bears were their own worst enemy at times with 10 penalties for 105 yards. It was the first time since 2000 that the Bears had two roughing-the-passer penalties and two unnecessary roughness penalties in the same game, according to ESPN Research. Late in the fourth, Jaquan Brisker dove onto Malik Willis after the quarterback slid, giving the Packers 15 yards to move into Chicago territory for a field goal that made it 16-6 with 5:03 left. -- Courtney Cronin

Next game: vs. 49ers (Sunday, Dec. 28, 8:20 p.m. ET p.m. ET)

Packers

How deflating was this loss for the Packers? Not only did the Packers lose a game they controlled until the final minutes of the fourth quarter, they don't know if they'll have starting quarterback Jordan Love for the all-important final two games of the regular season. Love left in the first half because of a concussion, and his status going forward is unknown. While Willis filled in admirably for Love -- until a fumbled snap in overtime --- it wasn't enough as the Packers melted down in the late stages of the fourth quarter. At 9-5-1, the Packers trail the Bears (11-4) in the NFC North, and the season series ends in a split.

Turning point: If Warren Brinson got a clean sack on Williams with 3:11 left in regulation, the game might have been over. It was third-and-20 from the Packers' 46-yard line when the rookie defensive lineman sacked Williams. But he grabbed the quarterback's facemask and the ensuing penalty gave the Bears a fresh set of downs, which led to a field goal that cut the Packers' lead to 16-9 with 1:59 to play. The Bears then recovered the ensuing onside kick and scored a tying touchdown to force overtime, where they finished the game.

Most surprising performance: Only six teams were better at scoring touchdowns from inside the red zone than the Packers entering Week 16. Their touchdown percentage inside the 20 was at 64.7%. Yet they failed on all five trips inside the Bears' 20-yard line Saturday. The first four of them were inside the Bears' 9-yard line. The Packers managed a pair of field goals sandwiched around a turnover on downs on a failed fourth-and-1 from the Bears' 7 and Josh Jacobs' fumble on first-and-goal from the 4. -- Rob Demovsky

Eagles

What is the significance of this win? The Eagles clinched the NFC East, becoming the first team to win the division in back-to-back seasons since 2004. It hasn't been the easiest road for the defending champs, but they've beaten up on lesser opponents over the past couple of weeks and appear closer to establishing an offensive identity. A big part of that is a commitment to the ground game, with Saquon Barkley having 84 rush yards after contact, his most in a game since 2019. With the ground game beginning to click and the defense continuing to dominate, Philadelphia looks to be in pretty good form with the playoffs fast approaching.

Turning point: Eagles defensive back Cooper DeJean intercepted Josh Johnson's pass late in the third quarter, setting up a Barkley touchdown run that pushed the lead to double digits. Johnson entered the game in the second half for an injured Marcus Mariota and made a critical miscue when he threw across the field on third-and-long. DeJean swooped in for the interception, and the Eagles reached the end zone seven plays later.

Stat to know: Dallas Goedert's third-quarter score was his 10th receiving TD of the season, tying Pete Retzlaff (1965) for the most by a tight end in Eagles history. Goedert, who is scheduled to be a free agent at the end of the season, had never had more than five receiving TDs in a season. -- Tim McManus

Next game: at Bills (Dec. 28, 4:25 p.m. ET)

Commanders

What else could go wrong? Washington was playing a strong game vs. the Eagles when yet another injury doomed the Commanders. With 14:18 left in the third quarter, quarterback Marcus Mariota injured his passing hand with Washington leading 10-7, and he did not return. The loss -- at least until late in the fourth quarter -- showed that though the Commanders still care about winning, they just don't have the firepower on either side of the ball to beat the Eagles. Washington has had 13 starters miss at least one game this season, and nine have missed at least seven -- eight more than all of last season. Washington also had two offensive linemen exit early because of undisclosed injuries: reserve tackle Brandon Coleman and starting right guard Sam Cosmi.

Biggest hole in the game plan: Washington's pass defense consistently allowed key plays when it needed a stop, partly because of the unit's lack of pressure, a weeks-long issue that won't be resolved this season. At times, the four-man rushes left running lanes for quarterback Jalen Hurts, who took advantage of man coverage for good runs. The Commanders were also called for illegal contact and defensive pass interference on a key Eagles touchdown drive.

QB performance: Washington couldn't muster any offense once Mariota exited, with the result still in doubt. Josh Johnson, who hasn't played since August, threw an interception that changed the game, passing across the field off his back foot with no zip. In his first three series, Washington gained one first down. If Mariota can't play on a short week, Washington will need to either elevate Sam Bradford off the practice squad or sign another quarterback -- or both. -- John Keim

Next game: vs. Cowboys (Thursday, 1 p.m. ET)

Seattle 38, L.A. Rams 37

Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap

Seahawks

What are the playoff implications of the Seahawks' win? They secured their postseason berth. Now, it's a matter of whether they can hang on to their one-game lead in the NFC West and the conference's No. 1 seed, which they'd be assured of by winning their final two games at Carolina and San Francisco. The first NFC team to 12 wins, Seattle still has to hold off the Rams and 49ers to win the division. Los Angeles finishes with winnable games against the Falcons and Cardinals, and the 49ers already have one win over Seattle. This could come down to the season finale at Levi's Stadium.

Biggest hole in the game plan: Despite not having to worry about Rams wide receiver Davante Adams (knee and hamstring injury), the Seahawks' defense gave up 225 yards and two touchdowns to Puka Nacua. Los Angeles gashed Mike Macdonald's unit in a way you rarely see, racking up 581 yards with a ton of damage on explosive passing plays. The Seahawks got the stops when they needed them, and they did so despite losing Coby Bryant, Nick Emmanwori and Riq Woolen to injuries in the fourth quarter.

Best quote from the locker room: In addition to a lousy day by their defense, the Seahawks overcame two interceptions by Sam Darnold, who then threw a pair of touchdown passes late in the win. ""Just shows a true competitor,"" Jaxon Smith-Njigba said of the quarterback. ""A lot of guys would get down on themselves and give up, lay down, but that's not what we do, that's not what he is. That goes around to the whole team. Excited to have a leader in Sam."" -- Brady Henderson

Next game: at Panthers (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)

Rams

What does the loss to the Seahawks mean for the Rams' NFC West chances? The Rams entered the game with a 62% chance to win the NFC West, but those odds dropped to 25% after the OT loss (independent of other games), according to ESPN Analytics. The 10-4 Rams fell to the No. 5 seed in the NFC, and they could drop to No. 6 if the 49ers win Monday night. The Rams had a win probability of 97% in the fourth quarter, and had they won, ESPN Analytics would have given them a 91% chance to win the NFC West. Instead, the Rams no longer control their own destiny in the division race.

Trend to watch: Puka Nacua has 573 receiving yards in his past three games. It's the most in a three-game span since Josh Gordon had 649 for the Browns in 2013. With Davante Adams injured, Matthew Stafford relied even more on Nacua, whose 225 receiving yards are the most by a Rams player since Isaac Bruce in 1997. -- Sarah Barshop",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1221%2Fr1592158_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 02:57:52.808907

Love was ruled out of Saturday's 22-16 overtime loss to the Chicago Bears because of a concussion after he took a helmet-to-helmet hit from defensive end Austin Booker in the second quarter. Love was taken out of the game after Booker committed his second roughing-the-passer penalty of the first half.

LaFleur had no update on Love after the game but tried to explain how his team led for the entire game until the Bears tied the score with 1:35 left in regulation.

""We knew they were a team that was going to fight to the end,"" LaFleur said. ""It was a playoff-type atmosphere, which we expected, but I was really, really proud of the way our guys competed, the way they battled. And we just gotta -- it's tough. It's always tough in this league to have to rebound and get it together, but that's exactly what we have to do and that's exactly what we will do to get ready for a tough Baltimore team.""

Malik Willis finished the game in relief of Love and while he completed 9-of-11 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown pass to Romeo Doubs that gave the Packers a 10-point, second-half lead, he also lost a fumble on a botched snap on the first possession of overtime.

The Packers were still in control and looked like they might have ended the Bears' hopes when rookie Warren Brinson sacked Caleb Williams on third-and-20 from the Packers' 46-yard line with 3:11 left in regulation. But Brinson was called for a facemask, and things began to unravel. The Bears kicked a field goal on that drive to cut the Packers' lead to 16-9 with 1:59 to play.

""Everybody makes a mistake once in a while on the field,"" Brinson said. ""It was just, my hand was a little too high and I grabbed his facemask.""

The Packers might have survived that mistake, but then Doubs fumbled an onside kick, giving the Bears the ball back when a Doubs recovery might have ended it.

""S---, I missed it,"" said Doubs, who suffered a wrist injury on that play. ""That's just this game, bro. I rep this s--- all week, and yeah, bro, somebody gotta be responsible, and I'm willing to take on 1000% of it.""

Packers cornerbacks Nate Hobbs and Keisean Nixon then miscommunicated on a fourth-down play that allowed Caleb Williams to hit Jahdae Walker for a 6-yard touchdown that tied the score with 24 seconds left.

After Willis fumbled a snap on the first possession of overtime -- he said he sped up the snap count because the play clock was running down and it threw off center Sean Rhyan -- Williams ended it with a 46-yard touchdown pass to D.J. Moore, who beat Nixon in single coverage after the Packers blitz.

That's how the Packers fell to 9-5-1 and lost the chance to sweep the Bears (11-4).

It puts even more pressure on the Packers heading into their final two games -- home next Saturday against the Ravens and at the Vikings to close the season.

They likely won't know until much later in the week whether they'll have Love back for the next game.

Love has not had a reported concussion during his NFL career. He was evaluated for a concussion earlier this season against the Giants in Week 10, but instead suffered a left-shoulder injury. He returned to finish that game, and the only action he has missed since then was late in a blowout win over the Vikings in Week 11.

Earlier this year, he underwent surgery for a broken left thumb late in training camp but returned for the start of the regular season.

This is the second time that Love has not finished a game against the Bears. He left last year's regular-season finale because of a right elbow injury but returned for the playoffs the following week. Earlier last season, he could not finish the Week 8 game against the Jaguars because of a groin injury. He returned the following week.

He has missed two games since he became the Packers' full-time starter in 2023. After starting every game in his first season, he missed Weeks 2 and 3 last season because of the knee injury he suffered on the final drive of the season opener against the Eagles in Brazil.

LaFleur was noncommittal when asked whether he thought Booker's hit on Love was dirty, saying: ""That's football. I gotta see it to -- I mean I saw it live, so I gotta go see it again. But stuff happens.""

However, Packers left guard Aaron Banks took issue with the hit, especially because it was second penalty of the game.

""What's the flag they called on that, roughing the passer?"" Banks said. ""I just don't know, guys get kicked out of games for taunting, but if you hit a quarterback late in the head, you know what I'm saying? That should get the same treatment for something as simple as taunting. I think that has to be re-evaluated. I think that's ridiculous.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1221%2Fr1592186_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 02:57:59.210646

Personnel clarity will drive both scripts once inactives post. If Watson is active, Green Bay’s perimeter speed and vertical stress return, pairing with play-action to challenge Chicago’s safeties; if he’s held, intermediate timing and distribution become central.

Backfield decisions will dictate early-down efficiency and third-down distances. On Chicago’s side, Odunze and Burden III being out tightens the route depth, likely elevating DJ Moore and the tight ends in quick-game and play-action concepts; Swift’s availability shapes the run-pass balance and screen timing.

Jordan Love Injury Update

Packers QB Jordan Love left Saturday's game against the Bengals after taking a big hit in the second quarter.

He was taken to the back to be evaluated for a concussion, and he was later ruled out for the rest of the game.

Green Bay has a massive matchup against the Ravens next Saturday, and given the usual recovery timeline from concussions this season, Love will be up against it to be cleared for that game.

Malik Willis took over at quarterback for the Packers after Love left the game.

Willis led the Packers to a 2-0 record with Love sidelined last season.

Q4 4:00 - Packers 16, Bears 6

On second-and-10, Olamide Zaccheaus dropped a ball that hit him in the chest and would have been a big gain.

One play later, Caleb Williams takes off and slides down for a gain of what appeared to be 10 yards. After review, he is ruled to be down a bit short of the line to gain.

Going for it on fourth-and-1, Williams takes off again and this time gains 12 yards.

Q4 5:03 - Packers 16, Bears 6

Chicago finally gets off the field but Green Bay burned over five minutes of clock and pushed its lead back to two possessions with just under six minutes to go after Brandon McManus drills a 28-yarder.

I've said this too many times tonight but here we are again: Caleb Williams and company need to score quickly.

Q4 10:52 - Packers 13, Bears 6

Chicago faces a critical third-and-9 from the Green Bay 23-yard line but the play was doomed from the outset.

The Packers sent heat and Caleb Williams immediately launched the ball away, drawing an intentional grounding penalty, making it an even longer field goal attempt for Cairo Santos.

Despite the swirling winds, Santos drills a 51-yarder to make it a one-possession game with a lot of time remaining.

Malik Willis is going to get paid this offseason and it’s probably not going to be by the Packers.

Willis has done enough in his fill-in stints over the last two seasons to at least compete for a starting job somewhere else.

Quite the deal general manager Brian Gutekunst struck when he traded a seventh-round pick for the failed Titans QB on the eve of the 2024 season.

Q3 4:15 - Packers 6, Bears 3

Does this sound familiar?

Kyle Monangai starts the Bears drive with a chunk gain before the offense stalls. On third-and-18 from Chicago's 17-yard line, Caleb Williams throw behind DJ Moore, who makes the grab but is brought down well shy of the line to gain.

Jordan Love injury update

The Packers have officially ruled Love out for the remainder of Saturday's game because of a concussion. He had originally been deemed ""questionable"" to return but the team announced he would not return after halftime.

Love completed 8 of 13 passes for 77 yards before leaving the game. Green Bay was leading Chicago 3-0 when he exited.

Who is the Packers backup QB?

Malik Willis is the Packers' backup quarterback and checked into the game to replace Love after he was injured.

Willis, 26, is a four-year pro who is in his second season with the Packers. He was a third-round pick by the Tennessee Titans in the 2022 NFL Draft out of Liberty and has completed 63.4% of his career passes for 913 yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions.

Willis went 2-0 in two starts in relief of Love last season with the Packers and has a career record of 3-2 as a starter. The 6-1, 225-pound signal-caller is well-known for his mobility and has 301 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 55 career carries.

Packers QB depth chart

The Packers have three quarterbacks currently in their organization. They are as follows:

Jordan Love

Malik Willis

Clayton Tune (practice squad)

Tune was not elevated for Saturday's game, so the Packers do not have another quarterback available behind Willis against the Bears.

Fox Sports' Erin Andrews reported Packers coach Matt LaFleur told her the team's emergency QB would likely be starting running Josh Jacobs if Willis needs to leave the game for any reason.

Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap

Eagles

What is the significance of this win? The Eagles clinched the NFC East, becoming the first team to win the division in back-to-back seasons since 2004. It hasn't been the easiest road for the defending champs, but they've beaten up on lesser opponents over the past couple of weeks and appear closer to establishing an offensive identity. A big part of that is a commitment to the ground game, with Saquon Barkleyhaving 84 rush yards after contact, his most in a game since 2019. With the ground game beginning to click and the defense continuing to dominate, Philadelphia looks to be in pretty good form with the playoffs fast approaching.

Turning point: Eagles defensive back Cooper DeJean intercepted Josh Johnson's pass late in the third quarter, setting up a Barkley touchdown run that pushed the lead to double digits. Johnson entered the game in the second half for an injured Marcus Mariota and made a critical miscue when he threw across the field on third-and-long. DeJean swooped in for the interception, and the Eagles reached the end zone seven plays later.

Stat to know:Dallas Goedert's third-quarter score was his 10th receiving TD of the season, tying Pete Retzlaff (1965) for the most by a tight end in Eagles history. Goedert, who is scheduled to be a free agent at the end of the season, had never had more than five receiving TDs in a season.-- Tim McManus

Next game: at Bills (Dec. 28, 4:25 p.m. ET)

Commanders

What else could go wrong? Washington was playing a strong game vs. the Eagles when yet another injury doomed the Commanders. With 14:18 left in the third quarter, quarterback Marcus Mariota injured his passing hand with Washington leading 10-7, and he did not return. The loss -- at least until late in the fourth quarter -- showed that though the Commanders still care about winning, they just don't have the firepower on either side of the ball to beat the Eagles. Washington has had 13 starters miss at least one game this season, and nine have missed at least seven -- eight more than all of last season. Washington also had two offensive linemen exit early because of undisclosed injuries: reserve tackle Brandon Coleman and starting right guard Sam Cosmi.

Biggest hole in the game plan: Washington's pass defense consistently allowed key plays when it needed a stop, partly because of the unit's lack of pressure, a weeks-long issue that won't be resolved this season. At times, the four-man rushes left running lanes for quarterback Jalen Hurts, whotook advantage of man coverage for good runs. The Commanders were also called for illegal contact and defensive pass interference on a key Eagles touchdown drive.

QB performance: Washington couldn't muster any offense once Mariota exited, with the result still in doubt. Josh Johnson, who hasn't played since August, threw an interception that changed the game, passing across the field off his back foot with no zip. In his first three series, Washington gained one first down. If Mariota can't play on a short week, Washington will need to either elevate Sam Bradford off the practice squad or sign another quarterback -- or both.-- John Keim

Seahawks

What are the playoff implications of the Seahawks' win? They secured their postseason berth. Now, it's a matter of whether they can hang on to their one-game lead in the NFC West and the conference's No. 1 seed, which they'd be assured of by winning their final two games at Carolina and San Francisco. The first NFC team to 12 wins, Seattle still has to hold off the Rams and 49ers to win the division. Los Angeles finishes with winnable games against the Falcons and Cardinals, and the 49ers already have one win over Seattle. This could come down to the season finale at Levi's Stadium.

Biggest hole in the game plan: Despite not having to worry about Rams wide receiver Davante Adams(knee and hamstring injury), the Seahawks' defense gave up 225 yards and two touchdowns to Puka Nacua. Los Angeles gashed Mike Macdonald's unit in a way you rarely see, racking up 581 yards with a ton of damage on explosive passing plays. The Seahawks got the stops when they needed them, and they did so despite losing Coby Bryant, Nick Emmanwori and Riq Woolen to injuries in the fourth quarter.

Best quote from the locker room: In addition to a lousy day by their defense, the Seahawks overcame two interceptions by Sam Darnold, who then threw a pair of touchdown passes late in the win. ""Just shows a true competitor,"" Jaxon Smith-Njigba said of the quarterback. ""A lot of guys would get down on themselves and give up, lay down, but that's not what we do, that's not what he is. That goes around to the whole team. Excited to have a leader in Sam."" -- Brady Henderson

Next game: at Panthers (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)

Rams

What does the loss to the Seahawks mean for the Rams' NFC West chances? The Rams entered the game with a 62% chance to win the NFC West, but those odds dropped to 25% after the OT loss (independent of other games), according to ESPN Analytics. The 10-4 Rams fell to the No. 5 seed in the NFC, and they could drop to No. 6 if the 49ers win Monday night. The Rams had a win probability of 97% in the fourth quarter, and had they won, ESPN Analytics would have given them a 91% chance to win the NFC West. Instead, the Rams no longer control their own destiny in the division race.

Trend to watch:Puka Nacua has 573 receiving yards in his past three games. It's the most in a three-game span since Josh Gordon had 649 for the Browns in 2013. With Davante Adams injured,Matthew Staffordrelied even more on Nacua, whose 225 receiving yards are the most by a Rams player since Isaac Bruce in 1997. -- Sarah Barshop",https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/1221/r1592108_1296x729_16-9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-20 22:59:35.766536

The 49ers signed Bourne after Week 1, which coincided with the toe injury that cost Purdy eight games.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Ricky Pearsall, who aggravated a knee injury Sunday, has been ruled out of Monday’s game against the Indianapolis Colts.

The San Francisco 49ers receiver originally hurt his posterior cruciate ligament in Week 4 on a diving attempt out of bounds. He reinjured it when he fell on his knee while making a third-down catch in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s win over the Tennessee Titans. Pearsall finished with 96 receiving yards to lead all pass catchers.

Kyle Shanahan said Pearsall came close to playing versus the Colts. But he didn’t practice this week and was limited to sprinting on a side field during Friday’s session.

“He was close, but not close enough,” Shanahan said.

Monday’s game will be the seventh Pearsall has missed this season. Kendrick Bourne likely will step in as the starter opposite Jauan Jennings, with Demarcus Robinson becoming the team’s No. 3 option at the position.

With 499 yards, Bourne leads the team’s wideouts in receiving yards and needs just one more yard to trigger a $500,000 bonus.

Shanahan joked this week that Bourne is to blame for the 1-yard shortage. He called a screen pass late in Sunday’s game that was blocked to go for 7 yards, but Bourne spun at the end of the play and picked up only 6.

Bourne agreed he should have plowed straight ahead.

“At the end, it was really just an Oklahoma drill — I’m supposed to go through ’em,” Bourne said with a chuckle. “The whole team was laughing at me. I blew it, brah. I blew it.”

Bourne also said his chemistry with quarterback Brock Purdy has improved in recent weeks. The 49ers signed Bourne after Week 1, which coincided with the toe injury that cost Purdy eight games. The bulk of Bourne’s output this season — 465 yards — has come with Mac Jones, an ex-New England Patriots teammate, at quarterback.

But Bourne said Purdy has become sharper and more confident as the toe has improved, and with that, their connection has improved.

“His foot — during the times he played — it was tough,” Bourne said. “You could tell he was struggling. So with him being healthy, I’ve noticed that (now) he’s spinning the ball, he’s really throwing it well. He’s throwing it where he wants it to go. So I think that’s helped our chemistry.”

Meanwhile, starting cornerback Renardo Green was also ruled out after the neck injury he suffered didn’t improve. Darrell Luter Jr. likely will start in his place.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/20171811/GettyImages-2251917821-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-20 21:59:40.884074

* Key: Player, Team | Injury | Game Status Listing | Playing Expectation

Saturday Night 8:20 PM EST Game

RB Josh Jacobs, Green Bay | Knee | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Josh Jacobs has not practiced all week due to the knee injury that has lingered for several weeks. When the injury first occurred, there was concern for a possible PCL sprain, but Green Bay downplayed it as a knee contusion.

Since Week 11, Jacobs has been clearly limited, flashing effectiveness at times but noticeably hindered in others. It's possible the cumulative effect of the injury has caught up to him. Jacobs is expected to sit out Saturday.

RB D'Andre Swift, Chicago | Groin | Questionable | Projecting Active

D'Andre Swift is another running back who has been battling injuries for much of the season. Swift was added to the injury report with a groin injury but practiced all week, albeit in a limited capacity.

We've seen this pattern before with Swift and the Chicago Bears, and based on that history, he should be active Saturday night.

WR Christian Watson, Green Bay | Chest | Questionable | Projecting Active

After initial concerns of an SC joint sprain, Green Bay has offered little detail regarding Christian Watson's ""chest"" injury, only revealing that he briefly visited a local Denver hospital.

The fact that Watson was cleared to return to practice this quickly suggests that any clavicle or rib injury he sustained was minor and that his internal organs—most importantly, his lungs—were unaffected. He should play Saturday, although he carries a slightly elevated risk of re-injury if he fully sells out on a dive for a pass, similar to the play in which he was originally injured.

Mahogany's return comes at a welcome time for a Lions team that has started seven different combinations on its offensive line this year and still is managing injuries in the group.

Starting center Graham Glasgow is questionable to play Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers with a knee injury, and team elevated center Kingsley Eguakun and tight end Giovanni Ricci from the practice squad to the gameday roster.

Eguakun has played three offensive snaps in his career, but took some first-team reps at center this week and could start against the Steelers.

Left tackle Taylor Decker also has been playing through a shoulder injury all season, and Trystan Colon, who started the past two weeks at left guard and has been the Lions' backup center most of the season, is questionable to play with a thumb/wrist injury.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/14/PDTF/86155433007-20250913-detroit-lions-vs-chicago-bears-54.JPG?crop=2047,1152,x0,y106&width=2047&height=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-20 19:00:07.684797

Dean has had a tough go with regard to injuries, but every time he’s healthy, he’s been hugely impactful. He was able to take the starting job back from rookie Jihaad Campbell, who had been playing pretty well for his experience level, earlier in the season.

Campbell went a whole game without snaps just a few weeks ago, but DC Vic Fangio admitted that probably wasn’t ideal, and had been making a bigger effort to get the rookie on the field more in the weeks since. Now, with Dean back on the sideline, Campbell will get some useful reps down the stretch.

As Jefferson began walking off the field, he showed the fans inside Arrowhead Stadium the double bird.

After the game, Jefferson apologized for the gesture saying, ""I’m classier than that, I was just caught up in the moment. Emotions get high. I won’t sit here and act like I’m a perfect man. I messed up when I did that. I have kids at home, and there’s kids out there watching the game too.”

As for the hit itself, Jefferson said he was just “trying to make a football play.”

“It was like a bang-bang moment,"" he said. “You have to go with what the officials called in the moment.”

The Chargers were up by three points at the time, and held on to pick up the win with one final stop after Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes went down with a knee injury. Jefferson finished with five total tackles. The 33-year-old is up to 37 total tackles and four interceptions this season, his second with the Chargers.

Jacobs is dealing with knee and ankle injuries, while Watson is battling a chest/shoulder injury he suffered last week.

With just hours to go before kickoff, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports that Watson ""should be good to go"" as long as he doesn't suffer a setback in warm-ups.

As for Jacobs, Rapoport didn't have any semblance of confirmation for the star rusher but did note that Jacobs wants to play and typically that means he's going to play.

During the week, both players said they expected to play.

“I’ll probably just have something in my pads for game day just to be cautious,"" Watson said. ""Honestly, it’s feeling pretty good for everything considered, so I think it’ll be all right for the game.""

""Josh Jacobs, walking with a significant limp in locker room and wearing a stimulation bracelet around his injured knee, makes it clear he intends to play in Chicago,"" USA TODAY's Ryan Wood reported during the week.

We will get final confirmation on Jacobs' and Watson's statuses by around 6:50 p.m. ET when the Bears and Packers put out their inactives lists.

But, for now, we fully expect both Jacobs and Watson to go.

Now, let's look at what you need to know for the last 15 games on the slate. We have last-minute nuggets from our NFL analysts on matchups from Saturday through Monday.

First, analytics writer Seth Walder breaks down three stat trends that could be pivotal this weekend. Then, fantasy writer Eric Moody highlights five players who are rostered in fewer than 50% of ESPN leagues as of Saturday and could be started in a jam. That's followed by NFL analyst Ben Solak's three potential surprises, NFL analyst Matt Bowen's key matchup to watch and sports betting analyst Pamela Maldonado's favorite bet for Week 15. We also asked our NFL Nation reporters to answer questions about interesting QB situations around the league.

Can the Packers generate a pass rush without Micah Parsons? Could quarterbacks J.J. McCarthy and Tyler Shough have big fantasy performances? Will the Eagles get upset by the Commanders? Can Bears rookie running back Kyle Monangai put together a huge day? Which bet stands out in Patriots-Ravens? And what has a full week of preparation looked like for Colts quarterback Philip Rivers? We dig into all of it.

Walder: Three key stat trends that could determine Week 16 winners

Will the Packers generate a pass rush without edge rusher Micah Parsons against the Bears?

There's no question the Packers will feel the effect of losing Parsons for the rest of the season to a torn ACL, but the sheer degree of the team's on-off splits with him is wild. With Parsons on the field this season, the Packers recorded a 43.9% pass rush win rate, which would be rank around third in the NFL. Without him? That number drops to 23.4%, which would rank 32nd. Their EPA allowed per dropback increased from 0.06 to 0.15. And opponents' pass rate over expectation against them increased from minus-10% to plus-2%, per NFL Next Gen Stats.

All of this is to say that Green Bay will need to find some pass rush against suddenly hard-to-sack Bears quarterback Caleb Williams. If edge rusher Lukas Van Ness can play after being limited in practice this week with a foot injury, that would help a lot. He has the highest pass rush win rate (12.7%) among all non-Parsons Packers with at least 100 pass rushes, but even his rate is basically half of Parsons' number (24.6%).

Can the Steelers stop Detroit's play-action?

The Lions, as usual, are one of the heaviest play-action teams. They run it on 30% of dropbacks, the fourth-highest rate in the league. And it makes sense since play-action is an offensive advantage that, on average, improves efficiency. But that might not be the case against the Steelers.

Pittsburgh is one of the rare teams with a defense that actually performs better against play-action (minus-0.10 EPA allowed per dropback, third best) than without it (plus-0.07, 20th). If Pittsburgh can derail one of Detroit's favorite offensive levers, that would be a huge edge in a contest between two playoff hopefuls.

How will Titans quarterback Cam Ward fare against the Chiefs' blitz?

The Titans face a suddenly winnable game against the Gardner Minshew-led Chiefs following Kansas City's elimination from playoff contention and Patrick Mahomes' torn left ACL. But the Chiefs present one issue for the Titans that has nothing to do with who is playing quarterback.

Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo's defense blitzes 35% of the time, the third-highest rate in the league. And that has been a particular weakness for Ward. While he currently ranks last in the NFL with a 31.2 QBR, that number drops to 13.7 when facing the blitz. Even with Ward's subtle improvements over the past two weeks (a 46.9 QBR from Week 11 on), he still has just a 9.5 QBR against the blitz. If the Titans want to get the better of the down-and-out Chiefs, Ward might need to connect on plays when Kansas City brings extra heat.

Moody: Five fantasy sleepers you need to pick up -- and can start this week

J.J. McCarthy, QB, Minnesota Vikings (34.3% rostered)

McCarthy has played well recently, scoring at least 20 fantasy points in two consecutive games. He benefits from elite pass catchers in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, and he adds value with his rushing ability. McCarthy now faces a Giants defense that has given up the second-most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks. New York has also allowed the most rushing attempts and rushing yards to the position.

Darren Waller, TE, Miami Dolphins (29.1% rostered)

Waller finished with a season high in targets (eight) and fantasy points (25.6) on Monday against the Steelers. Even though starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has been benched after a league-high 15 interceptions, rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers can still take advantage of a favorable matchup for Waller. The Bengals' defense has given up the most fantasy points per game to tight ends this season.

Schefter to McAfee: Tua benching the first step in Miami moving on

Adam Schefter joins Pat McAfee to break down the Dolphins' options after benching Tua Tagovailoa.

Michael Carter, RB, Arizona Cardinals (24.7% rostered)

Carter should be the Cardinals' lead back against the Falcons with Bam Knight on injured reserve after an ankle injury in Week 15. Carter stepped in once Knight left the game against Houston, finishing with 18 touches and 13.4 fantasy points. It was an impressive outing against an elite defense. The Falcons are a middle-of-the-road defense against running backs, making Carter a solid option for managers in deeper formats.

Tyler Shough, QB, New Orleans Saints (8.8% rostered)

Shough is a strong option thanks to his recent fantasy production and rushing upside. In the past three games, the rookie has completed 70% of his passes and scored at least 17 fantasy points in each outing. Shough also averaged 35.5 rushing yards per game during that span, scoring two rushing touchdowns. He should find success against a Jets defense that allowed Jacksonville's Trevor Lawrence to score 44.3 fantasy points in Week 15.

Jalen Coker, WR, Carolina Panthers (5.5% rostered)

Coker has seen at least four targets in five consecutive games and scored at least 11 fantasy points in three of them. The second-year receiver is trending up at the perfect time for managers in deeper formats. The Buccaneers have been eviscerated by quarterbacks since Week 12, allowing 1,098 passing yards and eight touchdowns. Atlanta quarterback Kirk Cousins just posted 26.9 fantasy points against their leaky secondary in Week 15. Coker is in a favorable spot catching passes from Bryce Young this week.

Solak: Don't be surprised if ...

Bears running back Kyle Monangai leads the league in rushing this week. D'Andre Swift is questionable for Saturday's game, and the Packers' defense will not just be lacking Parsons, but also elite run defending safety Evan Williams. On top of that, Chicago has two receivers confirmed out for this game (Luther Burden III and Rome Odunze), so it will likely skew extremely run heavy. Monangai could get the lion's share of the carries, putting the rookie in line for his third 100-yard game this season.

The Commanders upset the Eagles. Philadelphia's offense looked healed against the Raiders, while the Commanders' passing defense is one of the worst in the league (29th in passing yards allowed per game). But Washington coordinator Kliff Kingsbury has had offensive success against Philly coordinator Vic Fangio's defense. The Commanders have also continued to play hard in a lost season under coach Dan Quinn. Divisional upsets in December are always live, and the Eagles are not a trustworthy squad.

Shough wins Offensive Rookie of the Year. He was once an enormous underdog for this award at 200-1 -- now he's fifth in odds at 14-1. Shough gets an enormously depleted Jets secondary Sunday, and with a floundering offense on the other side, he might have enough drives and short fields to put up 30-plus points and 300-plus yards. The momentum is building.

Bowen: Key matchup to watch

Chicago's running game versatility vs. the Green Bay defense

The Bears rushed for 90 yards in the second half of the Week 14 matchup against the Packers. Swift and Monangai delivered plenty of body punches on a mixture of zone, power and misdirection run plays. And coach Ben Johnson's usage of the tight ends -- mostly off pre-snap movement -- gave the Bears both numbers and blocking angles at the point of attack. Look for Chicago to use heavy 12 personnel (one running back, two tight ends, two wide receivers) on Saturday night against Green Bay.

The Patriots are more reliable than the Ravens in terms of play volume and efficiency. New England consistently runs more offensive snaps, which shrinks variance and limits separation from its opponents. Meanwhile, Baltimore's 44% red zone touchdown rate is second lowest in the league, capping its ability to pull away against opponents who control possession even if it can move the ball. I like the Patriots inside the +2.5 points, but I could also see them winning outright.

NFL Nation: QB questions

What has Philip Rivers' first full week of preparation looked like for the Colts?

Rivers has taken the overwhelming majority of the first-team reps, and the goal this week is to make the offense a bit more aggressive than it was in Rivers' first game last Sunday. Rivers threw for 120 yards against the Seahawks, making it tough for the Colts to match Seattle score for score. ""That game was the plan that we had,"" he said. ""I don't feel any real limitations pushing the ball down the field. Am I going to throw it 60 yards? No, but I can't name many times I ever did that anyway."" -- Stephen Holder, Colts reporter

Where do things stand on Tyler Shough starting for the Saints next season?

Shough has proved his case lately. He ran for two touchdowns in a win against Tampa Bay and then engineered two comeback drives against Carolina last week. He has been able to do that even though injuries have the Saints now using fourth-team receivers and running backs. With the Saints falling down the draft order due to their recent wins, it would make sense to use their draft pick to build around Shough next year. -- Katherine Terrell, Saints reporter

What was the most interesting thing you heard from Bo Nix's four-touchdown day against Green Bay?

Broncos coach Sean Payton has put his QB under center more over the past four games than earlier in the season, with Nix's three highest totals for the year coming over that span. And it has cleaned up Nix's footwork and pumped up the efficiency of the Broncos' run game a bit. Broncos offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said this week, ""I think his footwork has gotten a lot better."" Nix has had three of his four games this season with at least 295 passing yards over those past four games, including the four-touchdown game against the Packers. -- Jeff Legwold, Broncos reporter

Da’Shawn Hand Hit on Patrick Mahomes Could Contribute to Travis Kelce’s Retirement Following the Season Then there is the career of tight end Travis Kelce to consider.","The NFL announced 22 fines for players around the league in accordance with their on-field behavior in Week 15, though noticeably absent from the list was Da’Shawn Hand of the Los Angeles Chargers who knocked Patrick Mahomes out for the season and dashed the Kansas City Chiefs’ playoff hopes in the process.

Hand, an eight-year veteran defensive lineman and league journeyman, went low with his hit on Mahomes during the Chiefs’ final drive on Sunday, December 14 at Arrowhead Stadium.

“After trying to extend a play to his right, [Mahomes] threw the ball away just before his left leg was twisted awkwardly, as he planted his foot and Chargers defensive lineman Da’Shawn Hand brought him down,” NFL.com’s Around the NFL Staff wrote following the game.

Mahomes left the field, with the team announcing shortly afterward that the QB had torn the ACL and LCL in his left knee and would miss the remainder of the game and the year.

In the meantime, backup quarterback Gardner Minshew entered the contest with the Chiefs trailing by three points and needing at least a field goal to potentially force overtime and keep their postseason chances alive. A few plays after he came in, Minshew threw an interception that sealed Kansas City’s fate.

The league could have punished Hand retroactively, likely via a fine, if the Office of Gameday Accountability had determined the hit on Mahomes was illegal. The referees did not throw a flag on the play, and the NFL ultimately deemed that Hand’s hit was clean, even though the result of it was catastrophic for Mahomes as well as the Chiefs.

Patrick Mahomes Could Miss Multiple Games Next Season With Knee Injury

Hand’s play on Mahomes also potentially changed the course of Kansas City’s franchise history in multiple ways.

A victory for the Chiefs last weekend and Mahomes’ continued health could have resulted in the team extending its playoff streak to 11 years. Kansas City’s streaks of seven consecutive AFC title game appearances also ended when Mahomes’ season did, as did the Chiefs’ streak of three straight Super Bowl appearances, which included wins following the 2022 and 2023 campaigns.

Mahomes could miss the beginning of next season because of the extra complications an LCL tear adds to a standard ACL injury, which might end up impacting the team’s record and playoff contention next year.

Da’Shawn Hand Hit on Patrick Mahomes Could Contribute to Travis Kelce’s Retirement Following the Season

Then there is the career of tight end Travis Kelce to consider. Kelce has three games remaining this season before his contract expires.

At 36 years old, Kelce has played 13 campaigns in the league. He has 10 Pro Bowl appearances, seven All-Pro selections, three championship rings and a surefire Hall of Fame statistical resumé.

Kelce has avoided talking about his potential retirement twice this week, once on his “New Heights” podcast and again during a media session on Friday.

However, the disappointing end to the 2025 season and the deflating injury to Mahomes could influence Kelce’s decision, as he has several lucrative media and business opportunities awaiting him in retirement from football.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2237018278-e1766266179971.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-20 20:00:19.083254

Isak, 26, made a significant impact off the bench as he broke the deadlock just 11 minutes after being brought on at the start of the second half.

However, the £125million summer signing was unable to celebrate his second Premier League goal for the club after being caught by a sliding challenge from defender Micky van de Ven.

Isak had to be helped from the field by medical staff with head coach Arne Slot admitting they face an anxious wait to discover how long he will be sidelined with a suspected lower leg injury.

“I don’t have any news on him but if a player scores, gets injured and doesn’t come back on the pitch or doesn’t try to come back, it’s usually not a good thing,” Slot said. “I cannot say anything more than that. That is just a gut feeling and nothing more than that. Nothing medical to say about it.

“I haven’t spoken to him about it yet but it’s a good thing he scored — a good goal assisted by Florian Wirtz.

“Let’s not be too negative yet. We don’t know yet. Let’s hope Alex is back with us soon but it is difficult to say.”

Victory came at a cost with right-back Conor Bradley taken off at half-time after being hurt in a collision with Djed Spence during the opening 45 minutes.

Florian Wirtz limped off late on but Liverpool are hopeful the Germany international was only suffering from cramp.

Dominik Szoboszlai collected a fifth yellow card of the season which means he will be suspended for the visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers to Anfield on December 27.

Having come off the bench to replace Isak as he made his comeback from injury after two months out, Jeremie Frimpong was subsequently subbed off in stoppage time.

Slot explained that was a tactical switch with Federico Chiesa introduced as Liverpool clung on to win against nine men following red cards for Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero.

“With Jeremie there is no problem at all,” Slot added. “I didn’t want to go down to 10 men for 30 seconds. This is the only country where players have to go off for 30 seconds if they’re injured. I adapted to that.

“I knew there wasn’t long to play and thought we struggled a lot. Playing 10 v 10 for half a minute with him being on the floor, I just went with Federico so no problem with him.

“With Alex and Conor, we have to wait. You could see our bench today but we are not the only team in this period picking up injuries because we play so many games.”

Liverpool appeared comfortable when Hugo Ekitike headed them 2-0 up but after Richarlison pulled one back in the 83rd minute panic set in. Even after Romero’s red card in stoppage time, the visitors failed to control proceedings and endured a nervy finale.

Slot said: “It wasn’t perfect, especially the last 10 minutes, but we pick up points and are developing in a way I want to see.

”I thought against nine men we would be able to keep them away from our goal but it looked as though we were down to nine and they had 11, which led to attack, after attack, after attack.“",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/20153848/GettyImages-2252231960-scaled-e1766263152182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-20 19:00:48.084374

That, of course, was in the NFC Championship game last January, a game the Eagles won 55-23. Since then, much has changed for both teams, as they'll now face each other twice in the span of two weeks.

The Eagles (9-5) are headed back to the playoffs, needed only one win or one loss by the Dallas Cowboys to secure their second straight NFC East title.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

The Commanders, meanwhile, beset by injuries and old age, take a disappointing 4-10 record into this game. They have shut down quarterback Jayden Daniels for the rest of the season because of an injured left (non-throwing) elbow.

As much as the Eagles want to clinch the NFC East, they insist they're not looking past the Commanders, who beat the Eagles last Dec. 22 at Northwest Stadium.

""What we think about is this next game and our preparation for this game,"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. ""There hasn't been a lot of talk about, ‘Hey, this is an opportunity to do this.’ ... But we’ve got to go do it, right?

The Delaware News Journal is providing live coverage of the Eagles' game against the Commanders. Follow along for updates:

Halftime update: Commanders 10, Eagles 7

This time, it was the Eagles' special teams that struggled, at least in the first half.

Will Shipley fumbled away the opening kickoff, setting the Commanders up at the Eagles' 26. The Eagles held Washington to a field goal.

Then after Jalen Hurts hit DeVonta Smith for a 6-yard TD, the Eagles missed a chance to extend their lead when Jake Elliott missed a 43-yard field goal. Shipley later made another mistake by taking the ball out of the end zone after the Commanders scored as the Eagles started their final drive of the first half at the 19 instead of the 35.

The Eagles set up for a 57-yard field goal in the final seconds. But Elliott missed that one. He got a break when Washington was ruled offsides. That gave Elliott a chance from 52, but he missed that as well.

The Eagles' offense was moving the ball as Hurts went 12-for-17 for 112 yards. while Saquon Barkley had 40 yards on 9 carries, while A.J. Brown had 8 catches for 86 yards.

Commanders 10, Eagles 7: Jacory Croskey-Merritt scores from 1

A Jake Elliott missed field goal, his fourth in five games, ended up leading to a Commanders touchdown. The key play was Marcus Mariota's 40-yard pass on the first play, from the Eagles' 33 down to the Eagles' 27. Washington got the ball down to the 1, where Croskey-Merritt converted on second down. That gave the Commanders a 10-7 lead with 3:40 left in the first half.

Eagles 7, Commanders 3: Jalen Hurts throws TD to DeVonta Smith

The Eagles finally got the offense going on their second drive. The Eagles marched down the field, getting four plays of 14 yards or more, including a 16-yard pass from Hurts to A.J. Brown down to the Washington 2.

A false start penalty on a tush push ended up pushing the Eagles back to the 6. That's where Hurts hit DeVonta Smith for the TD and a 7-3 lead with 2:37 left in the first quarter.

Commanders 3, Eagles 0: Will Shipley fumble on kickoff is costly

So much for the Eagles getting off to a strong start. Will Shipley fumbled away the opening kickoff and the Commanders recovered at the Eagles' 26. Washington ended up with a first down at the Eagles' 5, then settled for a 20-yard field goal instead of going for it on 4th-and-goal from the 3.

It was a curious decision considering the Commanders are out of playoff contention. Still, the Eagles must feel good to only be down a field goal with 11:39 left in the first quarter.

Dover, Delaware native Jordan Magee key LB for Commanders

Delaware native Jordan Magee, the Commanders' fifth-round pick in 2024, is having a strong second season in Washington. Magee has gotten into 14 games, starting 5. He has 41 tackles on the season.

Eagles inactives: Cameron Latu, Lane Carter, Jalen Carter not playing

Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson is missing his fifth straight game with a foot injury while defensive tackle Jalen Carter is missing his third with an injury to both shoulders. It's not known if either will be able to return next week against the Buffalo Bills.

The Eagles' other inactives were QB Sam Howell (emergency QB), RB AJ Dillon, DE Josh Uche, CB Mac McWilliams and TE Cameron Latu. Latu, a key special teams player, was on the injury report this week with a stinger. He was listed as questionable for the game.

Eagles give 2 practice-squad elevations, including EJ Jenkins

The Eagles elevated TE E.J. Jenkins and DB Brandon Johnson from the practice squad for the game against Commanders. Jenkins had an elevation against Minnesota on Oct. 19. It's the first elevation of Johnson's career. He was signed as an undrafted free agent out of Oregon last spring, waived, then re-signed to the practice squad.

Eagles 30, Commanders 13: The Eagles can clinch the NFC East and the playoff berth that goes with it with a win. Considering that many of their veterans are either banged up or can use the rest, it's safe to assume the Eagles will pour everything into this game, then start relaxing over the final two (at Buffalo on Dec. 28 and home for the Commanders on Jan. 4) to gear up for the postseason. – Martin Frank

Saquon Barkley’s nerve scare, Kamara’s continued absence, risky returns like Drake London, and multiple concussion and knee situations are creating massive lineup traps that casual injury reports won’t catch. Below is a medical-driven breakdown of every key injury, explaining what actually impacts performance, re-injury risk, and snap counts, so you can make the right calls and survive the fantasy playoffs.

Quarterbacks

Geno Smith

Injury: Back and shoulder injury

Analysis: Smith is on track to return in week 16 after missing week 15 with an injury to his throwing shoulder and his back. The Raiders struggled mightily without Geno, and his return will be welcomed. Having practiced in full all week, Geno is likely all but over his injuries. Acute back injuries typically respond well to treatment, and I would not expect the back injury to significantly limit his ability. An injury to the throwing shoulder can linger and impact throwing power and accuracy, easily aggravating it with either a bad hit or overuse in a game. Fantasy managers who have made it to round two of the playoffs are not relying on Geno; however, his return bodes well for Brock Bowers.

Running Backs

Saquon Barkley

Injury: Stinger

Analysis: Saquon suffered a stinger on Sunday which knocked him out for a few plays, but ultimately finished the game without appearing to suffer any performance deficits. A stinger is an irritation to the nerves as they exit the neck and will have a wide range of impact. Nerve injuries have three different levels, each with a very sciencey name.

Neuropraxia: Mild injury to the myelin sheath that surrounds the nerve. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, and burning that lasts for minutes to a few days. This is what most stingers are, and likely where Barkley's injury falls. No prolonged deficits is expected

Axontmeosis: The nerve itself is injured, but not completely severed. Symptoms include weakness or paralysis, sensory loss, and pain. Recovery happens but extremely slowly (1mm/day). If this ever happens to a football player, their season is likely over.

Neurotmesis: Complete severance of the nerve: Symptoms include complete paralysis and sensory loss. This would be career-ending.

Barkley's injury is undoubtedly a neuropraxia, or a very mild nerve disruption that is likely completely, or near completely, gone now. This will not affect his production in week 16 but it should be noted that the area of the nerve that was affected, as well as the entire nerve distal to the affected area, will be at a higher risk for injury.",https://fantasyinjuryteam.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Drake-London-full-pic-3.webp,N,,2025-12-20 19:00:56.900374

""Good enough to go,"" Harrison said Friday after practice. ""We'll see Sunday.""

Of Harrison's work for the week prior to Friday's practice, coach Jonathan Gannon said ""I thought he looked pretty good.""

The heel injury wasn't a problem running, but any deceleration was an issue, Harrison said. Harrison also missed two games with appendicitis and left the game against the Colts with a concussion.

""It's been tough,"" Harrison said. ""The whole year has been tough, honestly. What we wanted it to be going into the year and where it is now, it's not what we expected. The whole year has been tough, but you keep going one day at a time and stick to your process.""

This season, Harrison has 40 receptions for 594 yards and four touchdowns in 10 games.

In Harrison's absences, Michael Wilson has shined as the top wide receiver, making 41 catches for 499 yards and three touchdowns in those four games. And tight end Trey McBride has been dominant of late and is coming off a game in Houston in which he tied his career high in catches (12) and set a career high in yards (134), along with two touchdowns.

Now the Atlanta defense will likely have to contend with Harrison as well. Harrison had six catches for 69 yards in the Tampa game in Week 13 before the heel injury. That was post-appendix surgery, and Harrison acknowledged he was anxious to get back on the field after an unprecedented sidelining for him.

Who are the Bears' inactives?

TBA

Who are the Packers' inactives?

TBA

Will Tremaine Edmunds play vs. Packers?

The Bears could welcome back a key part of their defense in linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, who spent the last four weeks on injured reserve with a groin injury. Chicago is expected to activate Edmunds off IR before Saturday night's game, per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, so the Bears could have a dominant linebacker trio in Edmunds, T.J. Edwards and D'Marco Jackson against the Packers.

Will D'Andre Swift play in Week 16?

Chicago will likely lean on their 1-2 punch at running back with D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai, and it sounds like Swift will be good to go. Swift was listed on the injury report with a groin injury and is officially questionable for Week 16. ESPN's Jeremy Fowler said the expectation is Swift will play on Saturday night, which is great news for the NFL's second-best rushing attack.

Will Cole Kmet play vs. Packers?

With the Bears down two of their top receivers, the tight ends could see plenty of action in the passing game. While rookie Colston Loveland is expected to be a top target, veteran Cole Kmet has also proven a solid option as a receiver. Kmet suffered an ankle/knee injury last week, and he's officially questionable for Saturday night. It sounds like Kmet should be good to go, which would be huge for this offense as Kmet's been a solid blocker, as well.

Bears rule out Rome Odunze, Luther Burden III in Week 16

Chicago will be without top wide receivers Rome Odunze and rookie Luther Burden III against Green Bay. Odunze reaggravated his foot injury during warmups last week against the Cleveland Browns. Meanwhile, Burden suffered an ankle injury in the second half against Cleveland. Look for a big day from DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus, as well as tight ends Colston Loveland and Cole Kmet.","https://bearswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/03/SBRS/87058621007-27487804.jpg?crop=7133,4014,x0,y372&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-20 18:00:15.235115

Swift popped up on the injury report this week with a groin issue and was only able to log limited practices before drawing a questionable tag.

However, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, Swift is indeed expected to suit up against the Packers on Saturday.

""Bears RB D'Andre Swift (questionable, groin) is expected to play today vs. Green Bay, per source,"" Fowler reported.

Not much of a surprise here, as it likely would've taken an act of God to keep Swift off the field for such an important game.

Swift is in the midst of what could be a career-best year in 2025.

The veteran running back enters Week 16 with 935 rushing yards, which is just 114 yards shy of his career-high. Swift needs two more rushing touchdowns and three more total scores to break his personal best marks in those areas.

Making those stats more impressive is the fact that Swift has ceded more and more touches to rookie back Kyle Monangai as the season has progressed.

Chicago and Green Bay will kick off from Lambeau Field at 8:20 p.m. ET on Saturday night. The winner will sit in first place in the NFC North.

Adding a player who can consistently win one-on-one is vital if the worst pass defense in the NFL is to turn things around in 2026.","BIGGEST WISH: Offensive line help

Regardless of whether it’s Jacoby Brissett or Kyler Murray under center in 2026, the offensive line needs aid. The long-term plan at right tackle remains a concern. Jonah Williams is a pending free agent and hasn’t stayed healthy (15 games in two seasons). Kelvin Beachum is also a free agent and has struggled. The interior has been a mess. The running back injuries haven’t helped, but the run-blocking struggles have been a main driver in the Cardinals being such a pass-heavy unit.

BIGGEST WISH: Pass catchers

With Kyle Pitts in the last year of his rookie deal, Atlanta has a massive choice to make: Pay the inconsistent TE, who has come on strong of late, or find a replacement. Regardless of that decision, the Falcons must find more weapons in the passing game. It can't be just Drake London moving forward. Atlanta needs a consistent No. 2 receiver. Despite playing in just nine games thus far, London leads the team with 810 receiving yards. Darnell Mooney is the No. 2 wideout with 364 yards. Adding additional pass catchers who can burn defenses that roll coverage to London is a must for Michael Penix Jr. to take the next step when he returns next season.

BIGGEST WISH: Defense

The league's worst defense needs help at all three levels. Cincinnati ranks dead last in the NFL in points, yards and yards per play allowed. It doesn't matter how explosive the offense is -- no team can win consistently with that type of play on D. With Trey Hendrickson and Joseph Ossai both heading to the open market, the pass rush needs help. Outside of DJ Turner II, the secondary needs upgrading. Geno Stone has been a disaster at safety and is likely gone in free agency. Cincy also needs its two rookie linebackers, Demetrius Knight Jr. and Barrett Carter, to improve immensely in the offseason. With a good chunk of cap space and a potential top-10 pick, the Bengals have to completely overhaul the defense this offseason.

BIGGEST WISH: Offensive line

Cleveland has another massive quarterback decision this offseason -- what else is new? Yet, it won’t matter if the offensive line remains a disaster. The Browns have the worst pass-blocking unit in football this season, and the much-maligned line opens precious few holes in the ground game. Injuries have exacerbated the problems. Cleveland has a hoard of O-linemen on expiring contracts ( Joel Bitonio , Jack Conklin , Wyatt Teller , Cam Robinson and Teven Jenkins ). General manager Andrew Berry needs to completely overhaul this unit in the offseason, or it won’t make a difference who is under center.

BIGGEST WISH: Running back

Patrick Mahomes' injury will garner all the attention this offseason, but the needs are clear for a Chiefs team that won't be participating in the playoffs for the first time since the 2014 campaign. Edge rusher is a pivotal need on defense. However, if we're handing out wishes, adding a playmaking running back shoots to the top of my list. Whether or not Mahomes is ready for the start of next season, the run game in K.C. must be better. Kareem Hunt can get 3 yards, but the 30-year-old isn't consistently gashing defenses. Isiah Pacheco has hit a wall, and seventh-round rookie Brashard Smith has accumulated just 95 ground yards over 14 games. The Chiefs haven't had a 1,000-yard rusher since Hunt's rookie year in 2017. A true dual-threat back would be big for Andy Reid's squad, especially if Mahomes misses time.

BIGGEST WISH: Quarterback

No quarterback could thrive behind this sieve offensive line that the Raiders have rolled out in 2025. Upgrading the blocking is a massive need in 2026. But finding a franchise QB takes precedence on this wish list. Geno Smith clearly isn’t the long-term answer, as a 35-year-old struggling his way through a turnover-plagued season. Drafting a signal-caller in Round 1 is the best way to breathe some fresh air into an organization living in the basement of the AFC West.

BIGGEST WISH: Resolution to the QB situation

Tua Tagovailoa's struggles have come to a head. The Miami quarterback was benched after more than a month of subpar play. The decision came 17 months after he signed a $212.4 million extension. It's a mess in Miami. Tua is owed $54 million guaranteed next year. Even with a post-June 1 release, he'd account for $67.4 million in dead money in 2026, per Over The Cap. We've seen teams take that nasty medicine in recent seasons (SEE: Denver's release of Russell Wilson and Atlanta's trade of Matt Ryan), but it's still a big pill to swallow, particularly for a cap-strapped team. It's difficult to imagine Miami turning back to Tagovailoa after a benching, but what are the franchise's other options? Seventh-rounder Quinn Ewers is getting his shot to make an impression. In a perfect world for the Dolphins, he pulls a Brock Purdy. Short of that, there aren't many pretty options. The free-agent pool is shallow. The Fins could draft a rookie and carry Tua as a Kirk Cousins-esque backup. There is no seamless option for the most pressing question in South Beach heading into 2026.

BIGGEST WISH: J.J. McCarthy and Justin Jefferson find chemistry

Oh, I could put down Cornerback or talk about the need for O-line depth, but the reality is that if McCarthy doesn't progress, none of those other discussions will mean bupkis. After missing his entire rookie campaign with a knee injury, it's been a roller-coaster second season for the former No. 10 overall pick. He'll go long stretches looking like a backup, then flash elite throws to close out games. Injuries have slowed the progress under Kevin O'Connell, and McCarthy has shown improvement in the past few weeks. Those strides need to be longer in Year 3. The signal-caller must find a changeup on his passes; touch is not a strength of his game. And if Santa could send a chemistry package for him and Jefferson, that would be amazing. The star receiver has made things work in past seasons with the likes of Nick Mullens and Josh Dobbs, so it's head-scratching seeing him unable to find a groove with McCarthy. That must change in the new year.

BIGGEST WISH: Pass rusher

Tyler Shough's stretch run has sparked the Saints, but the rebuilding club still has plenty of holes to fill. Another pass catcher alongside Chris Olave -- who's in line for an extension this offseason -- and interior O-line aid are certainly needs. Those additions would significantly help Shough's development. However, for me, adding a dynamic front-line defender tops the list. New Orleans has generated 29 sacks this season, tied for ninth-fewest in the league. 36-year-old Cam Jordan leads the team with 6.5 sacks. Adding a weapon to pair with Chase Young and Carl Granderson would boost an average defense heading into 2026.

BIGGEST WISH: Coaching stability

Since Tom Coughlin resigned in January 2016, Big Blue has endured one disaster after another. First, it was Ben McAdoo and his oversized suit going 13-15. Pat Shurmur bumbled his way to 9-23. Joe Judge was in over his head, finishing 10-23. Brian Daboll at least won a playoff game before bottoming out, ending his run this year with a 20-40-1 record. The Giants have been rudderless for a decade. New York has to nail this hire. The next coaching staff must be able to get the best out of quarterback Jaxson Dart while turning around a moribund defense. Another swing-and-miss on the coaching hire, and we’ll be right back here in two years writing a similar blurb.

BIGGEST WISH: Quarterback

The rebuilding Jets have holes aplenty, but the same need that has persisted for generations remains: quarterback. Justin Fields proved he’s not the answer. Tyrod Taylor is no more than a veteran backup. Brady Cook ... no need to pile on the undrafted rookie. Big-name stand-ins like Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers disappointed. High picks like Zach Wilson , Sam Darnold and Mark Sanchez flamed out. The singular wish of every Jets fan for the past half-century has been to have a consistent, stable quarterback situation. The yearning continues. Regardless of where the team lands in the final draft order, the Jets, after their midseason trades, have the ammo to move up for a QB. Aaron Glenn and Darren Mougey need to succeed where so many others have failed with this long-suffering franchise.

BIGGEST WISH: Weapons for Cam Ward

Getting the right coach in the building is an important step, but adding playmakers around Ward is paramount for the young QB to thrive in Year 2. Chimere Dike and Elic Ayomanor have shown flashes as rookies, but the Titans lack a true No. 1 threat. At this point, we can’t presume Calvin Ridley will be that guy. Rookie tight end Gunnar Helm has also displayed upside and rapport with Ward, but with Chigoziem Okonkwo an impending free agent, another TE could be an option. Getting Ward a go-to target will go a long way toward the No. 1 overall pick smoothing out some of the rough patches that have plagued him during an up-and-down debut season.

BIGGEST WISH: Young defenders

Washington's old defense has looked its age for the bulk of the season, ranking 31st in yards allowed and yards per play through 14 games, as well as 26th in points surrendered. The Commanders don't do much well on D, ranking in the bottom five against the run and pass. Adam Peters needs to overhaul the unit with young, fresh playmakers at all three levels. The biggest need is on the edge, where a 36-year-old Von Miller leads the team with seven sacks. A coverage linebacker and youth in the secondary are also on the wish list.

BIGGEST WISH: Edge rusher

I know, I know, I know. Dallas isn't officially eliminated from the postseason. Yet with less than a 1% shot at overtaking Philly for the division, I think we're in the clear. Entering Week 16, Next Gen Stats put the Cowboys in the playoffs 80 times in 10,000 simulations (0.8%). Their faint hopes could be dashed before they even take the field on Sunday, if the Eagles beat the Commanders on Saturday evening. If you want to hang on that slim shot, feel free to stop reading. For everyone else ...

The Cowboys' defense needs help all over the field. Safety is a concern, and Donovan Wilson is set to hit free agency. Corner Trevon Diggs, who hasn't played since Week 6, is a cut candidate. Dallas could use a coverage linebacker. However, an edge rusher remains the most significant need. James Houston leads the Cowboys with 5.5 sacks. The team has just 29 total sacks through 14 games. Adding a player who can consistently win one-on-one is vital if the worst pass defense in the NFL is to turn things around in 2026.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/oowfjs80hpoj90l6seus,N,,2025-12-20 14:59:32.999043

Oh, and side note: he put up 10/16/3 rushing against them in the NFC Championship last season.
Philly also gives up the second-most rushing YPG (23.5) to QBs, so you could do considerably worse at QB than Mariota this week.
Jacobs is at 4.71 YPC on zone runs, which are 62% of his runs, so it’s a solid matchup.
This is a little scary, since D'ANDRE SWIFT (groin) was limited all week and is still questionable.","D.C. gives up the most receiving YPG (98.1) and fifth-most receptions per game (7.4) to slot receivers, and it’s also a strong schematic matchup for DEVONTA SMITH, who averages 2.08 YPRR and .21 TPRR on 210 routes against Cover 3 (27.1%) and Cover 1 (23.1%), which they use half the time. Not everyone can eat in the passing game for Philly (most likely), and he posted only 10/80 in two games against them last year, but DeVonta is DUE.

D.C uses Cover 3 (27.1%) and Cover 1 (23.1%) at a 50.2% clip, and DALLAS GOEDERT averages a weak 1.49 YPRR and .20 TPRR on 180 routes against those coverages. However, he got them for 7/85 in last postseason, and D.C. gives up the sixth-most receiving YPG (64.6) and the third-most receiving TDs per game (.6) to TEs, along with the third-most schedule-adjusted FPG to TEs the last five weeks (+7.2) and the most to TEs split out (+4.6). The matchup is too appealing to ignore.

There’s a lame expected total of 44.5, but it’s hard to argue with the positive matchups for his top three receivers, and it’s also a solid schematic matchup for JALEN HURTS, who averages 7.93 YPA with a 4.3% CPOE and 18/139 rushing on 225 dropbacks against Cover 3 (27.1%) and Cover 1 (23.1%), which they use half the time. Washington also gives up the fifth-most passing YPG (259.9) and the second-most passing TDs per game (2.0) to QBs. Oh, and side note: he put up 10/16/3 rushing against them in the NFC Championship last season.

No RT Lane Johnson is a buzz kill, but SAQUON BARKLEY is on a mini roll, and this matchup is borderline elite, since D.C. gives up 12th-most adjusted YBC/ATT (2.22), the sixth-most rushing YPG (109.5), and the eighth-most receiving YPG (35.9) to RBs. Barkley got them for 15/118/3 rushing in this matchup last January, and Tyrone Tracy dropped 25 FP against them last week with 15/70/1 rushing and 3/27/1 receiving.

Philly gives up the 13th-most receiving YPG (107.4) and the seventh-most YPR (14.19) to outside receivers, and they use Cover 3 (28.9%) and Cover 6 (21.2%) at a 50.1% clip, and TERRY MCLAURIN averages a massive 4.28 YPRR and .28 TPRR on 67 routes against those coverages. They could always get stud Quinyon Mitchell on him, but based on alignment numbers, McLaurin should see more of Adoree' Jackson, who is improved but still roastable. McLaurin usually plays well in division games, and he got them for 3/51/1 last postseason.

Philly allows the eight-fewest passing YPG (210.4) and the fewest passing TDs per game (.9), and they have limited QBs to 1 or fewer TD passes in nine of their last 10 games. However, they also use Cover 3 (28.9%) and Cover 6 (21.2%) at a 50.1% clip, and MARCUS MARIOTA averages a strong 9.24 YPA with a 6.9% CPOE and 5/45/1 rushing on 96 dropbacks against those coverages. Philly also gives up the second-most rushing YPG (23.5) to QBs, so you could do considerably worse at QB than Mariota this week.

With good matchups for Dallas Goedert and DeVonta Smith, someone is going to be the odd man out, but it’s a good schematic and individual matchup for A.J. BROWN, who has hit 11.9+ FP in five straight with 10+ targets in four straight before last week, when they attempted 15 passes. He averages 2.97 YPRR and .32 TPRR on 183 routes against Cover 3 (27.1%) and Cover 1 (23.1%), which they use 50.2% of the time. They have been better against the pass and give up the 13th-fewest schedule-adjusted FPG to outside WRs the last five weeks, so a dud game wouldn’t surprise me, but he’s been too hot to sit and the matchup very good schematically and individually.

The Eagles use Cover 3 (28.9%) and Cover 6 (21.2%) at a 50.1% clip, and DEEBO SAMUEL averages a solid 1.76 YPRR and .24 TPRR on 152 routes against those coverages. However, Philly gives up the third-fewest receiving YPG (48.5) and the fourth-fewest receptions per game (5.3) to slot receivers, and he’ll see a lot of stallion Cooper DeJean, so there’s a little more downside than usual for Deebo.

With DT Jalen Carter out, it’s actually a good spot for Washington's running game, and they have a top-10 grade in our OL/DL matchup report, since they block up 1.98 YBC/ATT and Philly gives up 1.98. They give up the 16th-most rushing YPG (97.2) and the 15th-most rushing TDs per game (.7) to RBs, so they’re basically a middling matchup and better than that when Carter is out. But with CHRIS RODRIGUEZ expected back, it’s likely a hot-hand situation with JACORY CROSKEY-MERRITT, and JEREMY MCNICHOLS caps both their upside with most of the passing game work, leading the backfield in route share last week at 42%.

He was cruising again last week until Christian Watson went down, but it looks like JORDAN LOVE will have Watson, and it’s a strong schematic matchup for him, since he averages 8.15 YPA with a 6.2% CPOE and 8/58 rushing on 184 dropbacks against Cover 3 (28.7%) and Cover 2 (22.7%), which they use at a 51.4% clip. Love got them for 234/3 passing two weeks ago, so if Chicago can put up a fight on offense and forced Love to drop back 30+ times, he should be in solid shape

The Packers block up 1.83 YBC/ATT (24th-most) and the Bears give up 2.67 (4th-most), so it’s a solid matchup from an OL/DL standpoint. Over the last five weeks, the Bears face 37% of their carries on man/gap runs and give up 5.41 YPC (7th-worst), and JOSH JACOBS is at 5.01 YPC on those runs (9th best). Jacobs is at 4.71 YPC on zone runs, which are 62% of his runs, so it’s a solid matchup. But the Bears have given up 19.4+ FP to a RB just once this season, and Jacobs’ injury status is what’s shaky, first and foremost. If he ends up being inactive, then you can confidently start backup EMANUEL WILSON and expect 15+ touches.

Chicago gives up the 12th-fewest receiving YPG (92.5) to outside receivers, but they run Cover 3 (28.7%) and Cover 2 (22.7%) at a 51.4% clip, and CHRISTIAN WATSON averages a strong 2.42 YPRR and .23 TPRR on 62 routes against those coverages. They’ve also given up the 8th-most schedule-adjusted FPG to outside receivers, and Watson crushed them for 4/89/2 receiving in this matchup two weeks ago. Of course, you can’t view him like we did going into last week, since he was completely healthy and now has dealt with a shoulder injury.

Chicago gives up the seventh-fewest receptions per game (6.6) to outside receivers aligned, but they use Cover 3 (28.7%) and Cover 2 (22.7%) at a 51.4% clip, and ROMEO DOUBS averages a solid 1.86 YPRR and .18 TPRR on 135 routes against those coverages. Of course, he was catch-less (2 targets) against the Bears in Week 13, and rookie MATTHEW GOLDEN is back in the mix while Christian Watson is expected to play.

TE LUKE MUSGRAVE has shown some signs of life lately, but his body of work is too poor to count on him so late in the season, and the Bears are now giving up the 12th-fewest schedule-adjusted FPG to TEs the last five weeks.

Green Bay gives up the seventh-fewest passing YPG (208.6) and the fewest rushing YPG (10.6) to QBs, so it’s a less-than-ideal matchup and spot for CALEB WILLIAMS, who won’t have his two of his top targets in WRs Rome Odunze and Luther Burden. It’s not hopeless, at least, since the Packers use the third-highest rate of zone coverage (79.1%), and Caleb is improved against zone and averages a workable 7.04 YPA with a .4% CPOE and 23/188 rushing on 379 dropbacks against the coverage. Of course, it’s still a sub-optimal matchup and spot, and Williams posted a weak 186/2 passing, 1 INT, and 4/15 rushing in this matchup two weeks ago.

Green Bay allows the 15th-most adjusted YBC/ATT (2.17), the 12th-fewest rushing YPG (87.6), and the eighth-fewest receiving YPG (25.9) to RBs, and they’re still a bottom-12 matchup by schedule-adjusted FPG the last five weeks. This is a little scary, since D'ANDRE SWIFT (groin) was limited all week and is still questionable. If he’s active, it’s not a terrible spot in terms of the OL/DL matchup, since the Bears get 2.56 YBC/ATT, and the Packers allow 2.17. Obviously, if Swift is out, KYLE MONANGAI would likely have a bell cow role with 20+ touches in this run-heavy offense.

Green Bay gives up the eighth-most receiving YPG (112.9) and the 14th-fewest YPRR (1.89) to outside receivers, so it’s not a bad or good matchup. But over the last five weeks, they have given up the 8th-most schedule-adjusted FPG to outside WRs (+3.0), and with Luther Burden and Rome Odunze out, D.J. MOORE will be needed. That’s great if you don’t have strong options and need Moore, but it’s not an ideal schematic matchup, since they use the third-highest rate of zone coverage (79.1%), and he averages a poor 1.52 YPRR and a weak .17 TPRR on 302 routes against zone. To that point, Moore put up four fewer receiving yards than I did in the first matchup two weeks ago (1 catch for -4) and I was on my ass on the couch.

Veteran OLAMIDE ZACCHEAUS should be a factor stepping in for Luther Burden mainly, but Green Bay has been tough inside all year. They’ve slipped up a little, but still give up the 16th-fewest (or most) schedule-adjusted FPG to the slot.",https://static.fantasypts.com/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-20 14:59:40.182504
,,2025-12-20 14:22:46+00:00,NFL.com,Examining coaching futures of NFL teams eliminated from 2025 postseason contention,Ian Rapoport,,,,,https://www.nfl.com/news/examining-coaching-futures-of-nfl-teams-eliminated-from-2025-postseason-contention,"His young staff, including offensive coordinator Drew Petzing and defensive coordinator Nick Rallis, has continued to grow into their roles on the job.
Coach Zac Taylor has two years left on his contract, and all indications are that Taylor should return.
Burrow's injuries -- including a severe turf toe injury that required surgery in September, costing him nine games -- have been a driving force in the team's struggles.
Assuming Taylor is back, the biggest question is whether he'll make a defensive coordinator change for the second consecutive year.
No decisions have been made on the future of Kevin Stefanski, the two-time NFL Coach of the Year.","It feels like ages ago that the Cardinals started 2-0. Since then, they've lost 11 out of 12 games as the offense was increasingly decimated by injuries, including a foot sprain that has sidelined quarterback Kyler Murray since Week 5 and countless hits to receivers and running backs.

Owner Michael Bidwill has been supportive of coach Jonathan Gannon, who overachieved with a rebuilding roster in his first two seasons, jumping from 4-13 to 8-9 last season. His young staff, including offensive coordinator Drew Petzing and defensive coordinator Nick Rallis, has continued to grow into their roles on the job. And Gannon and general manager Monti Ossenfort have yet to pick their own QB, taking on Murray -- with a contract that fully guarantees him $36.8 million next season, plus another $19.5 million if he's on the roster March 15 -- when they were hired in 2023.

With potentially a new QB, can the Cardinals make a leap back toward contention next season in a division in which the other three teams are all currently competing for the NFC's No. 1 seed? If Bidwill decides the answer is yes, the sense is he'll stay the course. Putting all the factors together and noting the overwhelming number of injuries this year, one wouldn't expect a change in Arizona.

The Falcons got a positive jolt last on Thursday night of Week 15 when they stunned the Buccaneers. But the season remains a resounding disappointment thanks to a 5-9 record, a season-ending ACL injury to quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and no shot at the playoffs.

Owner Arthur Blank has shown patience in the past, but is it running out with a franchise that hasn't made the playoffs in eight years? He plans to evaluate the futures of coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot as the season draws to a close, as most owners do following trying campaigns.

A strong finish certainly wouldn't hurt their cause, and if Kirk Cousins finishes strong, it would justify a part of the QB decisions made last year. But people familiar with Blank's thinking expect potential changes in some form to the football operation regardless. Nothing is decided and won't be until after the season.

Coach Zac Taylor has two years left on his contract, and all indications are that Taylor should return. Burrow's injuries -- including a severe turf toe injury that required surgery in September, costing him nine games -- have been a driving force in the team's struggles. Bengals owner Mike Brown believes in Taylor, who led Cincinnati to Super Bowl LVI during the 2021 season and the AFC title game the year after, and historically has not wanted to pay coaches not to coach.

Assuming Taylor is back, the biggest question is whether he'll make a defensive coordinator change for the second consecutive year. The unit has been one of the NFL's worst this season under Al Golden, as injuries to star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson and first-round pick Shemar Stewart crippled the pass rush. But when Taylor was asked about the defense recently, he indicated beefing up the D-line to make the entire unit better was the priority, rather than wholesale changes. And there does seems to be an argument, as Cincy's defense from Weeks 11-15 gave up six fewer points per game and allowed nearly 70 fewer passing yards per game compared to the first 10 weeks. The Bengals also rank sixth in the NFL in takeaways since Week 11. Progress.

No decisions have been made on the future of Kevin Stefanski, the two-time NFL Coach of the Year. The Browns know Stefanski can coach, and he has maintained a consistent approach amid the adversity of a transition year with a young roster. But the hard reality is the Browns are 6-25 over the past two seasons, putting everything up for evaluation.

The organization has already undergone a major change this year: chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta, who presided over football matters for 10 seasons remotely from his San Diego home, left the organization last month to become the Colorado Rockies' president of baseball operations. A Harvard graduate who appeared in the book Moneyball, which was later adapted into the movie of the same title, DePodesta influenced the hires of fellow Ivy Leaguers as head coach (Stefanski) and general manager (Andrew Berry). He also built out one of the NFL's most robust data and analytics staffs -- infrastructure that will largely remain in place, though it's unclear if his old role will continue to exist.

The Browns' rookie class has been one of the NFL's best, and it'll look even better if quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders can develop into a long-term option. How Stefanski and his staff continue to bring along Sanders will be part of the evaluation over the final three games as Cleveland approaches a QB crossroads. Deshaun Watson is (finally) entering the final year of his $230 million fully guaranteed contract in 2026. And the team has significant draft capital -- including two first-round picks -- to potentially target another QB in April.

Does owner Jimmy Haslam believe Stefanski is the right coach to bring a young team and young quarterback(s) into the next phase of the Browns' build? If not, Haslam might opt to move on, and Stefanski would immediately become a top candidate elsewhere.

Legendary coach Andy Reid isn't getting fired, and people who know Reid well say he has given no indications he'll walk away at age 67. For the first time in years, he'll finally have a full offseason to recharge. As one person close to him said: ""Coach Reid ain't going out like this.""

But after seven consecutive AFC championship game appearances, five Super Bowls and three rings, the Chiefs find themselves in the unfamiliar position of playing out the string. Patrick Mahomes will spend the offseason rehabbing from ACL and LCL surgery, one that challenges whether he'll be ready to start the season. Travis Kelce could retire, though no decision has been made. Another roster reboot, as GM Brett Veach has executed adeptly in the past, could be afoot.

One situation to watch: Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy chose not to sign an extension in the offseason and is set to become a free agent. Nagy will be a top head coaching candidate and could well land a job. If he doesn't, Nagy could become a hot candidate for a play-calling job elsewhere. That would mean Reid needs a new OC, with several of his former assistants -- including Eric Bieniemy and perhaps Giants interim HC Mike Kafka -- among potential candidates.

The Raiders are 2-12. Two coordinators (OC Chip Kelly and special teams coordinator Tom McMahon) have been fired. Veteran quarterback Geno Smith, acquired for a third-round pick, has thrown 14 interceptions. No. 6 overall pick Ashton Jeanty has rushed 200 times for only 700 yards, with little running room. Superstar pass rusher Maxx Crosby, who signed a contract extension last March, appeared to hit a breaking point in last week's shutout loss to the Eagles.

It all has the fate of 74-year-old coach Pete Carroll very much in doubt. No stranger to making changes, mercurial owner Mark Davis will weigh the feedback he gets from all sides of his building as he considers the possibility of another. Meanwhile, Carroll is intent on convincing the owner he should return.

Legendary quarterback Tom Brady and his business partner Egon Durban have wielded significant influence since becoming Raiders minority owners last year. Brady is close with former Michigan teammate and current GM John Spytek, with both serving as the sounding board for one another. While Spytek was Brady's GM target last year, Brady's prime target for head coach was Ben Johnson, who took the Bears job instead. Expect Brady -- who has spent little time in the Raiders building as he balances his broadcasting duties on Fox and other business interests -- to increase his presence as the decision closes in.

Davis is his own man, though. And all the voices around him report to him. He has won three titles in four years with the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces and believes he can replicate that success with the Raiders. Whatever Davis wants to do ultimately is what will happen, and it's not yet clear what that will be.

When Miami parted ways with GM Chris Grier in October after a 2-7 start, the message publicly and privately was clear: Coach Mike McDaniel would finish the season, with hopes of the team responding and showing McDaniel is the right man for the job.

The Dolphins face major organizational decisions on several other fronts: Do they bite the bullet and release Tagovailoa, who is due $54 million fully guaranteed next season (and would count over $99 million in dead cap over two years)? Do they go into a deeper rebuild by trading other assets in the coming months? And who will take over as GM to navigate it all?

First, owner Stephen Ross must decide the fate of McDaniel, who still has a winning record (34-31) and two playoff appearances in four seasons. Ross has long been a believer in McDaniel, and last year extended his contract through 2028.

To be sure, this 6-8 season has been a disappointment. After going 14-3 last season, the Vikings have experienced a mess of injuries -- including to quarterback J.J. McCarthy, whose development was a priority after he missed his entire rookie season because of meniscus surgery. (McCarthy has played better in recent weeks and now is 4-4 as the starter.)

Aaron Glenn's first season as head coach has been filled with adversity: An 0-7 start. Trading two of the franchise's best players (Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams). Benching quarterback Justin Fields. A 3-11 record that has them in the running for the No. 1 pick.

At 4-10, the Saints are long out of the playoff chase. However, there's a case to be made that not only has Kellen Moore's first season been a success, but that New Orleans is also the hottest team in the division, with wins over the Bucs and Panthers in a five-day span.

This was never going to be a championship season in New Orleans, and Moore's work has impressed people around the league. He'll be back in 2026 with a roster that will continue to evolve as he builds the program.

That doesn't mean there won't be changes. After a brutal first half of the season on defense, Quinn took over play-calling duties from his longtime assistant Joe Whitt Jr., who seems unlikely to return as defensive coordinator.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/udgynpnb8dbfgognvncc,N,,2025-12-20 12:59:38.783746

""That changes so much,"" said Sky Sports NFL's Schecter on Inside the Huddle. ""It's pretty incredible how much can change in just a couple of weeks in the NFL.

""You go from being a team who is being compared to or being challenged to go in to make it to the Super Bowl to now, I don't know if they're going to even make it deep into the playoffs. Will they make it past a wild card weekend?

""When these two teams met last in Green Bay, an interception was the difference of winning and losing essentially, and they still had Micah Parsons. He is the fourth-quarter closer for this team.

""He allows this defense to operate at the level in which they want to. And I fear now for this team without Parsons and without Christian Watson, who is just explosive.""

Parsons has mustered 12.5 sacks since joining the Packers, while wide receiver Christian Watson, Jordan Love's chief deep threat, has been nursing injury, although looks on course to feature against the Bears.

""He takes so much attention,"" said Schecter of Watson. ""He can take the top off of defense and open it up for others. And we've seen how he's benefited Jordan Love, his quarterback rating jumps by about 25 per cent.""

The loss of Parsons has heightened the importance of pass rush partner Rashan Gary, who has 7.5 sacks on the year.

""We can still write our story,"" said Gary.

""I've just got to be myself. When guys are thinking that they need to do more than what they've been doing, you start to strain, start to try to find plays that's not there.""

The Packers were 28-21 winners when the two sides met on December 7, Keisean Nixon icing the game with an end-zone interception of Caleb Williams on fourth-and-one with 22 seconds remaining.

Both teams can secure playoff berths with a victory in addition to a loss of tie for the Detroit Lions against the Pittsburgh Steelers, while both would get in with a tie were the Lions to lose. Chicago sit top of the NFC North at 10-4 as they seek to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2020, with the Packers second at 9-4-1 having gone 4-0 against division rivals this season.

""It's a really good football team and a really good defense,"" said Bears head coach Ben Johnson. ""I know you kind of lock in on one player, because he does garner a lot of your attention when you go against that defense, and yet, they have some high-calibre players throughout, on the defensive line, the linebacking core and on the back end.

""Just because one player goes down, that doesn't mean that this is going to change a whole lot for them.""

The Bears rank second in rushing offense in the league behind D'Andre Swift, Kyle Monangai and the ground threat of quarterback Caleb Williams, while leading the NFL in turnovers on defense with a 21 interceptions and nine fumbles.

Williams has naturally warranted a more intense spotlight as he looks to live up to the billing as the eagerly-awaited No 1 overall pick from last year's Draft. He enters Saturday 266 of 459 passing (58 per cent) for 3,150 yards, 21 touchdowns and six interceptions with a passer rating of 88.8, victories, a playoff-bound season and glimpses of magic for now relaxing question marks over his accuracy.

""I still think Caleb will make some kind of inaccurate throws at times, but you see why they drafted him,"" said Schecter.

""You see that arm strength and skill and the way it kind of jumps out of his hands. He is phenomenal at what he does and as he's getting more comfortable doing a lot more of the under center work, you can see what the plan is for this offense.

""And then you've got Ben Johnson, who I feel has settled nicely into his role as head coach and understanding how to manage a whole team because there's so much learning for kind of him and Caleb on this journey.""

The Packers are 30-6 against the Bears since the beginning of the 2008 campaign, and had won 11 straight against their long-time rivals before falling to Chicago in the final game of the season last year. The Bears are on a five-game winning streak at Soldier Field since their opening-day defeat to the Minnesota Vikings, their best home streak since 2005.",https://e0.365dm.com/25/12/1600x900/skysports-micah-parsons-packers_7114982.jpg?20251219125502,N,,2025-12-20 12:00:55.683643

Truly Questionable / Game-Time Decisions 🤔

Players with key fantasy repercussions listed in bold.

Saturday

RBs Josh Jacobs (knee) & Chris Brooks (chest)

RB D'Andre Swift (groin)

WRs Christian Watson (chest) & Dontayvion Wicks (ankle)

TE Cole Kmet (ankle/knee)

Jacobs didn't practice this week but said he'll play anyway. Swift also seems likely to play, dealing with the same groin injury that he's largely fought through without suffering a drop-off in performance. The other guys here are tougher to get a read on, but all practiced some during the week and thus appear at least 50/50 for Saturday's showdown.

Early Games

WR Quentin Johnston (groin)

WR Drake London (PCL)

WR Tee Higgins (concussion)

WR Mason Tipton (illness)

Higgins is in concussion protocol, which means the Bengals should know by Saturday morning/afternoon if he's able to play. I don't think he should play when he's suffered two concussions this season and his team doesn't have a shot at the playoffs, but it seems that's what Higgins and Co. want to do.

Late-Afternoon Games

RBs Woody Marks (ankle) & Nick Chubb (rib)

WRs Marvin Harrison (heel) & Xavier Weaver (hamstring)

WR Christian Kirk (illness)

Chubb was a full practice participant Thursday and Friday, while

Harrison expects to play this week, but his comments almost felt like he was setting the table for disappointment (which is probably what you want to hear if you're starting Michael Wilson).

Today, the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals both held their final practices of the week. We have been monitoring the health for both teams over the last few days, and we now have game designations to share.

Looking at the Falcons first, we received some encouraging news that receiver Drake London will likely play this week. Despite not practicing on Friday and having the questionable game designation, head coach Raheem Morris said today that he expects London to return to action this week. It’s worth noting that London has not practiced fully since he sustained his knee injury almost five weeks ago, and even this week only had a limited practice on Thursday. So him being downgraded to not practicing today is likely a precaution and rest situation.

EDGE James Pearce Jr. interestingly popped up on the injury report on Friday, after practicing normally all week. Pearce apparently has a foot issue which kept him out of Friday’s practice and has his availability for Sunday as questionable. That will certainly be something to keep an eye on, as Pearce is in contention for defensive rookie of the year due to his sack production this season. Raheem Morris did tell the Atlanta media on Friday that he feels good about the possibility of Pearce playing.

Joseph has not played since an Oct. 12 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs because of a chronic knee issue but remains on the Detroit Lions' 53-man roster.

Joseph did not practice this week and is one of two players listed as out on the Lions' weekly game participation report. Gio Manu, who returned to practice this week but remains on injured reserve from an October knee injury, also was ruled out for Sunday.

The NFL interception leader last year, Joseph has played just six games this season because of lingering pain in his knee. He first injured the knee in training camp, then suffered a bone bruise in the same spot in a Week 4 win over the Cleveland Browns.

The Lions (8-6) have been reluctant to put Joseph on injured reserve this season, hoping the pain in his knee would subside long enough for him to contribute on the field.

Joseph still leads the Lions with three interceptions this season, and has had great success against Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in his career. In 2021, Joseph had his first two career interceptions against Rodgers while the quarterback was playing for the Green Bay Packers, and picked Rodgers off a third time in the final game of the year – on Rodgers' final pass with the team.

The Lions also listed five players as questionable on their injury report: Offensive linemen Graham Glasgow, Taylor Decker, Christian Mahogany and Trystan Colon, and cornerback Amik Robertson.

Robertson said he intends to play Sunday with a club on his broken left hand. The Lions could activate Mahogany off injured reserve in his return from a broken fibula.

Hero RB/WR Strategy Single Elite RB: Taking one elite running back and then focusing on other positions can be effective.","Drafting a winning fantasy football team can be a daunting task, but with the right strategies, you can increase your chances of success. Here are some of the most discussed and recommended draft strategies from Redditors:

Aggressive QB Drafting

Early QB Selection: Many Redditors have found success by drafting a quarterback aggressively in the early rounds. ""I shifted from 'wait on QB' to 'aggressively take a QB somewhere in rounds 2-4' several years ago and that has worked out really well for me.""

High-Value QBs: Taking a top-tier quarterback early can provide a consistent stream of points. ""My strategy has been if a guy like Lamar, Josh Allen or Daniels is right there I will take him.""

RB-Heavy Approach

Solidify Running Backs: Focusing on strong running backs early in the draft can set a solid foundation for your team. ""During these zero RB years I’ve been going RB heavy to solidify some bell cows and shoot for high upside WRs after.""

First-Year RBs: Drafting rookie or second-year running backs can provide high value. ""Draft first or second year RBs. It tends to be when they are cheapest and have the most juice.""

Hero RB/WR Strategy

Single Elite RB: Taking one elite running back and then focusing on other positions can be effective. ""Using that baseline of info and running numerous mock drafts, I think the best formula for success in your ESPN home league drafts right now is what most analysts would call a 'Hero RB' approach.""

Single Elite WR: Similarly, securing a top-tier wide receiver can be a strong start. ""In PPR, WR’s will win you your league. You always want to prioritize a WR that can carry you.""

Flexible Drafting

Best Player Available: Adapting to the draft flow and picking the best player available regardless of position is a common strategy. ""No strategy. Just go with the flow. See who is there when it gets to me and pick the best player.""

Value-Based Drafting: Focusing on undervalued players can yield great returns. ""Drafting is all about taking undervalued players and avoiding over valued.""

Auction Draft Strategies

Bid High on Key Players: Aggressively bid on players you want to secure. ""I used to NEVER put up players that I wanted in the first 3-4 rounds. I would always put up the highest value player that I had no interest in first hoping that people overpay early, so I have more money than them when going for my guys.""

Late-Round Gems

Late-Round QB: Waiting until later rounds to draft a quarterback can be a successful strategy if you pick the right players. ""I've been extremely lucky waiting on qbs the past few years.""

High-Upside Rookies: Targeting rookies or second-year players in later rounds can provide significant value. ""I like targeting rookies and year 2 guys to stash on my bench.""

Avoid Key Positions Early

Tight End and Kicker: Many Redditors suggest avoiding early picks for tight ends and kickers. ""I hate playing the TE stream."" ""Literally never draft a kicker unless the platform forces me to.""

Additional Tips

Know Your League Settings: Understand the scoring rules and roster requirements of your league. ""Know your league. If your league uses PPR and your cheat sheet is for standard scoring you're putting yourself at a disadvantage.""

Use Reliable Resources: Utilize tools and rankings from reputable sources. ""I use beersheets every year.""

At 6-8, the Chiefs have been eliminated from playoff contention in the AFC. Plus, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL last week to turn this Chiefs season into a true disaster. There are plenty of questions facing the Chiefs about their future and how they'll build the roster next year with Mahomes hopeful to be ready for the start of the season.

Among the biggest questions is whether Travis Kelce will be back. He continues to brush aside retirement questions, noting that will be a tougher conversation he has to have with himself and the team in the offseason, via ESPN.

""I think I'd rather just keep the focus on this team, right now,"" Kelce said. ""All the conversations that I have with the team moving forward will be with them. It's a unique time in my life. I've got three games left. Unfortunately, I've got three games left and I know when the season ends. Just trying to make sure everybody here knows that I'm focused on trying to win these last three games.""

While his long-term future remains up in the air, Kelce stated on Friday that he has no plans on sitting out any of the Chiefs' final three games despite being out of the playoff race with a backup QB.

""It's just integrity, man,"" Kelce said. ""I signed up to be a Chief, and I love doing what I do. I know I've been dreaming of being in these moments and playing for an NFL team since I was a kid. Getting back to that will give you more motivation than you could ever need. That's just how you need to go about work, whether you're in the race or not. I'm going to make sure these guys know I'm out there giving them everything I got.""

Kelce will try to help close the season out strong and provide some help for backup Gardner Minshew as he takes over the offense in Mahomes' absence. Kelce does have some individual accolades to play for. He is just 203 yards shy of another 1,000-yard season, which would make him the oldest tight end to reach that mark.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/19/3ea504e2-2e92-4507-8657-72274cf58359/thumbnail/1200x675/64a64521c918e59a08ac27ea29fc8411/kelce.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 23:59:02.499299

For bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 16, here are the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Eagles at Commanders (5 p.m. ET, Saturday)

PHI DT Jalen Carter (shoulders, out)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)

WASH QB Jayden Daniels (elbow, out)

The Eagles can clinch the NFC East with a win over a beat-up Washington team on Saturday or a Dallas loss on Sunday. The Commanders have officially shut down Jayden Daniels amid an injury-plagued Year 2, and Washington is just playing things out at this point with Marcus Mariota under center. The Eagles are down two key players in the trenches in Lane Johnson and Jalen Carter, though that's been the case for a few weeks now.

The Eagles are 7-point favorites, and the total is 44.5.

Packers at Bears (8:20 p.m. ET, Saturday)

GB LB Micah Parsons (knee, out for year)

GB RB Josh Jacobs (knee and ankle, questionable)

GB WR Christian Watson (chest and shoulder, questionable)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)

CHI WR Luther Burden III (ankle, out)

CHI RB D'Andre Swift (groin, questionable)

This massive NFC North tilt has some major injuries on both sides. Star Green Bay defender Micah Parsons is out for the year in a major blow for the Packers' defense. Green Bay is hoping to have star running back Josh Jacobs and top receiver Christian Watson, both of whom are questionable. Jacobs didn't practice this week while Watson logged two limited practices to close things out. As for Chicago, it's down two of its top three receivers in Rome Odunze and rookie Luther Burden III while No. 1 running back D'Andre Swift is questionable here, though he was a limited practice participant Wednesday and Thursday and appears to be trending toward playing.

Chicago is a 1.5-point favorite at home. The total is 46.5.

Chargers at Cowboys (1 p.m. ET)

LAC WR Quentin Johnston (groin, questionable)

DAL CB DaRon Bland (foot, out)

The Chargers have listed receiver Quentin Johnston as questionable in this matchup against Dallas' struggling secondary, which will likely be without cornerback DaRon Bland for the remainder of the year. The good news for the Cowboys is neither CeeDee Lamb or Javonte Williams carry injury designations for Week 16.

The Cowboys are slight 1.5-point favorites at home. The total is 49.5.

Vikings at Giants (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams are just trying to get across the finish line here, with the Vikings taking a major step back from last season while the Giants are going to have a new head coach in 2026. The Giants have a handful of players out or questionable, but no real line-movers.

Minnesota is a 2.5-point favorite. The total is 43.5.

Bengals at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)

CIN WR Tee Higgins (concussion, questionable)

This matchup is most noteworthy for Quinn Ewers starting at quarterback for Miami in place of the benched Tua Tagovailoa as the rookie from Texas is set to make his first NFL start against Cincinnati's league-worst defense. The Bengals are hoping to have Tee Higgins back on offense as he's questionable with his second concussion of the season.

Cincy is a 4.5-point favorite, and the total is 47.5.

Buccaneers at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

This very important NFC South clash thankfully doesn't have major injuries impacting it, as the Bucs have no players listed while none of Carolina's stars, namely receiver Tetairoa McMillan, carry designations into the weekend. Both teams are 7-7, so the winner will hold the NFC South lead entering Week 17. These teams face off again in Week 18.

Tampa Bay is favored by three points. The total sits at 45.5.

Jets at Saints (1 p.m. ET)

NYJ Tyrod Taylor (groin and knee, questionable)

NYJ QB Justin Fields (knee, questionable)

NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

NYJ WR Garrett Wilson (knee, out for season)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

Both Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields are questionable to suit up for the Jets on Sunday, but whether they're active or not, undrafted rookie Brady Cook will start for New York. He won't have two of New York's top weapons, either, with receiver Garrett Wilson shut down for the year while rookie tight end Mason Taylor remains sidelined with a neck injury. As for New Orleans, the Saints are again without top running back Alvin Kamara.

The Saints are 6.5-point favorites. The total is 40.5.

Bills at Browns (1 p.m. ET)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, out)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

The biggest injuries here come with Cleveland's offense, as rookie No. 2 back Dylan Sampson remains sidelined with a hand injury and veteran tight end David Njoku, who has seen his role diminish with the emergence of rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is also out.

Buffalo is a 10.5-point favorite, and the total is 41.5.

Chiefs at Titans (1 p.m. ET)

KC QB Patrick Mahomes (knee, out for season)

KC WR Rashee Rice (concussion, out)

The Chiefs are eliminated from playoff contention and will be without Patrick Mahomes for the rest of the year after he tore his ACL last week. Gardner Minshew will start in his place, but for this week, he won't have No. 1 receiver Rashee Rice as he is out with a concussion for this matchup with the Titans.

Kansas City is favored by 3, and the total is 37.5.

Jaguars at Broncos (4:05 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

This AFC clash between division leaders is a potential playoff preview. The Jags have won five in a row to move to 10-4, while Denver sits atop the conference at 12-2 amid an 11-game win streak. Denver has clinched a playoff spot already while Jacksonville can clinch with a win and a loss by either Indianapolis or Houston.

Denver is favored by 3.5 while the total is 47.5.

Falcons at Cardinals (4:05 p.m. ET)

ATL WR Drake London (knee, questionable)

AZ RB Zonovan Knight (ankle, injured reserve)

AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, questionable)

Atlanta is hoping to have star receiver Drake London back after he's been sidelined for weeks with a knee injury. He's officially questionable for Sunday. The Cardinals are also hoping to have a top receiver back in Marvin Harrison Jr., who is questionable after missing time of late after undergoing an appendectomy and more recently a nagging heel injury. The Cardinals' running back woes also continue, as Zonovan ""Bam"" Knight is now the third back the team has lost for the year due to injury, so Michael Carter will be Arizona's lead back on Sunday.

The Falcons are favored at -3. The total sits at 48.5.

Raiders at Texans (4:25 p.m. ET)

LV QB Geno Smith (shoulder, will play)

HOU RB Woody Marks (ankle, questionable)

HOU RB Nick Chubb (ribs, questionable)

The Raiders will get their starting quarterback back for this tough matchup with Houston as Geno Smith returns after missing last week's loss. The Texans' backfield is a bit of a question mark, however, as both Woody Marks and Nick Chubb are questionable to play.

Houston is a 14.5-point favorite. The total is 37.5.

Steelers at Lions (4:25 p.m. ET)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

DET OL Taylor Decker and Graham Glasnow (questionable)

This is a big one for both sides, with the Steelers holding a slim one-game lead over Baltimore in the AFC North race while Detroit is trying to keep pace in the NFC wild card picture. The Steelers will again be without star edge rusher T.J. Watt after he had surgery to repair a collapsed lung last week. The Lions have listed two of their five starting offensive linemen as questionable.

The Lions are favored by seven points. The total is 52.5.

Patriots at Ravens (8:20 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Sunday Night Football is a big one for the AFC playoff picture with the Ravens hosting the Patriots. New England fell to Buffalo last week and at 11-3 leads the AFC East but is behind Denver in the race for the No. 1 seed in the conference. The Ravens are 7-7 and are a game behind the Steelers in the AFC North race and desperately need a win to keep pace. The Pats can clinch a postseason berth with a win or if either Houston or Indianapolis lose this week.

The Ravens are -3 on the spread with the total set at 49.5.

49ers at Colts (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, TBD)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, TBD)

IND WR Alec Pierce (Achilles, TBD)

Final reports for Monday Night Football will come out on Saturday, but the three injuries worth watching are all in the passing game. Ricky Pearsall remains banged up and could be in danger of missing Monday's game for the 49ers, while the Colts are hoping for good news on top cornerback Sauce Gardner and deep-threat receiver Alec Pierce.

The 49ers are favored by 5.5. The total is 46.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/14/b4a13d60-f2ae-4ae6-9371-b0402a41a55b/thumbnail/1200x675/6b93ae20852564144b0b76be364a068b/mahomes-chiefs.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 20:00:15.223644

Any time a quarterback is dealing with an injury, the ripple effect is real. With Daniel Jones and the Indianapolis Colts, it’s about more than just pain tolerance, it’s timing, confidence, and trusting your body in the pocket.

I talked about this with Tiki Barber on WFAN Sports Radio. In the NFL, if your body isn’t allowing you to move, plant, and react the way you need to, it shows. You can manage an injury, but you can’t shortcut stability and readiness at this level.

Health dictates performance, especially at quarterback.

Seahawks’ Derick Hall suspended one game for stepping on player

Here’s a look at the updates, as well as insight from head coach Mike Macdonald and additional information from ESPN NFL reporter Jeremy Fowler.

• The biggest concern for the Seahawks coming out of the game is safety Coby Bryant, who has a knee injury. Macdonald said in a press conference Friday that Bryant would “get imaged,” meaning undergo an MRI. Fowler reported on social media that, per sources, Bryant is “expected to miss ‘some time’ based on initial tests.”

• Cornerback Riq Woolen has a knee concern of his own, but Fowler reported that it’s “not considered serious” and that, per a source, Woolen “more so got ‘banged up.'”

• Versatile defensive back Nick Emmanwori was evaluated for a concussion late in Thursday’s game, but Macdonald said he cleared concussion protocol.

The Seahawks improved to 12-3 with their win over the Rams, giving them a one-game lead over Los Angeles for both first place in the NFC West and the No. 1 seed to the postseason out of the NFC. The Seahawks also clinched a playoff spot with the dramatic comeback victory.

The next Seahawks game will be at 10 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 28 on the road against the Carolina Panthers (7-7). Radio coverage on Seattle Sports will begin at 7 a.m. that day with the pregame show.

That injury occurred in the first quarter of Thursday night's game at Lumen Field in Seattle. Dotson did not return after being carted back to the locker room.

Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall stomped on Dotson while Dotson was down on the ground – an act for which the NFL announced it suspended Hall one game without pay – and while McVay said the injury occurred before Hall's act, ""it certainly didn't help the matters and it was definitely not stuff we want in our game.""

McVay said Dotson's status will ""be possibly in doubt for the Falcons game.""

Second-year offensive lineman Justin Dedich took over for Dotson at right guard, and what he brought ""has been consistent with what he's been about,"" McVay said.

""This guy's always just kind of delivered, game's not too big for him,"" McVay said. ""He's tough. He plays tough, he plays physical. He's a great communicator. He understands the intent of what we're trying to get done. I thought he was really productive in both phases. If Kevin's not able to go, we'll obviously miss Kevin a bunch. But in the meantime, it's a real luxury to have a guy that's had as much experience in his first two years as as Justin has, and plays winning football for us.""

As for wide receiver Davante Adams (knee/hamstring), who missed Thursday night's game after re-aggravating a hamstring injury against the Lions in Week 15, McVay said he ""most likely"" will not be available."" With Adams out, the Rams took a committee approach to replacing him between the involvement of wide receivers Konata Mumpfield, Xavier Smith, and Jordan Whittington. McVay also praised Los Angeles' tight ends for the way they positively impacted the game.

McVay said they haven't really talked about keeping Adams out until the playoffs with a playoff spot already clinched.

""I think we really just take it a little bit at a time,"" McVay said. ""This guy's a great competitor. He wants to be out there. I say 'most likely' with Atlanta, (but) Davante's going to do everything he can to push to be available for that. And then it's our job to be able to kind of figure out what is best collectively with him. He's a player that deserves to be involved in those types of conversations because of the respect, the experience, but that's something that we've discussed at this point.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/rams/b8xm3kebjaoihzdlxuyq,N,,2025-12-19 22:00:16.036862

The NFL alleges that Hall unnecessarily stepped on the leg of Los Angeles Rams guard Kevin Dotson while Dotson was on the ground at the end of a play in the first quarter of the Seahawks' overtime win at Lumen Field on Thursday night. Dotson left the game with an ankle injury and did not return. He was later seen outside the Rams' locker room on crutches and with a walking boot on his left foot.

Hall ""absolutely"" plans to appeal the suspension, a source told ESPN. If it's upheld, he'll be eligible to return to the Seahawks' active roster Monday, Dec. 29, a day after Seattle's Week 17 game against the Carolina Panthers.

Rams coach Sean McVay was asked Friday whether Dotson got injured because of the stomp or was injured earlier in the play.

""I think he was injured before, but it certainly didn't help the matter,"" McVay said. ""And it was definitely not stuff we want in our game.""

A second-round pick in 2023, Hall is part of Seattle's four-man outside linebacker rotation and averages roughly 30 snaps per game. He has one sack and 10 QB hits in 13 games this season after recording eight sacks and 20 QB hits in 2024.

The Seahawks (12-3) clinched a playoff berth and took over sole possession of first place in the NFC West with their win over Los Angeles, but their defense might be short-handed next week against Carolina.

Safety Coby Bryant and cornerback Riq Woolen both suffered knee injuries in the fourth quarter Thursday night and did not return. Coach Mike Macdonald said postgame that Bryant's ""is not automatically season-ending right now.""

Sources told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler that Bryant is expected to miss ""some time"" based on initial tests and that Woolen's injury is not considered serious.

Nickelback Nick Emmanwori also went down in the fourth quarter Thursday night, but Macdonald said he cleared the concussion protocol and would have returned had Seattle's defense gone back onto the field.

Meanwhile, after missing Tuesday's session with a stinger, Saquon Barkley logged back-to-back full practices and carries no injury designation for Saturday.

The Commanders have decided to shut Jayden Daniels down for the rest of the season, and he's since been officially ruled out. That means backup Marcus Mariota will get another start. He'll do so without his star left tackle as Larmey Tunsil is out with a strained oblique. Tunsil practiced on a limited basis on Wednesday, but was downgraded to a non-participant on Thursday.

Chicago's receiver room will be thin in Week 16 with both Rome Odunze and Luther Burden III sidelined for this matchup. Meanwhile, running back D'Andre Swift popped up on the injury report on Wednesday and logged back-to-back limited sessions due to a groin injury, which has him questionable.

New England's defense could have a serious dent put into it this weekend, particularly if a number of key questionable players are unable to go. Christian Barmore seemed to be the most at risk of not playing after not participating on Friday. Every other questionable Patriot practiced on a limited basis to end the week.

After not practicing on Wednesday, Lamar Jackson participated fully on both Thursday and Friday, and carries no designation for Week 16. Maybe the most intriguing aspect of Baltimore's injury report, however, is Kyle Hamilton, who is questionable after popping up on the report on Friday as a limited participant with an ankle injury.

Coach Kevin O'Connell said Friday that Darrisaw has not suffered a setback or a new injury. O'Connell said it's his ""personal belief"" that Darrisaw will be able to resume a normal practice and playing routine next season. The Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention last week.

""This was a collaborative decision based upon where we're at in the season,"" O'Connell said, ""from the standpoint of Christian's workload and what these next few games and days are going to look like for our team. ... We thought this was the best decision for Christian in the short term, but at the same time, I think a lot of this can be a projection on a really positive outlook for 2026.""

Darrisaw, 26, signed a four-year contract extension worth up to $113 million in July 2024. On Oct. 24, 2024, he tore the ACL and MCL in his knee during a game against the Los Angeles Rams.

He recovered well enough to avoid the physically unable to perform list and opened training camp on the active roster, but he sat out the Vikings' first two games and later revealed he had been told it would take a full year to recover.

Even after that landmark passed, Darrisaw couldn't push beyond being a part-time player. He started 10 games this season but left five of them early. He took himself out of two of those games, Week 5 against the Cleveland Browns and Week 8 against the Los Angeles Chargers, while coaches removed him from the other three to manage his workload. The Vikings also excused him from at least one day of practice per week to give him extra rest.

Darrisaw said Thursday that he preferred not to talk about his season and wasn't able to answer a question about his availability for the Vikings' final three games.

""There's just a lot of layers to it,"" O'Connell said, ""where as coaches and as the head coach, we're just trying to defer to the medical staff and most importantly, making sure Christian's in a good place and everything. It has been just a really unique year for him and one that I think he'll be able to really grow from.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0723%2Fr1362312_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:02:12.375435

Hamilton, who is arguably the Ravens' most essential defensive weapon, was limited in Friday's practice. Playing across Baltimore's defense, Hamilton has 87 tackles, seven passes defensed, one sack, and six tackles for loss.

Ravens cornerback Chidobe Awuzie returned to practice Friday after missing the first two days, but is doubtful to play after being limited.

""I think Chido is going to be iffy,"" Head Coach John Harbaugh said. ""We'll have to see how it goes up and until the game.""

Awuzie, who injured his foot in Cincinnati last week, has been one of the Ravens' most effective defensive players this season. He has the fifth-highest Pro Football Focus grade among all NFL cornerbacks who have taken at least half their team's defensive snaps.

Left tackle Ronnie Stanley (knee/ankle) is questionable after he didn't log a full practice all week. Defensive lineman John Jenkins, who has been sidelined by an illness the past couple days, is also questionable to play.

""I think [Jenkins] should be OK by gameday, but there is a little 'flu bug' going around, and he got it,"" Harbaugh said.

Rookie inside linebacker Teddye Buchanan, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in Cincinnati, is still on the 53-man roster and has been ruled out. Trenton Simpson is slated to step into Buchanan's starting role and has the confidence of his coaches and teammate Roquan Smith. Rookie linebacker Jay Higgins IV (knee) returned to practice this week but has also been ruled out.

Patriots Rule Out Leading Tackler

The Patriots have ruled out linebacker Robert Spillane, who leads the team with 97 tackles. He hasn't practiced all week due to an ankle injury.

Spillane, who spent four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, also has two interceptions and one sack this season and it's a hit to the middle of New England's defense.

""He's a really good player, a really underrated player probably,"" Harbaugh said. ""He's one of those guys that people want to make assumptions about, then all he does is go out there and make every single tackle – that's kind of who he is. So, it's a factor, but they have a lot of good players on defense.""

Four other key Patriots defenders are all questionable: cornerback Marcus Jones (knee), who leads the Patriots with three interceptions, outside linebacker Harold Landry III (knee), who leads them with 8.5 sacks, fellow starting cornerback Carlton Davis III, and defensive tackle Christian Barmore.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/ravens/lx0lnfow3c5n8b910vsl,N,,2025-12-19 18:02:21.111201

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Ruled OUT

OT Giovanni Manu (knee, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 19

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

Manu returned to practice this week, but with only two practices under his belt, he’s not ready to return to action just yet. He still has over two weeks remaining in his injury evaluation window, so the Lions are in no rush to return him quicker than necessary.

Joseph has now missed five practices since coach Dan Campbell noted that the All-Pro safety had a setback last week, and he looks no closer to returning than he did two months ago. It may be just a matter of time before he is placed on injured reserve.

Questionable

C Graham Glasgow (knee)

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 11

OL Trystan Colon (wrist)

CB Amik Robertson (hand)

Glasgow was estimated to have been able to practice on Wednesday during the Lions walkthrough, but he showed up as a non-participant on Thursday, was still unable to practice on Friday, and has been listed as questionable. If he is downgraded or ruled inactive for this game, the Lions will most likely turn to Trystan Colon—as they have done previously—but he is also dealing with an injury and is listed as questionable. If Colon is unable to play, the Lions will likely turn to Michael Niese (who was the Lions’ backup center last season) or practice squader Kingsley Eguakun.

“We’ve obviously worked Colon because he’s been there. I know he’s got the wrist, but he was out there working with it yesterday,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said on Friday. “Just trying to get Graham off his feet. But I mean, we’ve worked Niese, we’ve worked Kingsley. We’ve kind of just hit all around, and we’re rolling the guards, too. So, it’s really been a little bit of a revolving door trying to get a number of guys ready because there’s a lot of flex going into this game right now.”

Decker missed practice on Wednesday and Friday, but got in a Thursday practice, which is more than he was able to do in Week 15. He’s been getting considerable rest as the season has progressed, so this pattern is not unusual, and he is expected to start at left tackle on Sunday.

Mahogany has made steady progress toward returning from injured reserve, and he’ll have a chance to see that happen this weekend. If he is activated, expect him to jump back into his starting left guard role, but there’s still a chance he will need another week before he’s ready.

“Yesterday, I thought he looked pretty good. Wasn’t perfect, but I thought he looked pretty good,” Campbell said of Mahogany. “And some of it’s going to be, I know he’s a little sore today, and how he feels in today’s practice. That’s what a lot of it’s going to come down to.”

Colon has been limited in practice this week, but he’s been present and participating in all three. If he’s able to play through his wrist injury, he’ll potentially have a chance to fill a big role against the Steelers.

Robertson has been practicing with a club/brace on his hand, and he has suggested that he will have a chance to play in this game with its protection. Robertson has previously played with a club on his hand (in college) and has noted he is familiar with its limitations.

Not listed with an injury designation

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

LG Kayode Awosika (foot)

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki has been playing through a thumb injury for several weeks now, but he was fortunately able to return to a full level of participation this week, suggesting he is very close to putting the injury behind him.

Awosika missed the previous two games with a foot injury, but he’s been practicing in full this week and looks ready to return to the game day roster. Depending on how things shake out with the rest of the interior offensive line, there’s a chance Awosika could be called upon to start at left tackle this week.

Harper was unable to clear the NFL’s concussion protocols last week, but he’s been practicing in full this week and appears close to being able to return to game action. If cleared, he’ll return to the starting free safety role, likely starting alongside Avonte Maddox.

Five players had their practice status changed in a negative way, and while Sean McDermott didn’t specify exactly how all of it went down, it just leaves you shaking your head this season with the amount of injuries the Bills have suffered in practice.

Defensive back Taron Johnson and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones went from full practice in Wednesday’s walk through session to limited on Thursday and McDermott said they would get veteran rest/injury management days off Friday. And defensive back Cam Lewis, offensive lineman Chase Lundt and punter Mitch Wishnowsky - yes, the punter - went from no designation to limited.

Bills injury report: Who is definitely out vs Browns

As for who McDermott said would not play Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, defensive tackle Jordan Phillips and kicker Matt Prater were already ruled out early in the week, and Lundt - a rookie who hasn’t really played this season - is going to be inactive. McDermott added that Lewis was not going to practice Friday, so that seems like a bad sign for his availability in Cleveland. He was officially listed as questionable when the final injury report was released Friday afternoon.

With Prater out, that means newly-signed kicker Michael Badgley will be elevated from the practice squad Saturday afternoon.

Dion Dawkins returns to practice

Now, it wasn’t all bad news as left tackle Dion Dawkins returned to work after missing two days with an illness. Obviously, Dawkins is a key player Sunday because he’ll be working against Browns superstar edge rusher Myles Garrett.

Linebacker Terrel Bernard and wide receiver/punt returner Mecole Hardman both improved from limited to full Thursday, and then Friday, cornerback Christian Benford was going to be a full participant which is potentially good news for his status Sunday.

Benford sat out last week’s game with a toe injury and he is perhaps the Bills’ best defensive player, so a return would certainly be nice, even though the Browns’ passing game isn’t anything to be too concerned about, even if Benford winds up not playing.

Bernard has missed the last three games with an elbow injury, and previously he was battling an ankle injury. Hardman is on injured reserve but his practice window was opened Wednesday, so there’s a chance he could be activated in time for Sunday’s game as he was officially listed for the game as questionable. If he plays, McDermott will have an interesting decision to make at receiver.

Hardman would immediately return to punt return duties, but Ray Davis has locked down the kickoff return job. He leads the NFL with a 32.4 average so taking him out of that role would not be wise. But who would Hardman replace in the wide receiver group if he’s active? Would he replace Brandin Cooks who has done nothing in three games and has not given the Bills the deep threat that is so lacking in the offense? Hardman can provide speed, and his advantage would be his contribution to special teams.

“He’s practiced this week, first week opening his window coming off IR so we’ll see how it goes,” McDermott said.

Browns will be missing several players

One of Cleveland's best players, offensive guard Wyatt Teller, may be able to return to action as he's listed as questionable with a calf injury. But overall, it's not a pretty picture for the 3-11 Browns.

Ruled out are their best cornerback, Denzel Ward, starting offensive tackle Jack Conklin, tight end David Njoku, and backup running back Dylan Sampson.

Mike Vrabel delivered some concerning injury updates on Friday. The head coach confirmed that linebacker Robert Spillane will miss Sunday night’s game with a left ankle injury.

Some other key defenders could join Spillane on the sideline. Vrabel announced that Harold Landry III, Marcus Jones, Carlton Davis III and Christian Barmore are all questionable.

Although he was active, Spillane didn’t play during Sunday’s costly 35-31 loss to the Buffalo Bills. New England allowed 349 total yards and 28 second-half points without its leading tackler.

Spillane missed practice all week, so the Patriots must face another MVP quarterback without the 30-year-old. They’ll hope the rest of the unit isn’t too hampered against Lamar Jackson and Co.

Landry, Jones, Davis and Barmore all missed Thursday’s practice, but Patriots.com’s Evan Lazar spotted the first three on the field Friday. Barmore worked on an exercise bike, which the defensive tackle did last Friday before playing 51 snaps against Buffalo.

Barmore would be a significant loss before opposing Derrick Henry and a Ravens offense allowing an NFL-high 5.2 yards per carry. Landry leads the Patriots with 8.5 sacks, Jones has secured a team-leading three interceptions, and Davis has started all 14 games this season.

Spillane had been active for the Patriots' Week 15 loss to the Buffalo Bills, but didn't play in the game, with Vrabel saying he was available only in an emergency.

In his absence, the Patriots' recent slippage against the run continued, which has been a point of emphasis for them in preparation for the Ravens, who rank third in the NFL in averaging 146.2 rushing yards per game. Running back Derrick Henry leads the Ravens with 1,125 yards on 233 carries (4.8 avg.) and 10 touchdowns, followed by quarterback Lamar Jackson with 333 rushing yards on 61 carries (5.5 avg.).

Of the run defense, Patriots outside linebackers coach Mike Smith said: ""Obviously we're struggling a little bit, it's been down these last couple weeks. We have to get back to what we were at the beginning of the year.""

Four-year veteran Jack Gibbens assumed Spillane's role as the defensive signal-caller last week, thrust into a starting role alongside four-year veteran Christian Elliss (61 tackles, tied for third on the team). Vrabel said Gibbens is slated to start again.

He was a limited participant in Wednesday and Thursday's practices before not participating in the team's final full practice Friday. As a reminder: London has missed each of the last four games with a PCL sprain in his knee.

He told reported Thursday that he is ""trending in the right direction"" to get the green light Sunday.

""I want to get back out there quick as possible,"" London said. ""But everything is going smoothly. I've been making good strides and leaps. That's all I can ask for.""

Despite listing him as questionable, head coach Raheem Morris said Friday that he fully expects to have London available on Sunday.

Joining London as a non-participant in Friday's practice and with a game designation of questionable was defensive lineman Brandon Dorlus (illness/shoulder) and edge rusher James Pearce Jr. (foot).

The inclusion of Pearce on the injury report was a surprise as he was a Friday add. Like what he said about London, Morris was asked about Pearce's status and said he expects him to be ready to go Sunday, too. Per Morris this week feels like the ""healthiest weeks"" the Falcons have had in a while.

Pearce currently leads all rookies — and the Falcons' team at large — with eight total sacks. He contributed two to his total last week against the Buccaneers.

Pearce's eight sacks are the most by a Falcons rookie in a single season since individual sacks were officially recorded in 1982. According to team record books, the organization recognizes Claude Humphreys as the rookie leader in sacks with 11.5. Pearce has recorded at least one sack in six straight games, tying the second-longest streak by any NFL rookie since individual sacks were officially recorded. He ties Jevon Kearse's record from 1999.

The only players the Falcons have ruled out of Sunday's game are cornerback Mike Hughes — who suffered an ankle injury early in the team's win over the Bucs last week — and wide receiver KhaDarel Hodge — who has been on and off the injury reports the last couple weeks with a shoulder injury. Morris ruled Hughes out earlier in the week and the expectation is his absence could open the door for more opportunities for undrafted rookie Cobee Bryant.

Brown and DeVonta Smith, who combined for just four targets in Week 15 as Philly cruised to a blowout win.
Mariota has performed admirably in his seven starts this year with an 11:5 TD-INT ratio and a 92.7 passer rating.","The state of the Eagles offense has been a weekly focus throughout Philly's bid for a repeat. The unit's struggles hit a nadir during a horrendous Week 14 loss to the Chargers in prime time in which Jalen Hurts had five turnovers -- including two on the same play -- prompting debate on if Nick Sirianni should consider a QB change. That obviously did not happen, and the Eagles responded last week with one of their best offensive performances to date in a 31-0 win over the Raiders. Performances against Las Vegas this season should be taken with a grain of salt, but the 31 points are the most that the Eagles have scored since Week 8. Hurts wasn't asked to do too much (15 pass attempts), but he finished 12 of 15 with three TDs for a 154.9 passer rating (second career game with a 150-plus rating). His 80% completion percentage was more than 20 points higher than what Hurts posted during the Eagles' previous three-game losing streak, and he'll face another struggling defense on Saturday in the Commanders. Washington enters Week 16 with the NFL's 31st-ranked defense (382.6 yards allowed per game), 26th-ranked scoring unit (26.8 PPG) and 31st-ranked opposing passer rating (107.3). With Saquon Barkley battling a stinger during the week, Hurts could be asked to lead the offense in the potential playoff-clincher. If that is the case, expect to see a bigger role for wideouts A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, who combined for just four targets in Week 15 as Philly cruised to a blowout win.

A season that began with so much promise in Washington will end with Marcus Mariota under center as the Commanders play out the string already eliminated from playoff contention. Washington announced this week that second-year QB Jayden Daniels would sit out the final three games of the year after he aggravated an elbow injury two weeks ago. When it's over, Daniels will have missed 10 games after he led the Commanders to a stunning trip to the NFC Championship Game in his rookie season. Figuring out the best ways to keep Daniels healthy will be the the top priority this offseason. Before that, ending this season on a positive note will be atop the agenda. Washington's win last week over the New York Giants snapped an eight-game losing skid, and keeping the Eagles from clinching the division on their home turf would be a nice Christmas gift for Commanders fans. Doing so will be a tall task against an Eagles defense ranked sixth in the league in points allowed (19.4) and first in opposing completion percentage (56.0). Mariota has performed admirably in his seven starts this year with an 11:5 TD-INT ratio and a 92.7 passer rating. Veteran wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who has battled his own share of injuries this season, has two touchdowns since returning to action at the end of November. If the Commanders want to pull off the upset, a big day for No. 17 could go a long way.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/zvqy0kpfbzalr8cj6qlf,N,,2025-12-19 19:01:42.418168

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes tore the ACL in his left knee against the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14.
ACL tears occur when too much stress is placed on the ligament.
Most ACL tears require surgery and extended physical therapy to heal.
Many athletes have been able to come back from ACL tears and experience continued success.","Knee injuries are some of the most common in sports. In the NFL, two star players saw their seasons end in a matter of hours in Week 15 due to ACL tears.

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes tore the ACL in his left knee against the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14. The injury was caused by hyperextension. Mahomes had to exit the game during the Chiefs’ final drive, and his team’s eventual loss knocked them out of playoff contention for the first time since 2014.

Green Bay Packers edge rusher Micah Parsons tore his ACL on the same day. He went down without contact while chasing Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix.

While ACL tears are all too common across the league — other prominent players such as New York Giants receiver Malik Nabers, San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz, Miami Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill and Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. have suffered them this season — what exactly is an ACL tear?

ACL stands for anterior cruciate ligament, and it is one of four main ligaments in the knee. The ACL’s primary function is to provide stability during lateral or rotational movement.

ACL tears occur when too much stress is placed on the ligament. These injuries can be contact-related or occur without any contact at all. Sudden stops in acceleration, twisting movements, hyperextension or landing awkwardly from a jump can all cause excessive strain on the ACL and result in a tear.

Recovery can take anywhere from nine to 12 months, meaning a torn ACL is almost always season-ending in the NFL. Most ACL tears require surgery and extended physical therapy to heal.

Mahomes acted quickly on his injury by getting surgery the following day, which was deemed successful. Chiefs head athletic trainer Rick Burkholder said rehab started on Tuesday with the early goal of getting the quarterback’s muscles firing to help reduce the swelling in his knee. Mahomes will wear a protective brace as his knee heals.

Many athletes have been able to come back from ACL tears and experience continued success. Tom Brady tore his ACL in his ninth NFL season (the same as Mahomes) and came back the following year to win the Comeback Player of the Year award. Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow won the same award in 2021 when he returned from a torn ACL and MCL to lead the Bengals to a Super Bowl appearance.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/18200911/AP25352566418241-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-19 13:00:35.721125

As a result, it will be worth checking Friday’s injury report to see what their official game statuses end up being.","The New England Patriots are preparing for their upcoming Week 16 contest against the Baltimore Ravens, and it’s clear that injuries are going to play a role in this game. On Thursday, the Pats were dealt some concerning injury updates on the defensive side of the ball.

For much of the year, New England did well to avoid the injury bug, but it is beginning to get hit hard down the homestretch of the season. Milton Williams and Will Campbell are both on injured reserve, and it was hard not to notice Robert Spillane’s absence from the team’s Week 15 loss to the Buffalo Bills.

Besides Campbell, the Pats appear to be pretty healthy on offense heading into this one. The same can’t be said for the defense, as Spillane, Carlton Davis III, Marcus Jones and Harold Landry III all missed practice for the second straight day, throwing their status for Sunday up in the air.

It’s safe to say the concern level regarding these injuries is growing. Landry has missed multiple practices in previous weeks before logging a limited session on Friday and suiting up on Sunday, so he should be able to play if he can practice on Friday.

Story continues below advertisement

The rest of the guys are big question marks, though. Spillane didn’t play against the Bills, despite being active for the game, which isn’t a good sign. Davis suffered a groin injury during that game, and while he returned, it appears he isn’t fully healthy.

Regardless of whether Parsons, who has five straight seasons with at least a dozen sacks, can come close to the record, even getting him back on the field early next season would be a boon for Green Bay.

New England had a shot to wrap up the AFC East by picking up a win over Buffalo, but instead, it left the door open for one of its top rivals to sneak in and make a late push for the top spot in the division. That had made picking up a win over Baltimore extremely important.

In the buildup to this game, the Ravens were put on high alert on Wednesday when superstar quarterback Lamar Jackson was forced to miss practice due to an illness. The team’s concerns were put to rest on Thursday, though, as Jackson practiced fully, putting him on track to be ready to go for this game.

Jackson has not been 100% healthy for much of the 2025 campaign, which has led to him not practicing on Wednesdays since returning from a knee injury that caused him to miss three games earlier this season. This simply appears to be par for the course for Jackson, as it never seemed like he was in real danger of missing this game.

While the Ravens have bounced back from a miserable start to the season, they haven’t looked as imposing as they have been in recent seasons. It is worth noting, though, that Baltimore is fresh off its most dominant victory over the season in Week 15, as it shut out the Cincinnati Bengals 24-0.

Watson, the receiver who was taken to a Denver hospital during last Sunday's loss to the Broncos for fear that he had sustained a serious chest injury, practiced Wednesday and Thursday and has proclaimed himself likely to play.

Jacobs, the running back who finished the game against the Broncos but has been battling a sore left knee for more than a month, did not practice all week.

They were among 10 players listed as questionable for the Packers (9-4-1) when they released their status report on Thursday afternoon.

When asked Thursday what he thought of Watson's return to practice, Packers coach Matt LaFleur said: ""Encouraging.""

As for Jacobs and starting right tackle Zach Tom (back/knee), LaFleur was less certain. Neither practiced Thursday.

""It means we'll give them up 'til game time,"" LaFleur said.

Jacobs said that his knee swelled up again during the loss to the Broncos, a game in which he had both a rushing and receiving touchdown and actually implored the coaches to put him back in despite the pain. Jacobs said he will once again push LaFleur to allow him to play against the Bears. He has missed just one game this season.

""It's been a couple times since I've been here where we kind of clashed on if they was going to allow me to play or not, and every time I had a pretty good game,"" Jacobs said. ""I think he's probably to the point where he's like, 'Man, I'm just going to trust you. If you say you can do it and you believe that you can do, then I'm going to let you go.'""

Among the others listed as questionable were safety Evan Williams (knee), receiver Dontayvion Wicks (ankle), running back Chris Brooks (chest), tackle Darian Kinnard (neck), defensive end Kingsley Enagbare (illness), defensive end Brenton Cox Jr. (groin) and defensive end Collin Oliver (hamstring). Neither Cox nor Oliver was on the active roster as of Thursday, but each had begun his three-week practice window to return from injury. Of that group of eight, only Williams and Enagbare did not practice Thursday.

The Packers ruled out tight end Josh Whyle (concussion), running back MarShawn Lloyd (calf, hamstring) and guard John Williams (back).

If Watson plays against the Bears (10-4), he would do so six days after his emergency room visit.

He went to a Denver hospital because there was an initial fear that he might not be able to fly home with the team after the game. But X-rays and a CT scan did not show anything that would prevent him from doing so. Watson was injured on a deep pass that was intercepted by Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II, who fell on top of Watson.

""They had some concern right away with just like with the ribs and stuff, making sure nothing was dislocated or anything,"" Watson said. ""Didn't want to put me in a bad spot just flying back and everything.""

""It's feeling pretty good for everything considered,"" Watson added. ""So, I think it'll be all right for the game.""

Watson's injury early in the third quarter was part of a deluge of injuries in the game, including Micah Parsons' season-ending torn ACL. Evan Williams sustained his knee injury on the same play in which Parsons was hurt, although it was barely noticeable.

""I look up, thinking I'm there's going to be a couple trainers,"" Williams said. ""There's one trainer holding a water bottle. And I'm like, 'Where's everybody else?'

THURSDAY NIGHT

L.A. Rams (+1) at Seattle, o/u 42.5 – Thursday, 8:15 p.m. EST

The Rams roll into this one with a tiebreaker-sized lead on Seattle in the NFC West thanks to a victory in their first meeting this season in Week 11, so another win here all but locks up the division title. The first clash was a defensive battle, 21-19, but that was the only time since the beginning of November that Matthew Stafford and company have been held to less than four touchdowns. Over seven games since their bye, the Rams have gone 6-1 while averaging 35.0 points and 407 yards of offense a game, and they've topped 40 points and 500 yards in back-to-back weeks against the Cards and Lions. Stafford has a 20:3 TD:INT in those seven games as he stays in the MVP conversation, but he'll likely be without his favorite red-zone target Thursday as Davante Adams nurses a hamstring strain. No worries — Colby Parkinson has been an outstanding Plan B with six TDs in the last six games, including two last week against Detroit. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum, meanwhile, have made eight trips to the end zone the last three weeks. Both these teams have strong defenses — both top four in PPG allowed and top 10 in yards per game allowed — but it's hard to overlook just how much of a juggernaut Sean McVay's offense has been while sending three TEs out there nearly a quarter of the time, forcing defenses to guess early whether they're about to have the ball run down their throat again or whether Parkinson or Terrance Ferguson or whoever is going to leak out and create a mismatch.

If the Seahawks do pull out a win, they'll be tied with the Rams atop the division standings, but they'll still have an uphill climb to take the crown — the Rams wrap up their schedule with two also-rans in the Falcons and Cardinals (combined 8-20 record), while the Seahawks get two road games against teams fighting for playoff spots in Carolina and San Francisco (combined 17-11). Still, they'll have almost no chance at all without a win Thursday. Mike Macdonald's crew has won four consecutive thanks to a defense that has been crushing inferior offenses lately, holding the Vikings, Falcons and Colts (or, more accurately, Max Brosmer, Kirk Cousins and Philip Rivers) to just 25 total points and an average of 218.7 yards per game with nine takeaways and six sacks. Needless to say, Stafford and the Rams are a bit of a step up in competition. Sam Darnold's been hit and miss lately, failing to throw any TDs at all in three of the last five games with a 5:5 TD:INT over that stretch, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba's fallen off his 2,000-yard pace as a result. (He's currently tracking to tie Julio Jones' 2015 campaign for third all-time at a mere 1,871 yards.) JSN's really the only member of the offense making a consistent impact, though, so if DC Aden Durde's unit stumbles at all, it could be tough for the Seahawks to keep up.

SATURDAY

Philadelphia at Washington (+6.5), o/u 44.5

Saturday, 5 p.m. EST

They did their best to blow it, but the Eagles find themselves on the verge of clinching the NFC East anyway — they'd have to lose out, and the Cowboys would have to run the table, for Philly to fail to become the division's first repeat champs since 2001-04, when Donovan McNabb and Andy Reid ruled the roost. Last week's rout of the Raiders snapped the Eagles' three-game losing streak, as the defense held Kenny Pickett and company to just 75 yards of offense and seven first downs in a 31-0 win. Saquon Barkley got into the end zone for a second straight game, the first time he's done that since Weeks 1-2, while Jalen Hurts rebounded from a four-INT performance to toss three TDs on only 15 attempts. The defending Super Bowl champions have only gone as far as DC Vic Fangio's unit has taken them this year, though. Philly's 6-0 when holding the opposition to 20 points or less, and 3-5 when it doesn't, with the team's last win against an offense it couldn't stifle coming against the Vikings in Week 7. The offense hasn't put together 400 yards since a Week 9 bye, and it's only hit that mark once in 2025.

Then again, if any defense can make the Eagles' offense look good, it's probably the Commanders. Last week's win over the Giants did snap an eight-game losing streak, but that was just a battle to see who was more dysfunctional now. With Washington out of playoff contention, Jayden Daniels has officially been shut down for the year, which is the smart decision. The second-year QB's difficulties staying healthy is bringing back unpleasant memories of Robert Griffin III, but Daniels' injuries seem to be more of the fluky variety. He's also hardly been the only key player sidelined for the Commanders in 2025, so running it back with Dan Quinn and a hopefully good draft class still seems like their best option.

Green Bay at Chicago (+1), o/u 46.5 – Saturday, 8:20 p.m. EST

Just one week after beating the Bears and taking over the NFC North lead, the Packers handed it right back by losing in Denver while Chicago stomped Cleveland at Soldier Field. This division could go right down to the wire, but the Pack do at least have a somewhat easier closing slate, facing the Ravens and Vikings (combined 13-15 record) instead of the 49ers and Lions (combined 18-10). The loss to the Broncos snapped a four-game win streak for Matt LaFleur's squad, but it was the defense that let it down, something that can't be surprising after Micah Parsons was lost to an ACL tear. The injury leaves a massive hole in the pass rush, and in the team's Super Bowl hopes. There'll be more pressure on Jordan Love and the offense as a result, especially with Josh Jacobs also banged up, and while Love did throw multiple INTs last week for the first time all season, that was against Patrick Surtain and an elite Denver secondary. If he does what he did against Chicago last time out — 68.0 percent completion rate, 9.4 YPA and a 3:1 TD:INT — the visitors should still be in good shape in this one.

It's really tough to get a read on Caleb Williams' development. Last week's 60.7 percent completion rate was his best mark since Week 8, but a 12:2 TD:INT over the last seven games is nothing to sneeze at. Ben Johnson's been riding his running game during that time anyway as the Bears have gone 6-1 — D'Andre Swift has 471 rushing yards, three TDs and a 5.2 YPC in the last six games, while Kyle Monangai has 495 yards, four TDs and a 4.8 YPC in the last seven. It's not quite Ram or Lion levels of production from the backfield, but it'll do. DC Dennis Allen's unit has gotten healthier, and stingier, during that span as well. Chicago's held four of the last six opponents to 20 points or less, though Green Bay was one of the exceptions, averaging 18.5 PPG allowed and 314.5 yards per game allowed with 11 takeaways and 12 sacks. With three strong teams in both the NFC North and NFC West, someone's going to get left out of the playoff picture, and from that perspective next week's trip to San Francisco might end up being more important to the Bears' postseason chances. Of course, just winning the North would make things a lot easier.

In Week 15, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL against the Los Angeles Chargers. He already underwent surgery on his knee, so his rehab is technically underway. However, there's no guarantee he'll be ready for Week 1 of the 2026 season.

""Every player is different. Every sport is different. Every position is different,"" said Rick Burkholder, the vice president of sports medicine for the Chiefs. ""[Mahomes] is so in tune to what he does, he does it a little quicker. Ballpark on this is nine months, but it could be a month or two more, a month or two less.""

On this week's episode of his ""Outta Pocket"" podcast, Griffin urged Mahomes to sit out all of next season to ensure he returns to full strength. The former No. 2 pick from Baylor suffered a torn ACL back in January of 2013.

“Is all hope lost with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs because he tore his ACL? I would say no, but I do think some changes need to be made,” Griffin said. “And the No. 1 change is not coming back too soon from injury. I believe that Patrick Mahomes should sit out the remainder — obviously the remainder of this year because he’s gonna be out — but he should sit out the entire next season because of when his injury happened.”

RG3 doubles down.

While on ""The Dan Patrick Show"" this Wednesday, Griffin said Mahomes isn't the only player who should sit out all of 2026. He wants Green Bay Packers pass rusher Micah Parsons to do the same.

Parsons suffered a torn ACL while sprinting towards Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix this past Sunday.

""The No. 1 advice I would give to Micah Parsons and Patrick Mahomes right now is to not play next year,"" Griffin said. ""It's because of when they got hurt. They both got hurt in December. We've seen guys come back in six months, eight months, but you don't really feel like yourself until 15 months after the injury. Don't get me wrong - 80% of Micah Parsons is better than dang near every pass rusher in the NFL and 80% of Patrick Mahomes is better than almost every quarterback in the NFL. But I look at it from my own experience. In hindsight, I wouldn't have played in 2013 because I wasn't back to myself yet.""

Miami will be starting a rookie quarterback and both teams seem to have a fairly lengthy injury report.

For the Bengals, defensive tackles B.J. Hill and Kris Jenkins Jr. missed their second consecutive practices on the week. The interior of the Bengals’ defensive line could be extremely thin if they can’t play Sunday. We could see some defensive lineman called up from the practice squad.

Furthering the concerns on the defensive line, Joseph Ossai (ankle) also missed practice. The Bengals are already down Trey Hendrickson, so Ossai missing the game is an extra hit to the pass rush rotation.

Wideout Tee Higgins (concussion) was limited again and is still actively in the NFL’s concussion protocol. Given the severity of his first concussion and him feeling symptoms over two weeks later, the Bengals wouldn’t catch much flack for sitting him another week.

Wide receiver and return man Charlie Jones (ankle) was also out.

Several players showed on the injury report, meaning they got treatment for an injury, but practiced in full.

For Miami, safety Minkah Fitzpatrick (calf) missed his second-straight practice. Arguably Miami’s best defender, his absence could be an advantage for the Bengals’ pass-heavy offense.

The All-Pro cornerback was added to the Dallas Cowboys' injury report on Wednesday, as the team began preparation to host the Los Angeles Chargers, with a foot issue that also sidelined him on Thursday.

As it stands, it doesn't appear likely Bland will practice on Friday, or appear in the game on Sunday, as the aforementioned foot injury makes him a top candidate to land on season-ending injured reserve — a move that would end his 2025 campaign with three games remaining on the schedule.

The news comes just days ahead of the Cowboys returning cornerback Josh Butler to practice, starting his 21-day window in the process, and needing to make a decision on the status of another All-Pro cornerback, Trevon Diggs.

Diggs, whose practice window was opened on Nov. 30, must be activated to the 53-man roster no later than this weekend, or he will also revert to season-ending IR. The Cowboys could justifiably bring both Diggs and Butler up from IR, though they more time to make such a decision on the latter than the former.

For Bland, the injury becomes the latest chapter in his struggle to remain fully healthy and available, and continues the trend of Dallas being unable to consistently field both of their All-Pro cornerbacks at the same time.

Just ahead of the 2024 season, he suffered a fracture in his foot that cost him a total of 10 games. He'd return to finish the year and entered the 2025 season with hopes of regaining top form — one that earned him the title of Pick-Six King during his record-setting 2023 season, leading to a four-year, $92 million extension in the offseason that followed; and prior to the aforementioned fracture in his foot sidelining him.

Bland managed soreness in his foot that cost him a couple games to begin this season as well, however, making the latest battle with the injury that much more concerning. Should he require surgery to repair his left foot, it will mark the second time in as many seasons, and puts his availability for the offseason program and the start of training camp in question.

As it stands, no decision has been made but, with only three games left to play and Bland's injury being grave enough to consider surgery at all, it's likely he's played his last down of 2025.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/rvbkwsnbnbowc8gppyqm,N,,2025-12-18 22:01:33.918263

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

No practice

C Graham Glasgow (knee) — New injury

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

Glasgow was not on the injury report on Wednesday, but was added with a knee injury on Thursday, which is a less-than-ideal situation. Mid-week injuries can often be too challenging to overcome, but with the Lions holding a walkthrough Wednesday, it may not be as bad as it appears on the surface.

It’s worth noting that until last week, Glasgow was previously listed with a knee injury, so his not practicing could mean that he either: Needed a rest day because his knee was still bothering him (a common practice with veterans), or he is dealing with a new injury/reaggravation that prevented him from practicing. Unfortunately, that leaves us with a lot of unanswered questions and a wide range of outcomes for his availability on Sunday.

Joseph continues to miss practice after suffering a setback last week, and it’s fair to wonder if he’ll play again this season, or if the Lions will consider shutting him down.

Limited practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder) — Upgraded from no practice

OL Trystan Colon (knee)

OT Giovanni Manu (knee, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 20

CB Amik Robertson (hand)

Decker returned to practice on Thursday after taking Wednesday off to rest his shoulder. It’s common for him to miss a practice or two each week, so there isn’t anything concerning with his health at this stage of the week.

Colon is sorting through a new injury this week, but he’s practiced both days, which puts him on track to be available for the Lions this weekend. Fortunately for the Lions, Kayode Awosika and Christian Mahogany—who are both ahead of Colon on the depth chart—are practicing in full this week, helping the Lions solidify some interior offensive line depth.

Manu has officially returned to the practice field (Wednesday’s practice was a walkthrough and an estimated participation level), thus starting his injury evaluation clock. He’ll now have 21 days in the window to be evaluated by the coaching staff, who have already set their eyes on getting him ready for the 2026 season.

“I think for Gio, he needs reps,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said. “Practice reps, get out there against our defense, against (Marcus) Davenport and (Aidan Hutchinson) Hutch in real-time practice. There’s not a ton of them, and it’s not like training, but he just needs reps, man. He cannot get enough reps. And if we’re able to use him or there’s something there this year, that’s a bonus. It’s really about getting him—will this set him up better for next year? Training camp, going into that next year. That’s really it.”

Robertson was practicing with his hand injury and is currently trending toward playing, potentially with a club on his hand, according to yesterday’s locker room conversation with Jeremy Reisman.

Full practice

RB Sione Vaki (thumb) — Upgraded to full practice

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 12

LG Kayode Awosika (foot)

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki continues to play through his thumb injury and has even shown a bit of a spark on special teams in recent games. This is the first full practice he’s gotten in some time, so he’s almost certainly good to go this week.

Mahogany got in a full week of limited practices and continues to make progress toward returning from injured reserve this week. The Lions are hopeful they can get him back this weekend and start him at left guard on Sunday.

“Last week, certainly was, ‘Okay, that looked pretty good.’ But also knew he wasn’t ready. So, we’re hopeful,” Campbell said of Mahogany possibly returning to game action this weekend. “It’s a good question. I mean, I’m kind of hoping. It looks pretty good. I hope he feels good, but we’ll know more really by Friday. So, full speed (Thursday), Friday he’ll go through, and then we’ll see if he can go.”

Awosika returned to practice last week but was unable to play in the game. However, he’s increased his participation levels this week, suggesting he may be on track to return and could end up starting at left guard if needed.

Harper has now stacked multiple practices, and while he wasn’t able to clear the NFL’s concussion protocols last week, his chances look improved based on his participation levels. The Lions would greatly benefit if he were able to return to a starting safety role.

Rome Odunze (foot) and Luther Burden III (ankle) were ruled out on the Bears' final injury report Thursday after not participating in either of Chicago's last two practices.
He was ruled out ahead of the Bears' first meeting with the Packers on Dec. 7 and was a late scratch Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.
Coach Ben Johnson said ""all options are on the table"" when asked whether the team would sideline Odunze for an extended stretch.
Burden was carted back to the locker room in the third quarter of Chicago's 31-3 win over Cleveland with an ankle injury.","LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- The Chicago Bears will be without two of their top wide receivers when they host the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night.

Rome Odunze (foot) and Luther Burden III (ankle) were ruled out on the Bears' final injury report Thursday after not participating in either of Chicago's last two practices.

It will be Odunze's third straight game missed due to the recurring foot injury he has been dealing with since late October. He was ruled out ahead of the Bears' first meeting with the Packers on Dec. 7 and was a late scratch Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.

Coach Ben Johnson said ""all options are on the table"" when asked whether the team would sideline Odunze for an extended stretch.

""We're going to do what's best for Rome first and foremost,"" Johnson said. ""I know he wants to be out there and helping. It's hard to tell him no sometimes. He just wants to be out on the field competing and contributing and helping our team win. So there may be a case where we have to protect him from himself a little bit and just make sure we get him right and he'll be able to help us down the road.""

Burden was carted back to the locker room in the third quarter of Chicago's 31-3 win over Cleveland with an ankle injury. He finished as the team's leading receiver with six catches for 84 yards.

DJ Moore paved the way for the Bears' passing attack with his two-touchdown performance against the Browns. His workload could increase even further with Odunze and Burden out, and reserve receivers such as Devin Duvernay and Jahdae Walker might get a chance to play meaningful snaps.

""I've been really pleased with that room,"" Johnson said of the Bears' receiver depth. ""I think we've got some young guys in there that we were really impressed with throughout training camp that ended up being on the practice squad. If called upon, I think they've done a great job soaking the offense in over the course of the season so far and being involved. Coach [Antwaan Randle] El has done a great job with them just keeping them engaged and walking through. They're in a great spot, and I feel that way about all the guys that are either on the practice squad or have been primarily special teams players to this point.""

The Bears (10-4) lost the first meeting between these NFC North rivals two weeks ago in Green Bay but enter Saturday ahead of the Packers (9-4-1) atop the division standings.

Running back D'Andre Swift sustained a groin injury in practice this week that led to him being limited Wednesday and Thursday. He has dealt with groin injuries throughout the season and missed Chicago's Week 9 game at Cincinnati while recovering.

Swift and tight end Cole Kmet (ankle/knee) are listed as questionable against the Packers, but Kmet said he will play.

The Bears activated linebacker Tremaine Edmunds' 21-day window to return to practice this week. He was listed as limited Tuesday and Wednesday and was a full participant Thursday. He is officially questionable.

""If we can get Tremaine back, it's a huge bonus,"" Johnson said. ""He was playing tremendous football before the injury.""

Despite missing four games with a groin injury, Edmunds leads the Bears in tackles (89), is tied for second in passes defensed (9) and is third in interceptions (4).",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0924%2Fr1550543_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 22:01:47.283139

“It’s never easy seeing your guys go down,” Kelce said on Wednesday’s episode of his “New Heights” podcast.
Kelce, along with several other disappointed Chiefs players, did not speak to the media in the postgame locker room.
In opening up about Mahomes’ injury and the Chiefs’ season on his podcast, which Kelce hosts with his brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, Travis described Mahomes as “fearless.” “He’s going to battle through this.
It’s just things didn’t go our way up to that point, and that’s the game for you right there,” Kelce said.","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said, “It was almost like it wasn’t real” when watching quarterback Patrick Mahomes go down with a torn ACL in Sunday’s 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.

“It’s never easy seeing your guys go down,” Kelce said on Wednesday’s episode of his “New Heights” podcast. “For the season to be going like it did up to that point, and we’re on our last quest to try and keep our playoff hopes alive there in the fourth quarter, and on a freakish play to see (number) 15 go down like that man, it f—in’ it was almost like it wasn’t real.”

Sunday’s loss was the final straw in a domino effect of outcomes that eliminated the Chiefs from playoff contention. Kelce, along with several other disappointed Chiefs players, did not speak to the media in the postgame locker room.

In opening up about Mahomes’ injury and the Chiefs’ season on his podcast, which Kelce hosts with his brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, Travis described Mahomes as “fearless.”

“He’s going to battle through this. It’s the only way this guy is wired, man,” Kelce said. “He’s a fearless, fearless warrior when it comes to this football thing. He’s going to make sure he comes back stronger than ever.”

Kelce continued, “Hopefully, the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible. I know right now, it’s kind of right around that Week 1 or beginning of next year. So I know he’s going to be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs as soon as possible.”

On Monday, Mahomes had surgery to repair the tear in his left ACL. The Chiefs said the procedure was successful and that the three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback will begin his rehab process immediately. ACL recovery can take between nine and 12 months, but coach Andy Reid said he is optimistic Mahomes will recuperate on an accelerated timeline.

Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew will replace Mahomes for the remainder of the season. When he stepped in against the Chargers after Mahomes’ injury, Minshew completed 3-of-5 passes, but ended the game with an interception on a pass intended for Kelce.

“We had some momentum going there with our guy Gardner Minshew and tried to find a way there at the end. It’s just things didn’t go our way up to that point, and that’s the game for you right there,” Kelce said. “Things, when you need them the most, just weren’t falling for us, and you gotta go back to the drawing board.”

The Chiefs have not missed the postseason since 2014. They have made seven straight AFC Championship Game appearances, winning five of them. Kansas City still has three games left (at the Tennessee Titans, versus the Denver Broncos and at the Las Vegas Raiders), but the stakes are different than this team is used to. Kelce was a rookie the last year the Chiefs missed the playoffs, and he described the team’s current state as “unfamiliar territory” to many on the roster.

“We’ve got three games left, I know we’re still talking about this game, but the integrity of who you are as a professional and as a player, you gotta love this s—,” Kelce said. “Chiefs Kingdom, we’re going to give you everything we’ve got. There’s no question about that.

“There’s only one way I do things. There’s only one way Coach Reid does things, and if we’re going to go out there and play some football, we’re going to do it the right way and keep trying to get these things fixed and end on the highest note we can.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/17124056/kelce-mahomes-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-18 20:00:25.608205

""He still has some vision limitations in his eye so we're going to get him back on the practice field, get him throwing some scout team,"" head coach Shane Steichen said of Richardson. ""It's good to get him back out there.""

Steichen said Richardson would not be available for Monday night's game against the 49ers.

They finished the game without Davante Adams, who re-aggravated a hamstring injury in the fourth quarter.

The Rams travel to Seattle on a short week to battle the Seahawks (11-3) on ""Thursday Night Football."" The question remains whether the star wide receiver will suit up.

NFL Media's Ian Rapoport reported on Dec. 15 that Adams is considered ""week-to-week"" with the hamstring injury. Rapoport wrote Adams is ""almost certainly"" going to miss the Rams' Week 16 ""Thursday Night Football"" game but the team listed the 12-year veteran as doubtful on Wednesday's final injury report.

The winner of this pivotal ""Thursday Night Football"" matchup will likely take control of the NFC West division and have the inside track to the NFC's No. 1 seed.

Here's the latest on Adams before the ""Thursday Night Football"" kickoff against the Seahawks.

Davante Adams injury update

The Rams have not yet announced whether Adams will be available for Thursday night's game against the Seahawks.

Adams failed to practice in any capacity on the short week and his status for the game is still undetermined. Official word may not come until the Rams announce their inactive players for ""Thursday Night Football.""

Adams has not missed any games this season. He has not missed a game since September 2024, when he missed two games due to a hamstring injury. Prior to that, he played all but one game between 2021 and 2023.

With Rapoport suggesting Adams will miss Thursday's game, it's likely the Rams will allow Adams extra time to rest with the ""mini bye"" following ""Thursday Night Football."" The Rams have already clinched a playoff spot but remain in the race for the No. 1 seed.

Los Angeles would certainly benefit if Adams can regain full health by the start of the postseason.

Rams WR depth chart

Puka Nacua

Davante Adams (questionable – hamstring)

Konata Mumpfield

Tutu Atwell

Jordan Whittington

Xavier Smith

Nacua ranks second in the NFL in receptions (102) and receiving yards (1,367), but if Adams misses time, the wide receiver room is thin. Atwell returned from IR in Week 15 and Mumpfield has scored just one touchdown this season. No Rams wide receivers outside of Nacua and Adams have garnered more than 25 targets in 2025.

Running back Kyren Williams and tight end Colby Parkinson will likely see additional work if Adams misses time.

Safety Kerby Joseph has missed the last eight games with a knee injury and may be moved to injured reserve.

Cornerback Amik Robertson practiced with a club on his injured left hand and expects to play Sunday.

Left tackle Taylor Decker, who missed last week's practices, was a limited participant.

Graham Glasgow played all 64 snaps last Sunday in the Detroit Lions' loss to the Los Angeles Rams this past Sunday.

But on Thursday, when the team held its first full practice since that defeat, the veteran center did not participate and was listed with a knee injury on the organization's official report. This season, Glasgow has started 13 of 14 games. However, a knee injury caused him to miss the Lions' loss to Green Bay late last month. It's uncertain, however, whether his current condition is related to his previous ailment.

Glasgow was one of two players absent Thursday. The other was Kerby Joseph.

Joseph’s absence wasn’t much of a surprise. He has missed the last eight games as he continues to deal with a lingering bone bruise in his left knee. After returning to practice Dec. 10, he suffered a “setback,” according to Lions coach Dan Campbell. He hasn’t participated in practice since. Campbell acknowledged last week that the All-Pro safety could be moved to injured reserve in the near future.

“We’re at the backend of the season now, so anything – even if it’s not technically long term becomes long term because we don’t have many games left,” he said then.

But Joseph remains on the active roster.

There was fear that the secondary could lose another one of its main cogs when cornerback Amik Robertson left late in the fourth quarter of the Lions’ 41-34 loss to the Los Angeles Rams this past Sunday. But Robertson was going through drills Thursday with a black-colored club on the left hand he injured while trying to strip the ball from tight end Colby Parkinson on his game-sealing 11-yard touchdown catch.

Robertson, who was listed as a limited partipant, told reporters Wednesday that he planned to play Sunday against Pittsburgh.

“That’s how it is looking, if everything goes right,” he said. “It went right (Wednesday) … I’m going to try to have some contact, and I should be fine.”

Other observations: Tight end Brock Wright (trachea) and linebacker Zach Cunningham (hamstring), who are both on injured reserve, were seen working off to the side at practice. Left tackle Taylor Decker, who missed every practice last week but played the maximum number of offensive snaps Sunday, was listed as a limited participant Thursday. He has spent much of the year dealing with pain in his surgically-repaired right shoulder.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/02/PDTF/87052114007-110225-lionsvikspre-011.jpg?crop=4431,2493,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-18 20:00:33.691843

Thursday night's matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks has massive NFC playoff implications. The winner of said game will likely have the inside track to the conference's No. 1 seed throughout the postseason next month, which obviously means guaranteed homefield advantage and the sole bye week available.

Unfortunately for the Rams, who beat the Seahawks at home earlier this season, they will have to overcome their NFC West rival on the road without one of their best players.

Veteran star receiver Davante Adams is likely to miss Thursday's game with a left hamstring injury. It's a reaggravation of the same injury Adams suffered earlier this season. The Rams apparently don't believe Adams' injury is of a long-term variety. He could theoretically return as soon as next week. But with the postseason around the corner, they're rightfully proceeding with caution so one of their top playmakers is healthy and can play in the biggest games.

Even still, a road game against the team nipping at your heels in the NFC and NFC West is probably the worst game to miss. Alas, the Rams are definitely more equipped than most to survive without Adams for at least one week:

We'll see how the Rams fare without Adams, who leads the team in touchdowns (14) and is second in both catches and receiving yards.

Who is Davante Adams' backup on the Rams?

Green Bay ruled out tight end Josh Whyle (concussion), running back MarShawn Lloyd (calf/hamstring), and guard John Williams (back).
The fourth-year wideout was cleared to travel with the team Sunday night and allowed to practice on a limited basis this week.
""Encouraging,"" said Head Coach Matt LaFleur when asked before practice Thursday what he's seen from Watson this week.
The Bears also listed four questionable: running back D'Andre Swift (groin), tight end Cole Kmet (ankle/knee), defensive lineman Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (personal matter) and linebacker Tremaine Edmunds (groin).","GREEN BAY – The Packers have listed running back Josh Jacobs (knee/ankle) and receiver Christian Watson (chest/shoulder) among 10 players who are questionable for Saturday night's game against the Chicago Bears.

The other eight questionable are tackle Zach Tom (back/knee), safety Evan Williams (knee), receiver Dontayvion Wicks (ankle), running back Chris Brooks (chest), tackle/guard Darian Kinnard (neck), and defensive linemen Kingsley Enagbare (illness), Brenton Cox Jr. (groin) and Collin Oliver (hamstring).

Green Bay ruled out tight end Josh Whyle (concussion), running back MarShawn Lloyd (calf/hamstring), and guard John Williams (back).

Watson avoided a significant injury despite being transported to a local hospital in Denver to be examined for chest-related injuries after crashing hard to ground while laying out for a deep ball in the third quarter on Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Broncos.

The fourth-year wideout was cleared to travel with the team Sunday night and allowed to practice on a limited basis this week.

""Encouraging,"" said Head Coach Matt LaFleur when asked before practice Thursday what he's seen from Watson this week. ""Ultimately, it's going to come down to, obviously, medical decision about where he's at on Saturday.""

Jacobs and Tom rode bikes in lieu of practice Thursday, but LaFleur said the team plans to give both up until gametime.

Jacobs told reporters after Tuesday's walkthrough that he took another shot to his injured knee during the Broncos game, which he originally hurt last month against the New York Giants. He fought through the pain in part because Emanuel Wilson was battling an illness and Brooks suffered a chest injury in the game.

""I just know how much it meant, honestly,"" said Jacobs earlier this week. ""Then Chris (Brooks) got banged up a little bit, so I feel like I'd be doing him a disservice if I let him go out there when he can barely stand up straight. So for me, it was just talking to myself and not really wanting to put nobody else in a tough position.""

The Packers placed star defensive lineman Micah Parsons on season-ending injured reserve on Wednesday, but reinforcements could be coming as both Cox Jr. and Oliver were full participants in practice this week.

Cox (injured reserve) and Oliver (physically unable to perform) are Green Bay's reserve lists and need to be activated to the 53-man roster to play against the Bears.

A fifth-round pick in April's NFL Draft, Oliver has yet to play this season while Cox has been sidelined since the opener against Detroit. The third-year defensive end had four sacks during the final seven games of the 2024 season.

""Having him back past couple of practices just been great,"" said defensive lineman Rashan Gary earlier this week. ""Seeing him get off the ball, setting edges, things like that, him building his confidence, and just understanding that we need him to go.""

Receiver/kickoff returner Savion Williams (foot) did not receive a game status and will play Saturday. The rookie third-round pick missed the past three games.

In addition to Williams, Jordan Love (left shoulder), defensive end Lukas Van Ness (foot), and receivers Matthew Golden (wrist), and Jayden Reed (personal matter) don't carry a game status and will play Saturday.

Chicago ruled out receivers Rome Odunze (foot) and Luther Burden (ankle), and linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga (hamstring).

The Bears also listed four questionable: running back D'Andre Swift (groin), tight end Cole Kmet (ankle/knee), defensive lineman Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (personal matter) and linebacker Tremaine Edmunds (groin).

Both Kmet and Edmunds were full participants in practice Friday. Edmunds is currently designated to return from injured reserve and must be added to the active roster in order to play.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/no7ezkceihtfhvz71rss,N,,2025-12-18 18:03:54.039846

""He still has some vision limitations in his [right] eye,"" Steichen said. ""So we're going to get him back on the practice field, get him throwing, doing some scout-team reps. It's just something that's he's going to have to manage through the process.""

For his part, Richardson acknowledged some vision issues but said things are mostly back to normal.

""There's not really major limitations,"" he said. ""It's just a little different because of the impact in my eye, but most of it's really the same. I was still able to move around the same and do everything I needed to do. So that's not that bad.""

He added, ""It's improved a lot, actually. When it first happened, it was just a lot of swelling and everything. Couldn't see much. But after two or three weeks from the surgery, everything healed up nice.""

As for the starting quarterback for the time being, that remains Philip Rivers. The veteran quarterback came out of retirement at 44 last week, after five seasons away from the game, to fill in at quarterback in the aftermath of Daniel Jones' season-ending Achilles injury.

""Right now, Philip's our starting quarterback,"" Steichen said Thursday.

The Colts host the San Francisco 49ers on ""Monday Night Football"" to end Week 16.

The next steps for Richardson involve the Colts monitoring his progress in practice. Steichen said he would not be active for Monday's game.

For Richardson, the return to practice was a long time coming. He was initially prohibited from doing any strenuous physical activity after the injury because the bone needed time to heal.

""I need to be back on the field,"" Richardson said. ""I love playing football. I've been doing it since I was 2. And it's just something I love doing. I just love being here with my teammates. And originally, they told me I was going to have to wait until after the season to see how my eye healed up. And luckily, I got clear this month and I just thank God for it.

""I'm ready to practice.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1218%2Fr1591096_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 15:01:17.714013

Chase Brown (at MIA) — Opponents are 68-of-75 when throwing to RBs this season against MIA (90.7%, would be just the second +90% season since 2010, the 2023 Vikings also had that weakness). Two running backs have at least 4 games with 7+ catches. Christian McCaffrey (7 such games) and Chase Brown (four).

Tyler Allgeier (at ARZ) — The Cardinals are one of two teams allowing 4+ red zone trips per game (Bengals) and allow a league-high 2.6 goal-to-go trips per game. Of 43 RBs with 100+ carries, Allgeier is scoring once every 13.8 carries, the best rate in the NFL (Jahmyr Gibbs and Josh Jacobs are 2-3).

Bucky Irving (at CAR) — His 6 straight 15+ carry games are tied for the longest active streak (Javonte Williams). Last season, he had 20+ rushes, 110+ rush yards, and 30+ receiving yards in both games against the Panthers

Blake Corum — 30 carries for 280 yards and 4 TDs over the past three weeks. The explosion is nice, but how about the floor: he has gained yardage on all 30 of those rush attempts.

Jaxson Dart (vs. MIN) — MIN is pacing to lead the NFL in blitz rate for a third straight season, and they have five of the single highest blitz rate games this season. Since Week 8, Matthew Stafford leads the NFL in passer rating against the blitz (131.6). Drake Maye (122.3) and Jaxson Dart (117.1) is third. New York’s rookie is 22-of-35 for 286 yards, 3 TDs, and 0 INTs in those spots over that stretch.

Caleb Williams (vs GB) — Week 14 against the Packers: 25% complete when pressured and 69.6% when not. Remove Micah Parsons from the equation, and it’s easy to see the non-pressured pass count spike.

CJ Stroud (vs. LV) — The Raiders allow the 2nd fewest yards before carry to RBs this season: HOU may control this game, but that doesn’t mean that the run game is the reason why.

He walked around the pitch at full time with an ice pack around his left knee.
“It looks looks like a knee problem and Tino’s had issues with knee injuries before,” Howe told a post-match press conference.
Let’s wait and see.” Livramento spent over a month on the sidelines between October and November after suffering ligament damage to his left knee earlier this season.
Newcastle are already contending with a number of defensive injury absences, with Dan Burn, Sven Botman, Kieran Trippier and Emil Krafth all sidelined.","Eddie Howe said full-back Tino Livramento is a doubt to face Chelsea on Saturday after he was forced off with a knee injury during Newcastle United’s Carabao Cup quarter-final win against Fulham.

Livramento, 23, received medical attention on the pitch at St James’ Park on Wednesday before being replaced in the 76th minute. He walked around the pitch at full time with an ice pack around his left knee.

Howe described the defender’s need to be withdrawn as “worrying” as Newcastle contend with a number of defensive injuries but said he was unsure on the severity of the problem at this stage.

“It looks looks like a knee problem and Tino’s had issues with knee injuries before,” Howe told a post-match press conference. “So the fact he had to come off and he’s such an honest, dependable lad – that sends worrying signs, really, for his participation maybe in the Chelsea game. Let’s wait and see.”

Livramento spent over a month on the sidelines between October and November after suffering ligament damage to his left knee earlier this season. He was sidelined for nearly a year when he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, again in his left knee, in April 2022 while playing for Southampton.

Newcastle are already contending with a number of defensive injury absences, with Dan Burn, Sven Botman, Kieran Trippier and Emil Krafth all sidelined.

Lewis Hall also missed Wednesday’s win against Fulham due to a hamstring problem, with Livramento moving to left-back and midfielder Lewis Miley slotting in at right-back. Howe, however, said Hall is in contention to return to face Chelsea at the weekend.

“Lewis (Hall), we’re more positive on. He couldn’t play today. He felt some tightness in his hamstring, but he has a chance for Chelsea. We’ve got a number of injuries to the same position, which is never good.”

Asked about the possibility of recalling left-back Matt Targett from his season-long loan spell at Middlesbrough in January as a solution to the extensive defensive injury list, Howe replied: “We’ll make that decision closer to the date where we have to, but certainly at the moment… I don’t have many more rabbits to pull out of the hat to be honest, so we’re in dangerous territory, so let’s see.”

Newcastle were 2-1 winners over Fulham thanks to Miley’s stoppage-time goal to secure their place in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, where they will play Manchester City.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/17181758/GettyImages-2251799612-scaled-e1766013498338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-18 14:02:11.486030
