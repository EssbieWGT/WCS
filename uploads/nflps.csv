Before the injury, Landry had a 2.7% sack rate and pressured opposing quarterbacks on 10.7% of his pass rushes.
Since the injury, Landry has been registering a sack on 1.8% of his rushes with a 7.3% pressure rate.
With a trio of starters returning to the lineup, the Patriots defense should improve.
Vrabel's goals were to win the AFC East, host home playoff games, and compete for championships.","The Patriots are preparing to host their first home playoff game in six seasons when they welcome the Chargers to Gillette Stadium, and New England's roster is in relatively good shape for Sunday night.

On Friday, New England ruled out NT Khyiris Tonga (foot) and listed WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) OLB Harold Landry III (knee), and OT Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) as questionable for Sunday night's Wild Card matchup. Although being down their run-stuffing nose tackle is notable, Tonga is the lone Patriot on the active roster who doesn't have a chance to play on Sunday night. Given that we're heading into the 19th week of the season, that's encouraging.

​That said, Tonga's absence will be felt on both sides of the ball, as it has been since he suffered his foot injury in a Week 16 win over the Ravens. The big nose tackle hasn't played since exiting the win in Baltimore after having significant roles on the interior defensive line and as a short-yardage blocker in jumbo packages offensively. Without Tonga in recent weeks, the Patriots have relied on defensive tackles Christian Barmore, Cory Durden, Eric Gregory, and practice-squad elevations Jeremiah Pharms Jr. and Leonard Taylor III, while standout DT Milton Williams returned from injured reserve in Week 18.

Williams played 26 snaps in his first game action since suffering a high-ankle sprain in a Week 11 win over the Jets. In those 26 plays, Williams logged a tackle for loss against the run and one quarterback pressure, while helping free up Barmore for a 1-on-1 rush on a second-quarter sack. Williams' return gave the Patriots defense a huge boost, as he is an impact player who can shed blocks and make plays in the backfield.

On Sunday night, the hope is that the defense will get a similar bump from the returns of captains Robert Spillane and Harold Landry III. Spillane's last snaps came before New England's bye week in a Week 13 win over the Giants. Since then, the starting linebacker has been sidelined due to an ankle injury. Spillane won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's night's game, meaning he is expected to play. Earlier this week, Spillane spoke about his potential return, adding that returning for the playoffs was his goal.

""Yes sir,"" Spillane replied when asked if he'll be ready to play on Sunday night. ""It was always a goal to be ready for Week 1 of the playoffs. It means everything to be out there. Obviously, you want to be a factor in these games. So that's the major goal this week: get healthy, be a good teammate, do whatever I can to be out there Sunday.""

During his multi-week absence, LB Jack Gibbens stepped into Spillane's role as the Patriots starting MIKE linebacker. Gibbens made the most of the opportunity, flashing impressive instincts in coverage while also logging five run stuffs. However, Spillane still leads the Patriots with 18 run stuffs despite playing in only 13 games. The captain is by far the team's best run-stopping linebacker and is the primary signal-caller on the field.

Along those same lines, the team hopes a few weeks of rest will do edge rusher Harold Landry III some good, after the captain sat out the final two games of the regular season. Landry has been managing a knee injury that dates back to a scare in a Week 6 win over the Saints. After playing through the injury for several weeks, the Patriots decided to shut Landry down after clinching a playoff berth. Before the injury, Landry had a 2.7% sack rate and pressured opposing quarterbacks on 10.7% of his pass rushes. Since the injury, Landry has been registering a sack on 1.8% of his rushes with a 7.3% pressure rate. If the rest does wonders for Landry, his playoff performance could be closer to the player he was to start the season.

With a trio of starters returning to the lineup, the Patriots defense should improve. They already got impact plays from Williams in his return, and now Landry and Spillane are expected to return. In particular, the hope is that the run defense returns to form. In the first 10 weeks, New England's defense was fourth in rush EPA allowed. Without some of their top defenders down the stretch, the Patriots defense finished their last six games ranked 21st in rush EPA. Hopefully, getting the defense back to mostly full strength allows New England to exploit a weakness in the Chargers along their offensive line.

Offensively, WR Kayshon Boutte popped up on the injury report with a hamstring injury this week. After practicing in full on Wednesday, Boutte was limited in the last two sessions and is officially questionable. The Patriots are already thin at wide receiver without veteran Mack Hollins, who is on injured reserve. New England's fully healthy wideouts are Stefon Diggs, Kyle Williams, DeMario Douglas, and Efton Chism III. Hopefully, Boutte, who has been a productive outside deep threat, will be able to suit up on Sunday night, which seems to be the plan barring anything unforeseen.

The Patriots also have some unknowns along the offensive line heading into Sunday night due to injury and illness. During the week, starting RT Morgan Moses and C Garrett Bradbury both missed practices due to illness. The expectation is that both will play, but New England is still unsure about the status of third tackle Thayer Munford Jr., who missed Thursday's practice due to his knee injury.

Munford Jr., who has played the jumbo tight end role for the Patriots over the last several weeks. In their last four games, New England has played 56 snaps with six offensive linemen on the field, third-most in the NFL, and Munford has been the primary extra offensive lineman. In those six O-Line packages, the Patriots are averaging 8.3 yards per play with 11 explosive plays, so one would expect that OC Josh McDaniels would like to have the jumbo package at his disposal in the postseason.

If he can't go, backup tackle Vederian Lowe, who has also been battling an illness, could be the sixth offensive lineman this week. New England could also turn to top backup Ben Brown in that role. Either way, the jumbo tight end has been an important role in the Patriots offense over the last month, so Munford being questionable to play isn't an insignificant injury.

At left guard, head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed that rookie Jared Wilson will start on Sunday night. On Friday, Wilson shed his red non-contact jersey at practice, indicating that Wilson cleared concussion protocol. Wilson has started all 13 games he's been healthy in this season and Vrabel told reporters on Friday that the rookie will get the start now that he has cleared concussion protocol after some discussion about sticking with Brown.

As for Los Angeles, the big injury question for the Chargers is the status of rookie RB Omarion Hampton (ankle). Hampton returned to practice in a limited capacity on Friday and is officially questionable for Sunday night due to his ankle injury. The first-round rookie is Los Angeles's lead-back when healthy, but has battled injuries in his first season. Hampton told reporters in Los Angeles that he plans to play on Sunday, but the Chargers will likely lean on RB Kimani Vidal if the talented rookie is out.

Along with hosting their first home playoff game since 2019, New England is aiming to check another box in Mike Vrabel's to-do list when he took over as head coach in January. Vrabel's goals were to win the AFC East, host home playoff games, and compete for championships. In his first season as head coach, the Patriots won the division and will host a home playoff game, so next up on the checklist is winning playoff games, adding extra validity to the Patriots terrific 14-3 regular season.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/yfitxzdrilyeir1kdw3a,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:16.076249

Here we are, with the Pittsburgh Steelers being the first team to challenge that assertion.

Houston makes its third consecutive trip to the postseason and is pursuing its third straight win in the wild-card round. Pittsburgh will try to avoid losing a wild-card playoff game for the third year in a row, looking to Aaron Rodgers to lift the Steelers to the divisional round for the first time since the 2017 season. Rodgers last played in the postseason in 2022, finishing his second-to-last season with the Green Bay Packers.

Previous meeting this season

These two teams did not face each other during the regular season. The last time Houston played Pittsburgh was during the 2023 season (unless you count the 2024 preseason), DeMeco Ryans’ first as the Texans’ head coach. Kenny Pickett was the Steelers’ quarterback and Najee Harris started at running back then.

C.J. Stroud threw for 308 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Nico Collins tallied 7 receptions for 168 yards and two scores in Houston’s 30-6 rout at home.

The Steelers have had a clean injury report throughout the week, with only Jaylen Warren missing practice time due to illness. However, Pittsburgh apparently believes the team’s leading rusher will recover in time for Monday night’s kickoff.

The Texans had two starters miss practice this week, cornerback Kamari Lassiter and left guard Tytus Howard. Lassiter tied for the team lead with four interceptions and was third with 91 tackles, while Howard started 16 games this season.

The head coaches

Strangely, Ryans might be the more secure coach in this matchup. The Texans are ascendant in his third season as he’s built the best defense in the NFL. Losing in the wild-card round might take some shine off that status, but Houston is clearly building a contender. Pittsburgh seemingly avoided a difficult decision by winning its regular-season finale to clinch the AFC North and a playoff berth. Yet if the Steelers lose badly to Houston, Tomlin and the team may mutually decide that it’s time for a change.

Key player for the Steelers

Pittsburgh needed a reliable starting quarterback, which is what led the team to sign Rodgers. But making it to the playoffs hasn’t been the issue. The Steelers qualified for the postseason in five of the past six seasons. With Rodgers, the hope was that he had one more vintage season left to advance further in the playoffs. But he threw for five total touchdowns while averaging 247 passing yards in the Steelers’ final five games. Is he capable of more against a defense that allowed 277 yards per game and has been unbeatable in its past nine games?

Key player for the Texans

Befitting their status as the NFL’s top defense, the Texans have standouts among their front seven and secondary. As mentioned above, four players had four interceptions. Defensive end Danielle Hunter led the team with 15 sacks. Yet the most disruptive player is on the opposite end of the line from Hunter, edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. The third-year pro has provided the stellar production Houston anticipated after making him the No. 3 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. The Steelers are surely aware that Anderson has 20 tackles for loss and 23 quarterback hits this season. Rodgers could see a lot of him on Monday night.

Prediction

Pittsburgh’s reward for winning the AFC North and making the playoffs is meeting the team nobody supposedly wanted to play. (Whether the Texans have the NFL’s most ferocious defense is a discussion that should include the Denver Broncos.) Additionally, the Steelers backed into the postseason, advancing thanks to Ravens kicker Tyler Loop shanking a 44-yard field-goal attempt wide right as time expired.

Houston’s defense may also be acclaimed because it compensates for a subpar offense. The Texans ranked No. 18 in total offense and averaged 24 points per game. Quarterback C.J. Stroud threw for 200 yards or fewer in three of his past five games. That might give the Steelers a chance. But Houston’s strength is too much to overcome.

Stafford led the NFL with a career-high 46 touchdown passes and 4,707 passing yards this season.

The 37-year-old quarterback overcame an offseason back injury and potential trade talks.

WOODLAND HILLS, CA. – Los Angeles Rams guard Steve Avila still finds it surreal that he’s teammates with Matthew Stafford.

“There are times like I'm like, ‘Wow, that's Matthew Stafford.' Like, I was 9 years old when he got drafted,” Avila told USA TODAY Sports. “It is awesome. I mean, especially just with the season that he's had, and just being able to be a part of that is just amazing.”

Avila’s elementary school recollection of Stafford might make the 37-year-old feel old, but the quarterback’s performed this year like an aging fine red wine.

Stafford led the NFL and broke a franchise record with a career-high 46 touchdown passes to just eight interceptions. Those 46 touchdowns are the second-most thrown in a single season by an NFL quarterback age 37 or older. Additionally, he became the third player in NFL history with at least 45 touchdown passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season, according to NFL Research. His 4,707 passing yards also topped the league.

Stafford threw four touchdown passes in Week 18 alone and became third player in NFL history with multiple touchdown passes in 15 games in a season. He earned his fourth career player of the week honor for his performance in the team’s season finale.

'He is the MVP'

The Rams quarterback’s statistics indicate he’s defying Father Time, and he might’ve just capped off the best regular season of his career.

Stafford is the frontrunner to win MVP, courtesy of BetMGM as of Jan. 4. For all his plaudits, the Super Bowl 56 champion and three-time Pro Bowler has never won the award.

Rams players believe the award should be added this year to Stafford's already impressive resume.

“He is the MVP. There's no ifs ands or buts about it,” Rams running back Blake Corum told USA TODAY Sports. “The season he’s had is ridiculous. The career he's had is just tremendous.”

MVP voting for the regular season concluded on Monday. The recipient of the award won’t be revealed until the NFL Honors ceremony on Feb. 5.

“I hope everybody has their head screwed on right and knows exactly that he's the most valuable person in the league,” Avila said.

Stafford had a humble response when asked by USA TODAY Sports about his MVP candidacy and diverted the credit to the team.

“As far as being a candidate, I just wanted to play as good as I possibly can this year like I do every season,” Stafford said. “Obviously, I have great football players around me and coaches around me that give myself and our offense a chance and opportunity to succeed. We were able to do that.”

Stafford: 'I didn't know if I would get there'

What makes Stafford’s stellar year even more impressive is what he’s overcome this season – a campaign that almost didn’t happen.

The Rams granted Stafford’s agent permission to speak to other teams about a trade last February, before the sides agreed to a contract restructure later that month. But a subsequent aggravated disk in his back would cause Stafford to miss most of training camp.

“There were some lean moments. It was touch and go there for a little bit,” Stafford recalled. “A lot of treatments and things that I did to try and help myself get to this point. I didn't know if I would get there but I went out there and it was wait and see, let's see what happens. Luckily it turned out pretty good.”

Pretty good is an understatement. Stafford started all 17 regular-season games, led the NFL in passing yards and touchdowns and is an odds-on favorite to win MVP.

Stafford’s now about to embark on another playoff journey in his fifth season as the Rams QB. Following a 2021 blockbuster trade with the Detroit Lions, Stafford led the Rams to a Super Bowl title his first season in Los Angeles. Stafford and the Rams have their sights set on another Lombardi Trophy, and maybe some additional hardware for the trophy case along the way.

“What a guy that you just watch that is totally present. He's enjoying the moment and I think that's when we're at our best. I think this team has taken on a lot of the great traits, the toughness mentally and physically, and just the overall enjoyment for the chance to go compete, but also the ability to celebrate your teammates. He's elevated everybody that he's around, but it's been really impressive,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “I wouldn't say I'm surprised though. This has been consistent for him over the five years that we've been together. I’m just grateful to be able to have the opportunity to be partnered up with him.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/08/USAT/88077152007-usatsi-27933520.jpg?crop=4193,2359,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-09 16:01:02.110120

Here are the final game statuses for the week:

Questionable: RT Lane Johnson (foot), OL Brett Toth (concussion), OLB Azeez Ojulari (hamstring)

As the Eagles held their final practice Friday ahead of hosting the 49ers in the wild-card round on Sunday, all 53 players on their active roster were practicing.

The two players who were not practicing on Thursday — LG Landon Dickerson (rest) and OL Brett Toth (concussion) — returned, which means all 53 players were there.

It also means that the Eagles should have 21 of 22 starters available against the 49ers on Sunday, assuming Johnson (foot) makes his return. While Johnson is officially listed as questionable, things during the week have seemed to be trending toward a return.

Meanwhile, the 49ers have a lengthy injury report heading into this game:

Johnson (foot) was practicing again on Friday for the third straight day after missing the last seven weeks with a Lisfranc sprain he suffered on Nov. 16 against the Lions. Johnson has been limited the first two days of the week. In addition to Johnson, the other three players who were limited on Thursday — DT Jalen Carter (hip), TE Dallas Goedert (knee) and TE Grant Calcaterra (ankle) — were all practicing again too and none of them have game statuses.

The only starter who won't be available for the playoffs is rookie safety Drew Mukuba, who fractured his ankle in late November and needed surgery.

The Eagles’ health going into the playoffs, especially against a banged-up 49ers team, should not go unnoticed. They had 22 of 22 starters available for Super Bowl LVII and had 21 of 22 available for Super Bowl LIX last year. The Eagles, as an organization, are proud about how healthy they have been in recent seasons.

“There's two things that need to happen,” head coach Nick Sirianni said earlier this week. “You've got to have your players available, and you do different things to make sure that happens throughout the year, but it is so important that you continue to get better as the season goes on. I think our guys have a great balance and we do a good job of balancing that intensity at practice. There's no [lack] of intensity at practice; When we're out there, we're ripping it, but I think our guys know how to practice, they know how to practice efficiently. We've had a tendency of getting better while also having guys healthy. We continue to tweak the process of what we do. Great people in this building to help us make decisions. There's a lot that goes into that.

“Then you've got guys that are truly committed to this game because they love this game and they want to be the best versions [of] themselves they possibly can be. You could have all the resources in the world [and] if the guys aren't using them, it's for nothing. But our guys do such a good job of using the resources they have, taking care of themselves, and I think we have a pretty good process. As an organization, I think we take a lot of pride in that.”",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2023/05/johnson_l_GettyImages-1237390053.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:27.134051

The Chargers have a very balanced passing attack, with four receivers between 641 and 741 pass yards this season.
The Chargers and Patriots each rank in the top half of the league of rushing yards and yards per carry, but they've taken different routes to get there.
New England has leaned more on the run game down the stretch, with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson filling big roles.
Like the Chargers, the Patriots' run blocking has been spotty at times, but the return of Campbell last week boosted the offensive line.","Drake Maye turned in an MVP-caliber season in Year 2, meshing well with new offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, a revamped offensive line and a new cast of receivers. Maye's downfield touch and accuracy, along with his scrambling ability, has made New England's offense a bear to defend, racking up more than 300 yards in every game and scoring 23 or more points in their past 14 games. It's also impressive how Maye has avoided turnovers, with only 11 on the season -- three games with two turnovers, five games with one and nine with zero giveaways. Stefon Diggs is the go-to guy in key situations, and they're a bit thin at wide receiver with Mack Hollins out. But Maye has good options at tight end with Hunter Henry and Austin Hooper, and they've used RBs Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson more as pass catchers recently. Having left tackle Will Campbell back in Week 18 also appeared to upgrade the offensive line. The Chargers are mostly excellent defensively, with more INTs (19) than pass TDs allowed (16) in 2025. Coordinator Jesse Minter operates a disciplined, zone-heavy and opportunistic unit. He will try to confuse Maye by disguising coverage pre- and post-snap, and Los Angeles has a pass rush that can get home, led by Tuli Tuipulotu, Khalil Mack and Odafe Oweh -- all rested and ready to pursue. Safety Derwin James is an X-factor in the middle of the Chargers defense whom the Patriots must respect, although tight ends have done some damage against them late in the season.

Justin Herbert has been a miracle worker at times for the Chargers, finding ways to thrive in spite of injury and poor protection up front. He sat out Week 18, protecting his broken left hand, and now the question once again is how good his protection will be against New England. Jamaree Salyer, the team's third left tackle this season, sat out the past two games with a hamstring injury, though he's luckily off the injury report. The Patriots will need a disciplined rush; Herbert has been terrific outside the pocket as a thrower and scrambler, able to get out of trouble and sting defenses, but he also has been sacked three or more times in 10 of his 16 starts. The Patriots' sack percentage (6.64%, 20th) doesn't tell the whole story, as their pressure rate (35.9%, per Next Gen Stats) ranks 10th, and it's possible they get Harold Landry (knee; questionable) back. New England also has generally kept the big plays under wraps this season, allowing only 42 passes of 20-plus yards (tied for seventh-best) and only three plays of 40-plus (tied for second). The Chargers have a very balanced passing attack, with four receivers between 641 and 741 pass yards this season. Keep an eye on rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden II, who has shaky hands but explosive ability, especially against a New England defense that has struggled to contain good receivers at the position. The Patriots will give up some catches with their zone-heavy scheme, but between limiting explosive pass plays and having eyes on mobile quarterbacks, reducing their scramble potential, the Chargers might have to work their way up and down the field more gradually.

The Chargers and Patriots each rank in the top half of the league of rushing yards and yards per carry, but they've taken different routes to get there. The Chargers hope to have Omarion Hampton back from injury -- the running back is questionable due to an ankle injury but said he expected to play -- and Kimani Vidal has added a layer of explosiveness to the backfield. However, the blocking hasn't always allowed them to thrive consistently. Justin Herbert's scrambling has helped to give those rushing totals a cosmetic boost at times, too. The Patriots' run defense looks good on the stat sheet, allowing only 101.7 yards per game (sixth), but they've been carved up a bit late in the season by the likes of Breece Hall, Derrick Henry and James Cook. The return of defensive tackle Milton Williams appeared to help the run defense last week, and the Patriots are set to get linebacker Robert Spillane (foot) back from injury (though defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga will miss). New England has leaned more on the run game down the stretch, with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson filling big roles. Stevenson has been on a heater of late, averaging 9.6 yards per carry and scoring six TDs in his past four games, and Henderson is the big-play dynamo with four TDs of 50-plus yards this season. Like the Chargers, the Patriots' run blocking has been spotty at times, but the return of Campbell last week boosted the offensive line. The Chargers' run defense has been very good this season, with Saquon Barkley the last one to really hurt them back in Week 14, but the Patriots likely will be patient with the run game and keep pounding away, especially if they gain an early lead.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/snucdj6enzp0op5heg9v,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:31.186880

Can Robert Saleh's zombie crew keep the Eagles offense spiraling, or will Hurts & Co. get back on track to jumpstart their postseason run?","Sunday afternoon's bout at Lincoln Financial Field will feature two seasoned playoff opponents. Either the Eagles or 49ers have represented the NFC in the Super Bowl in each of the last three seasons (Eagles in 2024 and 2022; Niners in 2023).

The wild-card bout marks the playoff rematch of the 2022 NFC Championship Game. Hopefully, Brock Purdy can stay healthy for more than one series this time. On that day, the Niners QB tore his UCL on the first drive of the game, and the Eagles steamrolled to a 31-7 win. That game feels eons ago.

Sunday, both Philly and San Francisco enter with a host of questions.

Kyle Shanahan's club is a MASH unit, particularly on defense, after losing stars Nick Bosa, Fred Warner and many others, sapping the unit of its potency. Offensively, Trent Williams is dealing with a hamstring injury, and receiver Ricky Pearsall has been dealing with a PCL issue for the bulk of the season.

The Eagles have injury concerns of their own, most significantly along the offensive line, but the main question for the reigning Super Bowl champs is whether Nick Sirianni's offense can finally hit a groove heading into the postseason tournament after frustrating inconsistencies have plagued the unit all campaign. Does the offense have enough to beat good teams? The Eagles went 2-3 and averaged 19.4 points per game against teams with a .600+ win percentage in 2025. Against teams under .600, they went 9-3 and averaged 23.5 PPG.

The Eagles are 5-0 at home in the playoffs under Sirianni, 0-2 on the road and 1-1 in Super Bowls (neutral site). The 49ers have reached the NFC Championship Game in each season they have made the playoffs under Shanahan, and San Francisco is 6-0 in Wild Card/Divisional Round games since 2019.

1) Can the Eagles offense take advantage of a banged-up 49ers D?

The Eagles have scored 22.3 points per game in 2025 (19th in the NFL and the fewest in the Nick Sirianni era) and averaged 311.2 total yards per game (24th in the league and the third-fewest of any playoff team).

Given the names on the Eagles offense, the numbers are mind-numbing. An offense with Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith shouldn't be so easily slowed. Offensive line issues have been a major factor in the spiral, as the Eagles fell from the top unit last season. With Lane Johnson set to return and others getting rest last week, the hope is that Philly's blocking will improve during the playoff run.

The unimaginative offense run by Kevin Patullo has earned the ire of Philly fans. It's been particularly predictable in the passing attack, which averaged 194.3 pass yards per game, good for 23rd in the NFL and the second-fewest among playoff teams (Carolina, 179.3).

Inefficiencies on early downs and predictable passing routes led the Eagles offense to a league-high 28.1% three-and-out rate in 2025.

Hurts hasn't been the quarterback who steamrolled through the playoffs last year, with a trove of missed passes peppering his season. However, his ability to protect the football has been key to the Eagles' success in close games. Philly is 11-2 when Hurts doesn't have an interception this season (0-3 in games with one or more).

Fortunately for the Eagles, they'll face a Niners defense that struggles to get after the quarterback, ranking last in the NFL with 20 sacks and creating just six interceptions, tied for the second-fewest. San Francisco is the first team to make the playoffs in a season with 20 or fewer sacks and fewer than 10 INTs.

The 49ers' inability to disrupt the passer has left their secondary vulnerable. Since Week 5, San Francisco has allowed 358.6 yards per game, seventh-most in the NFL, and 253.2 passing yards per game, third-most. In the first four weeks of the season, the Niners allowed 280.5 yards per game and 165 pass yards per tilt.

Can Robert Saleh's zombie crew keep the Eagles offense spiraling, or will Hurts & Co. get back on track to jumpstart their postseason run?

2) High-powered 49ers offense vs. Eagles' menacing D

Upon Brock Purdy's return in Week 11, the Niners offense was a buzzsaw, averaging 35.7 points per game from Weeks 11-17, before getting waylaid by the top-seeded Seahawks in Week 18 sans all-world left tackle Trent Williams. Purdy ranks third in total TDs (19) and passer rating (105.6) since his return.

With the starter under center, the Niners offense is a blitzkrieg, able to dice up defenses with play-action over the middle and on intermediate routes. Using a diverse set of playmakers, from Christian McCaffrey out of the backfield to Jauan Jennings, Kendrick Bourne and Ricky Pearsall (when healthy), San Francisco's passing attack is lethal when it gets rolling. The 49ers went 23 consecutive drives without punting at one point down the stretch.

The key matchup Sunday will be tight end George Kittle against a stingy Eagles D. Purdy has a 140.6 passer rating when targeting the TE this season, tops of any duo with at least 40 connections. Seemingly, whenever Purdy gets into trouble or needs a big play, he looks for Kittle. That combination will be tested Sunday against an Eagles defense that has allowed the lowest passer rating on targets to tight ends this season (72.2).

Vic Fangio's defense has played at a championship level this season and has been particularly menacing since acquiring Jaelan Phillips at the trade deadline. Since Week 10, the Eagles have allowed 15.6 points per game, the fewest in the NFL.

It's a D with little weakness. Phillips and Jalen Carter can disrupt the passer, Zack Baun patrols the middle and corners Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are smothering. Mitchell has allowed a 41.7 completion percentage in coverage in 2025, tied for first in the NFL. DeJean, meanwhile, allowed just a 48.8 completion percentage defending the slot, the lowest in the league with a minimum of 30 slot targets. Philly has generated at least one takeaway in nine straight games and allowed a single passing TD over the past four tilts.

If there is one area to quibble with Fangio's unit, it's that the defense has been run on at times this season, allowing 124.4 rush yards per game, 22nd in the NFL. Will a Niners run game that hasn't been very efficient this season, ranking 24th with 106.9 yards per contest, be able to exploit that tender spot in an otherwise impenetrable dragon?

3) Which running back will blast off?

Saturday will mark the fourth playoff matchup all time between the previous two AP Offensive Player of the Year winners: Saquon Barkley won in 2024, Christian McCaffrey in 2023.

McCaffrey has been the 49ers' workhorse, leading the NFL with 413 touches this season, 44 more than any other player (Jonathan Taylor, 369). Returning from last season's injury, McCaffrey generated 1,202 rushing yards on 311 totes. The concern for the Niners' rushing attack has been consistency. McCaffrey generated just 3.9 yards per carry, the lowest in his career since his rookie campaign (3.7). The splash runs have been few and far between, with CMC earning just 11 rushes of 15-plus yards and three over 20 yards.

The best all-purpose weapon in football is a matchup nightmare. His 924 receiving yards on 102 catches gave McCaffrey 2,126 scrimmage yards this season, second in the NFL (Bijan Robinson, 2,298). CMC generated 12 games with 100-plus scrimmage yards, tied for the most in the NFL (James Cook), and 10 games with 100-plus scrimmage yards and at least one touchdown (most in the NFL). Philly allowed 639 receiving yards to running backs, seventh-most in the NFL, so expect Brock Purdy to look for CMC often on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Barkley, coming off a 2,005-yard 2024 season, didn't earn a Pro Bowl nod as the Eagles offense was stuck in the mud. The dynamo generated 1,140 rushing yards on 280 carries (4.1 YPC) with seven touchdowns. The big difference this season is that the massive runs have been absent from the offense. In 2024, Barkley earned 17 rushes of 20-plus yards and a whopping seven of 40-plus. In 2025, he had just four rushes of 20-plus yards and three going 40 or more yards. Part of the lack of explosives has been play-calling, and another is blocking concerns, with linemen not getting to the second level as regularly as they were a year ago.

Like many backs who lead the league in carries, as Barkley did a year ago with 345, things started slowly. From Weeks 1-13, the RB averaged 61.7 rushing yards per game, 3.7 yards per carry on 16.5 totes per tilt. However, he's found a groove in recent weeks. Over his past four games, Barkley has averaged 100.0 yards on 20.5 carries per game for a 4.9 yards per carry average. With Lane Johnson and others along the Eagles' line hopefully healthier, we could see a return of 2024 Barkley in the 2025 playoffs.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/rvz5r2omqikwe8t5jsjw,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:34.460678

The NFC North rivals split the season series, and the tape really tells a story. So, let's take a deeper look at both teams, using the previous games to place our top bets.

Matt Bowen breaks it down and offers his take, and Liz Loza, Pamela Maldonado, Eric Moody, Ben Solak and Seth Walder share their best bets, analysis and DFS plays to help you get in on the action.

Note: Odds provided by DraftKings Sportsbookand subject to change.

When the Packers have the ball

Bowen: I expect the Packers to be methodical in their approach, using the running game and taking the throws that are available when Jordan Love sees zone coverage. However, when the Bears play their man schemes, the Packers can cash in. In the Week 14 game, Love completed 9 of 13 passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns versus man coverage.

Edge: Packers.

Best bet: Christian Watson can create numbers on out routes and quicks, but we want to see the big throws that get him loose on deep over routes and posts. Watson has 80 or more yards receiving in three of his last five games, with 89 yards (on just four catches) versus Chicago in Week 14. Take Watson over 54.5 yards receiving (-113).

When the Bears have the ball

Bowen: Bears coach Ben Johnson wants to run the ball and deliver body punches in the second half of football games. We've seen it. But that also sets up quarterback Caleb Williams on play-action throws out of multiple-tight-end sets, and this Green Bay pass rush has declined sinceMicah Parsons'knee injury.

Edge:Bears.

Best bet: Colston Loveland has emerged as a priority target for Williams, catching at least six passes in back-to-back games. Plus, given the zone-heavy tendencies of the Packers defense, Loveland can operate as an underneath outlet and work the seams. I'm going Loveland over 4.5 receptions (+105).

Staff picks, best bets and props

Bears +1.5 (-112)

Maldonado:Chicago controls pace with the run game, forces turnovers at the highest rate in the league and closes games late. Green Bay moves the ball but struggles to finish drives, especially under pressure. The Bears' fourth-quarter edge makes them the side to take.

Caleb Williams 34+ pass attempts (+142)

Moody: Williams has averaged 34.5 pass attempts per game over his last 10 contests and recorded at least 34 attempts in both meetings against the Packers earlier this season. With these teams familiar with one another, this matchup has the potential to turn into a high-scoring game, especially with Green Bay dealing with multiple defensive injuries. The Bears will look to exploit this.

Williams UNDER 31.5 pass attempts (-112)

Solak: The Bears have had to dig their way out of two multi-score holes against Green Bay this season, and, accordingly, those two games have demanded 35 and 34 pass attempts from Williams. If this game, with a spread of only 1.5 remains a closer contest that allows Chicago to play their preferred style of offense, Williams won't need to drop back nearly as much. And with his receiver room returning to full health, more completions will become big gains, leading to fewer attempts overall.

Williams OVER 21.5 rushing yards (-112)

Loza:Williams averages 4.5 carries (QB16) and nearly 23 rushing yards per contest (QB8). He ripped off 30 rushing yards when he last faced a Parsons-less Packers defense in Week 16 (he had only 15 rushing yards at Green Bay, with Parsons on the field, in Week 14). Green Bay's defense has allowed an average of 32 rushing yards per game since Parsons was injured in Week 15. Williams should find some scrambling room and flirt with at least 25 rushing yards Saturday.

Montez Sweat UNDER 0.25 sacks (-140)

Walder: Sweat's 4.8% pass rush win rate ranks 50th out of 52 qualifying edge rushers. That's probably underselling his ability a little bit because it might not capture some of his pocket-pushing ability, but still, there's a reason why the Bears have struggled with their pass rush all year. But it gets worse. Jordan Love has just a 4.3% sack rate this season, seventh-lowest among quarterbacks. And while I'm making this bet either way, if Zach Tom is active, this bet becomes even more attractive. Tom, who Sweat figures to align opposite most often, ranks sixth in pass block win rate among tackles. My model prices this under at -233.

Daily fantasy tips for DraftKings Captain Showdown

Loza's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): D'Andre Swift ($13,800). The Bears recorded the fifth-most rushes over the regular season. Ben Johnson figures to stick to that script versus a banged-up Packers defense. Despite Kyle Monangai's emergence, Swift has remained the Chicago's RB1, averaging 15.5 touches per game and 13 fantasy points per contest from Weeks 10-18.

Also in my lineup: Colston Loveland ($6,400). The rookie has emerged over the back half of the regular season, drawing at least five looks in every game since Week 12. He also leads the team in red zone opportunities (13). Chicago's receiving corps can be tricky to predict, but Loveland's robust number of high-value targets make him a solid ceiling pick.

Maldonado's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): Caleb Williams ($15,900) has rushing upside with scramble ability. Even when his throwing accuracy wavers early, volume and four-quarter aggression create ceiling outcomes. His legs matter more than efficiency.

Also in my lineup: DJ Moore ($8,400)is Williams' first read in big spots. When pressure hits, targets funnel his way. Moore's role spikes late in the game, giving him a reliable floor with shots at scores.

Moody's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points):Kyle Monangai ($4,200) is a nice value option and comes at a lower cost than Swift. Monangai has put together an impressive rookie season, and while his usage has been inconsistent, Monangai is an explosive runner. The Packers' defensive front has struggled late in the regular season, and Monangai could find success running behind a Bears offensive line that finished fifth in run-block win rate.

Also in my lineup:Luther Burden III ($6,600) closed the regular season on a strong note, averaging 5.4 targets per game over his last seven games. He also flashed significant upside, highlighted by a 30.8-point performance in Week 17 against the 49ers. Whether or not Rome Odunze plays, Burden profiles as an excellent DFS value at this price.'

Solak's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): Josh Jacobs ($14,400). Expect ownership to come in low on Jacobs, who has been quiet for the last month as he's dealt with nagging injury. But he's off the injury report this week for the first time in over a month, and the Packers will look to run the football and shorten the game against a Bears offense that has struggled to consistently put up points against them in the first half. Should be a heavy volume day for a player most of the field passes on.

Also in my lineup: Colston Loveland ($6,400). Despite leading the Bears in target share over the back half of the season, Loveland is priced below all three of the Bears' starting receivers in showdown. I think the return of Rome Odunze and emergence of Luther Burden III will lead to more distributed production among the wideouts, while Loveland's role as a reliable stick-mover with red zone utility will go untouched. He'll be heavily owned, but rightfully so.

Walder's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): Jordan Love ($15,600). I think this is going to be a high-scoring, back-and-forth battle where the quarterbacks are going to put up big numbers. The reason? Pass protection. Both of these team rank in the top six in pass block win rate, the Bears rank 31st in pass rush win rate and the Packers are even worse than that if we only look at their pass rushing snaps without Micah Parsons on the field. Love, and his stats, will be the beneficiary.",https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2026/0108/r1598211_1296x729_16-9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-09 16:01:21.427872

For Purdy, Jones, Adrian Martinez and Kurtis Rourke, a favorite pastime is kicking around various conspiracy theories with Lombardi serving as de facto traffic cop.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- For six weeks from early October to mid-November, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy wasn't sure how his injured right big toe would feel when he woke up most mornings.

As the Niners began preparing for Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals, Purdy was finally ready to return. The only potential complication? Backup Mac Jones had not only kept the Niners afloat but thrived in Purdy's stead, leading the team to five wins in eight starts and leaving outside observers wondering whether he should continue starting.

Inside the 49ers' quarterback room, there was no such consternation. The job belonged to Purdy and, as long as he was healthy enough to play near the standard he'd set on his way to landing a five-year, $265 million contract in May, he would reclaim the role.

There was no need for emergency meetings or big declarations from coach Kyle Shanahan, quarterbacks coach Mick Lombardi or anyone else in the organization.

Early in the week, Purdy simply told Jones he was back. Jones responded by welcoming him back and launching into things he'd seen from Arizona's defense in the Week 3 game he started in Purdy's place.

""For me to be able to see that and feel that in a real way, I'll always be appreciative of that,"" Purdy told ESPN. ""Sometimes in this business you can make it weird. But he did not.""

That small moment set the 49ers on a course for big things as they finished 12-5, earned the NFC's No. 6 seed and now will face the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday (4:30 p.m. ET, Fox) in the wild-card round. None of it would have been possible without Jones and Purdy teaming up to form the league's best one-two quarterback tandem.

According to ESPN Research, the Niners are the first team to make the playoffs after having multiple quarterbacks start at least eight games each since the NFL expanded to eight divisions in 2002.

Buoyed by Shanahan's quarterback-friendly system and the fun-loving environment of the QB room and the locker room overall, Jones has resuscitated his career. Save for a rough Week 18 outing against Seattle, Purdy finished the regular season playing some of his best football after returning from injury. Together, they've thrown touchdowns, created personalized handshakes, discussed conspiracy theories and danced their way back to the postseason stage.

""We spend so much time together and it's such a long season and there's a lot of pressure situations, a lot of things you've got to talk about,"" Shanahan said. ""And when you're in a small room with people all year long, if you're irritated with each other, it makes the year a lot harder. ... It's been a really cool room.""

Neither Purdy nor Jones has played enough to merit award consideration, but their combined production resembles the résumé of a Most Valuable Player candidate.

Jones and Purdy started eight and nine games, respectively, and combined to rank fifth in the NFL in QBR (68.4) and passing yards (4,157), third in completion percentage (69.3%) and fourth in touchdown passes (33). The two -- who first met on Purdy's 2017 recruiting visit to Alabama when Jones was a redshirt freshman and occasionally throw together in Florida in the offseason -- enjoy that success because of their bond.

""When a starting quarterback goes down, sometimes that could be the season,"" Purdy said. ""He stepped right in and kept the ship rolling. ... It wasn't just 'Let's squeeze by' wins. He looked great doing it. And he's been ready still even since I came back.

""To have two guys who can go in and play at a high level, there's nothing better.""

JONES' JOURNEY TO San Francisco was more circuitous than many anticipated. After the Niners passed on him in favor of Trey Lance after trading up to the No. 3 pick in the 2021 NFL draft, Jones went to the New England Patriots. He played well as a rookie but struggled in his final two seasons there. He was then traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars for a 2024 sixth-round pick and was Trevor Lawrence's backup last season. Jones started seven games, including the final five when Lawrence went on injured reserve, and finished with a 36.6 QBR, which would have ranked 31st in the NFL had he qualified.

Entering free agency for the first time in March, Jones had some ideas about what he wanted. He prioritized practical matters including a proven quarterback system such as Shanahan's and the chance to learn from a successful signal-caller like Purdy.

Jones, who noticed that Sam Darnold's career revitalization had begun in San Francisco, touched base with Purdy about the possibility of teaming up during their shared offseason workouts in Jacksonville, where Jones is from and Purdy spends time working with throwing coaches Tom Gormely and Will Hewlett.

Beyond the X's and O's, Jones also wanted his third NFL stop to provide something his previous two hadn't: the chance to be himself and rediscover the joy he had playing football in college.

""You want to be the same guy you are on the field as you are off the field because if you have to change, it's not going to be good because you're thinking about things you're not supposed to think about,"" Jones said.

A post shared by San Francisco 49ers (@49ers)

Jones, who said he wasn't allowed to listen to music before games in previous NFL stops, found himself on social media searching for videos of the 49ers' Bumpboxx entrance on game days. He watched players such as left tackle Trent Williams leading the Niners out of the tunnel with hip-hop blaring from a speaker and pictured himself dancing near the front of the line.

""New England runs things different over there,"" said receiver Kendrick Bourne, who played with Jones in New England and now with the Niners. ""It's a different system. It's more militant. And here it's more relaxed. ... The Patriots taught us a lot, but here it allows you to prevail in who you are.""

A FaceTime call with Shanahan sealed Jones' decision. It was validated weeks later when, after a spring practice, Jones watched Shanahan break down film of that day's workout.

Jones sat in awe as Shanahan offered insight on all three phases of the game in painstaking detail. Jones eagerly took notes on all of it, saying he treated every day like a rookie starting from scratch in case his number was called.

Little did Jones know that just two games into the season, he would need to put that study to use.

Stepping in for an injured Purdy against New Orleans in Week 2 might have been a recipe for disaster for most backup quarterbacks in a new system. But Jones' approach, paired with the repeated message from Lombardi to embrace all that comes with playing the most high-pressure position in sports, allowed him to settle in quickly after a shaky first quarter.

Jones threw for 279 yards and three touchdowns in a win. Purdy would return two weeks later before aggravating the toe injury in a Week 4 loss to Jacksonville, opening the door for Jones to build on what he'd learned.

Williams gave Jones the invitation he'd wanted ever since he joined the 49ers, asking him to move to the front of the Bumpboxx line.

""You can just tell that's his vibe,"" Williams said. ""That's Mac. Mac has got a lot of flavor to him. ... I could see him itching to, he wanted to, he might as well.""

After eight starts, Jones ranked second in the NFL in passing yards per game (268.9), ninth in completion percentage (69.6%) and 10th in yards per attempt (7.4). His 63.8 QBR still ranks eighth among quarterbacks with at least eight starts.

The Niners went 5-3 with Jones, leaving them in the playoff mix with the backup reestablishing his value as a potential starter for another QB-needy team in 2026 should San Francisco receive a worthwhile trade offer. But because Jones signed a two-year, $7 million deal, the Niners have the option of keeping their quarterback depth in place for another year.

""I've put some thought into it, but I just feel like I want to finish this year really strong and not get distracted by things that are out of my control,"" Jones said. ""I definitely feel like I got the train back on the tracks, and I'm going to work very hard to continue that. I don't know what's going to happen, and I'm on a two-year deal, so that's really all I can say about it. But I do believe that I played good football, and the scary part is I can play even better. I believe that.""

WALK INTO THE 49ers' quarterback room during normal business hours and the conversation will almost certainly be a deep discussion of fundamentals, the game plan or an opponent. In the few minutes before those meetings start, there's no telling what the topic du jour will be.

""If we had a podcast in our quarterback room, we would definitely break the internet,"" Jones said, laughing. ""We're very focused on doing our job, but the first five, 10 minutes, sometimes we get a little wild.""

For Purdy, Jones, Adrian Martinez and Kurtis Rourke, a favorite pastime is kicking around various conspiracy theories with Lombardi serving as de facto traffic cop. The moon landing is a popular debate, not so much because anyone believes the conspiracies, but in the delicate ecosystem of the room, it's always important to have opposing viewpoints.

Shanahan even occasionally joins in the fun, offering stories from his coaching and playing career that can lighten the mood before everyone gets down to business. Rourke, a rookie seventh-round pick out of Indiana who is on the non-football injury list, said the group has talked about ""pretty much everything you could imagine"" in those pre-meeting discussions.

All of it is meant to provide levity to a job that requires plenty of monotony, and it creates a closeness that can bring joy in the tedium.

""The best way I can describe our room is it's more like a friend group rather than just a work group,"" Rourke said.

That has manifested in many ways this season. When Purdy was out and Jones was starting, Purdy stayed tuned into the playcalls, regularly offering his teammate tips on even the tiniest bit of minutiae.

During installation periods at practice, Purdy would notice things such as Jones using a cadence that wouldn't pair with a certain motion, a seemingly small matter that could throw off the timing of an entire play.

""He kind of would catch me,"" Jones said. ""A lot of guys, maybe they wouldn't have said something or whatever. They wouldn't have thought to think, 'Let's help this guy out a little bit and make sure that he's doing it how I did it so that it runs the same way.'""

According to Purdy, that has been a two-way street with Jones finding ways to help him, too. Whether it's offering insights on how certain coordinators like to defend certain plays or Jones ensuring that Purdy is properly hydrated, he has jumped back into the supporting role headfirst.

When the 49ers beat the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 22, Jones checked that Purdy, who was playing through a triple-digit fever, the chills and sinus issues, was drinking plenty of fluids and taking IVs. Purdy threw for 295 yards and five touchdowns in what Jones jokingly called his ""flu game.""

""We've gotten along great in terms of having each other's backs,"" Purdy said. ""Our relationship is legit and real and authentic in terms of building each other up.""

The dynamic extends to Rourke and Martinez, too. Rourke, who is out for the year with a knee injury suffered in college, has watched Purdy closely, noting that the starter has carved out a successful path despite being the last pick in the draft.

Jones has done similar for Martinez, who has bounced around various practice squads and the UFL since going undrafted out of Kansas State in 2022. Late in a Nov. 2 win against the New York Giants, Jones pulled himself from the game, approaching Martinez on the sideline and telling him to go in. Martinez kneeled out the clock, logging his first regular-season snap.

""He didn't have to do that,"" Martinez said. ""And for me to get my first snap in that way, I mean, it meant a lot. He just kind of made the call and I was ready to go.""

LATE IN THE third quarter of the Niners' Nov. 30 win against the Cleveland Browns, Purdy faked a handoff to running back Christian McCaffrey and raced off the left side for a 2-yard touchdown. Purdy immediately dropped the ball and broke out the Dougie, the dance named for 1980s rapper Doug E. Fresh and brought back into the mainstream by the 2010 song from Cali Swag District ""Teach Me How to Dougie.""

Purdy has never shied away from celebrations, but dancing had rarely been part of the repertoire. As it turns out, Purdy has long annoyed his wife, Jenna, by regularly practicing in their kitchen, but never did it out on the field. In the following weeks, Purdy made it a staple, drawing laughter and support from teammates.

""When you see a quarterback that can get the tedious work done and be super serious, but then when we're successful let his hair down and celebrate a little bit, it's not something that you come across too often,"" Williams said. ""It energizes everyone else.""

In Purdy's case, it shows not only that there has been much to celebrate but also that he feels comfortable and confident after the injury.

Since Purdy took over as San Francisco's starter in 2022, the only quarterback in the NFL with a better QBR than his 69.8 is Buffalo's Josh Allen. Before the season finale against Seattle, teammates believed Purdy was playing his best football since returning, and that confidence remains entering the postseason. That he has done it without the usual cast of household names next to him, save for McCaffrey and tight end George Kittle, only bolsters that confidence.

In San Francisco's final seven games, Purdy ranked fourth in QBR and ninth in passing yards per game, and he accounted for 19 total touchdowns, third most in that span. Those numbers came despite a three-interception performance against the Carolina Panthers and a 22.8 QBR against Seattle, the fifth worst for a game in his career. The Niners went 6-1 in that stretch and locked up the playoff berth.

""He's a special football player,"" McCaffrey said. ""He's one of the best quarterbacks in the league and somebody who can make a play on any given snap. He's grown in the sense that now he might be a little more comfortable dancing and all that stuff.""

For the 49ers to make a run in the postseason, Purdy and the offense will have to bounce back from their season-ending stinker against Seattle. Without defensive ends Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams, and linebacker Fred Warner (at least for now), the defense is just trying to hold it together. It's Purdy & Co. who will be asked to carry the freight for any deep playoff run.

Should Purdy have a setback, Jones is staying prepared. Either way, the two quarterbacks their teammates call ""Glock Purdy"" and ""Mac-10"" (Jones and Purdy provided the offensive line with T-shirts with those monikers and have a custom handshake with each other paying homage to the nicknames), will be leading the way and leaning on each other.

What happens after the season remains to be seen but neither quarterback wants this ride to end any time soon.

""People ask me about it, I get it,"" Jones said. ""But at the same time, I'm dialed in. I love the guys here and don't want to be a distraction. I know that I possibly could be needed at a very critical part of the season, and so your job as the backup quarterback is to save the season. If I have to do that, I know I'm going to be ready.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0108%2Fr1598062_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 10:00:43.664321

The Giants finished 13th in total offense (333.5 ypg), 17th in points per game (22.4).","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- One of the final players to make it into the locker room before the New York Giants closed out their 2025 season last Sunday was injured wide receiver Malik Nabers.

He was moving slowly with a single crutch tucked underneath his right arm pit. His right knee was held in place by a bulky brace.

It was a little bit jarring to see Nabers like this 9+ weeks after surgery.

""I had a lot messed up in my knee,"" Nabers said the day following the injury.

But the talented wide receiver who was injured in Week 4 against the Los Angeles Chargers insists he's doing well. The outlook is positive.

""Successfully healed. Successfully operated on,"" Nabers said. ""But it's going to take a little bit of time for everybody. My injury is different from somebody else. My body reacts different.

""I was walking with a cane before I could see a doctor. Then they told me I could get off it. So now I don't got to do it. Just taking precautions to make sure the injury is healed.""

Nabers admitted originally it was a hard pill to swallow. After exploding onto the scene with 1,204 receiving yards as a rookie, he didn't make it through his first game with rookie Jaxson Dart at quarterback.

It forced some introspection.

""It's tough. It's hard. For myself, I needed this,"" Nabers said. ""I needed to get back to where I once was. Get that hunger. It's a blessing in disguise that I don't really see yet. I had a talk with (quarterback) Jameis (Winston) and I kept asking him, 'Why did it happen to me? Why did it happen to me?' And he said, 'Why not you? Why not go back to the bottom and find your way back to the top?'

""I'm taking that in my mind, taking that in my head and attacking rehab as much as I can. Doing what I can.""

Now the question is when Nabers will be healthy enough to get back on the field. Right now, that is unknown, even if the start of the regular season is 11 months post-surgery.

He wasn't ready in early January to commit to Week 1.

""Not really sure,"" he said of his expected return. ""If my body doesn't feel right, then I'm not going to go out there.""

While Nabers isn't quite sure when he's going to be back, rookie running back Cam Skattebo is aiming at the summer.

""Training camp for sure is the goal,"" Skattebo said on Monday.

Skattebo suffered an open tibia fracture, ruptured deltoid ligament and dislocated his right ankle in October against the Philadelphia Eagles. But he's already been seen jogging in the team facility and says his rehab is on track.

Right now, it's all about getting full movement back in his foot. That's not so easy given the extent of the injury.

""Getting my dorsiflexion in the foot is the main thing obviously,"" Skattebo said. ""I was stuck in a boot for eight weeks. Just strengthening it up. I broke my bone and dislocated my ankle. So anything you can imagine to get the ankle moving again is what I have to get up.""

That the injury wasn't worse considering how it looked is incredible. Skattebo, however, said he tried to get up and didn't really feel the pain when it was first injured. By the time he was in the X-ray room, it was already back in place.

There isn't a doubt in the mind of the fourth-round pick out of Arizona State that he will return to the same level.

""That's not even a question,"" Skattebo said. ""I'm going to be back. I played seven games in the NFL and I got hurt. There's a long road ahead but that is not going to stop me.""

The Giants finished 13th in total offense (333.5 ypg), 17th in points per game (22.4). They were 28th in total defense (359.5 ypg) and 26th in points per game allowed (25.8). Nobody would have predicted that split at the start of the season.

The offense was supposed to be the concern, but it was the defense that was a disappointment. There is no way around it considering the money and assets invested. The Giants' two most expensive free agent signings were on that side of the ball along with their top draft pick (Abdul Carter third overall).

Now the defense did improve dramatically over the final five games under interim coordinator Charlie Bullen. They were 10th in total defense during that time allowing 298.4 yards per game, one spot ahead of the Houston Texans and one behind the Denver Broncos.

Based on the results and the talent, there seems to be a belief that the problem was in the coaching. General manager Joe Schoen even pointed out that the talent on that side should be enticing for whoever takes over.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0107%2Fr1597736_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 09:00:30.188418

(5) Rams at (4) Panthers

Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET | Fox | LAR -10.5 (46.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Rams: Los Angeles is expecting WR Davante Adams to return. He has not played since aggravating a left hamstring injury in Week 15. The Rams have missed him most in the red zone, as nine of his league-leading 14 receiving touchdowns have come in goal-to-go situations. According to ESPN Research, the Panthers have allowed only five passing touchdowns in goal-to-go situations this season, which is tied for the fewest in the NFL. ""[Adams is] such a great player,"" QB Matthew Stafford said. ""I just have to put it in the ballpark and let him go do his thing."" -- Sarah Barshop

What we're hearing on the Panthers: As big as this game is for QB Bryce Young, it's bigger for the running game that had 19 yards last week and only 99 the week before. Carolina needs the balance it had in its Week 13 win over the Rams, in which the Panthers ran 40 times for 164 yards. That opened it up for Young, who had three TD passes -- including two on fourth-and-short. -- David Newton

Stat to know: The Rams rank second in run block win rate (74.1%), while the Panthers are 32nd in run stop win rate (26.2%) and 26th in EPA allowed per designed run. It all sets up for a game where the Rams won't have to take as many risks because they should have success on the ground with Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. But they will be without Kevin Dotson (ankle injury), who ranks 24th out of 62 qualifying guards in run block win rate. -- Walder

Bold prediction: Panthers WR Tetairoa McMillan will go off for 100-plus yards in his first career postseason game. McMillan had only one catch for 43 yards in the first contest against the Rams as the Panthers ran the ball a ton. But on a trailing script in this game, he'll shine. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Panthers WR Jalen Coker. He has a touchdown catch in three of his past five games, including one in Carolina's win over the Rams. If the Panthers are going to upset L.A., Coker will have to create explosive plays as a boundary target for Young. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: OVER 46.5. The over cashes if Carolina scores early and forces a competitive game. The Rams can score 30-plus, while any early Panthers success prevents coach Sean McVay from slowing the tempo. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: The Rams have been one of the NFL's least penalized teams over the past six seasons, and in 2025, they committed the fewest in the league (5.5 per game). Referee Clete Blakeman's crew threw an average of 14.4 flags per game. -- Seifert

(7) Packers at (2) Bears

Saturday, 8 p.m. ET | Prime Video | GB -1.5 (45.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Packers: Green Bay has the advantage in playoff experience. The Packers are in for the third straight season, although they've won just one game of their previous two appearances. ""You still go out there and get beat regardless of if you got hella experience or not,"" safety and defensive captain Xavier McKinney said. Coach Matt LaFleur said, ""Ultimately, it's about what you do on that day."" -- Rob Demovsky

What we're hearing on the Bears: Chicago wants to avoid another slow offensive start after getting outscored 47-21, running 66 fewer plays, losing the time of possession battle by 10:43 and going 2-for-12 on third downs in the first halves of their past three games. It has been an especially common trend against the Packers this season (Chicago trailed 14-3 and 6-0 at halftime in both regular-season games). ""The biggest thing with us playing complementary football is us getting out to that fast start, having urgency right from the first snap and being able to go out and execute the plan, execute the openers and be able to go put points on the board,"" offensive coordinator Declan Doyle said. -- Courtney Cronin

Stat to know: Both QBs should have all the time they need. The Bears lead the league in pass block win rate (73.6%), and on plays without Micah Parsons on the field, the Packers have just a 28.1% pass rush win rate. On the flip side, the Bears also have almost zero pass rush (28.8% PRWR, 31st) while the Packers rank sixth in pass block win rate (69%). -- Walder

Bold prediction: The Bears will hit a trick play on the first drive. They almost had one against the Packers in Week 16 -- a fourth-and-goal direct snap to RB Kyle Monangai that went over his head. Johnson will have another wrinkle for his first postseason game as coach, and Chicago needs to get out to a faster start in this game. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Bears TE Colston Loveland. He has topped 90 receiving yards in each of his past two games. He has the alignment versatility to work multiple levels of the field in coach Ben Johnson's offense. Look for Loveland to see steady volume from QB Caleb Williams versus the Packers' zone-heavy defense. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: Bears +1.5. Chicago runs efficiently, forces turnovers and closes better late. Green Bay moves the ball but stalls when it matters. Take the team built to survive discomfort. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: Referee Adrian Hill missed two games because of a leg injury, but overall, his crew threw the second-most flags among the 17 crews (17.9). The Bears led the NFL with nine flags for roughing the passer, four more than the next team, but Hill's crew called only three such penalties. -- Seifert

(6) Bills at (3) Jaguars

Sunday, 1 p.m. ET | CBS | BUF -1.5 (45.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Bills: Coach Sean McDermott has never won a road playoff game in his Bills tenure (0-5). In the four games with QB Josh Allen, the Bills' defense has been the statistical difference on the road versus at home (33.5 points per game allowed on the road and 19.8 allowed at home). The team is embracing this challenge. ""Being able to just have that mentality of it's you and your guys versus everybody else. We embrace that, and I mean, we're excited. We could play anywhere,"" DE Greg Rousseau said. -- Alaina Getzenberg

What we're hearing on the Jaguars: The headlines might be about the QBs, but this game likely will be decided on the ground: the Jaguars' top-ranked run defense versus the league's leading rusher in James Cook III. The Jaguars didn't allow a 100-yard rusher in the regular season. ""It's a challenge at every level of the defense, and the running back obviously is elite,"" defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile said. ""Cook does a tremendous job of finding cracks. You look at some of the stuff on tape, there's nowhere to go, and he pops through there."" -- Mike DiRocco

Stat to know: The Jaguars have a 67.8% pass block win rate, which ranks ninth best but is by far the best for a Jaguars team with QB Trevor Lawrence under center. A part of that solution? Cole Van Lanen, who took over at LT in Week 13 and has a 92% pass block win rate, which is 22nd best at the position and an upgrade over Walker Little. -- Walder

Bold prediction: Bills WR Gabe Davis, who played for the Jags in 2024, will score a touchdown in his revenge game. The Bills use Davis as a short-yardage and red zone threat because of his 6-foot-2, 225-pound frame. If they can't run the ball in and need to drop back, Davis will be Allen's preferred target. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Bills CB Taron Johnson. His ability to get to depth in Buffalo's foundational zone coverages is key versus a Jaguars passing game that features deep in-breaking concepts. Here, Johnson can close the intermediate windows, which will limit Lawrence's explosive play ability. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: UNDER 51.5. Buffalo allows the fewest opponent plays per game and has a run-heavy offense. The Jaguars' offense is efficient but not fast. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: Referee Brad Allen's crew threw the fewest flags per game this season (12.9). That could help the Jaguars, who were the NFL's third-most penalized team (9.3 per game). The Bills were tied for the sixth fewest at 6.8 per game. -- Seifert

Injuries: Bills | Jaguars

Maldonado's pick: Bills 27, Jaguars 20

Moody's pick: Jaguars 31, Bills 27

Solak's pick: Jaguars 23, Bills 21

(6) 49ers at (3) Eagles

Sunday, 4:30 p.m. ET | Fox | PHI -4.5 (44.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the 49ers: In an alternate universe, Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio would be working with coach Kyle Shanahan. Fangio spent time with the 49ers during the 2022 offseason, and Shanahan planned to hire him when all signs pointed to DeMeco Ryans leaving (he did to Houston). But Fangio signed with Miami in 2023, then joined the Eagles in 2024. Now, Shanahan faces the task of scoring against a Fangio-led defense that ranks fifth in points allowed per game (19.1). ""[Fangio], schematically, he has always been the best to me,"" Shanahan said. ""... Has a very sound scheme that he doesn't need to change up very much. It just naturally changes with how he does his coverages, how he does his fronts, the personnel groupings he does. He's very good at getting a beat on what you're trying to do and making you adjust."" -- Nick Wagoner

What we're hearing on the Eagles: Philadelphia was equally respectful toward Shanahan. Fangio was complimentary of Shanahan's scheme and his ability to call plays, and noted how ""everything's packaged well together"" and is purposeful on offense for San Francisco. The 49ers use motion on 70% of their offensive plays, the third most in the NFL. ""It's an offense that challenges your eyes and your discipline,"" LB Jaelan Phillips said. ""If you let all of the moving pieces affect you, that's when they take advantage of people."" -- Tim McManus

Stat to know: Since Week 7 -- the week after LB Fred Warner's ankle injury -- the 49ers are allowing opponents a 47% success rate on designed runs (third highest). Though the Eagles haven't been nearly as successful on the ground this season as they were in 2024, San Francisco's defense could present the opportunity for RB Saquon Barkley to have a big game. -- Walder

Bold prediction: Niners DE Bryce Huff will get a key sack. Huff is the 49ers' best shot at edge pressure, and he has a quick first step that can challenge Eagles LT Jordan Mailata. Huff has been struggling mightily as of late but expect an impassioned performance here. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Eagles S Reed Blankenship. He will be asked to play a two-way role in the secondary, limiting the middle-of-the-field targets in the 49ers' route tree, while also filling the alleys to cut off RB Christian McCaffrey in the run game. Blankenship had 53 solo tackles and one interception this season. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: 49ers QB Brock Purdy UNDER 1.5 passing touchdowns. The Eagles allow a league-low passing touchdown rate. And Fangio defenses historically suppress red zone passing efficiency, supporting Purdy's under. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: The 49ers were the second-least penalized team in the NFL (six per game), but they're tied for the most flags for unnecessary roughness (10). Overall, referee Alan Eck's crew threw the NFL's second-fewest flags per game this season (13). -- Seifert

Injuries: 49ers | Eagles

Maldonado's pick: Eagles 24, 49ers 20

Moody's pick: 49ers 20, Eagles 17

Solak's pick: 49ers 24, Eagles 17

(7) Chargers at (2) Patriots

Sunday, 8 p.m. ET | NBC/Peacock | NE -3.5 (46.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Chargers: QB Justin Herbert has been playing through a fractured left hand since Week 13, but he said this week that his hand feels the best it has since the injury. Herbert and other key starters rested in Week 18, a decision he said proved beneficial. ""I'd say definitely not taking hits on it last week was probably pretty helpful,"" he said. -- Kris Rhim

What we're hearing on the Patriots: QB Drake Maye said the Chargers don't allow many explosive plays by keeping everything in front of them, and that they are a top-five defense in forcing three-and-outs. So a point of emphasis for the Patriots is to sustain drives and then capitalize on one-on-one matchups. ""One-on-one, I like our guys. Ball placement, I like giving them a chance to go make a play. At the same time, be patient. Don't be bored being efficient and executing underneath and letting things come to you,"" Maye said of the approach against the Chargers. -- Mike Reiss

Stat to know: The Patriots' average of 8.7 air yards per attempt ranks second most in the NFL. But that makes for an interesting matchup against the Chargers' defense, which allows opponents just 5.0 air yards per attempt (third lowest). Los Angeles achieves that by being the most two-high heavy (57%) defense and the league's most zone-heavy defense (70%). -- Walder

Bold prediction: Chargers RB Omarion Hampton will shine on 20-plus carries and 100-plus yards against a poor Patriots run defense, especially if DT Khyiris Tonga (foot) can't go. The Chargers need to run the ball to protect their offensive line and control pace, and Hampton has looked good since returning from his ankle injury. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Patriots TE Hunter Henry. His ability to uncover and work the seams gives the Patriots an edge in the red zone. Henry has five red zone touchdown receptions this season, including two in his past three games. He should be a priority target for Maye. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: Patriots -3.5. New England is top five in point differential, points per drive on offense and defensive points allowed per drive. Since Week 10, the Chargers' offense ranks bottom three in yards per play, success rate, explosive play rate and points per drive. That gap supports the margin. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: Patriots CB Carlton Davis III was flagged six times for defensive pass interference, second most in the regular season. But the Chargers haven't been great at drawing pass interference and have had only four called against their opponents, second lowest. -- Seifert

Injuries: Chargers | Patriots

Maldonado's pick: Patriots 24, Chargers 17

Moody's pick: Patriots 27, Chargers 24

Solak's pick: Patriots 20, Chargers 14

Walder's pick: Patriots 26, Chargers 23

(5) Texans at (4) Steelers

Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET | ESPN/ABC | HOU -3 (39.5 O/U)

What we're hearing on the Texans: Coach DeMeco Ryans has the utmost respect for Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin, saying he has ""done it for a long time"" and pointing out how Tomlin sends encouragement his way. However, based on Monday's news conference, Ryans will use the heavily slanted coverage toward the Steelers as a rally cry. He showed slight annoyance at the number of questions he received about Pittsburgh by sarcastically saying, ""Y'all excited about the Steelers."" In the 2024 playoffs, he used the pro-Chargers coverage as motivation for the team before its 32-12 win in the wild-card round. -- DJ Bien-Aime

What we're hearing on the Steelers: The offensive line will face its greatest challenge of the season in the pass-rush tandem of Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter (29.5 sacks combined). ""Both of them just present major threats,"" LT Dylan Cook said. ""It's more so their changeups. We all know they're kind of power guys, but they both have really good spin moves. They both have really good motors, good hand usage."" The line has played well since Cook joined the group a month ago, giving up only two sacks in each of the past three games. -- Brooke Pryor

Stat to know: There is perhaps no game more relevant for the Steelers' ultra-quick average time to throw of 2.62 seconds (fastest in the NFL) than this one. That's because of the edge rushers they are facing: Anderson recorded 62 pass rush wins this season (second most), and Hunter delivers plenty of disruption as well. Pittsburgh might be uniquely suited to mitigate that threat because of Rodgers' quick release -- though standout DBs Derek Stingley Jr., Kamari Lassiter and Jalen Pitre will surely know that, too. -- Walder

Bold prediction: The Steelers will get shut out in the first half. There's so much hype for the Texans' pass rush, but it's the secondary's ability to create turnovers and minimize YAC that will lead to quick three-and-outs in this one. Houston can sustain long drives to control the clock, too. -- Solak

Matchup X factor: Anderson. He can play a difference-making role, setting an edge to limit the Steelers' outside zone run game, while also creating chaos as a pass rusher to disrupt Rodgers' rhythm. -- Bowen

One bet to consider: Texans -3. The Texans allow the second-lowest points per drive and force the most field goals per drive. Pittsburgh can score only with short fields, so the cleaner defense will cover in this game. -- Maldonado

Officiating nugget: The outcome of this game could depend on whether the Steelers can keep the Texans' pass rush off Rodgers. But he has helped the Steelers avoid harmful holding penalties by getting the ball out quick. They were flagged only 14 times for it, tied for the second fewest this season. -- Seifert

Injuries: Texans | Steelers

Maldonado's pick: Texans 23, Steelers 20

Moody's pick: Texans 21, Steelers 17

Solak's pick: Texans 24, Steelers 13

Quentin Lake made 23 tackles in his first three playoff games, and he believes that the Rams’ experience will matter in Charlotte and beyond.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — When the Los Angeles Rams lost Quentin Lake to a dislocated elbow in mid-November, their defense suffered and slumped.

Lake is returning for the wild-card round, and the Rams (12-5) are hoping he’s a key to a long playoff run.

As for Lake himself, he’s just eager to get back to work as the do-it-all defensive back who has become the unlikely engine driving a precocious young defense.

“I’m ready to go throw my elbow in there, have fun, fly around and help this team win again,” Lake said Thursday.

After several weeks to recover from surgery, Lake will be back in uniform when the Rams visit the Carolina Panthers (8-9) on Saturday in the first game of the NFL postseason. He wasn’t in uniform Nov. 30 when the Rams made their first trip to Charlotte, and his absence was felt in that game — and in every game the Rams have played since he went down nearly two months ago.

“He’s got this presence where you just feel better,” coach Sean McVay said.

Lake’s job is big and complicated, but the former sixth-round pick from UCLA has grown into the role filled by Jalen Ramsey during Los Angeles’ Super Bowl championship run four years ago.

Lake usually plays the “star” position in the schemes utilized by McVay and his past three defensive coordinators. The job requires him to line up frequently as a slot cornerback in coverage, but also to contribute heavily to the Rams’ run defense in the box.

He earns his “Captain Q” nickname by leading the defense on the field, making sure his teammates on the NFL’s least expensive defense are lined up correctly — and keeping a cool head amid the late-game pressure that will only be ratcheted up in the postseason.

“It’s extremely important,” defensive coordinator Chris Shula said of Lake’s return. “He’s a great player, whether you’re just talking about scheme-wise or all the things that he does for us. Really what he brings to the team as far as from a physicality, from communication and the questions he’s asking, it’s awesome to have him back.”

Lake’s importance can be measured by what happened while he was out.

The Rams fell to the bottom quarter of the NFL in scoring defense, yards allowed per play and big plays allowed, among several metrics. Los Angeles yielded 28 points per game in its final six outings, dropping the defense into the middle of the pack in the final NFL standings.

Lake showed his leadership qualities when asked about the Rams’ defensive play during his absence. Los Angeles went 3-3 in its final six games.

“We had a lot of guys come in for my spot that did great things,” Lake said. “At the same time, my job is, how can I come back and really help this team? That’s it. I don’t really look at, hey, what was happening when I was out, what wasn’t happening, the difference between when I was in and when I wasn’t. I was just focused on getting back, and luckily the team gave me a shot to come back and play meaningful football.”

Lake has known about big-time football pressure his whole life: His father, Carnell, played on several playoff teams and reached the Super Bowl during his decade as a dominant defensive back for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Quentin Lake made 23 tackles in his first three playoff games, and he believes that the Rams’ experience will matter in Charlotte and beyond.

“The playoff atmosphere is amazing,” Lake said. “Guys either rise to the occasion, or they sink to the level of their training, and I know we have a lot of guys that are built for it. Guys that when the pressure and the moment is big, they rise to the occasion.”

NOTES: RG Kevin Dotson has been ruled out this week due to his injured ankle, an absence that compromises the Rams’ rushing attack and overall offensive structure. Dotson got hurt when Seahawks LB Derick Hall stepped on him last month, earning a one-game suspension. The game in Carolina will be the third straight missed by Dotson. … Rookie TE Terrance Ferguson is questionable for Saturday after injuring his hamstring in practice last week, but he participated in parts of Thursday’s practice after missing the first two workouts this week. … CB Josh Wallace (ankle) is also questionable.

In other injury news, linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga (concussion) and defensive end Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (concussion) were also ruled out.
Here’s the full Bears injury report:","LAKE FOREST, Ill. — Bears slot cornerback C.J. Gardner-Johnson suffered a concussion during a Week 18 loss to the Detroit Lions. The veteran was down on the field for a while, and then skipped the sideline injury tent and headed straight for the home locker room. He hasn’t been on a football field since.

He missed the entire practice leading up to Saturday’s NFC wild-card round playoff against the Green Bay Packers, so it was no shock to see him ruled out on the official Bears injury report.

The Bears are fortunate to a reinforcement working his way back to action. Kyler Gordon was designated to return from his second injured-reserve stint on Monday and he worked through through each part of the practice week. Offensive lineman Braxton Jones, also designated to return of IR, is questionable.

He was formally listed as questionable, standard procedure for players on IR even when the plan is to activate him before kickoff.

Receiver Rome Odunze will return after five games missed with a foot injury. He did not receive an injury designation. Neither did receiver DJ Moore (knee) or offensive tackle Ozzy Trapilo (quad) who were limited this week.

Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen said Gordon is part of the plan for Saturday, though the Bears needed to see how Gordon would respond to practice activity. He dealt with a hamstring injury earlier in the season, but a groin issue has sidelined him lately. He was set to return prior to the Week 14 contest at Green Bay during pregame warmups.

In other injury news, linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga (concussion) and defensive end Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (concussion) were also ruled out.

A 1-0 Flyers lead, thanks to a goal from Konecny in the first minute of the second period, eventually evaporated.
Tocchet didn’t offer any insight into when either of those two could return, either, when pressed for an update Thursday morning.
Emil Andrae, relegated to the Phantoms to start the season, has returned and played a generally steady game on the blue line.
“It’s just next man up right now,” Owen Tippett said, “and we’ve got to find energy and find ways to win.”","PHILADELPHIA — The circumstances under which Travis Konecny exited the Philadelphia Flyers’ 2-1 overtime loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday night at Xfinity Mobile Arena were peculiar. Konecny was on the ice as the buzzer sounded to end the second period and even did the intermission interview with NBC Sports Philadelphia’s Ashlyn Sullivan moments later.

Then he entered the Flyers dressing room. He didn’t come back out. A 1-0 Flyers lead, thanks to a goal from Konecny in the first minute of the second period, eventually evaporated.

Coach Rick Tocchet explained what happened with Konecny. Kind of.

“Something was bugging him, I guess, early on,” Tocchet said. “I think he fell, or something. I don’t know the whole details.”

Konecny did appear to come into contact with one of the on-ice officials before the game began, but nothing appeared off when the puck dropped. After a scoreless (and low-event) first period, Konecny got open in the high slot early in the second, received a pass from Christian Dvorak and flicked a top-shelf wrister past Dennis Hildeby to give the Flyers a 1-0 lead just 55 seconds in. It was the game’s only goal for the first 54 minutes.

Konecny has been hot lately. In the last 19 games, he’s the Flyers’ leading scorer with 21 points (nine goals, 12 assists), shaking off a rough start in which he was turning the puck over far too often while trying to learn the intricacies of what Tocchet wanted him to do when he or his teammates had the puck.

“He would just pass it into piles of people. … Now, I just feel he’s making better decisions,” Tocchet said Wednesday at practice.

Not having Konecny for any amount of time would be a substantial blow, particularly on top of the Flyers’ already missing two other key players — winger Bobby Brink and defenseman Jamie Drysdale — who both suffered concussions Tuesday night in the Flyers’ 5-2 win over the Anaheim Ducks. Tocchet didn’t offer any insight into when either of those two could return, either, when pressed for an update Thursday morning.

The sprint to the Olympic break in February is on. Philadelphia has 14 more games in 27 days, beginning with Saturday’s match against the Tampa Bay Lightning. It’s a stretch that could make or break their season. How they handle these absences, however long they might last, will be vital.

“The depth is going to get challenged,” Tocchet said, speaking as if he expects the Flyers to be short-handed for at least a little while longer. “Stay with the structure, things like that. It’s really the next-guy-up mentality. You hear it all the time, but it’s true.”

Fortunately for the coach, getting contributions from depth players is one of the reasons the Flyers have remained in the thick of the playoff race with a 22-12-8 mark, including a 5-2-1 record in their last eight.

Denver Barkey, recalled from the Phantoms last month, played in his ninth straight game and nearly converted a breakaway chance in the first period Thursday, hitting the crossbar. He continues to look like an NHL player. Carl Grundstrom, essentially given away by the San Jose Sharks in an October trade, has seven goals and has become a key penalty killer lately, too. Emil Andrae, relegated to the Phantoms to start the season, has returned and played a generally steady game on the blue line.

Other depth guys seem to be trending in the right direction, too. After a nightmarish first half of the season, Garnet Hathaway has looked rejuvenated since re-entering the lineup Jan. 3. He threw a pair of devastating hits in the Anaheim game and, on Thursday against the Maple Leafs, put together an outstanding shift on the penalty kill in which he prevented Toronto from moving the puck through the neutral zone. He later sold out to block an Oliver Ekman-Larsson shot in which the blade of his skate popped off upon impact with the puck. Travis Sanheim had to help Hathaway get back to the bench on one foot.

“I can’t go back and change the first half. I wish I could, but I can’t,” said Hathaway, who is still scoreless in 36 games. “I’m trying to go day by day. I’m trying to help this team win games, be productive. I think the last few games I’ve played to my identity more than I have before that, and that’s what I need to rely on.”

Another player popping lately is rookie Nikita Grebenkin. He was effective in the Ducks game, scoring an empty net goal that put the game away, assisting on a Cam York score in the second period and recording three shots on goal. He was noticeable again on Thursday while playing against his former team, too.

Tocchet has been impressed.

“Played hard. Played really hard,” Tocchet said of Grebenkin. “He was moving his feet. He had a lot of motion tonight. I thought he played really well.”

Said Hathaway: “We have a deep team. We have guys that have contributed when they get in, up and down the lineup. You can’t replicate those guys we’re missing with one player.”

Still, if the Flyers are going to survive, something that will have to drastically improve is the power play, which entered the evening 30th in the NHL. They went 0-for-3 against Toronto, two of which came in the third period when they could have salted the game away, including nearly a minute of five-on-three time with less than eight minutes to go.

Instead, Sanheim’s missed shot resulted in a short-handed rush the other way after it became a five-on-four, and Scott Laughton, playing in his first game as a visiting player in Philadelphia, ripped a shot past Dan Vladar to tie the score at 1. Easton Cowan’s overtime winner on a two-on-one earned the Leafs the extra point.

“Keep trying to get better each day and hope that we can start putting some in,” Sanheim said of the power play. “It’s a big part of good teams, and something that we obviously have got to be better at.”

Though the ending wasn’t what the Flyers wanted, particularly in that they had a Trevor Zegras breakaway opportunity and a pair of two-on-one chances in overtime, Tocchet gave them credit for working hard and finding a way to hold a lead for most of the night. They fought through a game that didn’t have nearly the same kind of emotion as Tuesday’s tilt with Cutter Gauthier and the Ducks, and against a streaking team that improved to 6-0-2 in its last eight.

There could be greater challenges in their immediate future, however, considering who might not be available.

Boutte missed two weeks back in November due to a hamstring injury. It's not clear if this injury is related. Boutte also missed Week 17 with a concussion, but was cleared and returned for Week 18.

Outside of the three games he's missed Boutte has been one of Drake Maye's most trusted and reliable targets this year, especially on deep balls. He had 33 catches for 551 yards and six touchdowns this season.

The Patriots are already without another outside receiver in Mack Hollins, who was placed on IR last week. If Boutte can't go it could mean a bigger role for rookie Kyle Williams.

Introduction

Wayne Gandy (“Gandy”) played fifteen years in the National Football League (“NFL”) as an offensive lineman with multiple teams. Six years after he retired, he filed a worker’s compensation claim in California naming the Rams. It was later amended to include his other NFL employers, the Pittsburgh Steelers (“Steelers”), New Orleans Saints (“Saints”) and Atlanta Falcons (“Falcons”), creating the conundrum of which Defendant should be liable for Gandy’s workers compensation injury claim in California. The trial Judge declined to exercise jurisdiction over the non-California teams per Labor Code 3600.5(c) and (d). The California Workers Compensation Appeals Board, (“WCAB”), overruled the trial judge and opined that California had jurisdiction over the other named defendants per Labor Code 3600.5(a) since applicant once played for a California team. The Atlanta Falcons, appealed to the California Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal reversed the WCAB, holding that California lacked jurisdiction over the Falcons per Labor Code Section 3600 (c) and (d). Gandy v. The Atlanta Falcons, et al, California Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division Three, Case No. G064622, (WCAB Case. No. ADJ1010126), (10-7-2025)). The case was remanded back to the WCAB for further proceedings, consistent with the Court of Appeal opinion.

Background

Gandy was the 15th pick in the first round of the 1994 draft by the Los Angeles Rams. He went on to play 15 seasons as an offensive linemen in the NFL, with the Los Angeles Rams in 1994, St. Louis Rams 1995-1998, Pittsburgh Steelers 1999-2003, the New Orleans Saints, 2003-2005, before ending with the Atlanta Falcons, 2006-2009. Playing offensive line in the NFL carries substantial well-documented physical and long-term health risks. Linemen are generally the largest players on the field, playing in the “trenches”, often involved in high impact collisions. Gandy himself was listed as 6’6” and 315 pounds. With the combination of mass, leverage and force at the line of scrimmage, no one disputes the risk of injury involved.

‘

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

The battle over [California] Workers’ Compensation cannot be understood without looking at the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). In fact, the NFL-NFL Players’ Association have express provisions in the CBA structuring worker’s compensation. The CBA states, in Article 41: “Section 1. In any state where workers’ compensation coverage is not compulsory or where a Club is excluded from a state’s workers’ compensation coverage, a Club will either voluntarily obtain coverage under the compensation laws of that state or otherwise guarantee equivalent benefits to its players under the compensation law of the state in which his Club is located.

Section 2. states: “A Club that has the legal right to reject coverage under the workers’ compensation law of its state. Moreover, any Club may be excluded from those laws if it elects to do so. However, if a Club elects to reject or be excluded from coverage under the compensation law of its state, it must nevertheless guarantee benefits to its Players in the manner provided in Section 1 above. “

Flowing from the collectively bargained provisions in Sections 1 and 2 above, the NFL and the NFL Players Association agreed on uniform contract language that steers workers compensation claims to the team’s home state. These provisions were created to prevent players from filing claims in states like California where cumulative trauma claims were more likely to succeed and benefits were more generous.

For the NFL and team owners, the CBA functions as the central risk management tool providing predictability in limiting liability to one team, one state and one workers’ compensation system. One might ask why the NFL Players’ Association agree to jurisdictional limits on where claims could be filed. As part of the bargaining process, the players received other benefits including higher minimum salaries, and expanded injury protections during and post career outside of workers’ compensation.

The CBA is more than a labor peace document. It is the mechanism through which risk is allocated and legal exposure is managed. Thus, the NFL and team owners fight to control [California] workers’ compensation benefits became as important as over the field of play.

The California Worker’s Compensation Process Begins

On September 14, 2015, six years after his NFL career ended with the Falcons, Gandy filed a lawsuit in California for workers’ compensation benefits. The cause alleged was a cumulative trauma injury throughout his NFL career from 4/25/1993 to 2/27/2009, involving injuries to his head, brain, face, neck, trunk, multiple other body parts and nervous system. The lawsuit initially only named the Los Angeles Rams who are a California based team and the St. Louis Rams since he continued to play under his California contract with the St. Louis Rams. Applicant also played seven games in California while with the St. Louis Rams.

The suit was later amended to include the Steelers, Saints and Falcons whom applicant played for over the last decade of his NFL career. Gandy played 2 games in California while playing for the Steelers and Falcons respectively. He also played 4 games and spent 1 week of practice in California with the Saints.

Pursuant to Labor Code 5500.5(a), liability for a cumulative trauma injury is limited to the employers who employed the worker during the one-year period immediately preceding the date of injury (LC 5412), or the last date of injurious exposure, whichever occurs first. Under Labor Code 5412 the date of injury is defined as the first date someone suffers both disability (i.e. missed time from work, medical treatment beyond first aid, or disability payment), and knows the disability is work related.

Based on the pleadings, per Labor Code 5500.5, the last year of injurious exposure would be 2/27/2008 to 2/27/2009. The Falcons would be the lone defendant in the last year of injurious exposure, if California jurisdiction extends to applicant’s employment with the non-California teams including the Falcons.

LABOR CODE 3600.5

Labor Code Section 3600.5 was enacted in 1955 to clarify and expand coverage for California employees injured outside the State and to limit California benefits for out of state employees temporarily working in California. The intent was partly to reduce workers’ compensation insurance costs for employers.

Pursuant to Labor Code Section 3600.5 (a) California employees injured outside the State are entitled to California worker’s compensation benefits. (b) out of state employees temporarily working in California are exempt if covered by any another state’s workers’ compensation system.

In 2013, there was a significant amendment, AB 1309, later codified as Labor Code 3600.5 (c)(d) specifically targeting professional athletes. The amendment applied to claims filed after September 15, 2013, and injurie occurring after January 1, 2014. It exempted certain out-of-state professional athletes from California’s cumulative injury provisions if: they were1) hired outside of California worked temporarily in California for less than 20% of his her/duty days during the year immediately preceding the last day of work for that employer, the employer provides reciprocal workers compensation coverage under another state’s law.

Labor Code Section 3600.5 (c) states that professional athletes hired outside of CA are exempt from cumulative injury claims if covered by any another state’s workers’ compensation system. (d) if a professional athlete has both California and non-California employers, the claim is exempt when all of the employers in the last year of work as a pro athlete are exempted unless: 1) the pro athlete has worked 2 or more seasons for a California based team or 20% or more of his/her duty days in California or for a California based team and 2) has worked fewer than seven seasons for any teams other than a California based team.

Before 2013, California allowed cumulative trauma claims even for athletes who played only a few games in the State. This attracted voluminous claims from retired athletes who had minimal California ties because: California recognizes cumulative trauma injuries and California has a long statute of limitations for filing such claims. The increased number of claims created financial strain on California teams and insurers and clogged the WCAB with cases that had little connection to California.

TRIAL COURT/RECONSIDERATION

Gandy’s case proceeded to trial in June 2019 on three issues: 1) whether California has jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim; 2) whether jurisdiction should be exercised in light of the Choice of Law & Choice of Frum clauses in Gandy’s contracts with the Falcons and Saints (Mckinley v. AZ Cardinals, 78 Cal Comp Cases 23 (2013); and 3) whether Gandy’s claim against the Falcons was barred by the statute of limitations.

The trial Judge held the Falcons were exempt because they provided workers’ compensation insurance coverage for Gandy under the laws of another state, and that such insurance provided coverage for Gandy in California and Atlanta for all relevant time Gandy was working for the Falcons.

On Reconsideration, the WCAB determined jurisdiction extends to any athlete who ever signed a contract in California or with any California based team. Hansell v. Arizona Diamondbacks 87 Cal Comp Cases 602 (2022). The WCAB has jurisdiction over Gandy’s claim because he signed a contract for his first season in the National Football League with the Los Angeles Rams, a California based team. Any choice of law/forum selection clause should not be enforced. The legislature did not intend for 3600.5(c) and (d) to apply to athletes who have been hired in CA by at least one employer during the CT period. Counsel for the Falcons petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of review which was granted.

APPELLATE COURT DECISION

The Court of Appeal performs review de novo, starting with the statutory language. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation v. WCAB 17 Cal 5th 510,520 (2025). If there is a conflict, the statutes should be harmonized. If the statutes can’t be reconciled, the later enactments supersede earlier ones, and more specific provisions take precedence over general ones. State Dept. of Public Health V. Superior Court 60 Cal. 4th 940, 955 (2015).

California workers’ compensation is solely a creation of the legislature and fundamental subject matter jurisdiction is limited by statute. In the absence of a statute affirmatively conferring subject matter jurisdiction over a claim to the WCAB, it lacks authority to adjudicate the claim.

The legislature in fact explicitly addressed the issue posed by Gandy’s claim of what happens when a pro athlete is hired by both California and non-California teams over the course of his employment and suffers a cumulative trauma injury. Labor Code 3600.5 (d) exempts claims when all the professional athlete’s employers in his/her last year of work are exempt under 3600.5 (c) unless: 1) the pro athlete has worked two or more seasons for a California based team or worked 20% or more of their total career duty days for a CA based team AND 2) the pro athlete has worked for fewer than seven seasons for any non-California based teams.

Gandy fails both provisions. Of his 15 NFL seasons, only one was with a California based team, less than 20% of his total career duty days were performed in California and he played more than 7 seasons with non-California teams given his 14 seasons with the St. Lous Rams, Pittsburgh Steelers, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons.

CONCLUSION

California Labor Code § 3600.5(c) and (d) significantly restricts the ability of professional athletes to bring workers’ compensation claims in California for cumulative trauma or occupational disease when they have been hired outside the state and are only temporarily working in California, provided their employer has valid out-of-state workers’ compensation coverage that applies to their California work. These provisions, as interpreted by California courts and the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB), are designed to prevent “forum shopping” by athletes with minimal California contacts, while preserving access for those with substantial California ties (e.g., multiple seasons with California teams or significant duty days in California). This way players with long-term, significant California contacts like Joe Montana, and LaDanian Tomlinson, are still protected under California workers’ compensation law.

Legal professionals handling these cases must carefully analyze the athlete’s employment history, contract formation, and the scope of coverage under other states’ laws to determine jurisdiction and the proper forum for claims. Pennsylvania and Louisiana both have reciprocal extraterritorial provisions which should exempt them from California jurisdiction for purposes of workers’ compensation like the Falcons. The St. Louis Rams are not so lucky since Gandy continued to play for the St. Louis Rams under his California contract.",https://sportslitigationalert.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/cropped-sla-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-09 06:58:15.428242

Lake is returning for the wild-card round, and the Rams (12-5) are hoping he’s a key to a long playoff run.

As for Lake himself, he’s just eager to get back to work as the do-it-all defensive back who has become the unlikely engine driving a precocious young defense.

“I’m ready to go throw my elbow in there, have fun, fly around and help this team win again,” Lake said Thursday.

After several weeks to recover from surgery, Lake will be back in uniform when the Rams visit the Carolina Panthers (8-9) on Saturday in the first game of the NFL postseason. He wasn’t in uniform Nov. 30 when the Rams made their first trip to Charlotte, and his absence was felt in that game — and in every game the Rams have played since he went down nearly two months ago.

“He’s got this presence where you just feel better,” coach Sean McVay said.

Lake’s job is big and complicated, but the former sixth-round pick from UCLA has grown into the role filled by Jalen Ramsey during Los Angeles’ Super Bowl championship run four years ago.

Lake usually plays the “star” position in the schemes utilized by McVay and his past three defensive coordinators. The job requires him to line up frequently as a slot cornerback in coverage, but also to contribute heavily to the Rams’ run defense in the box.

He earns his “Captain Q” nickname by leading the defense on the field, making sure his teammates on the NFL’s least expensive defense are lined up correctly — and keeping a cool head amid the late-game pressure that will only be ratcheted up in the postseason.

“It’s extremely important,” defensive coordinator Chris Shula said of Lake’s return. “He’s a great player, whether you’re just talking about scheme-wise or all the things that he does for us. Really what he brings to the team as far as from a physicality, from communication and the questions he’s asking, it’s awesome to have him back.”

Lake’s importance can be measured by what happened while he was out.

The Rams fell to the bottom quarter of the NFL in scoring defense, yards allowed per play and big plays allowed, among several metrics. Los Angeles yielded 28 points per game in its final six outings, dropping the defense into the middle of the pack in the final NFL standings.

Lake showed his leadership qualities when asked about the Rams’ defensive play during his absence. Los Angeles went 3-3 in its final six games.

“We had a lot of guys come in for my spot that did great things,” Lake said. “At the same time, my job is, how can I come back and really help this team? That’s it. I don’t really look at, hey, what was happening when I was out, what wasn’t happening, the difference between when I was in and when I wasn’t. I was just focused on getting back, and luckily the team gave me a shot to come back and play meaningful football.”

Lake has known about big-time football pressure his whole life: His father, Carnell, played on several playoff teams and reached the Super Bowl during his decade as a dominant defensive back for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Quentin Lake made 23 tackles in his first three playoff games, and he believes that the Rams’ experience will matter in Charlotte and beyond.

“The playoff atmosphere is amazing,” Lake said. “Guys either rise to the occasion, or they sink to the level of their training, and I know we have a lot of guys that are built for it. Guys that when the pressure and the moment is big, they rise to the occasion.”

NOTES: RG Kevin Dotson has been ruled out this week due to his injured ankle, an absence that compromises the Rams’ rushing attack and overall offensive structure. Dotson got hurt when Seahawks LB Derick Hall stepped on him last month, earning a one-game suspension. The game in Carolina will be the third straight missed by Dotson. ... Rookie TE Terrance Ferguson is questionable for Saturday after injuring his hamstring in practice last week, but he participated in parts of Thursday’s practice after missing the first two workouts this week. ... CB Josh Wallace (ankle) is also questionable.

Without this acceptance, rehab becomes doubly difficult, as the mind works against the body’s healing process.
The Stoic mindset A key aspect of NFL resilience is the “Stoic” approach: focusing on what can be controlled.
Final word Recovering from an NFL injury is a process that combines mental and physical resilience.
The recovery process isn’t just about getting back to where they were, but about evolving into a more mentally durable and focused athlete.","In the high-stakes environment of the National Football League (NFL), an injury is not just a physical setback; it’s a profound threat to an athlete’s identity, career, and mental stability.

While the torn ACL or fractured ankle grabs attention, the real battle begins in the weeks that follow. For athletes whose lives are defined by physical dominance and team camaraderie, being sidelined triggers an “identity crisis.”

The sudden halt of their routine, the absence of the locker room atmosphere, and the uncertainty of their future contract can lead to psychological distress. Just as people use tools like the best apps for anxiety relief to manage stress, athletes must rely on their mental playbook to navigate the emotional rollercoaster of rehabilitation. Resilience in the NFL isn’t just about healing physically; it’s about the “mental playbook” players use to get back to the field.

The initial psychological impact of injury

When an injury occurs, players often experience a mourning process similar to the stages of grief. Suddenly, they’re separated from teammates and the adrenaline-filled rhythm of the season.

This isolation can lead to feelings of irrelevance or fear of being replaced while they are away. The first step in resilience is acknowledging this emotional shock.

Coaches and sports psychologists agree that the most successful recoveries begin when a player accepts their new reality rather than fighting it.

By moving past the “why me?” phase and focusing on the road ahead, athletes can better manage their emotions and avoid spiraling into a negative mental state. Without this acceptance, rehab becomes doubly difficult, as the mind works against the body’s healing process.

The power of micro-goals

A daunting nine-month recovery timeline can feel insurmountable for any player. To manage this, they break the recovery into small, achievable milestones—called micro-goals. This technique is commonly used to manage stress, tracking small wins to maintain focus.

In the NFL training room, micro-goals might include standing without crutches, regaining motion, or completing a set of exercises without pain. Each small success triggers dopamine, keeping players motivated and preventing “rehab fatigue” that often sets in during the middle phase of healing.

These micro-goals help athletes see progress, no matter how small it may seem, providing psychological momentum to keep going.

Visualization and mental reps

While the body is healing, the mind must stay sharp. Elite athletes use visualization and “mental reps” to keep their cognitive reaction times intact during physical absence. By watching game film and mentally running through plays, athletes keep their neural pathways active. Research shows that the brain fires similarly during visualization as it does during actual performance. This mental rehearsal helps players stay “game-ready” for when they return. For a quarterback, this might involve visualizing the opponent’s blitz patterns; for a linebacker, it’s “seeing” the gaps in the offensive line before they open. This technique prevents “mental rust” and ensures that their tactical awareness remains intact when they return to the field.

Finding strength in vulnerability

Resilience isn’t just a solo effort—it’s a team effort. The most durable players are those who build a “support squad” made up of sports psychologists, family, and fellow injured teammates. There’s a growing culture in professional football that encourages players to share the emotional struggles of rehab rather than internalizing stress.

By opening up about their frustrations, players can process setbacks without letting them break their spirit. Sharing the burden with their support system reminds them that, even though they are sidelined, they are still valued members of the team. This sense of belonging is vital for maintaining mental health during recovery.

The Stoic mindset

A key aspect of NFL resilience is the “Stoic” approach: focusing on what can be controlled. Injured players can’t control their team’s depth chart or how quickly they heal, but they can control their nutrition, sleep quality, and effort during rehab.

By focusing on these controllable factors, they eliminate anxiety about the uncertain future. This sttitude shifts players from being “victims” of circumstance to active participants in their recovery. The Stoic mindset serves as a psychological anchor, helping athletes avoid despair and stay focused on the progress they can control.

The return to play: overcoming the fear of re-injury

The final stage of resilience is overcoming the fear of re-injury. Physical clearance is only half the battle; the real challenge is regaining the confidence to play without hesitation. After an injury, there’s a natural instinct to protect the injured area.

Overcoming this fear requires gradual exposure to contact and trust in the rehab process. Through “confidence-building” drills, players slowly ramp up the intensity of their training, allowing their brain to gather evidence that the body is strong enough to handle the physical demands of the game.

When a player stops thinking about the injury and begins reacting instinctively, that’s when they fully reclaim their place on the field.

Final word

Recovering from an NFL injury is a process that combines mental and physical resilience. By breaking down recovery into small goals, staying mentally sharp through visualization, and leaning on a strong support system, athletes can successfully navigate the toughest parts of rehabilitation.

Physical healing alone isn’t enough to ensure a successful return; mental conditioning is just as crucial. The recovery process isn’t just about getting back to where they were, but about evolving into a more mentally durable and focused athlete. True strength comes from the mind, and the resilience cultivated during recovery is what allows athletes to thrive under pressure when they return to the game.",https://nfldraftdiamonds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/49f49770-8f74-11f0-9f6b-36bf999072c0.webp,N,,2026-01-08 22:58:44.724941

(AP) — When Brock Purdy walked off the field following his first playoff trip to Philadelphia, his future was in question.
He won in his return to Philadelphia in 2023 when he helped San Francisco reach the Super Bowl and leads the 49ers back to Philadelphia to take on the Eagles (11-6) on Sunday in a wild-card matchup.
When I look at his resume and how well he’s played throughout his entire career, he’s a special football player.
... He’s always played with that swagger and that energy.” But Purdy and the San Francisco offense struggled in the regular-season finale with the No.
The Niners managed one field goal in a 13-3 loss as Purdy was held to 127 yards on 27 attempts.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — When Brock Purdy walked off the field following his first playoff trip to Philadelphia, his future was in question.

Purdy had gone from the last pick of the 2022 draft to an improbable starting quarterback in the NFC title game for the San Francisco 49ers in a span of nine months only to tear a ligament in his right elbow on his opening drive of a loss.

“You tear your UCL, the ligament that you use as a quarterback, as a thrower, obviously you start thinking about your future and things and coming back from the injury and it was at the end of the year so I was questioning will I be back in time, will I be the guy come the start of the season? Stuff like that,"" Purdy said Thursday. ""But now we’re moved on and ready to go.”

Purdy returned from the major surgery and proved his late-season run as a rookie wasn't a momentary flash, establishing himself as the franchise quarterback for the 49ers (12-5).

He won in his return to Philadelphia in 2023 when he helped San Francisco reach the Super Bowl and leads the 49ers back to Philadelphia to take on the Eagles (11-6) on Sunday in a wild-card matchup.

Purdy's concerns this week are with Vic Fangio's defense featuring stars such as Jalen Carter, Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean, and a tough Philadelphia crowd instead of the elbow which has been completely healed since 2023.

“Obviously, we know Philly from being there and their environment, their fans, all the things,” Purdy said. ""It’s getting prepared for that right now rather than having flashbacks or anything like that. I already went there in 2023 and played after what had happened in ’22. So, I feel like that’s out of the way and ready to move on.”

Purdy recovered from that injury to become an AP NFL MVP finalist in the 2023 season when he set a franchise record for yards passing and helped the Niners reach the Super Bowl before losing in overtime to the Chiefs.

After the Niners struggled to a 6-11 record last season, they are back in the postseason again with another visit to Philadelphia on Sunday for the wild-card round.

The season hasn't been an easy one for Purdy, who was rewarded for his early success with a five-year, $265 million contract extension in May. Purdy injured his toe in the season opener and missed the next two games.

He returned and struggled in a Week 4 loss to Jacksonville before sitting out the next six games because of the injured toe. He returned in Week 11 and quickly got back to his old form, leading San Francisco to six straight wins including back-to-back five touchdown games in prime-time wins over Indianapolis in Chicago in Weeks 16 and 17.

That's the type of performance the 49ers have grown used to seeing from Purdy.

“I’ve got to say, when he showed up from the first game he played, he looked pretty incredible in that game too,” running back Christian McCaffrey said. ""He’s never gotten enough credit. When I look at his resume and how well he’s played throughout his entire career, he’s a special football player. He’s one of the best quarterbacks in the league. ... He’s always played with that swagger and that energy.”

But Purdy and the San Francisco offense struggled in the regular-season finale with the No. 1 seed, a first-round bye and home-field advantage on the line against Seattle. The Niners managed one field goal in a 13-3 loss as Purdy was held to 127 yards on 27 attempts.

Offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak said that has served as motivation this week.

“We got punched in the mouth,” Kubiak said. “We didn’t play good and we got beat. That’s what happened. I think our guys were a little pissed off. I think they were disappointed. We were all disappointed in how we played and how we coached. It wasn’t our best.”

Injury update

The Niners got some good news on the injury front with Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams back at practice for the first time since injuring his hamstring on the opening snap in Week 17.

Receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle) remains out but was able to do some running on the side. Linebacker Luke Gifford (quadriceps) didn't practice after being limited on Wednesday. Defensive lineman Keion White (hamstring, groin) and linebacker Dee Winters (ankle) also remained out.

Tight end George Kittle (ankle), defensive tackle Jordan Elliott (knee) and defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) were also limited.

Linebacker Fred Warner, who has been out since injuring his ankle in Week 6, was able to do some running on the side for the first time during an open portion of practice to reporters.

Stroupe took to X, formerly Twitter, to post an old photo of Mahomes working out from May 1, 2021. The last time he posted that photo, which was on Instagram, he captioned it, “It’s personal.” However, he captioned it by putting the NFL on notice.

“Remember the last time they said he would never be the same[?]” he asked, also posting a variety of emojis along with his caption.

Of course, Stroup is likely referring to Mahomes’ previous toe injury, which required surgery after the 2020 NFL season concluded. He suffered the injury in the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Cleveland Browns.

That year ended with disappointment as well. The Chiefs were blown out by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl 55 in Tom Brady’s final Super Bowl. In 2025, the Chiefs went 6-11 and missed the playoffs, and Mahomes tore his ACL in Week 15.

Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes’ injury occurred in Week 15

Mahomes suffered his torn ACL injury during the fourth quarter in a game against the Los Angeles Chargers. Gardner Minshew would fill in for Mahomes, and he tore his ACL the following week. Chris Oladokun, a seventh-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, and Shane Buechele finished the season under center.

Before his injury, Mahomes was averaging 256.2 yards per game, throwing for 3,587 yards. He also passed for 22 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. Mahomes also rushed for 422 yards (a career-high) and five touchdowns.

Now, Mahomes is rehabbing his torn ACL and LCL injuries after getting surgery to repair them. Hopefully, he will be back in time for the first game of the 2026 NFL season. The Chiefs are going to hope to get back to the top of the mountain after five Super Bowl appearances under Mahomes.

Fellow offensive linemen Vederian Lowe and Garrett Bradbury remained sidelined due to illnesses, as well, while defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga’s absence continued because of a foot injury.

Previously listed as a limited participant, Munford marked the fourth absence for the AFC East champions on Thursday. Since being signed back off the practice squad of the Cleveland Browns in November, the bookend has seen 100 snaps on offense and 30 snaps on special teams. A pair of starts have been notched along the way while reporting as eligible. Fellow linemen in Lowe and Bradbury have now missed consecutive sessions due to a sickness going around the locker room. As for Tonga, the three-phase nose tackle has not practiced since missing consecutive games to end the regular season.

Four Patriots practiced in a limited capacity on Thursday. Boutte would find himself among them. The wide receiver has been added to the injury report due to a hamstring injury. He missed Week 10 and Week 11 with a hamstring injury and later had a stint in the NFL’s concussion protocol, finishing the slate with 33 catches for 551 yards and a career-best six touchdowns. Elsewhere, a rookie starter at guard as well as a captain and sack leader at outside linebacker continued to be limited for New England. As for Austin, the cornerback has yet to be activated from injured reserve after having his 21-day practice window open on New Year’s Eve.

A handful of veterans graduated to full participation outside Gillette Stadium on Thursday. Moses and Jennings both sat out the previous session due to illnesses.

Bradley left the stadium on crutches with his left knee in a brace.
Slot told Sky after the match of his fears for the 22-year-old, who has played 21 matches across all competitions this term.
“I don’t know Gabriel Martinelli but he comes across as a nice guy,” Slot said in his post-match press conference.
But it doesn’t look great if Conor has the injury which we fear he might have.","Arne Slot has said he “fears the worst” over the knee injury Conor Bradley suffered in Liverpool’s goal-less draw at Arsenal.

The Northern Ireland full-back will under scans to determine the extent of the damage after being stretchered off deep into second-half stoppage time. Bradley left the stadium on crutches with his left knee in a brace.

Slot told Sky after the match of his fears for the 22-year-old, who has played 21 matches across all competitions this term.

Arsenal substitute Gabriel Martinelli had enraged Slot’s players by throwing the ball at Bradley and then attempting to shove him off the pitch as he lay in obvious discomfort awaiting treatment.

“I don’t know Gabriel Martinelli but he comes across as a nice guy,” Slot said in his post-match press conference.

“I think the problem for him is, and it’s a problem in general in football, that there is so much time-wasting and players pretending they are injured in the final parts of the game. You can then sometimes be annoyed if you want to score a goal that you think the player is time-wasting.

“I cannot ask of Gabriel Martinelli in the 94th minute when it’s so emotional for him to understand he is playing Liverpool – a team when we played Leeds and a player was held but didn’t go to the floor, or played West Ham United and my players try to drag (Lucas) Paqueta out of a situation where he was getting a second yellow card.

“I’m 100 per cent sure that if he knew what the injury might be that he would never do (what he did). But it doesn’t look great if Conor has the injury which we fear he might have.

“I think when we see the video we both probably think the same, but we have to wait on the scans if it’s that bad.”

The Eagles listed two players under DID NOT PARTICIPATE: Landon Dickerson and Brett Toth.

The Eagles have commonly rested Dickerson on Thursdays since he’s been playing through injury all year long. He’ll be ready to start at left guard on Sunday.

While Toth did not practice, he was seen watching the action from the sideline. This development points to him progressing through the concussion protocol, though it still seems like he’s on track to miss Sunday’s game. He could be ready to suit up for the Divisional Round next week, if applicable.

The Eagles listed four players under LIMITED PARTICIPATION: Lane Johnson, Jalen Carter, Dallas Goedert, and Grant Calcaterra.

Johnson, Carter, and Goedert were limited for the second day in a row.

Johnson seemed to be moving well during the media-attended portion of practice. It seems like he’s going to suit up on Sunday. We’ll find out more about his playing status on Friday’s final injury report.

The thinking here is that the Eagles are managing Carter and Goedert to help get them to Sunday.

Calcaterra was upgraded from DNP on Wednesday to limited on Thursday. Eagles fans aren’t exactly dying to see him play but he might be out there as the No. 2 tight end.

The Eagles listed four players under FULL PARTICIPATION: Nakobe Dean, Marcus Epps, Jaelan Phillips, and Azeez Ojulari.

Dean and Epps were upgraded from limited on Wednesday to full go on Thursday. They’re ready to play, which is good news.

Phillips and Ojulari were full go for the second day in a row. Phillips will start and Ojulari will likely remain on injured reserve for now.

SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS INJURY REPORT (THURSDAY)

The 49ers have three changes from their Wednesday injury report:

Christian McCaffrey was upgraded to full participation after resting on Wednesday.

Trent Williams was upgraded to limited after missing Wednesday’s practice due to his hamstring injury.

Luke Gifford was downgraded to not practicing after being limited on Wednesday.

Williams practicing is obviously the big development for the Niners. Guessing the 37-year-old is going to try to play through his hamstring injury. If he does suit up, we’ll see if he can make it through the game. Always risk of a hammy flaring back up.

Gifford’s absence points to the 49ers being down to Eric Kendricks and Garret Wallow starting at off-ball linebacker. Those two players have combined for 90 defensive snaps played for San Francisco this season. So, yeah, the 49ers are really thin at linebacker.

In other news, second-year wide receiver Ricky Pearsal didn’t practice for the second day in a row. He’s on track to miss Sunday’s game, which is bad news for the 49ers’ offense. Pearsal is their best big play threat at receiver.

We’ll find out more about the 49ers’ injury situation when they issue their final injury report on Friday afternoon. It’ll also be worth paying attention to any roster moves they may or may not make prior to Saturday’s 4:00 PM deadline.

Looking into my crystal ball, I give you the slate of winners for the 2025 season.

Most Valuable Player: Drake Maye, QB, New England Patriots

Back in training camp we were wondering if Matthew Stafford’s back would allow him to make it through the first month of the season. Now, here the 37-year-old stands, the NFL’s leader in passing yards (4,707) and touchdowns (46) while directing the top-rated Los Angeles Rams offense and a team that ranks among the favorites to win the Super Bowl. Any other year, Stafford would be a slam dunk for MVP. And yet, there is another.

Maye took a massive leap forward in Year 2 and has served as the catalyst for the Patriots’ surprising success. Passing for 4,394 yards, 31 touchdowns and just eight interceptions, Maye registered some big-time performances down the stretch to help New England earn the AFC’s No. 2 seed. He’s also used his legs to buy time and escape pressure behind a shaky offensive line and has run for 450 yards and four touchdowns.

Josh Allen also has delivered another MVP-worthy season while leading a Buffalo Bills team that offers probably the weakest supporting cast he has had in years. But Maye’s season has been pretty special.

Offensive Player of the Year: Christian McCaffrey, RB, San Francisco 49ers

The Seattle Seahawks’ third-year wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba delivered one of the most dominant single-season performances in NFL history. His 1,793 receiving yards (on 119 catches and 10 touchdowns) rank eighth on the all-time list. The Rams’ Puka Nacua’s 129-catch (league-high), 1,715-yard, 10-touchdown season makes him worthy of consideration as well. And the Atlanta Falcons’ Bijan Robinson delivered one of the most dynamic and well-rounded campaigns with 1,478 rushing yards and seven touchdowns on 287 carries and 820 receiving yards and four touchdowns on 79 catches.

But McCaffrey truthfully is deserving of MVP honors given the way his production (1,202 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns and 102 receptions for 924 yards and seven touchdowns) kept the 49ers afloat despite two different injury-induced absences to quarterback Brock Purdy, a six-game absence for tight end George Kittle, Ricky Pearsall’s eight games missed to injury and an entire season missed by Brandon Aiyuk. McCaffrey’s 413 touches led the NFL, as did his total touchdowns.

Defensive Player of the Year: Myles Garrett, DE, Cleveland Browns

Garrett ranks among the most unstoppable forces the league has ever seen. After averaging 12.8 sacks per season and recording 14 in both 2024 and 2023, Garrett turned in his most impressive season yet, setting the single-season sack record with 23. New York Giants linebacker Brian Burns turned in a stellar season with 16.5 sacks and 67 tackles. And Houston Texans defensive end Danielle Hunter also impressed with 15 sacks and 54 tackles. But the gap between Garrett and the pack is significant.

Offensive Rookie of the Year: Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Carolina Panthers

The Arizona product is a truly polished young player who quickly developed into the go-to guy for Bryce Young and just got better as the season progressed, finishing the year with 70 catches for 1,014 yards and seven touchdowns. His yardage set a Carolina rookie receiving record. For much of the year, it seemed as if McMillan and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Emeka Egbuka were in a neck-and-neck race for the top rookie honor, but McMillan pulled away to top his counterpart’s 63 catches for 938 yards and five touchdowns.

New Orleans Saints quarterback Tyler Shough also made a strong push for the award, completing 67.6 percent of his passes for 2,384 yards, 10 touchdowns and 6 interceptions and winning four of his last five games.

Defensive Rookie of the Year: Carson Schwesinger, LB, Cleveland Browns

The second-round pick out of UCLA turned in a rookie season that saw him record 156 tackles (sixth-most in the NFL), 2.5 sacks and two interceptions while helping anchor Cleveland’s top-five defense. Schwesinger faced competition from Atlanta safety Xavier Watts (five interceptions, 96 tackles) and Philadelphia linebacker Jihaad Campbell (80 tackles, a forced fumble and an interception), but Schwesinger’s impact has been undeniable.

Comeback Player of the Year: Dak Prescott, QB, Dallas Cowboys

Sidelined for the second half of last season by a right hamstring tear that required surgery to reattach the tendon to the bone, Prescott thundered back by throwing for 4,552 yards, 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions while completing a league-high 404 passes. The Cowboys boasted the second-most prolific offense in the league. If not for the lack of support that he received from Dallas’ porous defense, Prescott very well could have led his team on a playoff run.

McCaffrey — limited to four games in 2024 by Achilles tendon and knee injuries — is another strong candidate after playing all 17 games and producing at such a prolific rate this season. Also worthy of the honor: the Detroit Lions’ Aidan Hutchinson, who recovered from a broken leg to record 14.5 sacks (fourth-most) while playing all 17 games this season.

Most Improved Player of the Year: Trevor Lawrence, QB, Jacksonville Jaguars

After battling significant inconsistencies the last several seasons and seeing another challenging campaign (2024) end after 10 games because of a shoulder injury, Lawrence entered this season with loads of questions about whether he could ever live up to the billing of a true franchise quarterback. But Lawrence’s first season under Liam Coen has translated into immense growth. The quarterback ranked sixth in the NFL with 4,007 passing yards while completing 60.9 percent of his passes for 29 touchdowns and 12 interceptions and posting his best passer rating (91.0) in four seasons. Lawrence also rushed for a career-high nine touchdowns.

Coach of the Year: Mike Vrabel, New England Patriots

He took a listless team that had deteriorated on Bill Belichick’s watch and continued its spiral in one season under Jerod Mayo, and in one season’s time, Vrabel has elevated the quarterback, gotten the defense right and has quickly restored the Patriots to one of the leading teams in the league. The Patriots boast the third-best offense, a top-10 defense and an impactful special teams unit and now appear to have as legitimate a shot at contending for a Super Bowl as anyone.

The competition was thick this year. The 49ers’ Kyle Shanahan easily could have taken this honor home after keeping his team afloat despite a swarm of injuries that would have wrecked any other organization. Ben Johnson took the Chicago Bears’ job last winter and now has Caleb Williams playing like a franchise quarterback as Chicago won its first division title in seven seasons. Coen took a 4-13 Jaguars team and pulled off a turnaround that saw them post a 13-4 record and win the AFC South after closing the season on an eight-game winning streak, winning those games by an average of 19.1 points per game.

Assistant Coach of the Year: Klint Kubiak, OC, Seattle Seahawks

Plenty of assistant coaches have delivered impressive results this season. In Denver, Vance Joseph directs a championship-caliber defense. Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniel took Maye to another level and has masked the deficiencies of a subpar offensive line to direct a top-five offense. In Los Angeles, DC Chris Shula’s Rams defense also appears capable of leading a Super Bowl march.

But Seattle offensive play-caller Klint Kubiak may have delivered the most impressive and surprising body of work in his first season with the Seahawks. From helping Sam Darnold further elevate his game, to turning Smith-Njigba into one of the most dangerous weapons in the league and giving Seattle an offense capable of perfectly capitalizing on the opportunities provided by a championship-caliber defense, Kubiak takes the cake.

Executive of the Year: John Schneider, GM, Seattle Seahawks

Schneider has repeatedly positioned the Seahawks for success, building a Super Bowl champion in the 2013 season, revamping the team once that window closed and now elevating the franchise to a 14-3 record this season and the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. A year after getting the head coaching hire right with Mike Macdonald, Schneider made what looked like big gambles, moving on from DK Metcalf and Geno Smith, and he continued rolling the dice by signing Darnold.

Each move wound up being right, and Schneider and the Seahawks have been rewarded. Robust draft classes have produced key contributors all over the roster, and trades and free agent signings have further fortified this team. Now, Seattle heads into the postseason with the No. 1 seed in the NFC and looks every bit the part of a Super Bowl contender.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/07193205/GettyImages-2246101162-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-08 19:02:14.605019

Last year, the club utilized the franchise tag and signed Tee Higgins to a long-term deal. This year, Trey Hendrickson hits the open market after a contentious year battling the organization for a long-term contract and battling a lingering injury.

Beyond Hendrickson’s situation as the headliner, the Bengals boast 15 unrestricted free agents and one restricted.

The Bengals currently project to have $69 million in cap space for 2026, ranking eighth in effective cap space entering the offseason, according to Over The Cap.

There’s also a small list of potential cap cuts that could add another $5 million to $15 million to the available total. Look for more discussion of those players in the near future.

For now, here’s a look at the Bengals’ free-agent class this offseason with analysis and what I’ve gathered on whether they’re expected to return or sign elsewhere. There’s always a surprise return or two each offseason, but this should provide a solid ballpark of where Cincinnati is headed with its free agents.

Starting level decisions

Trey Hendrickson

Position: Edge rusher

Age (start of camp): 31

Career cash: $97.2M

Last deal: One year, $29M extension

Status: Unrestricted free agent (UFA)

Key stat: Over his last four seasons, Hendrickson posted a pressure percentage of at least 17 percent, in the top 10 among NFL defensive linemen each year. Dating back to 2019, no defensive lineman age 31 or older has posted a pressure percentage higher than 17.1, according to TruMedia.

Where it stands: Hendrickson had core muscle surgery in December and is expected to be fully healthy by the start of free agency. At long last, he can hit the open market outside the constraints of the Bengals. The only way that changes is if they apply a franchise tag with the idea of trading him to receive better (or earlier) draft compensation. Zac Taylor was asked about there being a path to Hendrickson coming back this week and said, “There’s always a path.” He said that because he had to, because there is no path here. It’s actually kind of funny envisioning what the real-life version of that path would be. My best answer would be to Google the Darien Gap. Bridges have been set on fire here, so there’s no realistic return to Cincinnati for 2026 in the plans. When they let him walk, the team would likely receive a 2027 third-round compensatory pick.

Chance of return: 1 percent

Joseph Ossai

Position: Edge rusher

Age (start of camp): 26

Career cash: $11.4M

Last deal: One year, $6.5M

Status: UFA

Key stat: Out of 59 qualifying edge rushers this season, Ossai ranked 50th in true pass set win rate, a highly predictive stat to future success. His overall productivity (five sacks and 29 pressures) offers a rosier view. But there’s still not an overwhelming indication of a larger breakout incoming.

Where it stands: Ossai is still young, and the last two years have been the best of his career. Somebody will be interested. There’s valuable production and a league desperate for it. His injury history raises a red flag after taking a prove-it deal last year, but it feels like somebody will be willing to give Ossai multiple years and $10 million per year, given his age and production. The more important aspect for Cincinnati is that Ossai doesn’t feel like a piece that fits where they are in the defensive line rebuild. Murphy and Shemar Stewart both fit in the mold of a second pass rusher at this point. They could use a No. 1, or someone with a higher chance of becoming one. Ossai isn’t that, so that money probably goes elsewhere. A return to the Bengals feels unlikely, but the door will always be open for a surprise.

Chance of return: 20 percent

Geno Stone

Position: Safety

Age (start of camp): 27

Career cash: $16.7M

Last deal: Two years, $14M, then accepting a pay cut to $4.9M in 2025

Status: UFA

Key stat: Stone ranked 61st out of 66 qualifying safeties this year in missed tackle rate (18.5%). This after also ranking 61st out of 66 safeties in 2024 (17.7%).

Where it stands: Coaches have consistently given Stone credit for work off the field, communication, and aligning the defense properly during games. All that’s fine, but the inability to take proper angles and make tackles has been a centerpiece of the Bengals’ defensive ineptitude the last two years. That’s not all Stone’s fault. Poor play from the line and linebackers has forced him to come up and make too many tackles in space, already not his strength. Coming from Baltimore and signing in Cincinnati, Stone was a third safety. He’s largely played like a third safety for the Bengals, who forced him to take a pay cut and stay the starter this past offseason. Stone’s market won’t be much, which leaves open the possibility he returns in a cheap, reserve role as a player with experience and knowledge in the system. Even that requires squinting to see happen.

Chance of return: 15 percent

Cam Taylor-Britt

Position: Cornerback

Age (start of camp): 26

Career cash: $8.1M

Last deal: Rookie contract

Status: UFA

Key stat: Taylor-Britt only managed two starts this season. He was made a healthy scratch for the Week 7 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers after moving in and out of the cornerback rotation throughout the last two years. He was benched by both coordinators he played for, Lou Anarumo and Al Golden.

Where it stands: Taylor-Britt went on injured reserve after going down in Week 11 with a Lisfranc injury to his foot. He says he is expected to be healthy for next season, but participation in an offseason program would be in jeopardy. He is also spending five days in jail this week for a charge of reckless driving and driving without a license that occurred last year. That’s a fitting end to an up-and-down four seasons in Cincinnati. There was a point where Taylor-Britt was on a Pro Bowl track, but he could never find consistency to stay reliable on or off the field. That was maddening for both defensive staffs. The organization gave him time to find maturity and settle in. It just never came. He was playing better football following his healthy scratch, which he dubbed a “wake-up” call, but how does that project in the long run? He’s open to a change of scenery, but wasn’t closing the door on a return. If he did come back, it would be in a reserve role behind starters DJ Turner and Dax Hill, now entrenched as pieces to build around on the outside. He’s willing to play in the slot, but he’s probably best suited to start fresh elsewhere.

Chance of return: 20 percent

Noah Fant

Position: Tight end

Age (start of camp): 28

Career cash: $34.1M

Last deal: $2.8M

Status: UFA

Key stat: Fant had three fumbles returned for touchdowns — the most by a non-quarterback for Cincinnati in a single season. The Bengals allowed nine return touchdowns this year, tying the most in franchise history. There will be an offseason focus on cutting that number, and those three plays will be hard to get past inside the building.

Where it stands: The Bengals turn over tight ends every year. They are also still stocked in the room. Drew Sample and Mike Gesicki are both under contract. Plus, 2024 fourth-round pick Erick All missed all of this past season trying to recover from multiple ACL surgeries, so there’s also hope he could fill the gap after the Bengals staff fell in love with his game as a rookie. Fant never developed into what they hoped this past season, so this seems like an easy parting of ways.

Chance of return: 10 percent

Dalton Risner

Position: Guard

Age (start of camp): 31

Career cash: $14.8M

Last deal: $1.2M

Status: UFA

Key stat: Risner said he thought he played the best football of his career, and Pro Football Focus agreed. Not only did he earn the highest individual PFF grade of his seven-year career during his first season with the Bengals, but his raw pass-blocking efficiency numbers were also career-bests. He protected for 261 true pass sets this season, allowing one sack and just three quarterback hits, via PFF.

Where it stands: Everyone seems to want Risner back, and they aren’t afraid to say it. Ted Karras and Amarius Mims made impassioned pleas in recent weeks. Zac Taylor spoke about how well he’s meshed into that room. Risner admitted a desire to return and get a deal done before free agency begins in March. He’s made a habit of waiting out the market in recent seasons, and that’s part of what caused him to still be on the street when the Bengals signed him in August. Will the Bengals, who often devalue the guard position, be able to find the common ground on what he’s worth before another team plucks him away? That’s the biggest question, but there’s an obvious desire on all sides to make a return happen.

Chance of return: 75 percent

Tanner Hudson

Position: Tight end

Age (start of camp): 31

Career cash: $6.3M

Last deal: $1.3M

Status: UFA

Key stat: Over the last three seasons, Hudson owns the fourth most completions from Joe Burrow on third down. Not only that, but he specializes in working underneath against zone coverage. TruMedia has Hudson leading the team in success percentage per route against zone coverage over the last three years (17.7%). That’s higher than Ja’Marr Chase, Mike Gesicki or anyone else. As much as teams play zone and turn attention to the other receivers, there’s a sweet spot for Hudson’s skill set that meshes well with Burrow.

Where it stands: Hard to imagine Hudson wanting to play anywhere else or being valued more than he is in Cincinnati. Feels like an easy deal to get done even before free agency gets underway in a similar range as last year’s deal, perhaps with a bump in pay.

Chance of return: 90 percent

Joe Flacco

Position: Quarterback

Age (start of camp): 41

Career cash: $185.5M

Last deal: One year, $4.3M

Status: UFA

Key stat: During the six games Flacco started for the Bengals, Cincinnati ranked fifth in the NFL in points per drive at 2.44. That would rank in the top 10 of the NFL across the entire season. Flacco enjoyed one of the best stretches of his career statistically. He posted 0.04 EPA per dropback during his time with the Bengals this season.

Where it stands: Flacco doesn’t want to retire. He wants to play again next year. The question surrounds his options. He discussed the ability to be “selective” on Monday. There’s a good chance somebody views Flacco as a bridge quarterback for a young pick. He proved he can show up and perform like a total pro the moment he walks into a building. He made fans of everyone in Cincinnati — players, coaches and staff alike — for how his time went. The Bengals would love to have him back. Flacco did not discount the idea. There’s also the thought he could hang out with his family and, if an injury occurred, pick up the phone to come play. The Bengals will need to figure out a backup quarterback, but Flacco’s situation is so unique that it’s hard to know exactly where he lands. It does sound unlikely he signs in March to be Burrow’s backup, though. Any return would be a circumstantial waiting game.

Chance of return: 33 percent

Reserve level free agents

QB Jake Browning

Where it stands: There’s not much coming back from what went wrong with Browning during his three-game stretch as a starter this season. It made sense to prioritize him as a backup because the team had confidence he could do the job after what happened in 2023 when he kept the Bengals relevant following Burrow’s wrist injury. For similar reasons, it’s hard to see a path ahead here because of how poorly things went this time. Browning will have options because teams everywhere are searching for quarterbacks with quality experience. He’s shown that. Doubt that happens in Cincinnati, despite being almost universally liked internally.

Chance of return: 8 percent

G Cordell Volson

Where it stands: Volson missed the season with a shoulder injury sustained in August. Offensive line coach Scott Peters was excited to work with Volson, but it never came to fruition. It’s not impossible Volson returns to Cincinnati to compete for a backup role. His knowledge of the system, Peters and his teammates could help. It’s more likely he finds a change of scenery to compete.

Chance of return: 40 percent

CB Jalen Davis

Where it stands: Davis spent the first half of the season on the practice squad. Once he entered the lineup as the starting nickel inside Dax Hill and DJ Turner, the back end (and defense as a whole) stabilized. There’s a reason Davis was on the practice squad. His physical skills aren’t on the same level as others at the position, but his knowledge of the game and awareness popped off the tape down the stretch. His leadership was noted by staffers even before his promotion. They will want him back, and there’s no reason to believe Davis leaves in what should be an easy deal to get done.

Chance of return: 90 percent

S Tycen Anderson

Where it stands: A four-year special teams ace, there will be a push to keep him around. There’s clearly little trust he could play safety, considering he was never elevated over Stone this year, but he’d seem the ideal fourth safety to play if needed and dominate on special teams. His impact is limited slightly under the new rules with less need for speed on the dynamic kickoff, and there’s less punting in the NFL than ever. That said, he’s a solid piece. There will be interest in bringing him back. Keep an eye out for a team looking to make a big impact on special teams to potentially swoop in here, though. Reminiscent of Clayton Fejedelem and Cethan Carter in the recent past.

Chance of return: 55 percent

CB Marco Wilson

Where it stands: Wilson has fans in the building, hence his return last year. He could come back and be thrust into a competition, but more than likely, the Bengals will be looking to upgrade the depth here. He won’t be a priority, but could come back for the league minimum.

Chance of return: 50 percent

OG Lucas Patrick

Where it stands: With so much talk about the chemistry of the offensive line becoming a strength, Patrick figures into that mix as well. The 10-year veteran never ended up assuming the starting role that landed in the lap of Jalen Rivers and then was assumed by Risner. That doesn’t take away from the value he brings. Not only would he provide depth at guard, but he also serves as backup center to Karras — a spot where they currently have no realistic solution with little momentum behind 2024 seventh-rounder Matt Lee. This would be a league-minimum type of agreement.

Chance of return: 47 percent

LB Brian Asamoah

Where it stands: He joined the team in late October after being released by the Raiders, and the 26-year-old opened eyes on special teams. He could certainly return for camp and see if he can latch on in the back of the linebacker group.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/07163728/GettyImages-2243666298-scaled-e1767821880909.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-08 21:59:18.956325

Packers coach Matt LaFleur said it’s due to the field conditions being better than on their practice field.

Zach Tom injury update

Packers right tackle Zach Tom didn’t participate in the Jan. 8 practice.

LaFleur said during his pre-practice news conference that it’s a rest day. Tom missed the past three games of the regular season after exiting the Broncos game Dec. 14 with knee and back injuries. LaFleur said earlier this week that he expects Tom to be available for the wild-card matchup against the Bears.

“He’s looked good in practice,” LaFleur said Jan. 8. “But we’ll see. Like I tell you all the time, we’ll give him up to game time. If he can go, he’ll be out there.”

Packers receiver Dontayvion Wicks is still in the concussion protocol, per LaFleur.

Here are the notable injury updates and the injury reports for each of the six playoff teams this weekend.

Bears WR Rome Odunze back for Packers game

Caleb Williams will get a weapon back for his first NFL playoff game, with Rome Odunze off the injury list and ready to return. The second-year wide receiver has been out since Week 13 with a foot injury.

“I’m planning on playing,” Odunze said Wednesday. “But I’ve been planning on playing for weeks.”

Odunze was the Bears' leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown receptions when he exited the lineup. He said Wednesday his stamina isn't fully back yet, but he's confident he can help.

""As long as I have the option to be out there and contribute, I’m going to give it my all,"" Odunze said. ""I believe I can make a difference.”

Cornerback Kyler Gordon is also expected to play against the Green Bay Packers after missing the final five regular-season games with a groin issue. He is currently listed as ""questionable.""

""He looked good yesterday. We'll see what it looks like again today both him and Rome, you know,"" said head coach Ben Johnson. ""It's good to have them both back out there. They're excited. They're moving around well and we'll see if they can help us out this weekend.""

49ers get LT Trent Williams back at practice

San Francisco 49ers left tackle Trent Williams was seen in uniform at the start of Thursday's practice. The All-Pro sat out Wednesday as he's been dealing with a hamstring injury suffered in Week 17.

Williams usually rests on the first day of practice during a game week, but head coach Kyle Shanahan clarified this wasn't the case.

""No, he's still hurt,"" Shanahan said Wednesday. ""Hopefully, he'll be better and can get something in tomorrow, but I'm not sure where he'll be at tomorrow yet.""

Receiver Ricky Pearsall was also spotted, seen on a side field but in uniform. Shanahan said Wednesday that Pearsall aggravated the PCL injury that has limited him this season during Week 17.

Bills K Matt Prater (right quad) practices Thursday

Matt Prater did not practice on Wednesday, but the Buffalo Bills kicker was a full participant on Thursday after injuring his right quad against the New York Jets in Week 18.

Matthew Wright, who played four games this season with the Houston Texans, Washington Commanders and Tennessee Titans, was signed to the practice squad in case Prater cannot kick.

The 41-year-old Prater was 18-for-20 on field goal attempts and 46-for-49 on extra points during the regular season. He has not missed a field goal since Week 9 against the Kansas City Chiefs.

The Miami Dolphins fired their head coach after four seasons, the team announced on Thursday.

McDaniel ends his tenure with a 35-33 record and two playoff appearances in four seasons as head coach.

""After careful evaluation and extensive discussions since the season ended, I have made the decision that our organization is in need of comprehensive change. I informed Mike McDaniel this morning that he has been relieved of his duties as head coach,"" Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a statement. ""I love Mike and want to thank him for his hard work, commitment, and the energy he brought to our organization. Mike is an incredibly creative football mind whose passion for the game and his players was evident every day. I wish him and his family the best moving forward.""

The 2025 season began as the worst for the Dolphins since McDaniel's arrival. The team started 0-3 and picked up its first win of the year against the New York Jets on Monday Night Football in Week 4, a game in which it lost star receiver Tyreek Hill for the season with a devastating knee injury.

From there, the team blew late leads in back-to-back defeats against the Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Chargers. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa called out the Dolphins' ""leadership"" following their Week 6 loss to the Chargers, saying some players had been late or skipped meetings in prior weeks.

Following Tagovailoa's comments, the Dolphins traveled to Cleveland and got demolished 31-6 by the previously 1-5 Browns. However, they followed that up with a four-game winning streak in Weeks 10-14 before ultimately losing three of four games to finish out 7-10.

The Dolphins hired McDaniel in February 2022 to replace former head coach Brian Flores. McDaniel had spent one year as offensive coordinator with the San Francisco 49ers before making the leap to a head coaching position.

The hiring of McDaniel in 2022 coincided with the Dolphins' trade for Hill, and both aided Tagovailoa in getting the team to the playoffs at 9-8, the same record it had with Flores in 2021. The team fell 34-31 against the Buffalo Bills in the wild card round, which featured rookie Skylar Thompson at quarterback in place of Tagovailoa, who was in the NFL's concussion protocol.

McDaniel helped guide the Dolphins to an 11-6 record and another playoff berth in 2023, but their season ended in another wild card flameout, this time against the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs in frigid Kansas City.

The team went 6-5 in Tagovailoa's 11 starts in 2024, but the team went just 2-4 in games he missed and failed to make the playoffs at 8-9.

Looking to the Dolphins' future, Tagovailoa signed a franchise-record four-year, $212.4 million contract in July 2024. He has $54 million in guaranteed money and a $99.2 million dead cap hit for 2026, but he does not have any guaranteed money in his deal after next season. On March 15, $3 million of his 2027 salary becomes guaranteed, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.

On top of McDaniel's exit, the Dolphins also have a vacancy at general manager after they parted ways with Chris Grier midseason.

Many of the names, however, have not changed for the 49ers. Neither has much of the bitterness judging from the last two meetings.

The first came in the NFC Championship game in January 2023. Back then, 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, that year's Mr. Irrelevant in the NFL draft, was completing his rookie season going from third string to starter after injuries to Jimmy Garoppolo and Trey Lance, the No. 3 pick in 2021.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

Yet the Eagles knocked Purdy out of the game early with an elbow injury. Then his backup, Josh Johnson (remember him from last week leading the Commanders past the Eagles?) left with a concussion. Purdy tried coming back in the game, but was unable to throw. And the 49ers took some snaps with Christian McCaffrey as the quarterback.

It added up to a 31-7 Eagles demolition that put them in the Super Bowl.

The following season, the Eagles came into their Dec. 3, 2023, matchup with the 49ers with a 10-1 record, seemingly poised to make it back to the Super Bowl. And they took a 6-0 lead after the first quarter.

That's when Purdy got going, leading the 49ers to a 42-19 win.

During that game, Eagles chief of security Dom DiSandro was banished from the sideline after a skirmish between the two teams. DiSandro shoved 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw after he threw down Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith after a catch on the sideline.

That also started the Eagles' 1-6 collapse to end the 2023 season.

So here the two teams are again, facing each other in the playoffs. The Eagles still have Purdy, McCaffrey and star tight end George Kittle to worry about.

But the 49ers will look much differently on defense. Star edge rusher Nick Bosa and linebacker Fred Warner are out with injuries. And Warner's replacement, Tatum Bethune, was lost for the season after an injury last week against the Seahawks. Fellow linebacker Dee Winters, also injured against the Seahawks, might not play either.

Then again, the Eagles' offense hasn't exactly been a juggernaut this season. And the Eagles defense will have their hands full against the 49ers offense, especially if left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall are able to return from injury.

""There are a lot of familiar faces,"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. ""There are a bunch of guys that are really good players. This is why they’re still playing.""

Added Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who coincidentally had the same role with the 49ers a decade ago: ""Everything they do is with a purpose and they do a really good job of it. Obviously, Purdy operates it very well, McCaffrey's an elite back. They got a good group of receivers (and) Kittle at tight end.""

Martin Frank

Here comes the referendum on offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. If the Eagles can't outscore a 49ers' defense reeling from injuries, well, it's hard to see Patullo coming back next season. And really, the Eagles should have all of the advantages on offense: They're rested, healthy, at home, and seemingly ready to unleash QB Jalen Hurts and RB Saquon Barkley. Still, it's the Eagles' defense that will make the difference − again.

The pick: Eagles 30, 49ers 17

Greg Giesen

The 49ers' defense gave up 38 points to the Bears, 27 to Phillip Rivers and the Colts and 24 to the lowly Titans. I have no faith in San Francisco being able to stop the Eagles' offense. The only question is if the Eagles will ease up if they get a big lead. Thankfully, the game will be close.

The pick: Eagles 31, 49ers 20

Kevin Tresolini

Three years after their ill-fated NFC title game trip to Philly, the 49ers return for a wild-card round encounter in which the hosts are poised to again send them home hurting and humbled. The well-rested and big-play-capable Saquon Barkley could have a successful day against a San Francisco defense that has struggled to stop the run. The Eagles' defense has been too unyielding of late to underestimate and should be rarin' to rumble after a week watching.

The pick: Eagles 20, 49ers 16

Tom Rimback

How's this for a take that could cause me to lose my NFL pundit credentials? Kyle Shanahan is the most overrated offensive mind in the National Football League. Yeah, the Eagles squandered a shot at getting the No. 2 seed. Not great. All the great Shanahan did was score three points with the top seed and a bye on the line − at home. Three points!

The pick: Eagles 40, 49ers 6

Michelle Ganassi

Could this be the year I get my all-Pennsylvania Super Bowl? As a proud member of the Yinzer nation, I need to point out that Tomlin has not lost a Monday night game at Heinz Field (yes, I know that is not the name). But I digress. The Eagles have a tough matchup against the 49ers. But I think the 49ers' injuries, coupled with the Eagles' defense, will help them squeeze out another win at home.

The pick: Eagles 14, 49ers 7

Brad Myers

Remember the last time the 49ers played a playoff game in Philadelphia? It will be a little tougher for the Eagles this time because San Francisco will have a quarterback. But the Birds still win.

The pick: Eagles 17, 49ers 16

Tom Moore

This is another toss-up game for the Birds, whose defense must continue excelling to advance in the playoffs.

The pick: Eagles 20, 49ers 17

Tom McGurk

If 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy doesn't experience nightmares about facing the Birds' defense leading up to the game, he'll surely have them on the long flight back to San Francisco. The Eagles will set the tone with their defense and post a big sack total. And don't be surprised if the Birds get another home game next week.

The pick: Eagles 27, 49ers 12

Bob Jordan

Jalen Hurts hasn't thrown a pass in a game since Dec. 28. Not saying his first pass is going right to a 49er, but Bill Belichick never liked resting his starters in New England before the playoffs, once saying, ""It’s tough to go to your team and say, ‘Well, we’re not gonna play you guys over here, but the rest of you get out there. We don’t really care about you. If you get hurt, that doesn’t matter, but these six or seven guys we’re going to protect.’""

The pick: 49ers 20, Eagles 17

Bert Bainbridge

Simply put: The 49ers won't be able to overcome all of their injuries, especially on the defensive side of the ball, as the Birds cruise to the second round in their title defense.

The pick: Eagles 31, 49ers 17

Brandon Holveck

The Eagles force at least one turnover, giving Nick Sirianni's offense a short field for one of its two scores as Vic Fangio's defense swallows the limping 49ers.

The pick: Eagles 14, 49ers 10

Tom Haines

Counting on the Eagles defense to not only stifle the Niners high-powered offense, but to create some turnovers, giving the Birds' anemic offense some short-field opportunities.

The pick: Eagles 23, 49ers 20

Campbell missed four games with a knee injury before returning in Week 18. The rookie offensive tackle played 45 snaps in Sunday’s 38-10 win over the Miami Dolphins, putting him on track to play in New England’s first-round postseason showdown against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Campbell discussed his time away from the team with Alex Francisco on “Patriots Unfiltered.”

“It was terrible,” Campbell said. “The first time I ever missed games in my life, so watching from the sideline is not fun.”

However, the 22-year-old is relieved that he didn’t sustain a more significant injury that cost him the playoffs. Campbell initially feared a bad diagnosis after exiting New England’s Week 12 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.

“Whenever I first went down, the first thing I thought about was that I was down for the year,” Campbell said. “I automatically thought the worst when they started grabbing at my knee. No matter how long I had to sit out, I was just grateful and thankful that I was able to come back at some point.

“That makes you not take anything for granted, especially when the game’s never been taken away from you before. When it happens, you kind of don’t know what to do with yourself for a little bit. But I’m just glad to be back.”

Drake Maye and the Patriots are also glad to have Campbell back in the fold. The No. 4 pick began his NFL career by grading 32nd among eligible tackles on Pro Football Focus, allowing five quarterback hits and sacks in 782 snaps.

""So hopefully, returning him to the fold we get the benefits of all the things that I've just discussed.","The Steelers began their preparation for Monday night's Wild Card game against the Houston Texans, practicing at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.

The Steelers start the week a healthy group, with no major injuries coming out of last week's win over the Baltimore Ravens.

""In-game, we got some bumps and bruises associated with play that may limit some people at the early portions of week,"" said Coach Mike Tomlin. ""Thankfully we came out of it relatively well.""

One player who did miss practice on Thursday was running back Jaylen Warren, who is dealing with an illness.

Players who returned to the field last week, including linebacker T.J. Watt and receiver Calvin Austin III, among others, came out of the game without any issues.

""Everyone that returned to action last week from T.J. to Isaac Seumalo to Calvin Austin, James Pierre, Brandin Echols all were able to participate without any steps backwards,"" said Tomlin. ""So, thankful for that.

""Relatively healthy group as we lean in on a single elimination tournament.""

While he didn't miss the last two games because of an injury, the Steelers will get one of their key offensive weapons back on Monday night with the return of receiver DK Metcalf after he missed the last two games due to his suspension.

""Certainly, awesome to have DK back,"" said Tomlin. ""We're not going to exhale and think that DK automatically with his presence is going to be a difference or the difference.

""Football is the ultimate team game. It's going to require great effort from all parties involved, but certainly excited about doing it with him.

""I know that he's happy to be back. He's happy to be in this tournament. He's ready to go to work.""

In Metcalf's absence, Tomlin did see others step up and take advantages of opportunities, which will help the team moving forward.

""I think sometimes when you're lacking significant players it's opportunities for others to show what they're capable of and to accelerate growth and development and cohesion in other areas,"" said Tomlin. ""Adam Thielen for example is a new acquisition for us and he made some significant plays for us in recent weeks, and that cohesion has probably been accelerated.

""Scotty Miller is a guy that's always ready to make plays for us. He is not always given an opportunity, but certainly in the two years he's been here he's been a credible play maker when called upon. He's displayed some of that in some significant moments over the last several weeks as well.

""Our running backs have been a major component of our pass game in recent weeks. Maybe not down the field, but their ability to turn short into longer has bridged a gap for us in a lot of ways.

""I think we lead the league in yards after catch as a collective for the season. I think the running backs are central to that.

""And I think we all grow as strategists. I think as a collective, a coaching staff, when you're faced with adversity, it's important that you pivot.

""There is an expiration date on adjustments and certainly we had to make some adjustments. We felt the effects of it in Cleveland. It was reasonable to expect us all to be better. The players themselves, us as strategists, and I think we displayed that.

""So hopefully, returning him to the fold we get the benefits of all the things that I've just discussed. Our adaptability, the growth of individuals, the growth of continuity in new individuals, and you couple that with his presence, hopefully we are all continually collectively better.

Odunze has been dealing with a stress fracture in his foot since late October. His final action of the regular season came in Week 13 when the Bears beat the Eagles 24-15 and Odunze logged two catches for 8 yards.

After being ruled out against the Packers the following week, Odunze attempted to return against the Cleveland Browns but suffered a setback with his injury during pregame warmups that led to him being a late scratch. The Bears then shut Odunze down for the remainder of the regular season.

""I know he wants to be out there and helping,"" Bears coach Ben Johnson said Dec. 7. ""It's hard to tell him no sometimes. He just wants to be out on the field competing and contributing and helping our team win. So there may be a case where we have to protect him from himself a little bit and just make sure we get him right and he'll be able to help us down the road.""

Offensive coordinator Declan Doyle intimated that Odunze could have a smaller role than normal Saturday night. Odunze admitted that he is not in ""peak shape"" right now but said he has worked to keep his conditioning level where it needs to be.

""There might be some limitations; those are still to be discussed,"" Odunze said. ""For me, I'm looking to be out there as much as possible. Make as many plays as I can. At the end of the day, it's all or nothing for this game to make it to the Super Bowl until the end of the season. I want to contribute as much as possible and put everything that I have out there on the field. That's my mentality. Obviously the trainers and everybody has the scientific and the correct way of going about things. I respect those [opinions] too. It's going to be a little bit of clash at hand because of those things.""

Wide receivers DJ Moore (knee) and Jahdae Walker (illness), left tackle Ozzy Trapilo (quad), and cornerbacks Nick McCloud (illness) and Jaylon Jones (ankle) do not have injury designations for Saturday's game. Cornerback Kyler Gordon (groin) and offensive tackle Braxton Jones (knee) were full participants during Thursday's practice and await being activated off injured reserve. Both are listed as questionable.

The Packers, meanwhile, listed six players as questionable, including starting right tackle Zach Tom (back/knee), defensive back Javon Bullard (knee) and backup quarterback Malik Willis (right shoulder/hamstring).

After practicing on Tuesday and Wednesday, Tom did not practice on Thursday. Coach Matt LaFleur said they were giving him the day off from practice.

""He's looked good in practice,"" LaFleur said of Tom. ""Like I tell you all the time, we'll give him up 'til gametime, and if he can go, he'll be out there.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1013%2Fr1559694_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:03:04.995010

And I feel very good about Daniel Jones and where he's at, where he's going.
But I think Daniel Jones has got a really bright future here in Indianapolis.""
Jones' injury is not the only variable, as he will be a free agent in the spring.
""The history of guys coming back has been pretty good, and they've been older than Daniel,"" Ballard added.","INDIANAPOLIS -- Colts general manager Chris Ballard is on the clock if owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon is to be believed. Now, as he plots his next moves to get Indianapolis back to the playoffs and end a five-year drought, he plans to lean heavily on quarterback Daniel Jones to get them there.

That was one of the clear takeaways from Ballard's season-ending news conference Thursday, when he said the franchise strongly believes Jones can be the possible answer to its franchise quarterback void.

""I'm looking at him both near and long [term],"" Ballard said of Jones, adding, ""When you're chasing the quarterback all the time, it makes it very hard. Your margin for error really shrinks down. And I feel very good about Daniel Jones and where he's at, where he's going. Yes, he's got the Achilles. But I think Daniel Jones has got a really bright future here in Indianapolis.""

The Colts have been on a lengthy search for quarterback stability, fielding a different Week 1 quarterback in eight of the past nine seasons. Their 2023 first-round pick, Anthony Richardson Sr., faces an uncertain future after being benched temporarily last season, losing a preseason position battle with Jones in 2025 and suffering what would be a season-ending orbital fracture in October.

Jones joined the Colts last spring after an embattled six-year stint with the New York Giants and led them to an 8-2 start. But he sustained a torn right Achilles tendon in December, an injury that helped quicken the team's historic collapse with a season-ending seven-game losing streak.

Jones' injury is not the only variable, as he will be a free agent in the spring. The injury could complicate negotiations, but Ballard said he isn't concerned.

""Of course"" it will have an impact, Ballard said of the injury, ""but we'll work through that.""

Ballard's strong advocacy echoes the stance of coach Shane Steichen, who is perhaps the loudest voice at Colts headquarters on the merits of keeping Jones in the building. Together, Steichen and Jones helped generate historic offensive production in the first half of the season, when the Colts were on pace to shatter several franchise records.

As for the wisdom of relying heavily on Jones given his serious injury, Ballard said, ""It's a legitimate question. And you never know. I'm not a doctor and I'm not God in terms of knowing what the future's going to hold in his healing.""

""The history of guys coming back has been pretty good, and they've been older than Daniel,"" Ballard added. ""Daniel's 28 years old. He's a pretty freaky talent in terms of athletic ability. So I do feel confident he will make it back. Will he be the version you saw [in 2025] right away? Maybe not, but he's still going to be really good.""

Ballard's news conference was his first since the Colts traded for star cornerback Sauce Gardner in November, a deal that has been questioned in the months since given the way the season ended. Ballard sent two first-round picks and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to the New York Jets for Gardner, a two-time first-team All-Pro, with the idea that he could be an additional piece for a deep playoff push.

But Gardner joined Jones, cornerback Charvarius Ward, defensive tackle DeForest Buckner and other key players in suffering late-season injuries. Gardner struggled with a calf injury, effectively playing 2½ games' worth of snaps for the Colts, but Ballard defended the chance to add a 25-year-old top-tier cornerback.

""I kept asking myself, 'Look, would we get this guy in the draft?' Well, maybe we get a little luck. But you're talking about a premier guy who's been at Pro Bowls,"" Ballard said.

As for his own future, which was in question given the team's results, Ballard said he had multiple hourslong discussions with Irsay-Gordon in the past week that probed how he planned to move forward. He will be in the final year of contract next season and is on notice that improvement is expected.

""It starts with me,"" Ballard said. ""And until we win -- until we win big, win a division, go far into playoffs -- there's going to be doubt. That's real. I don't run away from that. I don't shy away from that.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1207%2Fr1586311_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 19:02:33.428604

Jacobs missed all of Week 12’s action against the Minnesota Vikings. He played the remaining five games of the year before taking off Week 18, another Vikings game, going into the playoffs.

Over the first nine games of the year, prior to his injury, Jacobs had played 68 percent of the offense’s total snaps. He only hit that number in any individual game one time since returning to the field, Week 14 against the Chicago Bears. Since that first Bears game, the Packers have been 0-4.

The Chicago Bears received good news as several key players are expected to return for their wild-card game against the Green Bay Packers.

Wide receiver Rome Odunze and cornerback Kyler Gordon appear poised to play, bolstering both the offense and defense.

The Bears will be without nickel cornerback C.J. Gardner-Johnson and rotational pass rusher Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, who are both in concussion protocol.

Receivers DJ Moore and Jahdae Walker, along with left tackle Ozzy Trapilo, have been cleared to play.

The Chicago Bears (11-6) shared their final injury report ahead of a wild-card matchup against the Green Bay Packers (9-7-1), where there were notable injuries and updates on both sides.

For the Bears, there's some good news regarding notable starters and prominent contributors. Wide receiver Rome Odunze and cornerback Kyler Gordon appear poised for a return to action, which will be key in defeating the Packers. Receiver DJ Moore and left tackle Ozzy Trapilo have been removed from the injury report and are good to go.

Here's a closer look at the injury report for the Bears entering Wild Card Weekend, as well as final game designations for Chicago and Green Bay:

Good news

Wide receiver Rome Odunze was a full participant during Thursday's practice and was not given an injury designation for Saturday night. That's a good indication that the former first-round wideout will be back in the lineup against the Packers.

Cornerback Kyler Gordon, who's missed most of the season with injury, is gearing up for a return from injured reserve. Gordon practiced all week, including in full on Thursday, and he's officially questionable. It sounds like Gordon is doing all he can to play Saturday night.

Rookie left tackle Ozzy Trapilo, who was sidelined last week with a quad injury, participated in full on Friday and is slated to be back along Chicago's offensive line for Saturday night.

Receivers DJ Moore (knee) and Jahdae Walker (illness) have also been cleared for Saturday night's game, which gives quarterback Caleb Williams his full arsenal of weapons.

Offensive tackle Braxton Jones, who's been on injured reserve most of the season, had a full week of practice and is gearing up for a return to the roster. He'd likely be the second or third option at left tackle behind Trapilo.

Reserve defensive backs and special team contributors Nick McCloud and Jaylon Jones do not have injury designations for Saturday night. And assuming Gordon can't go, with C.J. Gardner-Johnson sidelined, it would be McCloud getting the nod in the slot.

Bad news

The Bears will be without nickel cornerback C.J. Gardner-Johnson, who remains in concussion protocol. He's been ruled out and will not be on the field Saturday night. The hope is Kyler Gordon is able to suit up, as he's gearing up for a return from IR.

Chicago's pass rush is already lacking production, and they'll be without rotational piece Joe Tryon-Shoyinka, who has been ruled out with a concussion.

The Bears will also be without linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga (concussion), who is a core special teams contributor.

In April 2021, near his parents York County home, deputies said Phillip Adams shot Dr. Robert Lesslie; his wife, Barbara Lesslie; two of their grandchildren, Adah, 9, and Noah, 5; and two HVAC workers at the house, James Lewis and Robert Shook of Gaston County, N.C.

Adams, 32, died later that day after he shot himself as deputies surrounded his parents’ house, the York County sheriff’s office has said.

But after a Boston doctor said in December 2021 that Adams had brain injuries consistent with concussions that could come from football, Adams’ father, Alonzo, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Orangeburg County. The Adams family sued the NFL, NFL Properties, and South Carolina State University, where Phillip Adams played college football.

The lawsuit claims Adams suffered financial and emotional losses from his football injuries. He played in the NFL from 2010 to 2015 with the San Francisco 49ers, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, Oakland Raiders, New York Jets and Atlanta Falcons, after starring at S.C. State and Rock Hill High School.

The NFL and S.C. State have denied Adams’ claims of negligence, court documents in the case show.

The NFL and the college both sought to have the case dismissed, but South Carolina state court Judge Charles McCutchen ruled Wednesday the case filed in South Carolina civil court can move forward in Orangeburg County, documents show.

McCutchen ruled that Rock Hill’s Craig Wilkerson and Gedney Howe IV of Charleston, lawyers for the Adams family, showed enough to keep the negligence lawsuit going.

The lawsuit alleges the NFL was “engaging in activity which caused concussion and head trauma to Phillip Matthew Adams and latent neurological damage, illnesses, and decline that arise from those head impacts.”

Wednesday’s ruling in state court comes after a federal judge earlier refused to dismiss the case before it was sent to state court.

Timing and brain injury called CTE

Adams’ family claims in the lawsuit he suffered from concussions and had chronic traumatic encephalopathy — a brain condition called CTE sometimes found in former football players that is caused by repeated head trauma.

The judge ruled in favor of the family about the timing of the lawsuit. Adams had not played in the NFL for years when he died.

Yet the Adams family did not know and could not know Adams had CTE until after his death, because the disease can only be found in the brain after death.

“The statute of limitations not only did not run out prior to Plaintiff bringing his claim for negligence, Plaintiff had no legal right to sue for the wrongful death of Decedent until after Decedent’s death, and the diagnosis of CTE was only able to be made posthumously,” McCutchen wrote.

What happens next?

The judge also declined to issue a “summary judgment” that S.C. State sought that would have taken the college out of the case.

The judge also compelled the NFL to send Adams’ lawyers several documents about the NFL’s business practices in South Carolina, including all contracts and agreements entered into by the NFL Properties regarding the failed Carolina Panthers headquarters and practice facility that was supposed to be built in Rock Hill but failed.

Davante Adams Injury Update: Will Rams WR Play in Wild Card Game vs. Carolina?

The injury report lists Adams with a hamstring injury, and his status looks hopeful after being a full participant at Tuesday’s practice. Furthermore, coach Sean McVay said on Monday he expects Adams to be available.

Los Angeles’ veteran wideout hasn’t made a full appearance since Week 13, as he posted snap shares of 42.9% and 45.8% in Week 14 and 15. In his last full outing, Adams recorded 4 catches, 58 receiving yards, and 2 receiving touchdowns on 5 targets. Despite dealing with an injury late in the regular season, the six-time Pro Bowler still led the league with 14 receiving touchdowns.

PrizePicks is projecting 4 receptions, 55.5 receiving yards, and a 13-point fantasy score.

With the Rams’ scoring machine expected to return to the lineup, how could this impact the team’s fantasy football outlook?

Rams’ Fantasy Football Outlook

According to PlayerProfiler, Adams sports a lofty 35.6% red zone target share, and his 24.8% target share (14th) and 1,444 air yards (11th) point to a healthy workload.

He averages 8.1 targets, 4.3 receptions, 56.4 receiving yards, and 1.0 receiving touchdown per contest. The former Fresno State Bulldog has been a red zone monster, racking up 11 receiving touchdowns over his last eight games. If Adams returns, his fellow pass catchers' will likely see fewer scoring opportunities.

Adams and Rams WR Puka Nacua could dominate the receiving workload, boasting 166 and 114 targets this season. The next-highest mark is only 56 targets from Parkinson.

Over Week 17 and 18, the Rams’ tight ends stepped up to the plate, most notably Colby Parkinson, who totaled 6.0 targets, 4.0 receptions, and 53.5 receiving yards per game in the split. For context, he averages only 3.7 targets, 2.9 catches, and 27.2 receiving yards per contest on the season. PrizePicks projects Parkinson to have 19.5 receiving yards for Saturday.

Rams rookie TE Terrance Ferguson also posted 2 receptions and 54 receiving yards per game in Week 17, compared to his 0.8 catches and 16.5 receiving yards per contest on the season.

In short, this passing attack could be a two-man show on Saturday.

Adams is tracking to make his return at the perfect time, giving the Rams’ receiving corps a touchdown magnet. With Los Angeles’ standout WR2 back in action, the Rams’ tight ends production could take a step back on Wild Card Weekend.

Every week, I will review each team’s updated minutes per game to see which players are seeing the court more or less than in previous weeks. With this information in hand, I’ll try to discuss any relevant fantasy risers or fallers; players who we should be adding off waivers or removing from our teams.

The charts below are also great for exploring on your own. You can track the minutes over the last three, five, and ten games, and for the entire season, to see which trends stand out to you.

All of this data was made accessible by Kyle Bland, who is incredibly talented and also extremely generous. Be sure to follow him to check out all of his baseball data as well.

Atlanta Hawks

Well, it’s official, Trae Young is now a member of the Washington Wizards. My colleague Kurt Helin covered the fallout from that trade, so check that out. Young has missed the last six games with a quad injury that will probably magically heal when he arrives in Washington. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has been a top-70 player in the last six games that Young has been out, and stands to benefit the most in a trade since he could become a starter. Onyeka Okongwu and Dyson Daniels would also continue to be top-50 players now that Young is no longer in town.

Boston Celtics

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Derrick White36.135.835.5Payton Pritchard34.934.134.3Jaylen Brown34.634.534.4Anfernee Simons23.92624.2Sam Hauser23.923.722.7Neemias Queta23.924.624.3Luka Garza20.921.321.6Jordan Walsh20.61615.9Hugo González14.315.821.6

The Celtics’ situation has remained steady, and they have been much better than many expected. For fantasy purposes, the only truly relevant players are Derrick White, Jaylen Brown, and Payton Pritchard. It’s best not to hunt on the margins for others.

Brooklyn Nets

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Michael Porter Jr.35.235.533.7Day’Ron Sharpe30.624.721.2Noah Clowney30.128.228.5Egor Dëmin28.829.729.3Terance Mann24.825.926.1Ziaire Williams23.624.421.2Danny Wolf23.323.822Cam Thomas23.22221.5Nic Claxton23.127.628.6

The Nets got both Egor Dëmin and Terance Mann back last week and have become a feistier team of late, thanks to their strong defense. They’re still not a particularly good team, and really only Michael Porter Jr. and Nic Claxton have much fantasy value. Claxton missed two games this week for personal reasons, and Day’Ron Sharpe stepped up in his absence, but it seems like Zaire Williams would be the player who gains the most playing time if/when Porter Jr. gets traded. Dëmin is also developing pretty nicely as a rookie and shooting the ball well of late.

Charlotte Hornets

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Brandon Miller33.733.532.8Miles Bridges3333.930.1Kon Knueppel31.231.929.8Moussa Diabaté29.528.929.4Sion James2626.224.7LaMelo Ball25.626.626.3Collin Sexton22.224.321.9PJ Hall18.818.216.6Tidjane Salaün16.818.120.3

Ryan Kalkbrenner has now missed nine straight games, which has led Moussa Diabaté to be a top 100 player, while averaging 31 minutes a game over the last two weeks. We also saw Tidjane Salaün starting to come into his own a bit before an ankle injury caused him to miss a couple of games. This team has four intriguing young players, but I’m not sure the fit with all of them is particularly great. I’m curious to see if the Hornets make a move at the deadline.

Chicago Bulls

The Bulls remain without Josh Giddey (hamstring) and Coby White (calf), and I discussed all the repercussions of this in a video last week. Jalen Smith has also now missed a few games with a concussion, which has led to an increase in minutes for Patrick Williams. Smith’s name has also come up in trade rumors, so Williams could have more consistent playing time if that happened, especially as Zach Collins (toe) remains sidelined.

Cleveland Cavaliers

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Donovan Mitchell34.133.331.9Evan Mobley33.531.629Darius Garland32.431.531Jarrett Allen31.729.526.1Sam Merrill29.326.826.7Jaylon Tyson25.525.824.9Craig Porter Jr.24.623.520De’Andre Hunter23.823.924.3

On one hand, Darius Garland is starting to look healthier, which is great news for the Cavaliers. On the other hand, Max Strus (foot) was ruled out for yet another month and won’t return until the middle of February at the earliest. That should continue to lead to more minutes for Dean Wade, who has supplanted De’Andre Hunter in the starting lineup, but Wade is also dealing with a minor knee contusion of his own. Jarrett Allen has been paying off his uptick in minutes and has been a top-90 player over the last two weeks, so we can hope that role continues.

Dallas Mavericks

NameLast 3Last 5Last 10Anthony Davis37.237.233.1Cooper Flagg35.435.236.3Max Christie33.331.728.2Naji Marshall29.128.629.9Brandon Williams24.926.324.2P.J. Washington23.227.429.9Klay Thompson20.921.422.4Daniel Gafford17.620.317.8Ryan Nembhard15.616.120.3

Except for their few season-ending injuries, the Mavericks have been pretty healthy of late. Anthony Davis continues to be rested here and there, and we do expect him to be traded, but he’s been a top-60 player over the last two weeks, and he and Cooper Flagg work well with one another. Brandon Williams continues to own the starting point guard role and has been a top-100 player over the last two weeks, averaging 19 points, 4.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.0 steals per game.

Denver Nuggets

We know that Nikola Jokić will miss a month due to a knee injury, and Cameron Johnson is still sidelined. However, the Nuggets have gotten back both Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun this week. I covered the fallout of that in a video.

Detroit Pistons

The Pistons had been one of the healthiest teams in the league so far this season, but now they are dealing with injuries to Jalen Duren (ankle), Tobias Harris (hip), and Caris LeVert (knee). I covered the ripple effects of that in a video this week.

Golden State Warriors

Draymond Green has been battling an ankle injury, as well as his own boredom and ejections, over the last few weeks. He remains a borderline top-100 player in fantasy basketball because he contributes a little bit across the board, but there’s no “buy low” type of situation here. Other than that, this team is driven by Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler, along with a collection of other players who occasionally contribute.

The Rockets lost Alperen Sengun to an ankle injury right after he was battling a calf injury. Steven Adams, who was also battling his own ankle injury, should see the biggest uptick in minutes and usage, but Jabari Smith Jr. will also be relied on more. He’s been a top 100 player over the last two weeks, averaging 15 points, 7.7 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 1.0 blocks per game. I covered all the ripple effects of the Sengun injury in a video this week.

The Packers are relatively healthy aside from Isaiah Jackson (concussion), who wasn’t playing much anyway, and Bennedict Mathurin, who will now be sidelined for “a while” with a thumb injury. We also know the Pacers aren’t trying as they look to add a top-three pick to a roster that will be getting back Tyrese Haliburton next season.

Just after the team got Derrick Jones Jr. back, he’s now sidelined for the next six weeks with a Grade 2 MCL sprain. James Harden has also been dealing with a shoulder injury that caused him to miss one game, but Kawhi Leonard has been electric this season and is a top-five player in all of fantasy basketball over the last two weeks. Ivica Zubac returned over the weekend and was up to 33 minutes in his last game, so he should return to his regular role after missing five games. That pushed Brook Lopez back to the bench and cut into minutes and usage for John Collins.

Last week, we covered the injuries to Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura, so little has changed for the Lakers this week. This remains a two-man team with Luka Doncic and LeBron James, and LeBron in particular has really come on of late, pushing up top-20 value over the last two weeks.

Ja Morant has missed the last three games with a calf injury, Cedric Coward has missed the last two with an ankle injury, and Brandon Clarke remains sidelined with a calf injury. Oh, and Zach Edey is still out for another week, and Ty Jerome is probably out another week or two. Did I miss anything? Morant had actually been turning the corner before the calf injury, averaging 23.5 points, 7.8 assists, 2.3 rebounds, and 1.3 steals over the last two weeks. The Grizzlies had lost most of those games, but that’s another story. There’s a chance we see this team fully healthy by the middle of this month, and that could be fun.

Tyler Herro returned after missing 11 games with a toe injury, and I recorded a video on the fallout from that this week. We should note that Jaime Jaquez Jr. has missed the last two games with an ankle injury, so even though Herro did come back, this team is not at full strength. When they are, I think we see Nikola Jović take a hit in both his minutes and usage.

The Bucks are fully healthy right now (well, aside from Taurean Prince being out), so the minutes allotment of late is what we should expect going forward. It’s been nice to see Ryan Rollins remain productive with both Kevin Porter Jr. and Giannis Antetokounmpo playing nearly 30 minutes a game. Rollins has remained a fringe top-50 player over the last two weeks with Giannis back. I’m still a bit confused why this team traded for Myles Turner when he is not really bringing much to the table, but that’s a conversation for another time. Kyle Kuzma has seen a drop in his minutes and production with this team healthy.

Terrance Shannon is out for a couple of weeks with a foot injury, and while that doesn’t really impact the rotation, he’s an intriguing young player. Everything else is pretty much status quo here, and it’s interesting to see Naz Reid continue to be productive and a fringe top-100 player in fantasy leagues despite this team being fully healthy and him playing fewer minutes.

Herbert Jones missed seven games with an ankle and then returned for one game and sat out the second game in a back-to-back. We should expect him to ramp back up in the coming weeks. Trey Murphy III also had a historically good week, which I covered in a video here, but then he sat out the second game in the back-to-back as well, so Bryce McGowen got some extra usage. Saddiq Bey has missed the last four games with a hip injury, but nobody really stepped up to fill his spot. It’s really just been Murphy III, Derik Queen, and Zion Williamson. Of course, Dejounte Murray could be back in a week or two, so that could make things interesting.

Josh Hart has missed seven games with an ankle injury, and, boy, does this team need him. In addition to his defense, the team has sorely lacked the toughness and grit that he brings when he’s on the court. They did rebound nicely in a win over the Clippers on Wednesday, and it seems that Mike Brown has started to shorten his rotation a bit after the losing streak, which led to fewer minutes for guys like Tyler Kolek and Kevin McCullar Jr. We know who the studs are here, and that’s unlikely to change.

The Thunder are battling a CVS receipt list of injuries, but none of them seem overly serious. Isaiah Hartenstein has missed the last six games with a calf injury, Alex Caruso has missed the last two with a back injury, and Jaylin Williams has been out since December 13th with a heel injury. This team is plenty deep, so they’ve been able to transfer the minutes around, but, from a fantasy perspective, really only Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren, and Jalen Williams can be counted on regularly, with Ajay Mitchell also hanging around as a fringe top-100 player.

Jalen Suggs returned last week from his hip injury and then suffered a knee injury that will keep him out indefinitely. We’ve already seen how the Magic disperse their minutes without Suggs, but I covered it in more detail in a video this week. We could also get Franz Wagner back this weekend, so that would be a big boost for the Magic and a big hit to Tristan da Silva’s or Jase Richardson’s minutes.

Kelly Oubre Jr. returned on Wednesday for the first time since November 14th. He played just 20 minutes, but we should expect that number to rise in the coming weeks. With Oubre back, we saw Jared McCain play just 10 minutes, and Quentin Grimes was down to 26, which is a little dip from where he was previously. We should expect those three to siphon some minutes off of each other, but it will be curious to see if Oubre will supplant Dominick Barlow in the starting lineup. Grimes is the only fantasy-relevant player that Oubre would impact, but it’s a situation to monitor.

The Suns are inching closer to getting Jalen Green back from a hamstring injury, and it will be interesting to see how he fits into this team. Collin Gillespie has been a top 75 player in fantasy basketball over the last month, averaging 13.8 points, 5.2 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.9 steals. It would make sense that he loses some minutes when Green returns, but it’s really hard to take him off the court. Green’s minutes would then have to come at the expense of Jordan Goodwin, who has been solid in a reserve role this season. Grayson Allen also returned for two games after missing 11 games with a knee injury, so the Suns have kept his minutes pretty low for now. We’ve also seen Dillon Brooks be a fringe top-100 fantasy player without Green on the court. It’s hard to see that continuing when Green comes back and soaks up usage.

The Blazers have been without Jrue Holiday and Jerami Grant for a while now, but both of them could return this weekend. That would take away a lot of the playing time for Caleb Love and move both Siddy Cissoko and Kris Murray back into smaller roles.

Keegan Murray will be sidelined for three weeks with a back injury, and the Kings will likely remain without Domantas Sabonis for another two weeks. That will lead to increased playing time for Precious Achiuwa, but the offensive burden is going to be taken on by Zach LaVine, who returned from an ankle injury, Russell Westbrook, and DeMar DeRozan. Maxime Raynaud is playing tons of minutes and is a great story, but he’s not a great fantasy asset.

Devin Vassell has missed five games with an oblique injury, which has led to Julian Champagnie getting plenty more run, including a tremendous performance against the Knicks on New Year’s Eve. Victor Wembanyama is still having his minutes monitored, but he’s been productive, and the Spurs are winning, so we may have to assume that continues, which is why Luke Kornet continues to see solid minutes. More minutes than Dylan Harper, who has clearly taken a backseat in the Spurs’ trio of talented guards.

We now have five games with RJ Barrett back from his knee injury, so it’s clear how this Raptors’ rotation is shaking out. Jamal Shead, Ja’Kobe Walter, and Ochai Agbaji have seen their minutes decrease while Collin Murray-Boyles continues to play good minutes and has actually been a borderline top 100 fantasy player over the last two weeks. That could also be due to the Raptors being cautious with Jakob Poeltl’s back. Barrett has settled in, averaging 20.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in his five games back, and both he and Immanuel Quickley remain top-75 fantasy assets alongside Brandon Ingram and Scottie Barnes, who should be an All-Star.

Not much to see with this Utah team. Ace Bailey returned after missing five games with a hip injury, but he will likely take a while to have his minutes ramped up. Jusuf Nurkić has been a real asset for the Jazz lately, and this team is feisty. I recorded a video this week covering Nurkić and also the Jazz conundrum about whether to tank or risk losing their first-round pick.

WR Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle)

Limited:

TE George Kittle (ankle)

LB Luke Gifford (quad)

Kyle Shanahan doesn’t have a strict rule about playing players who haven’t practiced all week. It’s dependent on the player, according to Shanahan: “Whether they’ve done it before. What is the history of the player and stuff like that?”

Wednesday isn’t a rest day for Williams, as it typically was during the regular season. Shanahan is hopeful that Williams will be better on Thursday and can get some work in, but wasn’t sure as of today.

As for Pearsall, Shanahan said he reaggravated his PCL injury during Week 17’s game after acknowledging the 49ers didn’t have any physical practices last week. Pearsall is in the same boat as Williams.

White was one of two pass rushers to produce last week. He’s the team’s best interior pass rusher. White’s absence from the game would be a big blow to the 49ers’ rotation up front.

Shanahan said Kyzir White will practice today. Shanahan noted that what he sees will determine how they use White. With Winters out, there is a starting spot available. Shanahan shared that Brandon Staley helped influence the decision to sign White, calling him smart and instinctive. White played for Gus Bradley, the 49ers’ current assistant head coach, from 2017 to 2020 when Bradley was the defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers.

This is the first normal week of practice for the 49ers since the first week of December. The 49ers get an extra day this week. They looked like a team playing its third game in 13 days under the national spotlight.

Odunze was on track for a second-year breakout with the Bears before his foot injury, having become a clear focal point of head coach Ben Johnson’s new offensive system.
While the status of Odunze is bound to draw the most attention, the Bears also have a few other receivers they must clear from the injury report before playing the Packers.
While he will have Thursday’s practice to earn a clean bill of health, the Bears could rule him questionable on the injury report if he remains limited.
No other Bears wide receivers are listed on the injury report.","Chicago Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze seems to have every intention of playing against the Green Bay Packers in the wild-card round of the playoffs.

According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Odunze has been recovering from a stress fracture in his left foot that sidelined him for the final five games of the regular season and forced the Bears to punch their playoff ticket without one of their top playmakers.

He initially played through the pain for several weeks after injuring his foot in October, but he missed his first career game in Week 14 and then had a setback during pregame warmups before Week 15’s game that prompted the team to shut him down for longer.

Throughout Odunze’s injury, though, the Bears have expressed optimism that keeping him out in recent weeks would improve his chances of playing for them in the playoffs. And according to Odunze himself, that is still very much the plan against the Packers.

“I’m planning on playing, but I’ve been planning on playing for weeks,” Odunze said after practice on Wednesday, January 8, via The Chicago Tribune’s Brad Biggs.

Rome Odunze Was Breaking Out Before Foot Injury

The Bears have managed in the passing game without Odunze in the lineup, but getting him back on the field against the Packers would provide a massive boost — especially if he manages to pick back up right where he left off when he first injured his left foot.

Odunze was on track for a second-year breakout with the Bears before his foot injury, having become a clear focal point of head coach Ben Johnson’s new offensive system. He caught 20 passes for 296 yards and five touchdowns in his first four games alone and was still the team’s leader in receptions (44), receiving yards (661) and targets (90) heading into Week 16’s game against the Packers — after he’d missed two games.

Even if Odunze is not back to full strength, he can help against the Packers.

The question now is whether the Bears will clear Odunze. He returned to practice for the first time in three weeks on January 2 for Week 18’s final walkthrough for Detroit and has maintained his limited participation through the first two practice days of the wild-card round; although, the Bears have only held one practice in the short week.

The Bears must decide whether Odunze will carry an injury designation into the wild-card game against the Packers after January 8’s final practice, but they can also wait to make any decisions about his status until game day, so long as they don’t rule him out.

Will Bears Have All WRs Available Against Packers?

While the status of Odunze is bound to draw the most attention, the Bears also have a few other receivers they must clear from the injury report before playing the Packers.

The Bears have listed veteran wide receiver DJ Moore as a limited participant for each of their first two practice days after adding him to the injury report with a knee injury at the start of the week. While he will have Thursday’s practice to earn a clean bill of health, the Bears could rule him questionable on the injury report if he remains limited.

The Bears also have undrafted rookie wide receiver Jahdae Walker — who has taken on a larger role in the last month — on the injury report with an illness, but that seems to be trending in the right direction. He went from an estimated non-participant on Tuesday to a full participant in Wednesday’s first actual practice for the Packers.

'There's nobody else I'd rather have',Matt Schneidman,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6952189/2026/01/08/packers-bears-wild-card-jordan-love/,"GREEN BAY, Wis. — Jordan Love is ready to put the team on his back.
“There’s nobody else I’d rather have than Jordan,” coach Matt LaFleur said.
The Packers might be down 7 late in the game needing Love to make a play.
Nonetheless, the Packers didn’t clear Love from concussion protocol until after their Week 17 loss against the Baltimore Ravens, and Love didn’t play in Week 18 with nothing at stake against the Minnesota Vikings.
Love has been practicing since before the Ravens game, and the Packers were preparing for him to start that week.","GREEN BAY, Wis. — Jordan Love is ready to put the team on his back.

Of course, he’d never say as much — that would imply the defense can’t carry its weight — but one of the NFL’s top quarterbacks is at least capable of willing the Green Bay Packers to victory with his right arm if need be.

“There’s nobody else I’d rather have than Jordan,” coach Matt LaFleur said.

Just a coach fluffing up his quarterback? Or would the lie detector needle barely budge, if at all?

LaFleur’s statement isn’t as far-fetched as some might think. Love trailed only Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye in MVP odds entering Week 15. Love lit up the AFC’s top seed in the first half that week before the Packers’ season unraveled in the second half — first with Micah Parsons tearing an ACL and then with a blown 9-point lead while the Denver Broncos had Love under siege. That 8-point defeat spearheaded Green Bay’s four-game losing streak to close the regular season.

Love suffered a concussion midway through the second quarter the next week at Soldier Field and hasn’t played since. Rust? The 27-year-old isn’t concerned about it as he waltzes into the same stadium Saturday night for a wild-card round bout between the No. 7 seed Packers and No. 2 seed Chicago Bears. Perhaps it should be the Bears who are concerned instead, given Love’s ascension this season into, or at least near, the top tier of the league’s most important position.

“I like the look in Jordan’s eye,” offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich said. “He’s hungry. He’s ready.”

Love is no stranger to playoff football going into his third postseason. He sautéed the Dallas Cowboys in his first playoff game two years ago as the No. 7 seed before stumbling late against the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round and then again in Philadelphia during last year’s wild-card round. Nobody’s excusing those performances from No. 10. They weren’t good enough. But the 2025 season has been his best yet, even after extended stretches of brilliance in 2023 and 2024.

This season, Love ranked second in expected points added per dropback behind only Maye, sixth in passer rating, fifth in completion percentage above expectation, ninth in on-target percentage and tied the Philadelphia Eagles’ Jalen Hurts for the fewest interceptions (six) among players with at least 400 passes (via TruMedia and Next Gen Stats). Love also ranked fifth in average intended air yards per target among players with at least 400 attempts, so it’s not like he was Charlie Checkdown, either. The numbers support what the eye test also indicates: Love might not be the league’s best quarterback, but he’s not far off, either.

“He’s a big reason why I even decided to come (to Green Bay). I believed in him before I even seen him on a day-to-day basis,” running back Josh Jacobs said. “Seeing him on a day-to-day basis, just the way he works and the type of leader he is and his throwing ability is crazy. … He’s just one of those guys, man. He’s a special player, and I can’t wait for him to be able to have this opportunity to show the world.”

You’d be hard-pressed to find a quarterback with a more fitting temperament for the upcoming moment. There aren’t many more cliché descriptions of a player than calm, cool and collected, but Love’s headshot sits next to those words in the dictionary. Love’s mother and late father were police officers and saw some gruesome things on the job, but they put that aside at home to raise Love and his three sisters. Love’s father was a youth pastor at their church, too.

“There’s so many situations that came up with kids at church and just different upbringings of people and things that might (be) going on with their family, and you just gotta be calm,” Love told The Athletic last season. “Seeing him kind of react to any situation and find an answer for it or solution for it definitely has helped me in my life and football, and it’s like being a quarterback. You plan for certain things to go right on a play and you gotta react to what the defense is doing and be as calm as possible and just kind of have a solution for everything, so it definitely applies on the football field.”

Added Jacobs: “He’s kinda who he is, which is the thing I love the most about him, because the moments are never too big. He’s never really rattled in those situations.”

Soldier Field is going to be loud. The Packers might be down 7 late in the game needing Love to make a play. If anything, he won’t be flustered. His penchant for trudging on through adversity in college and the NFL is in part what convinced general manager Brian Gutekunst that Love was worthy of a $220 million payday on the eve of 2024 training camp. His ability to throw from any platform, whether a play stays on schedule, is a bonus. He’s also protected the ball far better this season than in his first two as a starter, an encouraging sign considering he threw five interceptions over the Packers’ last two postseason losses. That’s the full package you need to win a playoff game.

“It’s win or go home,” Love said. “Just gotta go out there, play your best ball and execute at a high level or else you’re going home.”

But can Love pick up where he left off after more than 2 1/2 games sidelined? Bears defensive end Austin Booker and Love collided heads on that Saturday night in early December, dealing Love his first documented concussion in the NFL. Jacobs said this week that a lot of players took Booker’s hit on their quarterback personally, even if Love appeared to lower his head into it. Nonetheless, the Packers didn’t clear Love from concussion protocol until after their Week 17 loss against the Baltimore Ravens, and Love didn’t play in Week 18 with nothing at stake against the Minnesota Vikings.

The Packers ratcheted up practice intensity last week knowing many starters wouldn’t face the Vikings. Love has been practicing since before the Ravens game, and the Packers were preparing for him to start that week. He can’t simulate taking hits in practice, but he said games sometimes feel slower than practice. It’s not like he’s missed a boatload of time, either, so he doesn’t expect Saturday night to shock his system.

“I don’t have any concern about that,” Love said bluntly in an uncharacteristically short answer to a question about potential rust.

“He’s looked great, man,” wide receiver Jayden Reed said. “J-Love is J-Love … faith is extremely high for him. I’ve never lost hope or anything in J-Love. I know the work he puts in every day. It’s going to show out there on Sunday, Saturday, whatever day we play.”

“He’s the biggest part of our offense,” wide receiver Christian Watson said. “Just to have him back, I think it’s only gonna elevate everybody else’s game.”

Though Love has proven he’s one of the game’s most talented quarterbacks, playoff success raises that status to another stratosphere. To be universally considered elite, he needs to take the Packers on a deep run. Their best chance of making one, given deficiencies on defense and special teams, is for Love to carry them.

1 scoring offense (30.5 points per game) and had the second-best point differential (+172) behind the top-seeded Seahawks.","The loss to the Panthers began a 3-3 end to the season for the Rams, punctuated by a heartbreaking overtime loss to the Seahawks and a stunning loss to the Falcons one week later. A common thread in those two losses: the lack of veteran wide receiver Davante Adams. Adams aggravated a hamstring injury in L.A.'s Week 14 win over the Lions, but will be back on the field Saturday. Adams' return gives Stafford back one of his top red-zone targets -- Adams led the NFL with 14 receiving TDs despite missing three games -- and means the Rams once again boast one of the league's best receiver tandems with the dominant Puka Nacua. The strength of the Panthers defense is a secondary led by Pro Bowl corner Jaycee Horn (five interceptions) and Mike Jackson (four INTs), and they performed admirably last time against L.A., holding Adams and Nacua to 10 receptions for 130 yards and two red-zone TDs. But they'll have their work cut out for them balancing their focus on the passing attack and trying to slow down running backs Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. The Panthers have struggled defending the run this season, allowing 123.3 yards per game (20th) and 4.4 yards per carry (23rd). The Rams are a team many expect to make a deep run this postseason -- even facing three potential road games en route to Super Bowl LX. Taking care of business on Saturday is the first step.

Saturday features a game between two former No. 1 overall picks with one (Matthew Stafford, 2009) in the hunt for his first-career MVP award, while the other (Bryce Young, 2023) still looks to cement himself as the franchise QB in Carolina. Young has shown promise in his second year under head coach Dave Canales, hitting career bests in TDs (23), completion percentage (63.6), yards per game (188.2) and rating (87.8). While those numbers are solid, they don't speak to a QB destined to win a shootout with one of the best signal-callers in the league. One thing Young has established, though, is his penchant for clutch play. Young boasts 12 game-winning drives in the fourth quarter/OT since entering the league in 2023 (most in the NFL). This season, Young led six such drives, trailing only the Broncos' Bo Nix, and his fourth-quarter prowess was instrumental in the Panthers' takedown of L.A. at the end of November when he put together a game-winning drive capped by a 43-yard strike to Offensive Rookie of the Year favorite Tetairoa McMillan. The Panthers have been at their best this season when leaning on their RB duo of Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard, but their run game has tapered off since Week 13 with no back topping 60 yards in a game since then. Heading into a key offseason during which the Panthers will decide on his fifth-year option, Young will have the chance to make a statement in his first playoff game.

There's no denying it. The Rams are heavy favorites to advance to the Divisional Round despite their previous slip up in Charlotte, North Carolina. Los Angeles boasts the league's No. 1 scoring offense (30.5 points per game) and had the second-best point differential (+172) behind the top-seeded Seahawks. Carolina by comparison is the fifth team to enter the postseason with a losing record at 8-9 (not counting strike-shortened seasons) and their -69 point differential is the fourth-worst for a playoff team in league history. The last time a team with eight or fewer wins to beat a team with 12 or more wins in the playoffs was when the Tim Tebow-led Broncos shocked the Steelers in the 2011 Wild Card Round. But the Panthers have history with upsets in the postseason. The 2014 Panthers at 7-8-1 beat the 11-5 Cardinals, and second-year head coach Dave Canales was part of Pete Carroll's staff when the 7-9 Seahawks stunned the defending Super Bowl champion Saints in the famous BeastQuake game. Canales saw success in an aggressive approach in their first matchup against the Rams. The Panthers were 3 of 3 with two TDs from Young on fourth-down tries that Sunday, totaling +13.4 EPA on fourth down (the most in the league in the past four seasons, per Next Gen Stats). That type of approach will be paramount if Carolina wants to pull off another upset.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/wbasjichnysf8qk9emzw,N,,2026-01-08 13:14:22.825462

For the third time in six weeks, the NFL’s oldest rivals will clash.

Though playoff berths and NFC North supremacy hung in the balance in the Packers’ and Bears' first two throwdowns, this one has far more at stake: namely, their seasons.

With a combined 211 seasons between the franchises, the Bears and Packers will play for an NFL-record 213th time. Yet, when the NFC’s second-seeded Bears host the No. 7 Packers, it will mark just the third time the teams have faced off in the postseason.

On their way to the 1941 NFL Championship, the Bears bested the Packers, 33-14, in the Divisional Round; in 2010, the Packers defeated the Bears, 21-14, in the NFC Championship Game en route to a win in Super Bowl XLV.

In the six-game Wild Card Weekend, this is one of just two regular-season rematches (the other -- Los Angeles Rams-Carolina Panthers -- kicks off the Saturday doubleheader) and the only divisional matchup.

For all the history in the rivalry matchup, the game is also symbolic of this year’s postseason field, one in which new blood runs through.

Bears quarterback Caleb Williams , the 2024 NFL Draft’s No. 1 pick, will make his playoff debut, just as 2023 No. 1 pick Bryce Young and ’24 No. 3 selection Drake Maye will do, whilst perennial postseason mainstays such as Patrick Mahomes , Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow will be watching from home.

2) Are Packers rested or rusty?

This is a bounce-back game in more ways than one for Jordan Love. The Packers franchise signal-caller hasn't played since the Week 16 OT loss to the Bears. He missed the past two games due to a concussion (Week 17) and rest (Week 18). Neither Love nor the Packers have won a game since Week 14 -- once again, against the Bears. Saturday will mark Love's fourth playoff start over the past three seasons, but he'll be looking to exorcise the demons of a dreadful 22-10 wild-card loss last season to the Philadelphia Eagles. He had no touchdowns, three interceptions and a 41.5 rating -- the second-lowest of his career. When Love made his playoff debut, he dazzled in a stunning thrashing of the Dallas Cowboys in the 2023 wild-card round, throwing three TDs in a 48-32 upset. Love and head coach Matt LaFleur's Packers were suddenly upstarts who seemed destined for brighter seasons to come. However, they enter their latest wild-card foray on a four-game losing skid. A loss Saturday would be the club's third straight postseason defeat. With Love and so many of Green Bay's starters sitting out the team's regular season-ending 16-3 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, just how rested or rusty they are could prove pivotal.

3) Which defense will wake up and step up?

When the Packers pulled off a trade with the Dallas Cowboys to acquire pass-rushing supernova Micah Parsons just before the season kicked off, it sent shockwaves through the league and made Green Bay an instant Super Bowl contender. When Parsons was lost to a torn ACL in Week 15, it sent the Green Bay defense spiraling. The Packers have allowed 170.8 rushing yards per game (most in NFL) since Parsons' departure and had just three sacks (fewest in the league). Rashan Gary's 7.5 sacks are second on the team behind Parsons (12.5), but he hasn't recorded one in the last nine games. Shoring up the rush defense with the Bears' Kyle Monangai (783) and D'Andre Swift (1,087) entering as the only backfield tandem in the league with 750-plus yards apiece is crucial for Green Bay. Chicago's defense has struggled versus the rush, as well, finishing 27th in ground yards given up, and 29th in total yards. It's hung its helmet on forcing turnovers, leading the league with 33 takeaways. Kevin Byard was the league leader with seven interceptions, but it hasn't led to sustainable defensive success, evidenced by the Bears being 23rd in points allowed (24.4 PPG). Consequently, the Bears are 9-1 this season when they allow 24 or fewer points. With running back Josh Jacobs and wide receivers Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs and Jayden Reed all healthy and good to go, Chicago's defense is set to face a stiff test.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/mxrnghheyd33rhdzvkwc,N,,2026-01-08 15:01:32.355089

The Los Angeles Rams defense has regressed since losing nickel Quentin Lake. Can they regain their form in the playoffs? Here are the key matchups in each of the NFC wild-card games.

San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (4:30 p.m. ET Sunday)

Key matchup: 49ers two-deep defenses vs. Eagles run game

The 49ers’ injury-riddled defense has struggled to stop the run and wide receivers. Though the Eagles run game has greatly regressed from last season, it still created explosive rushes at the 10th highest rate in the NFL. The offensive line has dealt with injuries, and the weight of grueling playoff runs has taken its toll on defending champion Philadelphia. Jalen Hurts hasn’t run as much on designed runs and scrambles, which has hurt the Eagles shotgun running game, so they’ve run the ball more from under center, where they get most of their explosive rushes. However, they don’t pass much from under center (30th in dropbacks from under center), which makes them predictable.

Last season, the Eagles only had one game under 100 rushing yards, in Week 18, when they rested their starters. This season, they’ve had nine games under 100. Notably, they struggled to run the ball against some of the league’s worst run defenses, such as the Washington Commanders, Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys. As mentioned, the 49ers run defense has struggled in the last few weeks, but it has a shot at stopping the Eagles run game. The Bills did so by confusing their blocking schemes with line games and run blitzes, and 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh did the same to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 18 after getting gashed on the ground early in the game. Still, anytime you have Saquon Barkley in the backfield, the threat of the big run always looms.

The Eagles faced the seventh-highest rate of two-deep safeties, which limited Hurts’ ability to throw outside to A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. Despite all the two-high shells they faced, they struggled to run the ball consistently. 49ers cornerback Deommodore Lenoir has struggled as of late, and Renardo Green is just coming back from injury. If the 49ers are forced to play one-high coverage because of the run, it’ll be a lot to ask Lenoir and Green to cover Brown and Smith one-on-one, especially with their nonexistent pass rush. With right tackle Lane Johnson possibly returning from injury, it’ll be even more difficult to get to Hurts and make the run game a bigger threat.

Although Saleh is a single-high coach, he has shown a willingness to go to two-deep coverages in certain games, as he did early against the Seahawks. With the star receivers that the Eagles have on the outside and their inconsistencies running the ball, the better choice should be to start the game in two-high and see if you can disrupt the run game without an extra defender in the box.

The 49ers have leaked yardage, but they’ve been very good at stopping teams in the red zone, ranking fifth in touchdown percentage allowed in the red zone. Against the Seahawks, they forced four field goals. They’ll have a much bigger challenge against an Eagles offense that ranks first in red zone touchdown rate (70.5%), which is the one area that it’s actually better in offensively than last season. The 49ers can’t rely on tightening up the red zone. Stopping the run from two-high alignments and not allowing them to get to the red zone frequently will be key.

Key matchup: CB Emmanuel Forbes Jr. vs. WR Jalen Coker/WR Tetairoa McMillan

In the Panthers’ upset win over the Rams in Week 13, they went after Forbes at cornerback. Whenever the Panthers needed a big play, they targeted Forbes, who gave up two long touchdowns in man coverage on fourth down. Forbes ultimately gave up the game-winning catch to McMillan, but they were clouding him for most of the game. It was Coker who had his best game of the season against the Rams (four catches for 73 yards and a touchdown).

After a hot start to the season, Forbes has regressed and has been frequently targeted by opponents. Coker has benefitted from one-on-one coverage when McMillan gets extra attention. This will be a matchup to watch out for in the fringe red zone. According to Pro Football Focus, Forbes is allowing the eighth-highest yards per reception (15.3) among qualifying corners this season.

Lake will likely make his return after getting injured in Week 11. As a nickel corner, Lake makes a massive difference for the Rams defense. His physicality allows the Rams to stay in sub personnel (five or more defensive backs on the field). They are much more effective at stopping explosive passes from sub personnel than base personnel (four or fewer defensive backs on the field). The Rams increased their percentage of snaps in base by 5% after Lake was hurt. When the Rams are in sub, they rank eighth in explosive pass rate allowed (10.2%). When they are in base, they rank 32nd (20.6%). If Lake is back, it’ll allow them to be more diverse in their coverage and allocate more help to Forbes. Still, there will be critical situations when Forbes has to cover one-on-one. How he fares in those situations could swing the game as it did in Week 13.

Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (8 p.m. ET Saturday)

Key matchup: Packers defensive tackles vs. Bears three interior linemen

In the two games (Week 16 and 17) after Parsons got hurt (Packers rested key starters in Week 18), Green Bay gave up 457 total rushing yards. One of those opponents was the Bears, who ran for 150 yards, averaging 5.8 yards per rush. Without Parsons’ disruption, this Packers front gets pushed around.

Green Bay’s defensive tackle room was already thin before Jordan Riley, who was signed off of the New York Giants’ practice squad to replace Devonte Wyatt, who was put on injured reserve after getting hurt on the road against the Baltimore Ravens. Simply put, the Packers are getting shoved around on the interior, getting blown back, and huge holes are being punctured in their front. No matter what alignment Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley tries to get into to slow down the run, there just isn’t a lot you can do when your defensive tackle play is this bad.

In Weeks 16 and 17, the Packers gave up 3.56 yards before contact. To put that in context, the Giants, who rank last in the league in that category, are giving up 1.95 yards before contact.

The first thing Ben Johnson did when getting hired by the Bears was revamping the interior with guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and center Drew Dalman. Can former sixth-round pick Karl Brooks and Colby Wooden hold up against the Bears’ star-studded interior? How Brooks and Wooden perform will determine if the Packers defense can slow down the Bears offense. In a Week 16 win against the Packers, the Bears had some early miscues like a botched snap in the red zone in the first quarter and fell behind by double digits, but in the wild-card round, expect Johnson to emulate what the Ravens did against Green Bay in a Week 17 win and run early and often.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/07181054/GettyImages-2254651473-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-08 12:00:58.781710

I'm not sure this Bills team does, either.","It's NFL playoff preview time. There are a lot of ways to break down what we're about to see, but I've landed on one I like: I'm going to take the playoff bracket and try to break down what would matter most in each game, picking winners along the way. We'll end with a Super Bowl prediction and a winner.

I've used this format for a couple of years now, and during that time, I've stuck to my preseason Super Bowl prediction when I've put together my bracket in January. This time around, that's not going to work. I did suggest before the season that the Chiefs would decline in 2025, but I thought that was going to be down to the 11- or 12-win range, and I still believed they would win the Super Bowl. On the other side, I had the Packers, who had just acquired Micah Parsons to add some star power to a young, talented roster.

A few torn ACLs later, those plans are in disarray. The Chiefs aren't in the bracket at all. The Packers are here, but they're walking wounded as a 7-seed. So this year, because my preseason pick is officially impossible, I'm freeing myself to make a new Super Bowl prediction. The chance of me picking all 13 games correctly is zero point zero percent, but maybe we can learn something along the way. What I'm interested in is how teams match up and what has changed about teams as they hit the postseason. Is there something about a team's performance that doesn't match public perception? Is there a weakness a particular opponent is likely to exploit? Was there something in a prior game between two teams that is unlikely to recur in a rematch?

Of course, there are so many things that can happen in a single NFL game that can't be anticipated. Think about the Packers-Eagles game last postseason, when Green Bay fumbled away the opening kickoff for a short field and a touchdown, lost Elgton Jenkins to a first-quarter injury and had his replacements commit three penalties, and eventually finished the game down its top three wide receivers. Nobody could have imagined that the 49ers would end up playing Christian McCaffrey at quarterback out of desperation in the NFC Championship Game a few years ago or (look away Saints fans) that an inexplicable pass interference non-call would help swing that same game years earlier. There's more unknown than known in previewing any matchup, let alone one weeks away.

It's still fun to go through the bracket to suss out how the playoffs might go, though, and so that's why we're here today. And while there have been years when the conference brackets seemed like parades to the Super Bowl for the top seeds, this is a wide-open season. The Broncos and Seahawks have plenty of skeptics. The top-ranked team in the NFC in ESPN's Football Power Index -- the Rams -- is the fifth seed. Its top-ranked team in the AFC is the Ravens, who won't be joining us this January, and just below are the Bills, who will be the sixth seed in the conference. It feels like anything is possible this postseason.

Super Bowl LX

AFC wild-card weekend

(7) Los Angeles Chargers at (2) New England Patriots

Sunday, Jan. 11 at 8 p.m. ET (NBC)

Spread: NE -3.5 (46.5)

Here's a good example of why this is a flatter postseason than usual. Since the league moved to the 14-team playoff format, the seventh seeds have collectively been slaughtered. They've gone 1-9 while losing by an average of nearly 11 points per contest. The only 7-seed to win even a single game is the 2023 Packers, who were then dismissed by the 49ers in the divisional round.

And yet here in the AFC, the Chargers are only 3.5-point underdogs as they travel to the East Coast to face the Patriots. Playing Sunday night is preferable given the track record of West Coast teams traveling and playing games at 1 p.m. ET, but this is really a referendum on the Patriots and the historically easy schedule they've faced this season. The Pats finished with the 10th-easiest schedule since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, per Pro-football-reference.com -- just ahead of the 1972 Dolphins, who rode that friendly slate to the only perfect season in league history.

There's a bit of a ""movable force versus resistible object"" thing happening here for the Patriots on defense. Their weakness all season has been in the red zone, where they have allowed opposing teams to score touchdowns nearly 68% of the time, the third-worst rate in the NFL. The problem for the Chargers is that they've also been a mess in the red zone, where they've converted only 47.4% of their trips into touchdowns.

Both sides could make a case that they'll be better in the postseason. The Chargers didn't have Omarion Hampton or Najee Harris, their two power backs, for most of the season. They have Hampton back now, and with Kimani Vidal sitting out the entirety of Week 18 despite being cleared to play after suffering a neck injury, coach Jim Harbaugh might lean heavily on his first-round pick. The Patriots did welcome back star defensive tackle Milton Williams-- who had been out because of an ankle injury --for the final game of the regular season, though, and that's a much-needed addition for a team built through its defensive line.

But the Chargers are a completely different offense without tacklesRashawn Slater and Joe Alt. Slater has missed the entire season because of a ruptured patellar tendon.The Chargers have still been third in the NFL in EPA per play with Alt (ankle) on the field, but theyhave been 26th without him. Missing Hampton for much of that stretch didn't help, but the offense has been disjointed and struggled to find an identity for most of the year.

Drake Maye's ability to attack downfield is the way to beat this Chargers defense, as C.J. Stroud showed with his first-quarter outburst two weeks ago. Maye led the league in Total QBR on deep passes, and while the Chargers were the fourth-best pass defense by EPA per play against short and intermediate passes, that fell to 16th when teams attacked them with deep balls.

This would be a matchup of the best offense at throwing to either sideline by QBR (New England) against the best defense at stopping those throws (Los Angeles). Top Chargers cornerback Donte Jackson is expected to play after leaving L.A.'sWeek 18 loss to the Broncos with an injury, but I think Maye hits a couple of deep shots to earn his first career playoff victory.

Prediction:Patriots 21, Chargers 13

(6) Buffalo Bills at (3) Jacksonville Jaguars

Sunday, Jan. 11 at 1 p.m. ET (CBS)

Spread: BUF -1.5 (51.5)

This is the game of the weekend for me, as we'll get Josh Allen with a week of rest for his ailing foot against Trevor Lawrencein the best form of his career. Lawrence's 85.0 Total QBR over the past five games is second in the NFL behind Maye; Lawrence is averaging 8.3 yards per attempt over that span while throwing 15 touchdown passes against just one interception.

Can Lawrence sustain that through the postseason? I'm not sure. We're not that far removed from a four-turnover game against the Cardinals in Week 12, and Lawrence had 13 interceptions and five fumbles this season. I also go back to 2022, when Lawrence posted a 15-to-2 touchdown-to-interception ratio over the final 10 games of the season, then threw five picks in two postseason games against the Chargers and Chiefs.

Lawrence has been able to play his best ball after Jacksonville addedJakobi Meyers, who gave him a much-needed option on in-breaking routes. Lawrence and the Jags were 30th in QBR on in-breaking routes during the first half of the season, but that has improved to 10th during the second half. The Bills have been a roughly neutral defense against different route types, but it makes sense to target the middle of their defense. Cole Bishop has struggled at safety, and it's unclear whether Buffalo will have (or should hope to have) Jordan Poyer at safety or Terrel Bernard at linebacker.

The bigger concern with the Bills in this matchup would be on the ground, where they've been a sieve in terms of allowing big plays. Buffalo has given up 28 gains of 15 yards or more on the ground, the most of any postseason team. Coach Liam Coen has improved what had been a moribund Jags run game, but despite a few big runs here and there, Jacksonville was 27th in the league in turning rush attempts into gains of 15-plus yards. If the Jaguars win this game, it will likely include a long carry or two fromTravis Etienne Jr., who could be playing his final game in a Jags uniform.

The other factor that might decide this game is whether the Jacksonville defense can force an interception or two from Allen. One year after posting the fewest takeaways in the league, the Jaguarshave thrived by forcing turnovers, with their 22 interceptions ranking second in the NFL. And while Allen posted a career-low 1.2% interception rate while winning MVP a year ago, his 2.2% rate in 2025 was roughly in line with his career average. With a receiving corps that struggles to separate against tight coverage, we know Allen is going to need to make some tight-window throws, and that's where the Jags can get their picks.

The Jaguars are a heavy zone coverage team, though, and Allen's 71.7 QBR against zone this season is the second-best mark in the league. The Jaguars have been a much better defense against teams that go lighter than against teams that use multiple tight ends, and the Bills are going to bring Dalton Kincaid, Dawson Knoxand Jackson Hawes onto the field to try to manipulate Jacksonville's personnel and limit its exotic pressure looks. The Bills win in a shootout.

Prediction:Bills 28, Jaguars 24

(5) Houston Texans at (4) Pittsburgh Steelers

Monday, Jan. 12 at 8:15 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC)

Spread: HOU -3 (39.5)

The Texans come into the postseason as the NFL's hottest team, having responded to their 2-4 start by winning 10 of the ensuing 11 games, including nine straight to end the 2025 season. They're third in EPA per play on defense, and their physicality is a scary match for a Steelers team that doesn't often stretch opposing defenses downfield. Aaron Rodgers was able to consistently move the ball downfield on Sunday nightonly after the Ravens lost star safety Kyle Hamilton to a concussion.

The Steelers have a distinct formula for winning. Does it match up well against the Texans?

We know that Rodgers wants to get the ball out quickly, which could help mitigate the impact of the fearsome Texans pass rush.Derek Stingley Jr. & Co. form an excellent secondary, but the Texans aren't as effective when the ball comes out within 2.5 seconds of the snap. Houston is 13th in EPA per defensive snap on those quick passes and the league's best defense afterward. Rodgers' average pass comes out after 2.6 seconds, the quickest rate for anyone in the league.

The Steelers lean into bigger personnel groupings by using a sixth offensive lineman and multi-tight end sets. Rodgers also loves throwing to his backs, particularly Kenneth Gainwell, who was named team MVP for his work during the regular season. The Texans are third in QBR on throws to running backs, but they do suffer when teams go bigger. They fall from being the best defense in QBR against when opponents use no or one tight end to 16th when they face multi-tight end sets.

Mike Tomlin's teams thrive by winning the turnover battle and relying on their defense to hand the offense a short field or two from takeaways. Here's where I would be worried for the Steelers:C.J. Stroudisexcellent at protecting the football, and the Texans turn the ball over on just under 6% of their drives, the best giveaway rate in the NFL this season. When the Steelers don't force turnovers, they're a league-average defense by points allowed per possession.

The Steelers usually have an advantage on special teams and manage to leverage that into a well-timed turnover or better kicking, but I'm not sure that will be the case Sunday, either. Chris Boswell missed what could have been a season-altering extra point in Pittsburgh's win over the Ravens, but the longtime Steelers kicker has generally been very good this season, hitting field goals at a rate 13.9% better than what an average kicker would do in the same situations, per Next Gen Stats. Houston'sKa'imi Fairbairnis right there with Boswell at 12.7% above average on his field goal attempts, though. He will have to kick on some of the least-friendly turf in football after spending most of the season in domes or friendly weather situations, but he has been one of the league's most reliable kickers.

The Steelers are fifth in win probability added on special teams, but the Texans are second. I don't think there's a huge advantage to be had for the Steelers here.

And unfortunately, while we just saw the Steelers win what unexpectedly turned into a late-game shootout with the Ravens, we know that their paths to victory have been narrower than those of the Texans. These teams are flawed up front, and I would expect a conservative game driven by the two pass rushes. But the Steelers are the more likely of these two teams to make a fatal mistake.

Prediction:Texans 16, Steelers 13

NFC wild-card weekend

(7) Green Bay Packers at (2) Chicago Bears

Saturday, Jan. 10 at 8 p.m. ET (Prime Video)

Spread: GB -1.5 (45.5)

It's the Packers' third postseason in a row as the seventh seed, and it's a third game between these two teams this season. The Packers came within an onside kick of sweeping their division rivals, but the Bears also came within a last-minute interception of getting the sweep themselves.

Despite the gap in seeding, this is also another matchup in which the lower seed is favored. The Packers are 1.5-point favorites even though they are traveling to Chicago this weekend. ESPN's Football Power Index has the Packers as the NFL's fifth-best team, while the Bears are 15th. DVOA ranks the Packers 11th and the Bears 16th, just behind the Ravens and Chiefs.

Are there reasons to think those numbers could be wrong? Yes, owing mostly to player availability. The Packers aren't going to have Micah Parsons in this game after the star edge rusher tore his left ACL. Cornerback Nate Hobbs, another offseason addition, is on injured reserve. Josh Jacobs has clearly been hobbled in recent weeks; the lead back had to leave the Packers' Week 16 game against the Bears after a goal-line fumble, then carried the ball four times for 3 yards against the Ravens before sitting out in Week 18. And Zach Tom, Green Bay's right tackle, will be questionable.

Jordan Love is returning to the lineup after suffering a concussion in the Week 16 loss to the Bears and missing the remainder of the regular season. The Packers looked just fine on offense with backupMalik Willis under center, but Love was third in the league in EPA per dropback before the second game against the Bears. At his best, Love is one of the most efficient quarterbacks in football. And while his mistakes can be conspicuous and frustrating, Love is at his best more often than it might seem.

One of the things Love and the Packers do really well is a problem for the Bears. I've written about it repeatedly throughout the year, but it remains an issue: The Bears are completely and utterly dependent on creating takeaways on defense. They're the best team in the NFL at forcing turnovers, ending a league-high 18.2% of opposing drives with a takeaway. But they're 27th in points allowed per possession when they don't force a turnover, just ahead of the Jets and Bengals. The hope was that the return of Jaylon Johnson and other starters from injuries would improve the defense, but the Bears have continued to struggle when they aren't taking the ball away.

The Packers, unfortunately for Chicago, turn the ball over at the fourth-lowest rate in the NFL, as just 7.8% of their drives end with a giveaway. The Bears forced one turnover from the Packers in each of their games, but Green Bay scored 28 in the first game. In the second, the Packers drove inside the 10-yard line four times in the first three quarters and came away with just three points, something the Bears can't count on again in the rubber match.

What the Bears can count on, though, is emulating what the Ravens did against the Packers in Week 17: running the hell out of the ball. Derrick Henry had one of the biggest games by any back all season against the Packers (216 yards, four TDs), and the Bears have a better rushing attack than the Ravens, if not a better back. Driven by one of the league's best run-blocking lines, the Bears are third in success rate on designed runs. The Packers are 23rd against those runs, and while the Cowboys were happy to hint that Parsons was a disastrous run defender, it's telling that Henry's huge game came after Parsons was lost for the season.

We saw Bears quarterbackCaleb Williams hit what might have been the throw of the year to win the second game against the Packers in overtime, but he has been inconsistent and has a high off-target rate. He should have something close to a full complement of playmakers, but I don't know if the Bears can stop the Packers on defense. This should be another fun one, but I expect the Packers to win the decider.

Prediction:Packers 31, Bears 24

(6) San Francisco 49ers at (3) Philadelphia Eagles

Sunday, Jan. 11 at 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox)

Spread: PHI -4.5 (44.5)

The vibes for this matchup aren't exactly blissful. The 49ers are coming off a brutal loss in their attempt to win the NFC West and the top seed in the conference, scoring just three points in what was the least-successful offensive effort of the Kyle Shanahan era (since 2017). The Eagles responded by essentially benching their starters (minus receiverDeVonta Smith, who was spammed with targets to get over 1,000 yards before leaving the game) and losing to the Commanders, passing up the opportunity to land the 2-seed in the process.

Eagles coach Nick Sirianni will never say this, but I suspect that both the coach and the rest of the organization preferred to play an injury-weakened 49ers team than the Packers, who rate out as a better team by advanced metrics. (Some organizations wouldn't know or care, but I believe the analytically inclined Eagles are not one of those teams.) The Eagles would miss out on a potential home game if they end up playing the Bears, but we've already seen Ben Johnson's team run all over the Eagles in South Philly this season.

The key factor for this game might be the presence of two Hall of Fame-caliber tackles. The 49ers lost Trent Williams(hamstring) on the opening snap of the Week 17 win over the Bears, and while San Francisco still managed to score 42 points over its ensuing nine possessions, the Niners managed only three points against an elite Seahawks defense the following week. Philadelphia's best pass rusher is on the interior in Jalen Carter, but the Eagles have a deep, talented defensive line that can take advantage of the weak spots for the 49ers up front, especially at tackle. It's unclear whether Williams and wideout Ricky Pearsall, who missed game against the Seahawks because of a knee injury, will be on the field this weekend.

Brock Purdywill targethis running backs and tight ends, but the Eagles have comfortably been the best defense in the NFL at stopping opposing tight ends this season. Targets toward opposing tight ends against the Eagles have produced a 42.9 QBR this season; nobody else is within 20 points of that mark, and the second-placed team (the 49ers, coincidentally) are closer to 21st than they are to the Eagles in first. EPA shows similar results. This will be a very tough matchup for 49ers tight endGeorge Kittle, and given how effective the Eagles' duo of Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean is in coverage, this seems like a game in whichChristian McCaffrey might see 15 targets.

The Eagles, meanwhile, will hope to get Lane Johnson back after their star right tackle missed most of the second half of the season because of a Lisfranc injury. As is often the case, much of the grumbling about the Eagles and their frustrating offense boiling over came after Johnson went down injured. Jalen Hurts posted a 64.3 QBR with Johnson on the field this season, but that fell to 50.1 without him in the lineup. And the offense fell from seventh in EPA per snap to 25th.

A 49ers defense that was already riddled with injuries will have to deal with another absence, as linebackerTatum Bethune will miss the postseason because of a torn groin muscle. For now, the 49ers will turn to veteran Eric Kendricks, who was out of football for most of the year and looked painfully slow with the Cowboys in 2024. Kendricks is a smart player and will know where he needs to be, but I just don't love his chances of surviving in space against Eagles running backSaquon Barkley or Hurts.

The Eagles have quietly expanded Hurts' rushing volume in recent weeks, with the offense seemingly picking up one third-and-long per game with a quarterback draw. Leaving sneaks, scrambles and kneels aside, Hurts had just 10 designed runs through Week 10. The Eagles then gave him 17 designed runs over the next six games, yielding 100 yards and seven first downs. After a week of rest and with the stakes raised, I would expect to see more Hurts in the QB run game, which adds another efficient play to the offense and helps make life easier for Barkley.

I have my concerns about the Eagles, but the tackles are enough to decide this one for me. It looks like the Eagles will have Johnson and the 49ers won't have Williams, and if that's the case, it'll be tough for the 49ers to overcome yet another critical absence.

Prediction:Eagles 24, 49ers 16

(5) Los Angeles Rams at (4) Carolina Panthers

Saturday, Jan. 10 at 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox)

Spread: LAR -10.5 (46.5)

Five of the six wild-card games are expected to be relatively close. This is the exception. The Panthers are 10.5-point underdogs despite being at home against a Rams team they beat 31-28 earlier this season in Carolina. It's the sort of thing that would make you feel disrespected if you hadn't lost a division-clinching game last week and needed a divisional rival to get you into the playoffs.

This is, objectively, a mismatch. The Rams finished the season as the NFL's best team by the FPI. The Panthers were 25th. L.A. coach Sean McVay's team was four wins better during the regular season while facing a tougher schedule. But then again, it was a mismatch on paper in the 2010 playoffs when an 11-5 Saints team traveled to Seattle to play a 7-9 Seahawks team. Seattle had won an awful division in Week 17 and wasn't even sure who would be its starting quarterback in the playoffs. The Saints were 10-point favorites in Seattle and got Beast-quaked back to New Orleans.

We don't have to imagine what it would take for the Panthers to upset the Rams, of course. But looking back at that Week 13 game, what happened? And what are the chances that it happens again?

To start, the Panthers won the turnover battle with a plus-3 margin, including a pick-six for cornerback Mike Jackson. That's the only time all season they've posted such a significant turnover margin in a game. Their success has been closely linked to how well they protect the football on offense. Last Saturday's loss to the Bucs was another multi-turnover game, most notably with the ill-fated decision to attempt a flea-flicker on the edge of the red zone. Carolina fell to 1-7 when it turns the ball over at least twice, leaving it 7-2 when it avoids multi-turnover games. The Rams have forced takeaways at the third-highest rate in the NFL this season.

The Panthers went 7-for-15 on third down and 3-for-3 on fourth down, with two of those plays turning into 33- and 43-yard touchdowns. Carolina should be capable of hitting big shots against the Rams, but relying on those plays on fourth down and for long touchdowns will be extremely dangerous. Those third- and fourth-down conversions that didn't result in touchdowns also allowed the Panthers to retain the football, which shortened the game; the teams shared only 15 meaningful possessions, with the Rams punting once.

Rico Dowdle and the Carolina ground game did run the ball effectively, turning 40 carries into 161 yards. We've seen Carolina run the ball well at times, and the potential to get guard Robert Hunt(biceps) back for this game would theoretically be a boon against one of the league's best defensive fronts.

The only problem is that the Rams ran the ball even better in that game, turning their 21 carries into 152 yards and two touchdowns. Quarterback Matthew Stafford averaged nearly 9 yards per attempt, and the Rams still averaged 7.4 yards per play. They finished with the fourth-highest success rate on designed runs for any team in any game all season. The Panthers didn't have starting linebacker (and former Rams player) Christian Rozeboom for that game, but the Rams have one of the most efficient rushing attacks in recent league history.

It's difficult to imagine the Panthers overcoming the Rams if they get outrun again this time around, and it's tough to find a path to that performance from Week 13 happening a second time.

Prediction:Rams 31, Panthers 15

AFC divisional round

(6) Buffalo Bills at (1) Denver Broncos

Here's another fun rematch. Last season, the Broncos were the wild-card team heading to Buffalo. Denver quarterbackBo Nix threw a 43-yard touchdown pass on the opening drive to kick off the scoring, but those were the only points of the game for the Broncos, who missed a field goal and had a late drive end in the red zone without a score. Facing arguably the league's best defense, the Bills scored on six of their seven meaningful possessions, rolling off 11-, 12-, 13- and 14-play drives en route to a 31-7 victory.

Of course, that was last season, and these teams are different now. The Bills have struggled for consistency on offense, even if the drop-off might be overstated; they've fallen only from second to third in the NFL in EPA per play. The Broncos were desperate to avoid giving up big plays to this offense last year, but the Bills beat them with a thousand small cuts. They went 8-of-15 on third down and converted both of their fourth downs. Josh Allen ran eight times for 46 yards and five first downs, and the Bills eventually hit Curtis Samuel on a deep shot for a 55-yard score.

This isn't a great matchup for the Broncos' strengths on defense. They have a superstar cornerback inPat Surtain II, but the Bills, to put it charitably, don't have a No. 1 receiver for Surtain to mark out of the game. The place to attack Vance Joseph's team is throwing at its linebackers, and Allen will happily target his tight ends and running backs up and down the field. Allen completed only 20 passes when these teams played in the wild-card round last season, but those throws went to eight different Bills.

And while this Broncos team can call upon valuable new additions in Talanoa Hufanga and Dre Greenlaw, I'm a little nervous that the defense might not be quite as dominant as its reputation would suggest. The Broncos finished the regular season seventh in EPA per play, and that's even after Nik Bonitto and this defensive unit got to end the season by playing Chris Oladokun and Trey Lance instead of Patrick Mahomes and Justin Herbert.

The Broncos were 10th in EPA per play on defense before those season-ending games against second- and third-stringers. They were 27th over the four-game stretch between their mid-November bye and the 34-20 loss against the Jaguars, and while Trevor Lawrence is playing great football, that run included games against Marcus Mariota and the combination of Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett.

The Bills' defense is no great shakes, of course, with a particular vulnerability against the run. Can the Broncos exploit that weakness? They were 17th in success rate and 23rd in EPA per play on designed runs this season. Getting J.K. Dobbins back would help, but reports suggest that he wouldn't be able to return until the AFC Championship Game, if not the Super Bowl. Nix hasn't scrambled quite as often as he did as a rookie, but this is where the young quarterback's affinity for picking up first downs would come in handy.

Coach Sean Payton springs this offense with heavy doses of movement from Nix, but that's a place where the Bills have actually been good on the defense. They're seventh in QBR against throws from outside the pocket and have the sixth-best success rate against throws when a quarterback is on the run. The Bills forced Nix to be a pocket passer in last season's playoffs, and while he went 9-of-15 for 115 yards and that early touchdown, he managedonly five first downs on those 15 dropbacks.

Most advanced metrics see the Bills as a similar or better team to the Broncos. ESPN's FPI has the Bills as the seventh-best team, while the Broncos are 11th. DVOA has the Broncos inseventhand the Bills in eighth. Home-field advantage and a week of rest will help Denver, but this just doesn't seem like a good matchup for what the Broncos do well, and I'm a little spooked by their defensive decline after the bye.

Prediction:Bills 27, Broncos 17

(5) Houston Texans at (2) New England Patriots

There are plenty of ties between these two franchises, of course. The Texans were essentially Patriots South at a time during the Bill O'Brien era, although GM Nick Caserio has stuck around and formed a new identity for the organization with DeMeco Ryans at the helm. And Mike Vrabel was once a defensive assistant with the Texans, with Houston finishing dead last in scoring defense during his lone year in charge. The Texans dropped 41 points on the Pats when these two teams faced off in 2024, but that was a very different New England team than the one Houston would face in the divisional round.

I mentioned how much the Pats have struggled in the red zone on defense, and fortuitously, they would get another matchup against an offense that hasn't been any good inside the 20. With a dismal running game for most of the season, the Texans rank 30th in red zone touchdown rate, converting just over 46% of the time. Their 28.8% success rate running the ball inside the 20-yard line was 31st, ahead of only the Raiders.

We would get a fascinating matchup between Texans receiverNico Collins and star Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez, who earned his first Pro Bowl nod this season. The Patriots haven't played man at a particularly high rate despite adding cornerCarlton Davis IIIto their cornerback room, but this might be a week when Vrabel's defense leans into their ability to do so. The Texans have the 10th-best passing attack against zone coverage per QBR, but that falls to 20th against man defense.

Could Stroud win throwing to his non-Collins targets? We've seen players like Dalton Schultz and Xavier Hutchinson have moments this season, but Stroud has an 81.7 Total QBR throwing to his top wideout and a 57.9 QBR when targeting any of his other receivers. With Houston's inability to run the football, I would be worried about the Patriots being able to take Collins out of the game and the Texans struggling to find solutions elsewhere.

There aren't many places where the Texans' defense can get beat, but one place where opposing offenses have had success is with scrambles. While Ryans' defense is rangy and physical, it has allowed a league-high 9.2 yards per scramble from opposing quarterbacks. The Texans obviously don't have to worry about anything more than the occasional scramble from Aaron Rodgers in the wild-card round, but Maye and the Pats scrambled for nearly 26 yards per game this season, sixth highest.

And while there's no arguing from me that the Texans have one of the best defenses in football, there's one spot they've been a little lucky this season: drops. Opposing receivers have dropped 5.8% of the passes thrown their way against Houston, the second-highest rate in the league. I would understand chalking that up to this defense's ability to hit and jar balls loose, but many of these defensive players were in place in 2024, and the Texans forced dropsonly 3.8% of the time then.

The Patriots have collectively done a spectacular job of exceeding expectations when it comes to catching the football, as their 9.1% completion percentage over expectation leads all teams (Next Gen Stats). That's likely going to regress to the mean some in the postseason, but Maye has been fantastic at fitting balls into tight windows and in catchable spots for his receivers. The Texans should give the Patriots trouble, butStefon Diggs wins this revenge game against his former team.

Prediction:Patriots 24, Texans 17

NFC divisional round

(7) Green Bay Packers at (1) Seattle Seahawks

Packers fans surely still have nightmares about the last time they played a postseason game in Seattle, when Mike McCarthy's conservative decisions, a fake field goal, a failed onside kick recovery and one of the wildest two-point conversions ever seen helped the Seahawks overcome four Russell Wilson interceptions to beat the Packers in the 2014 NFC Championship Game. The Seahawks seemed like a team of destiny -- until Wilson's next interception cost them the Super Bowl two weeks later.

These Seahawks have become a conundrum. I've written about how dramatic the splits are for Sam Darnold, who has never really been able to get back on track for a full game since his disastrous performance in the first game against the Ramsin November. Darnold has had his moments since then, but he led the NFL in Total QBR up until then and is 27th since. He also has as many passing touchdowns (eight) as interceptions during that time. And after averaging 9.9 yards per attempt before that first Rams game, Darnold is down to 7.2 yards per throw since.

We're seeing the same sort of hesitance to put the ball in danger that Darnold showed during his frustrating end to the 2024 season, with his decision to turn down a throw to the flatfrom the 1-yard line in Week 18serving as a carbon copy of athrow he turned downin Week 18 the prior year, when Darnold left four touchdowns on the field in a frustrating loss to the Lions.

The week off could have done Darnold some good. We know he'll be better off without needing to face Micah Parsons. The concerning thing is that the strength of the Seahawks' passing attack has been play-action, but the Packers allow only 6.2 yards per attempt off play-fakes this season, the third-stingiest rate in the NFL. Can this version of Darnold survive as a dropback passer?

Even with the Darnold downturn, though, the Seahawks responded to their loss to the Rams by winning their final seven games to claim the top spot in the conference. There has been a bit of fortune in there -- the Seahawks needed a drive in the final minute to beat the Colts and came back from 16 points down in the fourth quarter thanks to their special teams in the rematch with the Rams -- but Seattle has managed to go 7-0 despite having to drag its quarterback along for the ride.

How have they done it? On offense, a previously busted run game has finally gotten going. The Seahawks were 25th in EPA per designed run through the first game against the Rams, but that jumped to 11th over their seven-game win streak. Much of that has been some overdue explosiveness. The Seahawks had three runs of 25 yards or more through their first 11 games. They have seven over the past seven games, including four by Zach Charbonnet. Seattle's duo of Charbonnet andKenneth Walker IIIcarried the ball 33 times for 171 yards in the season-ending win over the 49ers; that sort of performance seems entirely possible against a Packers run defense that looked exhausted against the Ravens'Derrick Henryin Week 17.

The Seahawks' defense has simultaneously grown to completely suffocate opposing offenses. They lead the league in EPA against per play and points allowed per drive over the past seven weeks. They've held four teams to nine points or fewer, limited the Colts to one touchdown and had the Titans at 10 points late in the fourth quarter before two garbage-time scores. The Rams are the only team that has had sustained success moving the ball on the Seahawks during their win streak.

Can the Packers keep up with that sort of effectiveness? I'm just not sure. I know I just suggested that they could score 31 points on the Bears, but look at what the 49ers did against the Bears in Week 17 and what they did the following week against Seattle. Green Bay hasn't been consistently effective running the football most of the season, and Josh Jacobs' injury won't help its chances of getting the run game going against Seattle. If the Packers had Parsons, I might believe that they could terrify Darnold into a few turnovers, but the Seahawks should be able to win with their defense and run game.

Prediction:Seahawks 20, Packers 10

(5) Los Angeles Rams at (3) Philadelphia Eagles

Another trip to Philadelphia for the Rams, who had their 2024 playoffs ended in the snow by a pair of Jalen Carter pass rushes and then lost earlier this season thanks to a blocked field goal by Jordan Davis. Stopping the interior of the Eagles' line is a must for Sean McVay, and the Rams will need guard Kevin Dotson back in the lineup by this point of the postseason.

The Eagles came back from a 26-7 deficit in the second half to win in September, a product of them abandoning a run game that wasn't working and simply targeting the weakest link of Chris Shula's defense -- the cornerbacks -- with vertical routes. I'd expect the Eagles to get to that solution earlier in the game this time around, but Los Angeles' corners (particularlyEmmanuel Forbes Jr.)are better now than they were earlier in the season. The Eagles also had Lane Johnson for only 10 snaps of that game before the star tackle left with a stinger, so if they have Johnson back in the fold from a foot injury for the rematch, that should make life easier for Jalen Hurts.

On the other hand, while there were a couple of big-play bursts from Saquon Barkley late in the season, the Eagles haven't really run the ball well. They were 22nd in success rate on designed runs by the end of 2025, and that was down from only 17th while Johnson was on the field earlier in the year. The Eagles are a bad matchup in terms of physicality for the Rams, who want to load up the field with defensive backs and play dime at the highest rate in the league (32.4%). The Eagles overpowered a Rams sub-package with bigger bodies for a long Barkley touchdown run last season; they'll need to force the Rams out of those groupings and into their base defense by running the football, and that hasn't been a successful habit for them.

Meanwhile, the Rams turned 31 carries into 160 yards when these teams played earlier this season, and we saw the Bears run for 281 yards on these very Eagles in Philadelphia in November. The Rams have unlocked a new counterpunch with their 13 personnel (one back, one wide receiver, three tight ends) packages, and the Eagles are 24th in EPA per play on defense when teams have three tight ends on the field. I'd expect the Rams to run the ball and run it well in a rematch here.

Matthew Stafford didn't have his best game against Philly, going 19-of-33 for 196 yards, two touchdowns and a pick while missing a couple of key throws. The Rams were still good enough to make it into the red zone four times, though, and they went just 1-for-4 once they got there. The Eagles can't count on forcing the Rams to kick field goals or blocking those attempts this time. I think the defending champs' reign stops here.

Prediction:Rams 27, Eagles 21

AFC Championship Game

(6) Buffalo Bills at (2) New England Patriots

And then we get another rematch in the AFC Championship Game. The Bills and Patriots split their regular-season matchups, with the Pats winning 23-20 at Buffalo before the Bills came back from a 21-point deficit to get their revenge 35-31at New England. The Patriots ran for a whopping 246 yards and four touchdowns in that second game, but Drake Maye threw for only 47 yards after the break, and the Bills scored touchdowns on five consecutive drives.

After a dismal first half, the Bills were able to flip the script on Maye in the second half by shifting intomore two-deep looks and disguising their intentions to keep the Patriots from just checking to designed runs. With a lead and facing those two-high looks after the snap, the Patriots dropped back to pass 83.7% of the time in the second half, a remarkable figure given how inefficient they were throwing the ball. New England can't get outcoached with regards to adjustments if the Bills make in-game shifts again.

This was especially frustrating given how effectively the Patriots ran the football. With a 21-0 lead and the Bills struggling to stop the run all season, the Pats should have had no qualms about staying on the ground. They averaged an unreal 9.8 yards per carry in this game, the highest for any team in any game this season that didn't involve the Giants. Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels probably can't count on 52- and 65-yard touchdown runs from TreVeyon Henderson again, but with left tackle Will Campbell(knee) back in the mix, the Pats should be able to lean on their ground game and keep the Buffalo offense off the field.

The Pats didn't do a great job slowing down the Buffalo offense for long in either game. The Bills averaged 38.2 yards per drive in Week 5 and 35.4 yards per possession in Week 15. The only game in which the Patriots allowed more yards per drive came against the Dolphins, all the way back in Week 2. The Bills turned nearly 85% of their series into a first down or a touchdown in the December rematch, the highest rate allowed by the Pats in any game this season.

The difference between the two games from the Pats' perspective, again, came in the red zone. This was the league's third-best red zone offense against its worst red zone defense. In the first game, the Patriots allowed the Bills to make four trips into the red zone, but they came up with an interception and forced a field goal. The Bills also fumbled the ball away inside their own 10-yard line, handing the Pats a short field that they turned into three critical points.

In the rematch, the Bills were merciless. They made five trips into the red zone and scored five touchdowns. (They did technically make a sixth trip, although that ended with Josh Allen kneeling to end the game.) Allen & Co. faced a third down only twice during those five drives while they were inside the red zone. Red zone performance can be inconsistent, and the Patriots will have defensive tackle Milton Williams, who was missing for the December game, but this was their soft spot all season. And I wouldn't want to face a Bills offense using all four downs and willing to throw Allen into the run game with a chance to make it to the Super Bowl.

Again, this would be a matchup of a defense with great cornerbacks and less imposing linebackers and safeties in coverage facing a Bills offense that just wants to exploit those middle-field defenders with bigger personnel groupings. I don't anticipate Maye and the offense shutting down in the second half again, but I'm not confident the Pats can stop Allen for four quarters.

Prediction:Bills 31, Patriots 27

NFC Championship Game

(5) Los Angeles Rams at (1) Seattle Seahawks

Hey, look, another rubber match in a conference championship game! We've seen these teams play eight quarters of football, and for most of that time, the Rams have controlled the action. They've forced Sam Darnold to throw six interceptions, won the first game handily and were in control of the second game with a 30-14 lead and nine minutes to go.

Of course, what happened next mattered. A Rams team that had scored on its six prior possessions against an elite Seahawks defense failed to score on five drives in the fourth quarter. The Seahawks got a punt return touchdown, then took advantage of a short field after a shanked punt to tie the game. Harrison Mevis missed a 47-yard field goal that would have given the Rams the lead in regulation. And in overtime, the Seahawks responded to a Rams touchdown by marching down the field, scoring and picking up a two-pointer to win the game. All that matters.

I'm just not positive it overcomes the majority of what we've seen between these teams. While the Seahawks did slow the league's most efficient run game in the second matchup, Matthew Stafford threw for 457 yards on 49 dropbacks without being sacked. The Seahawks haven't found a way to cover Rams receiverPuka Nacua, and while they shut down the 13 personnel groupings in the first matchup, McVay was able to lean on them and score four touchdowns out of 13 personnel in the rematch. The Rams also were without receiverDavante Adamsin the loss because of ahamstring injury, and the veteran standout should be back in the postseason.

What's more important, though, is the two-month funk Darnold has been in since playing the Rams the first time. Darnold deserves credit for hitting a number of meaningful throws in the fourth quarter and overtime, but the Seahawks basically tried to turn him into a horizontal passer in the first half of that game to get the ball out quick and avoid mistakes, and Darnold got trapped into two interceptions afterward. I don't think the Seahawks can beat this Rams team in a rematch if they get the Darnold who has been one of the NFL's worst quarterbacks for two months.

Prediction:Rams 24, Seahawks 10

Super Bowl LX

(5) Los Angeles Rams at (6) Buffalo Bills

This would be fun, huh? Matthew Stafford vs. Josh Allen. Sean McVay vs. Sean McDermott. Puka Nacua and Davante Adams vs. ... Khalil Shakir and Brandin Cooks.I don't think many people would argue that the Bills have the better roster here, but they have Allen, and sometimes that's enough.

These teams played a wildly entertaining game in Los Angeles last season, with the Rams coming out on top in a 44-42 win. That game was the Allen show, as the non-Allen Bills ran for a total of only 21 yards. Allen didn't turn the ball over and wasn't sacked once, and the Bills scored six touchdowns on nine drives.

That still wasn't enough, in part because the Rams turned the only sudden change of the game into a touchdown when they blocked a punt and returned it for a 22-yard score. They gave the Bills no hope on defense, with Stafford's unit scoring five touchdowns and a field goal across its first seven meaningful possessions.

That Bills team had no answer for Nacua, who caught 12 passes for 162 yards and a touchdown and even added five carries on the ground for 16 yards and a score. I'm not sure this Bills team does, either. Maxwell Hairston might nominally have been drafted to be that sort of cornerback, but he has been sidelined by an ankle injury and has struggled with his focus and concentration at times. The Rams are the wrong sort of team to have those lapses against.

More concerningly, this would be a nightmare of a matchup for the Bills' biggest weakness, pitting the worst run defense in the postseason against one of the most efficient and consistent rushing attacks of the past decade. The Bills were 31st in EPA per play allowed when facing designed runs this season. The Rams' rushing attack was fourth in EPA per play on designated rushes, improving to second over the second half of the season. The run game mismatch would give the Bills fits and keep Allen off the field.

I do like the matchup for Buffalo on offense, where it is very comfortable running and throwing the ball out of multiple tight end groupings against lighter defenses. The Rams would face a real conflict in terms of sticking with their sub packages when the Bills come out with three tight ends, the same conflict the Rams put opposing teams in with their own offense. But the Bills can't move the ball when Allen is standing on the sideline.

If the Bills had an X receiver who could physically overwhelm Los Angeles' cornerbacks, that might be enough to swing the game their way. Amari Cooper, of all people, had 95 yards and a whopping 14 targets when these two teams played a year ago. Because the Bills don't have that guy, though, Allen would need to be perfect to keep up with Stafford, Nacua and the Rams' run game. Allen was something close to that when these two teams played last season, and the Bills still lost. Allen has turned the ball over and taken sacks more often this season, and while he's capable of being the best player on the planet in any single game, I'm not certain he can singlehandedly beat the better team in this matchup.

Super Bowl prediction: Rams 38, Bills 34

• Trent Williams is obviously the Niners' best offensive lineman, by far. He did not play Week 18 vs. Seattle, and he did not practice on Wednesday. It is expected that he will play on Sunday in Philly, but hamstring injuries can linger, and he very clearly is not 100 percent.

• Ricky Pearsall is a starting receiver, and probably the Niners' best deep threat. He did not play Week 18 against the Seahawks, and missed practice on Wednesday.

• The Niners lost top linebacker Fred Warner for the season way back in Week 6. Warner's replacement was Tatum Bethune, who tore his groin Week 18 against the Seahawks. His season is over.

The opening day starting linebacker opposite Warner was Dee Winters, who suffered an ankle injury when he got stepped on against Seattle. Winters was second on the team in snaps played in 2025, behind only CB Deommodore Lenoir. In 2025, Winters had 101 tackles, a pick-six, and 5 pass breakups. He did not practice on Wednesday.

The Niners also have to worry about LB Luke Gifford, who earned a trip to the Pro Bowl for his special teams play this season. He also had a role in the regular defense, getting defensive snaps in 15 of the Niners' regular season games. Gifford has a quad injury, and was limited on Wednesday.

Starting in place of Bethune will be 33-year-old Eric Kendricks. He had 138 tackles, 3 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 INTs for Dallas in 2024. In 2025, he has appeared in just 3 games. There are worse players around the league who are starting at linebacker than Kendricks, in my opinion. Still, the Niners have major issues at linebacker.

Notable players on IR, PUP, suspension, etc.

• LB Fred Warner (IR, eligible to return at any time): Warner is considered by some to be the best off-ball linebacker in the NFL, with four First-Team All Pro nods. He does everything well. He can play the run, he's outstanding in coverage, he can blitz, and he's a smart field general. He suffered a gruesome ankle injury Week 6, and will not play in this game. Warner had 51 tackles, 2 forced fumbles, and 3 pass breakups in 6 games this season.

• DE Nick Bosa (IR, season over): Nick Bosa is a very good pass rusher, though in my opinion not on the level of guys like Myles Garrett, Micah Parsons, and T.J. Watt, to name a few. He had 17 tackles, 2 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles in 3 games before suffering a season-ending torn ACL.

• WR Brandon Aiyuk (left team): Aiyuk had 75 catches for 1342 yards (17.9 YPC) and 7 TDs in 2023, earning a Second-Team All pro nod. He then ""held in"" at Niners training camp in 2024, before eventually landing a four-year deal worth $120 million. He then tore his ACL and MCL during the 49ers' Week 7 matchup against the Chiefs, ending his season.

Aiyuk began 2025 training camp on the PUP, and after a while simply stopped showing up to Niners' facilities, prompting them to place him on the ""reserve/left team"" list, ending his season, and voiding guarantees in his contract. It's unlikely that Aiyuk will ever play for the Niners again.

• DE Mykel Williams: Williams was the 11th overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, and he started the first nine games of the season for the Niners before a season-ending torn ACL and lateral meniscus.

• LB Tatum Bethune: Bethune was Warner's replacement. He suffered a torn groin against the Seahawks Week 18, and his season is over. Bethune had 94 tackles, a sack, and 4 pass breakups as a fill-in. He played well against the run, but was shaky in coverage.

• LB Nick Martin: Martin is mainly a special teamer, but he's worth noting because of the Niners' many other injuries at linebacker.

• OG Ben Bartch: Bartch is a backup guard. He started two games for the Niners this season and weas in a weird rotation with Spencer Burford at LG earlier this season. His absence is noteworthy in case the Niners lose a guard during the game on Sunday, as he is their first guard off the bench.

Pretty good situation to be in.""","GREEN BAY, Wis. -- When the Green Bay Packers kick off Saturday's NFC wild-card game against the Chicago Bears, it will have been three weeks since Jordan Love last took a snap in a game.

Love left with a concussion in the second quarter of a Week 16 overtime loss to the Bears at Soldier Field. He then missed the next two games to close out the season.

Despite it being the longest in-season layoff of his three seasons as the starter, it doesn't feel that long to Love.

""No, it doesn't really,"" Love said Wednesday. ""I think still just practicing all week, staying locked in. Obviously suited up last week, was ready to go. But yeah, you know, it's been a couple weeks, but no it doesn't feel like that, just staying with it in practice.""

Love never actually missed any practice time following the concussion, although he was limited for several days and did not clear the protocol until last week, when he was active for the regular-season finale against Minnesota but was held out to help prevent another injury going into the playoffs.

When asked specifically whether he's worried about rust, Love said he didn't have any concerns.

""He looked good,"" coach Matt LaFleur said of Love's practices the last couple of weeks. ""He had, I would say, a pretty normal workload, so he looked good.""

Love isn't the only player to have gotten some time off near the end of the season. Running back Josh Jacobs, who had been trying to play through a knee injury since mid-November, was one of more than a dozen starters who did not play against the Vikings, and he believes it paid off.

""My body coming into this game is the best I've felt probably in the last six weeks,"" Jacobs said. ""So, it's pretty good. Pretty good situation to be in.""

The seventh-seeded Packers (9-7-1) enter the playoffs on a four-game losing streak, having not won since the first of their two games against the second-seeded Bears (11-6) this season. This will be just the third time these teams have met in the playoffs and the first since the 2010 NFC Championship Game.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1221%2Fr1592126_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 13:01:55.699120

But after a Boston doctor said in December 2021 that Adams had brain injuries consistent with concussions that could come from football, Adams’ father, Alonzo, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Orangeburg County.
The Adams family sued the NFL, NFL Properties, and South Carolina State University, where Phillip Adams played college football.
The NFL and the college both sought to have the case dismissed, but South Carolina state court Judge Charles McCutchen ruled Wednesday the case filed in South Carolina civil court can move forward in Orangeburg County, documents show.
McCutchen ruled that Rock Hill’s Craig Wilkerson and Gedney Howe IV of Charleston, lawyers for the Adams family, showed enough to keep the negligence lawsuit going.","A South Carolina judge has denied the National Football League’s request to dismiss a brain injury lawsuit filed by the family of a former player from Rock Hill who killed six people before committing suicide in 2021.

In April 2021, near his parents York County home, deputies said Phillip Adams shot Dr. Robert Lesslie; his wife, Barbara Lesslie; two of their grandchildren, Adah, 9, and Noah, 5; and two HVAC workers at the house, James Lewis and Robert Shook of Gaston County, N.C.

Adams, 32, died later that day after he shot himself as deputies surrounded his parents’ house, the York County sheriff’s office has said.

But after a Boston doctor said in December 2021 that Adams had brain injuries consistent with concussions that could come from football, Adams’ father, Alonzo, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Orangeburg County. The Adams family sued the NFL, NFL Properties, and South Carolina State University, where Phillip Adams played college football.

The lawsuit claims Adams suffered financial and emotional losses from his football injuries. He played in the NFL from 2010 to 2015 with the San Francisco 49ers, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, Oakland Raiders, New York Jets and Atlanta Falcons, after starring at S.C. State and Rock Hill High School.

The NFL and S.C. State have denied Adams’ claims of negligence, court documents in the case show.

The NFL and the college both sought to have the case dismissed, but South Carolina state court Judge Charles McCutchen ruled Wednesday the case filed in South Carolina civil court can move forward in Orangeburg County, documents show.

McCutchen ruled that Rock Hill’s Craig Wilkerson and Gedney Howe IV of Charleston, lawyers for the Adams family, showed enough to keep the negligence lawsuit going.

The lawsuit alleges the NFL was “engaging in activity which caused concussion and head trauma to Phillip Matthew Adams and latent neurological damage, illnesses, and decline that arise from those head impacts.”

Wednesday’s ruling in state court comes after a federal judge earlier refused to dismiss the case before it was sent to state court.

Timing and brain injury called CTE

Adams’ family claims in the lawsuit he suffered from concussions and had chronic traumatic encephalopathy — a brain condition called CTE sometimes found in former football players that is caused by repeated head trauma.

The judge ruled in favor of the family about the timing of the lawsuit. Adams had not played in the NFL for years when he died.

Yet the Adams family did not know and could not know Adams had CTE until after his death, because the disease can only be found in the brain after death.

“The statute of limitations not only did not run out prior to Plaintiff bringing his claim for negligence, Plaintiff had no legal right to sue for the wrongful death of Decedent until after Decedent’s death, and the diagnosis of CTE was only able to be made posthumously,” McCutchen wrote.

What happens next?

The judge also declined to issue a “summary judgment” that S.C. State sought that would have taken the college out of the case.

The judge also compelled the NFL to send Adams’ lawyers several documents about the NFL’s business practices in South Carolina, including all contracts and agreements entered into by the NFL Properties regarding the failed Carolina Panthers headquarters and practice facility that was supposed to be built in Rock Hill but failed.

It will be the third matchup between the two teams this season, and it's for a chance of advancing to the Divisional Round.

After appearing as the No. 1 seed in the NFC in the final part of the regular season, injuries have taken a toll on the Bears. Chicago was still able to win the NFC North, but dropped to the No. 2 seed in the conference.

Throughout the week, Chicago has been monitoring its top two wide receivers in DJ Moore (knee) and Rome Odunze (foot). Both of their statuses will play a key role in the lead-up to Saturday's matchup.

Bears' DJ Moore (knee) and Rome Odunze (foot) were limited at practice on Wednesday

The Bears have faced injuries to both DJ Moore and Rome Odunze in recent weeks. In Chicago's Wednesday practice report, both pass-catchers were limited.

For Moore, injuries haven't stopped him from playing in all 17 regular-season games for the Bears.

His status will be monitored throughout the week. If he's unable to log a full practice before Saturday's matchup against the Packers, he could be leaning towards missing the contest.

As for Odunze, he hasn't played since the Bears were the No. 1 seed back on Nov. 28.

The second-year receiver was leaning towards a return later in the regular season, but after re-aggravating the stress fracture in his left foot, he's been held out of games over the past month.

Both receivers' injuries will be worth monitoring over the next few days.

""Our plan is to have him be a part of it,"" Bears defensive coordinator Dennis Allen said.
The Bears signed Gordon to a three-year, $40 million contract extension in April 2025, but multiple soft tissue injuries have limited the 2022 second-round pick to just three games this season.
Adding Gordon back into the mix comes at a critical time for the Bears' secondary.
Jaylon Johnson played 72 of 73 snaps against the Lions, which marked his highest percentage of playing time since his Week 12 return.","LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Bears nickel cornerback Kyler Gordon, who was limited in his first practice Wednesday since going on injured reserve for a second time this season, is being factored into the game plan for Saturday's wild-card game against the Packers.

Gordon was designated to return from his second IR stint of the season Monday after missing Chicago's past four games with a groin injury.

""Our plan is to have him be a part of it,"" Bears defensive coordinator Dennis Allen said. ""Today will really be the first day we go out there and go practice, get a chance to see him move around, but I'm excited about getting him back in the fold and seeing what he can do.""

The Bears signed Gordon to a three-year, $40 million contract extension in April 2025, but multiple soft tissue injuries have limited the 2022 second-round pick to just three games this season. He missed a significant portion of training camp and Weeks 1-4 with a hamstring injury, was placed on injured reserve in Week 8 after sustaining calf and groin injuries in practice and then had a second IR stint after injuring his groin in pregame warmups at Green Bay in Week 14.

Adding Gordon back into the mix comes at a critical time for the Bears' secondary. C.J. Gardner-Johnson, who has been filling in for Gordon since signing with Chicago ahead of Week 9, is in the league's concussion protocol. Reserve nickel Nick McCloud has missed the past two games with an illness.

""It gives us another playmaker,"" Allen said of Gordon's return. ""Obviously it's been unfortunate we haven't had him much this season, but he was a guy that, coming into the season, we were really excited about. I feel like he can help us make some plays and help us win.""

While Gordon is expected to see his first game action since Week 13 at Philadelphia, cornerback Tyrique Stevenson's role continues to diminish.

Stevenson has seen his snaps decrease since Week 15 as fellow cornerback Jaylon Johnson picked up more playing time in his return from core muscle surgery. Stevenson played 33 snaps against the Browns, 27 against the Packers and then just 18 against the 49ers. He did not take the field in the regular-season finale against Detroit.

Coach Ben Johnson said Monday that the Bears wanted Johnson and Nahshon Wright to take the bulk of the snaps over Stevenson because they presented a better matchup for the Lions.

Allen said there will be ""a plan in place"" for Stevenson against the Packers.

""I think when the season started, none of us thought Nahshon Wright was going to play the way that he played,"" Allen said. ""So I think some of that has to do with Jaylon being out, and then Nahshon Wright playing really well, and so you kind of go with a hot hand a little bit.""

Jaylon Johnson played 72 of 73 snaps against the Lions, which marked his highest percentage of playing time since his Week 12 return. Despite playing nearly every snap, Johnson expressed that he is still recovering from his mid-September surgery that has limited him to seven games this season.

""I'm not going to get back to my full self until I get a full offseason to really attack my body head to toe. ... Where I can just really take all the time I need to get my body back together,"" Johnson said. ""But right now I'm just as best as I'm going to get out of it.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1213%2Fr1588944_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 13:02:03.170760

Since the start of the 2016 season, the Eagles are 96-41-1 when Johnson starts.
They’re 15-27 when Lane Johnson doesn’t start, including 3-4 this season.","PHILADELPHIA — Lane Johnson practiced with the Eagles for the first time since his Week 11 foot injury, a positive sign that the five-time All-Pro tackle is on pace to return for the postseason opener against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.

Johnson’s official practice status will be revealed when the injury report is released Wednesday afternoon. He was similarly spotted in uniform at practice on Friday, but did not participate. The distinction Wednesday was that he stretched with the team. Last week, Johnson remained off to the side with offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland.

Johnson’s pending return has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks, with reports suggesting he would return, but with practice weeks (and games) going by without Johnson.

The Eagles didn’t put Johnson on injured reserve after he suffered a Lisfranc sprain, an indication that they expected him to return this season. The “when” was the major question. When he did not return in late December, it seemed the postseason opener would be a good date to circle.

Johnson’s value to the Eagles is immense. He’s on track to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is one of the best players in franchise history. Since the start of the 2016 season, the Eagles are 96-41-1 when Johnson starts. They’re 15-27 when Lane Johnson doesn’t start, including 3-4 this season.

Stoutland considers Johnson the prototype at the position, and the Eagles feel comfortable leaving Johnson on an island and allowing an extra player to run a route or help elsewhere with blocking.

“Lane’s a big difference maker, and I know he is working crazy to get himself back, and we will see where that is this week,” coach Nick Sirianni said. “But he’s a difference maker. … He’s one of the best that’s ever done it. I think I kind of get too much into scheme with that. But yeah, he allows you to do some different things.”

Nakobe Dean, Jaelan Phillips, Jalen Carter and Dallas Goedert were also on the practice field Wednesday after dealing with recent injuries.

Herbert, who suffered a fractured left hand in Week 13, said sitting out of last week's game against Denver for precautionary reasons proved beneficial.

""I'd say definitely not taking hits on it last week was probably pretty helpful,"" Herbert said. ""It limited kind of the swelling and just getting back to making sure that you have got full strength, being able to hold onto a football.""

One of the biggest issues for Herbert since the injury has been taking snaps under center and gripping the football with his left hand. While injured, he typically avoided those during the week, opting to take a few on Saturdays and on game days. But for the first time since the injury, Herbert took under-center snaps Wednesday, the earliest in a game week he has done that since the fracture.

""I would say that I was able to do most everything out there,"" Herbert said of Wednesday's practice. ""It's just making sure I can grip on the ball and have two hands on it in the pocket. ... So I think that's been good.""

It was just over a year ago that Herbert and the Chargers clinched a playoff spot on the road with a 40-7 beatdown of New England -- only the Patriots' second home loss by 30-plus points this century. Herbert threw for 238 yards and three touchdowns, and rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey had eight catches for 94 yards and two touchdowns.

That Patriots team, which was 4-13, bears little resemblance to this season's version, which has had one of the league's most surprising turnarounds under first-year coach Mike Vrabel. New England is 14-3 this season, earned the AFC's No. 2 seed and enters the postseason riding a three-game win streak.

For that reason, Herbert said last season's game film isn't very helpful.

""They're not the same team they were last year,"" Herbert said. ""... You turn on the tape and you see a completely different team.""

The Chargers could be heading into this game without one of their most important players. Running back Omarion Hampton, nursing an ankle injury, sat out practice Wednesday and didn't practice all of last week.

Cross, 25, was already under contract through 2026 because the Seahawks exercised his fifth-year option earlier in the season.
Cross has started 62 games, including 14 this season for the Seahawks, who are the No.
“I feel great just being in Seattle, being around my teammates, the organization here,” Cross said.
“I feel like it’ll help me a lot,” Cross said, “just being able to recover and get the reps, get more reps in and refine what I’ve been working on.” ___","RENTON, Wash.(AP) — The Seattle Seahawks have finalized a four-year contract extension with left tackle Charles Cross.

The contract runs through the 2030 season and includes $75 million guaranteed, according to multiple reports. Cross, 25, was already under contract through 2026 because the Seahawks exercised his fifth-year option earlier in the season.

“It means a lot to me,” Cross said Wednesday. “This team, this organization, I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. This place is definitely special, and I believe that and everyone in this building.”

The Seahawks selected Cross in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft with a pick they acquired when they traded Russell Wilson. Cross has started 62 games, including 14 this season for the Seahawks, who are the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs.

“I feel great just being in Seattle, being around my teammates, the organization here,” Cross said.

Cross missed the last three games of the regular season with a hamstring injury, which he said happened during Jason Myers’ game-winning field goal against Indianapolis on Dec. 14. Cross practiced Wednesday and is expected to be back for the playoffs.

The Seahawks received a first-round bye and will host the lowest remaining seed on the weekend of Jan. 17-18, giving Cross plenty of time to get back to full strength.

“I feel like it’ll help me a lot,” Cross said, “just being able to recover and get the reps, get more reps in and refine what I’ve been working on.”

Johnson was diagnosed with a Lisfranc sprain in his right foot, which forced him to sit out the latter part of the regular season for the Eagles. The six-time Pro Bowler, however, has been working hard behind the scenes to get himself ready for the NFL playoffs, and it appears that Johnson is finally set to reap the rewards of his labor.

Johnson was an integral part of the Eagles’ championship run last season, and they will need him healthy in the playoffs this year as they look to defend their crown.

The good news for the Eagles is that Johnson is now trending in the right direction ahead of Sunday’s wild-card matchup against the San Francisco 49ers. The team announced on Wednesday that Johnson finally returned to practice after an extended absence.

The last time Johnson practiced was in mid-November before he suffered his midfoot injury. The fact that he was able to practice on Wednesday, albeit in a limited capacity, is a significant step toward his recovery and his potential comeback for Sunday’s big game.

The Eagles practice again on Thursday and Friday, and Johnson’s status for those sessions will be worth monitoring. It would only make sense that the 35-year-old is able to turn in at least one full practice before he’s given the green light to suit up on Sunday against the Niners.

Another crucial development for the Eagles is Jalen Carter’s return to practice. The two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle missed four out of the last five games due to shoulder and hip injuries, but he, too, is making significant progress ahead of the wild-card showdown on Sunday.

Johnson, who suffered a Lisfranc sprain against the Detroit Lions on Nov. 16, practiced for the first time on Jan. 7 since suffering the injury in preparation for the Eagles' wildcard playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers on Jan. 11.

In addition, five other starters held out of the Eagles' 24-17 loss to the Commanders on Jan. 4 all returned to practice as well. They are DT Jalen Carter (hip), TE Dallas Goedert (knee), LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring), DE Jaelan Phillips (ankle) and S Marcus Epps (concussion).

Phillips was listed as a full participant, while Johnson, Carter, Dean, Goedert, Epps and Johnson were listed as limited on the Eagles' first injury report of the week. The only players who didn't practice were backups injured against Washington. They are TE Grant Calcaterra (knee/ankle) and OL Brett Toth (concussion).

Before the Jan. 7 practice, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni raved about Johnson, who's in his 13th season and considered one of the top tackles in the NFL.

Sirianni called Johnson ""a difference maker."" That effusive praise could indicate that Sirianni is expecting Johnson, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, to return against the 49ers.

""Obviously, Lane’s a big difference maker,"" Sirianni said. ""I know he’s working like crazy to get himself back. We’ll see where that is this week. But he’s a difference-maker. He’s one of the best who’s ever done it.""

Fred Johnson has replaced Lane Johnson at right tackle for the past seven games. The Eagles have gone 3-4 this season without Lane Johnson. That was a snapshot of the vast disparity in the Eagles' record when Lane Johnson plays versus when he does not over his 13-year career.

The Eagles are 110-57-1 when Lane Johnson plays, a winning percentage of .658. They're 18-27 when the 35-year-old does not play, a winning percentage of .400.

It's easy to see why, although Sirianni wouldn't divulge those reasons because of ""scheme."" Basically, the Eagles don't need to provide help when Johnson is at right tackle, and that frees up other aspects of how the Eagles block.

That can open up running room for Saquon Barkley, and provide more time for quarterback Jalen Hurts to pass, or run himself.

""He allows you to do some different things,"" Sirianni said about Lane Johnson. ""Again, Fred has done a nice job when he came in and played for him. We won a lot of games with Fred in the lineup.

""Lane is just a difference-maker. And it can affect everything. There’s a reason he’s going to the Hall of Fame. There’s a reason he’s going to be in the Eagles Hall of Fame, the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He’s one of the best ever to do it at that position.

Mercogliano,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6945769/2026/01/07/rangers-usa-olympics-roster-adam-fox/,"Soon after, he had individual conversations with Sullivan and Drury, who, the source said, had kept him informed throughout the process.
What came out of nowhere was a text indicating Fox was the one being placed on LTIR with a lower-body injury.
Even at full strength — something we haven’t seen very often this season — this team has clearly hit a wall.
“I think that I play with an edge and a competitiveness that can help win hockey games — and meaningful hockey games,” Trocheck said.
It’s probably a combination of the two, which calls into question whether Rempe should have taken more time to heal.","TARRYTOWN, N.Y. — I spent a good chunk of Tuesday’s off day working on this column, which included information on the fallout from Adam Fox missing the cut for the U.S. Olympic team.

I wrote that New York Rangers coach Mike Sullivan, team president Chris Drury and assistant coach David Quinn — all members of the American staff in some capacity — went to bat for Fox but were overruled by U.S. general manager Bill Guerin, according to a league source who was granted anonymity so they could speak freely about a sensitive issue. Fox heard the news directly from Guerin following last week’s 6-3 loss to the Washington Capitals, I was told, receiving the call shortly before the Rangers took off for the Winter Classic in Miami. Soon after, he had individual conversations with Sullivan and Drury, who, the source said, had kept him informed throughout the process. Another source who was briefed on the situation indicated the bulk of Fox’s ire was directed at Guerin, while admitting it’s hard not to wonder how the snub will affect his relationship with New York brass.

A few hours later, it all became an afterthought.

We had been anticipating news on goalie Igor Shesterkin, who sustained a lower-body injury during Monday’s 3-2 overtime loss to the Utah Mammoth and was unable to put weight on his left leg in a deflating scene at Madison Square Garden. It turns out he’s being placed on injured reserve, which beats the alternative of long-term IR, but a league source cautioned that we shouldn’t jump to any conclusions about a short absence. More time will be required to determine a potential return date.

What came out of nowhere was a text indicating Fox was the one being placed on LTIR with a lower-body injury. I responded by asking if that was a typo.

I noticed when Fox didn’t take the ice for the first shift of Monday’s OT but figured he was gassed and we’d see him on the next one. It never made it that far, with Utah defenseman Sean Durzi scoring the winner 1:06 in.

There was no obvious collision or incident, but from what I can gather, Fox felt something on a shift that ended with 59 seconds left in regulation. By Tuesday morning, the condition had worsened.

The surprising LTIR move puts the 27-year-old defenseman on the shelf for a minimum of 10 games and 24 days, making his earliest possible return date Jan. 31 in Pittsburgh. That’s the second-to-last game before the Olympic break, and while the injury isn’t considered season-threatening, there’s at least a chance we won’t see Fox again until late February or March if they play it conservatively. It almost surely rules him out as a potential injury replacement for Team USA.

As for the Rangers, I already wrote that missing Shesterkin for any length of time should serve as a nudge for Drury to go into sell mode. Fox’s injury only amplifies that message.

Even at full strength — something we haven’t seen very often this season — this team has clearly hit a wall. The Rangers entered Tuesday last in the Eastern Conference in points percentage (.523) and goals per game (2.59), with only two regulation wins in their last 15 games.

There are no Band-Aids or quick fixes for a roster that’s already proven to be too slow (as we saw again versus the Mammoth), too reliant on its goaltending (which just took a major hit) and severely lacking offensive punch (which suffers in a big way without Fox, especially on the power play). They were clinging to hope for a second-half rally, but that has been dashed now that they’re without their two best players for an undetermined amount of time.

Delaying the inevitable would threaten to set the Rangers back even further. Owner James Dolan went on WFAN Radio on Monday and preached patience while affirming his confidence in Drury, essentially giving the GM the green light to proceed as he sees fit. It’s time to take Dolan at his word and use the March 6 trade deadline to restock a bare cupboard with young players and draft picks.

Trocheck ‘not naive’ about his place on Team USA

In a video that was released by USA Hockey last week, Guerin was filmed calling each player who made the squad for the upcoming Olympics in Milan.

About four minutes in, Rangers center Vincent Trocheck can be heard on the other line saying, “Whatever you need, you know that.”

The inference was fairly obvious: The 32-year-old is willing to do any grunt work required to bring value to a team that had plenty of competition for the final few forward spots.

Trocheck is self-aware enough to recognize that some serious talent was left off the U.S. roster and sounded sympathetic to their plight while discussing his inclusion following Sunday’s practice.

“I’m not naive to the fact that I may not be the Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Jack Hughes type where I’m gonna dazzle with my skill and put up 100 points every year,” he told The Athletic from his locker at the MSG Training Center. “There were obviously some guys that were left off the list that have that in their game, and from a stats perspective, may have more points than (me). But I think the one thing that I was kind of falling back on and really hoping to make the team for was the intangibles that I bring.”

Guerin has repeatedly stressed the importance of building a complementary team rather than just a collection of all-stars, with Trocheck embodying that sentiment. He can’t match the production of Jason Robertson (24 goals and 25 assists through 42 games played) or Cole Caufield (20 goals and 20 assists through 42 games), who were both deserving in their own right. But Sullivan has referred to Trocheck as a “glue guy” who may be better suited as a checking fourth-liner or plug-and-play extra.

“I think that I play with an edge and a competitiveness that can help win hockey games — and meaningful hockey games,” Trocheck said. “At these types of tournaments, special teams go a long way. Being able to be on the penalty kill and do those types of things, I think, is part of the reason that I made the team.”

Another element that may be overlooked while picking names off the NHL leaderboard is cohesiveness.

Guerin, Sullivan and the U.S. leadership group believe the team they sent to last year’s 4 Nations Face-Off clicked on and off the ice, capturing a feeling of camaraderie that they wanted to tinker with as little as possible. That aided Trocheck’s case, as well as Rangers captain J.T. Miller.

“That’s something that a lot of the European teams have an advantage with, is that they get to play together so much more often, I feel like, and they have a ton of chemistry,” Trocheck said. “I think the teams are starting to realize that is a factor. If you’re able to keep guys comfortable and familiar with guys that they play with, in a short tournament like this where you have to get together and get ready for the games (quickly), I think that goes a certain distance.”

Perreault focused on ‘subtleties’

When it comes to the progress of top prospect Gabe Perreault, Sullivan is focused on what he described as “subtleties.”

He and the Rangers coaching staff firmly believe in the 20-year-old forward’s playmaking ability, but they’re closely monitoring how he looks away from the puck, on defense and in physical situations.

“One of his biggest strengths is his hockey IQ, and part of that process is figuring out how he could have success in those subtle circumstances that we’re talking about,” Sullivan explained Monday. “He’s an undersized guy. What strategies can he utilize to win wall battles on a breakout, on a rim, or puck battles in the corners? He’s not going to win pucks with physically overpowering people. He’s got to use his brain, his quickness, his stick skills. There’s an experiential learning process that he’s going through with respect to that. So I think Gabe is figuring it out, literally, with every game that he plays, and I think his hockey IQ is what’s going to allow him to do that.”

The Rangers initially valued allowing Perreault to work through those growing pains with AHL Hartford, where he’s appeared in 20 games so far this season, but the scoring deficiencies and mounting injuries of the NHL club necessitated two separate recalls. Sullivan thought he looked “overwhelmed” during his first stint in November, but he’s given the 5-foot-11, 180-pounder a longer runway since returning to New York in mid-December.

Perreault has appeared in eight of the last nine games, with mixed results. He carried a three-game point streak into Christmas break but looked a step behind against the speedy Mammoth.

He said the game is “starting to slow down,” but there’s a long way to go to reach the potential the Rangers see in their 2023 first-round pick. The key will be learning to navigate tight NHL ice and create enough space to let his offensive creativity take hold, which will require repetition and recognition. As Perreault put it, “You don’t really know what it’s like until you’re in it.”

“It’s kind of a mix of all those things: being more comfortable, more confident, knowing how to use your body and putting yourself in the right spot so you don’t get beat,” he added. “I’ve done that at every level. I’ve never been the biggest guy, so I was always kind of finding little ways to put myself in the right spot. I’m starting to figure that out.”

He’s recently been skating on a line with Trocheck and Alexis Lafrenière, with that trio producing a 61.27 percent expected goals-for rate, according to Natural Stat Trick. They hold a 13-4 advantage in high-danger scoring chances, but have yet to convert any into goals.

Perreault chalked some of that up to not “getting too lucky with our bounces,” which he believes will turn soon. He’s enjoyed playing with Lafrenière, with whom he relishes the chance to speak French, and lauded Trocheck as his locker-room mentor.

“Since I got here, he’s always kind of taking me under his wing and making sure I’m all good and talking to me a bunch,” he said. “Lucky enough, I’ve been playing with him, and I feel comfortable with him. He’s been really great since the start.”

Rempe ‘still has some limitations’

Early in Monday’s contest, Rangers forward Matt Rempe laid a big hit on Mammoth forward Kevin Stenlund and was immediately swarmed by Daniil But. A scrum ensued, but doctors have cautioned Rempe to avoid dropping the gloves as he continues to recover from left-thumb surgery.

It sounds like the 6-foot-9, 261-pounder may be restricted beyond just fighting.

“He still has some limitations,” Sullivan admitted following Sunday’s practice. “He’s still in the process of getting completely healthy.”

Rempe’s underlying numbers have been solid in 10 games since his return, with a 55.72 percent xGF that ranks fourth among Rangers forwards since Dec. 15. But he’s gone without a point in that span and hasn’t logged more than 9:16 time on ice in any contest. The 23-year-old was at 9:27 TOI or higher in every game before his injury, with the recent dip either a sign of Sullivan’s ongoing concern for the thumb or diminishing faith in his bottom six.

It’s probably a combination of the two, which calls into question whether Rempe should have taken more time to heal. It also speaks to the lack of depth and underwhelming alternatives throughout the organization.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/06150801/GettyImages-1470638235-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-08 00:01:17.014539

Odunze made the assertion and then slowly backed away from a full guarantee, considering coaches prefer to use uncertainty as a competitive advantage. No reason to get coach Ben Johnson angry right now. Odunze couched his claim, saying he has been planning to play for weeks.

But, if we’re reading between the lines here, it sure seems like, barring a setback, Odunze will play in the NFC wild-card round contest at Soldier Field.

The second-year pro has had setbacks before. He aggravated a stress fracture in his foot during pregame warmups prior to a Week 15 clash with the Cleveland Browns. The Bears essentially shut him down at that point and gave him a new target.

Work to be ready for the playoffs.

[READ: How Bears QB Caleb Williams evolved under Ben Johnson’s hard coaching]

“Everything’s been focused on that. Everything, honestly,” Odunze said after Wednesday’s practice. “All my energy, my focus, my attitude has been on that mark. Trying to get back as soon as possible. That was, like I said earlier, kind of changed to different weeks, time to time. When I got to an understanding with the training staff that this would be my benchmark, I put all my energy and effort into that. Excited for this week.”

Odzune missed five consecutive games with his foot injury, but he had been dealing with heel and ankle issues most of the season. That led to some lackluster totals for the Bears’ No. 1 receiver, with just 44 catches for 661 yards and six touchdowns. He was cruising to start the season, but the injuries sapped his effectiveness down the stretch.

He plans to be back now, when it matters most. It’s fair to wonder about how much he can contribute, considering his prolonged absences from games and practices. Odunze has worked on conditioning, but it’s impossible to remain in peak football shape after missing so much practice.

[READ: Ben Johnson, Bears captains define what’s required for NFL playoff success]

“I can definitely provide an asset to this offense,” Odunze said. “It’s tough being out for five weeks and having to be on the sideline and have all that happen and go through that, the ups and downs of the season and not being able to contribute. As long as I have the option to be out there and contribute, I’m going to give it my all. I believe I can make a difference.”

The Bears won’t expect him to assume his typical workload, where he rarely leaves the field. They’ve been fortunate to receive standout contributions from DJ Moore, Colston Loveland, Luther Burden III and Cole Kmet in Odunze’s absence.

[READ: How Luther Burden III has earned Bears’ trust, Caleb Williams’ targets]

Odunze, last year’s No. 9 overall draft pick, can make big plays for Chicago, as he has so many times this year. The coaching staff will formulate a plan for effective usage based upon how Odunze looks in practice.

“You don’t want to be giving him way too much, and yet, he’s a guy that can help us, and so we’ll be evaluating that over the next, you know, three days of practice, as we get to kind of finalize this plan and put that stuff together,” Bears offensive coordinator Declan Doyle said. “Anytime that he can be a part of it, certainly want to be able to use him and maximize the time that he’s out in the field and get him the ball, but really, it’s the same with all of our players. We always have plays for each guy specifically, and you know, we’re excited to have him back.”

[WATCH: The Chicago Football Show: Bears season 2.0 now begins]

Limitations should be expected but tolerated. Getting Odunze back on the field would be a huge boon for the Bears, as someone who must be respected by the Packers’ defense on every snap.

“I’m looking to be out there as much as possible,” Odunze said. “Make as many plays as I can. At the end of the day, it’s all or nothing for this game to make it to the Super Bowl until the end of the season. I want to contribute as much as possible and put everything that I have out there on the field. That’s my mentality.”",https://dupvhm5r1oaxt.cloudfront.net/uploads/2026/01/rome-odunze-bears-packers.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 20:00:21.708695

Johnson, 35, hasn’t played since suffering a Lisfranc sprain in his foot against the Lions on Nov. 16. He missed the final seven games of the regular season but the future Hall of Famer has been eyeing a return by the playoffs. Johnson made an appearance at Friday’s practice but did not participate.

It’s obvious that it would be a big boost for the Eagles’ offense to get Johnson back against the 49ers.

“Yeah, Lane's the best right tackle in the game, so if we get him back, it's tremendous,” offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo said. “He'll add so much to everything. Just even his leadership, his play-style ability, run-pass, doesn't matter. It'll be a tremendous lift for the whole entire offense and I think you'll feel the energy if he's out there.”

While the Eagles got a solid level of play from his backup Fred Johnson over the last month and a half, it would really help to get the starter back in the lineup. The Eagles in the regular season were 8-2 with Johnson at right tackle and were 3-4 without him.

And since the start of the 2016 season, here’s a look at the Eagles’ record with and without Johnson:

With Johnson: 94-41-1

Without Johnson: 15-27

It would also be a big boost for the Eagles’ defense to get Dean back. The Eagles’ starting middle linebacker suffered a hamstring injury against the Commanders in Week 16 and missed the final two weeks of the season.

On Tuesday, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said he expects Dean to play in this game.

Dean, 25, began the season on the PUP list after tearing his patellar tendon against the Packers in the wild-card round last season. He returned to the field in Week 6 and returned to the defense in Week 7. Since returning to the lineup, Dean had 55 tackles, 4 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 7 TFLs and 6 QB hits.

In addition to Johnson and Dean, the Eagles also saw Marcus Epps (concussion) return to practice, along with Jalen Carter (hip), Dallas Goedert (knee) and Jaelan Phillips (ankle). The two notable players missing on Wednesday were OL Brett Toth (concussion) and Grant Calcaterra (knee/ankle).

But there’s looking like the Eagles will have 21 of 22 starters on Sunday against the 49ers. The only regular starter on IR is safety Andrew Mukuba, who suffered a fractured ankle in Dallas in late November.

The 49ers, meanwhile, are still a bit banged up heading into this wild-card round. A few key players were not participating in practice to start the week out there:

The two names on that list to watch closely this week are Trent Williams (hamstring) and Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle).

Calcaterra suffered knee and ankle injuries after being taken down with a hip drop tackle in the Eagles’ Week 18 game against the Washington Commanders. He is now listed with just an ankle injury. Not trying to be harsh but his absence could be a case of addition by subtraction since the Eagles try to run behind him and it typically doesn’t go well since he’s not a great blocker. If Calcaterra can’t play, the Eagles will have at least three active tight ends: Dallas Goedert, Kylen Granson, and Cameron Latu. If they want a fourth tight end, they can opt to temporarily elevate E.J. Jenkins from the practice squad.

Toth suffered a concussion in the Eagles’ Week 18 game. If he’s not able to at least return to practice in a limited capacity by Thursday, I’m thinking he won’t be able to play on Sunday. Toth is typically the top backup at guard and center, so, it remains to be seen how the team would replace him if applicable. They could go with Matt Pryor as the top backup at both guard spots and Drew Kendall at center. Or perhaps Kendall’s inexperience would prompt them to slide Landon Dickerson to center and put Pryor at left guard.

Johnson returned to practice for the first time since suffering a Lisfranc injury in Week 11. There were initially some conflicting reports on Johnson’s status for this weekend but then Brian Baldinger tweeted that Johnson WILL be playing. Of course, that tweet has since been deleted. But NFL insider Adam Schefter also sounded pretty sure Johnson will suit up. It sure seems like Johnson will at least try to give it a go … but we’ll see if he’s able to make it through the entire game, assuming he does play.

Dean told reporters that he is “definitely playing” on Sunday. The limited workload is likely about the Eagles helping him ease back in to practice after suffering a hamstring injury.

Goedert missed practice last week with a knee injury. The Eagles are probably ramping him up to get him to Sunday.

Epps suffered a concussion in practice last week. That he’s been upgraded to limited participation indicates he’s progressing towards a return. Barring any setbacks, he should be on track to start at safety against the 49ers.

Phillips didn’t get a true bye week this season since the Miami Dolphins traded him before they had one. The Eagles gave Phillips time off last week to allow him to get some of that much-needed rest. Now he’s back in full and ready to play.

The Eagles opened Ojulari’s 21-day practice window to return from injured reserve earlier on Wednesday. The thinking here is that they’re keeping him on standby in case they suffer some edge defender injuries during their potential playoff run.

The 49ers have yet to announce their injury report (damn West Coast time) but it’s well-known that they’re banged up. And not just because they have a bunch of key players on injured reserve.

He made his season debut in Week 6 against the Giants and returned to the starting lineup two weeks later. In 10 games, Dean posted 55 tackles, four sacks, two forced fumbles, and a pass defensed.

The linebacker position is very much in flux for the 49ers.

We’ll update this post once the 49ers issue their injury report.","The Philadelphia Eagles issued their first official injury report in advance of their Wild Card playoff home game against the San Francisco 49ers.

The Eagles listed two players under DID NOT PARTICIPATE: Grant Calcaterra and Brett Toth.

Calcaterra suffered knee and ankle injuries after being taken down with a hip drop tackle in the Eagles’ Week 18 game against the Washington Commanders. He is now listed with just an ankle injury. Not trying to be harsh but his absence could be a case of addition by subtraction since the Eagles try to run behind him and it typically doesn’t go well since he’s not a great blocker. If Calcaterra can’t play, the Eagles will have at least three active tight ends: Dallas Goedert, Kylen Granson, and Cameron Latu. If they want a fourth tight end, they can opt to temporarily elevate E.J. Jenkins from the practice squad.

Toth suffered a concussion in the Eagles’ Week 18 game. If he’s not able to at least return to practice in a limited capacity by Thursday, I’m thinking he won’t be able to play on Sunday. Toth is typically the top backup at guard and center, so, it remains to be seen how the team would replace him if applicable. They could go with Matt Pryor as the top backup at both guard spots and Drew Kendall at center. Or perhaps Kendall’s inexperience would prompt them to slide Landon Dickerson to center and put Pryor at left guard.

The Eagles listed five players under LIMITED PARTICIPATION: Lane Johnson, Jalen Carter, Nakobe Dean, Dallas Goedert, and Marcus Epps.

Johnson returned to practice for the first time since suffering a Lisfranc injury in Week 11. There were initially some conflicting reports on Johnson’s status for this weekend but then Brian Baldinger tweeted that Johnson WILL be playing. Of course, that tweet has since been deleted. But NFL insider Adam Schefter also sounded pretty sure Johnson will suit up. It sure seems like Johnson will at least try to give it a go … but we’ll see if he’s able to make it through the entire game, assuming he does play.

Carter apparently suffered a hip injury in practice last week. There’s no indication he won’t play against the 49ers.

Dean told reporters that he is “definitely playing” on Sunday. The limited workload is likely about the Eagles helping him ease back in to practice after suffering a hamstring injury.

Goedert missed practice last week with a knee injury. The Eagles are probably ramping him up to get him to Sunday.

Epps suffered a concussion in practice last week. That he’s been upgraded to limited participation indicates he’s progressing towards a return. Barring any setbacks, he should be on track to start at safety against the 49ers.

The Eagles listed two players under FULL PARTICIPATION: Jaelan Phillips and Azeez Ojulari.

Phillips didn’t get a true bye week this season since the Miami Dolphins traded him before they had one. The Eagles gave Phillips time off last week to allow him to get some of that much-needed rest. Now he’s back in full and ready to play.

The Eagles opened Ojulari’s 21-day practice window to return from injured reserve earlier on Wednesday. The thinking here is that they’re keeping him on standby in case they suffer some edge defender injuries during their potential playoff run.

The 49ers have yet to announce their injury report (damn West Coast time) but it’s well-known that they’re banged up. And not just because they have a bunch of key players on injured reserve. Their active roster is facing some key injuries, including starting left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall.

After returning to the practice field for the first time in weeks last Friday, New England’s top linebacker was back to work with the team on Wednesday in their first practice of wild card week.

Spillane, who did not play in team’s last four games with an ankle/foot injury, was always targeting a return for Sunday.

“No doubt,” Spillane said. “It was always a goal to be ready for Week 1 of the playoffs.”

The 30-year-old was first bothered by injury back in Week 13 when he played a season-low 39 snaps in a Monday night victory over the New York Giants. Following the team’s bye week, Spillane was then active in an emergency-only role in Week 15. After being spotted with a walking boot in the locker room, he was inactive for the final three weeks of the season.

“I’m feeling great,” Spillane said Wednesday. “To be a part of this moment is very special to me and I don’t take it lightly or for granted.”

In Spillane’s absence, New England relied primarily on linebackers Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. Even without their captain and leading tackler on the field, Spillane continued to make his presence felt.

“Rob’s been unbelievable all season and even since going down just as a leader, as someone to get advice from, to support us, to bring energy to the meeting rooms, to the practice field, on the sidelines [Sunday],” Gibbens said. “Just constantly talking to us and continuing to be that veteran presence that we need in our room and bring energy and support the guys. He’s been awesome.”

Returning for the playoffs, Spillane will now be tasked with helping New England’s defense slow down Justin Herbert and the Chargers offense. The the linebacker is confident he and his teammates will take advantage of the opportunity.

“You continue to work. You continue to trust the process. You focus on the details, the things that you need to do to have a great outcome on Sunday,” he said. “I think as a collection, as a group, I couldn’t be more proud of the confidence level, the focus level of the group.”",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2245412327.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2026-01-07 20:00:38.059717

But now, as the Green Bay Packers return to Chicago for a wild-card playoff game with the Bears on Saturday, Jan. 10, they'll have their starting quarterback back.

Love is a full-go ahead of the playoffs after not playing the last 2½ games. And Packers coach Matt LaFleur is excited to see what his 27-year-old quarterback can do in the postseason.

""I’ve got a ton of confidence in him,"" LaFleur said Tuesday, Jan. 6. ""... I think that there’s nobody else I’d rather have than Jordan.""

Here's what to know about Love's playing status ahead of the playoffs:

Jordan Love injury update

He wasn't listed on the injury report Tuesday, Jan. 6 and is ready for another playoff run with the Packers.

Love actually cleared concussion protocol ahead of the Packers' Week 18 game against the Minnesota Vikings but LaFleur held him out, along with many of the team's starters, since Green Bay's playoff seed was already locked up.

Love was the backup to since-released third-stringer Clayton Tune in that game and only would have played in an emergency.

Buy Packers tickets on StubHub

Is Jordan Love playing vs Bears in playoffs?

Yes, Love is returning for the Packers against the Bears in the wild-card round of the playoffs on Saturday, Jan. 10.

It'll be his first action since his concussion on a helmet-to-helmet hit by Bears defensive end Austin Booker in the second quarter of the Packers' Week 16 game in Chicago, which ended with Green Bay collapsing in an 22-16 overtime loss. Love missed the team's Week 17 game against the Baltimore Ravens after not clearing the concussion protocol. He was active in the Week 18 game but, to avoid the chance of injury in what was a meaningless game, he didn't play.

This will be Love's fourth playoff game in three years as the starting quarterback. He's made the playoffs every season since taking over as the starter for Aaron Rodgers in 2023.

Jordan Love history in the playoffs

Love is 1-2 as a starter in the playoffs for the Packers, who have been the seventh seed in each of the last three years in the postseason.

Love hasn't had a home playoff game and won't again in 2025.

In his first playoff game two years ago, he led a surging Packers team into AT&T Stadium and torched the Dallas Cowboys, 48-32, in a wild-card game. He had three touchdown passes and a near-perfect passer rating. The Packers lost the next week in the divisional round to the San Francisco 49ers, 24-21, on a game that ended with Love throwing an interception as he looked to get the team in field-goal range.

In the playoffs last year, Love's three-interception performance was part of the Packers' dismal showing in a 22-10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/28/PMJS/87930466007-gan-20251227-rgo-sh-5-009.JPG?crop=4545,2558,x0,y73&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 18:01:27.058414

Tuesday, the Bills put in place a contingency plan in case Prater can’t recover as they signed kicker Matthew Wright to their practice squad.","ORCHARD PARK - The hits just keep coming for the injury-ravaged Buffalo Bills as they had to place defensive tackle Jordan Phillips on the injured reserve list Wednesday morning.

Phillips missed the Cleveland and Philadelphia games with an ankle injury, then played against New York last Sunday but apparently aggravated the injury to the point where he won’t be able to play in Sunday’s AFC wildcard game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

As for the rest of the injury report before the Bills took the field for their walk-through practice, coach Sean McDermott listed linebackers Matt Milano and Terrell Bernard, cornerback Maxwell Harrison, running back Ty Johnson and kicker Matt Prater as non-participants.

In the limited category, and remembering that in a walk-through everyone is essentially limited, McDermott listed tight end Dalton Kincaid, defensive tackle DaQuan Jones, safety Jordan Poyer, and linebacker Shaq Thompson. McDermott also said the team is opening safety Damar Hamlin’s 21-day practice window on Thursday.

Dane Jackson signed from practice squad

To fill Phillips’ spot on the 53-man roster, the Bills signed cornerback Dane Jackson off their practice squad, and that was necessary because rookie Hairston suffered an ankle injury against the Jets and McDermott has already said he won’t be able to play Sunday.

Jackson will be the primary backup for Christian Benford and Tre’Davious White, with White - who has been sharing his spot with Hairston - likely to play the full game.

“Dane’s always been a guy that’s done a great job for us,” McDermott said. “When he was first here, first came around, right away you notice the intangibles that Dane Jackson brings to the table - his toughness, his football instincts, his blue-collar approach, and he’s a great teammate. So it’s great to have someone like Dane that we can rely on in a situation like this.”

Without Phillips at defensive tackle, the Bills will have to roll with Jones, rookies TJ Sanders and Deone Walker, and probably Larry Ogunjobi, though they could also dress Phidarian Mathis.

Bills sign two others to practice squad

The never-ending practice squad shuffle, which has been quite a thing this season, also continued as the Bills signed cornerback Daryl Porter and quarterback Shane Buechele.

Porter, a rookie, was most recently on the Steelers practice squad before being released last week. He fills Jackson’s spot on the practice squad. Buechele spent most of the season with the Bills before the Chiefs signed him to their active roster late in the season and he played last Sunday in Kansas City’s finale against the Raiders, completing 7 of 14 passes for 88 yards, the first regular-season playing time of his career.

He will be the scout team quarterback this week, which frees up Mitchell Trubisky to take the backup reps behind Josh Allen.

While Hairston and Bernard are almost certainly out, Prater’s status is fluid. The 41-year-old kicker reinjured his quad muscle against the Jets and could not finish the game. Tuesday, the Bills put in place a contingency plan in case Prater can’t recover as they signed kicker Matthew Wright to their practice squad.

But while Prater took Wednesday off, McDermott said he will test his leg Thursday.

“We won’t kick Matt today, but we will try and kick him tomorrow so we can kind of get a feel for where he’s at and hopefully he’s good to go as of tomorrow,” McDermott said. “This is just on a day-by-day; right now that’s the plan and we can take a look tomorrow and just see where he’s at and then hopefully all is well and he gets a chance to then kind of get back to some rest after that as we head into game time.”","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/09/PROC/85591974007-usatsi-26813612.jpg?crop=7172,4035,x0,y771&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 19:02:25.449280

As a division winner, they earned a home game Wild Card weekend. The bad news? Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams (12-5) will be lining up opposite them this weekend in Charlotte.

All kidding aside, the task is large as the 10-point spread indicates. But wait! The Panthers played the Rams in Week 13…and won in Charlotte, 31-28. Bryce Young threw three touchdowns and forced the Rams into three turnovers that afternoon. History says a win is possible but replicating that outcome will not be easy for Carolina.

The Rams’ offense is elite. No team scored more points (518) than Los Angeles during the regular season. The Patriots were a distant second with a total of 490 points scored. Threats to score lurk all over the field for the Rams. Davante Adams scored 14 times this season. Puka Nacua found the endzone 10 times. Kyren Williams crossed the goal line ten times as well and Blake Corum contributed six touchdowns himself.

The Panthers ranked 27th in the regular season averaging just 18.3 points per game. Carolina’s game plan in Week 13 focused on the run game and it worked as the Panthers gained 164 yards on 40 carries. Rookie Tetairoa McMillan caught just one pass that day, but it was a 43-yard touchdown grab. He needs to be more involved in the rematch.

Carolina’s hope lies in again establishing the run game and keeping Bryce Young upright. If they do both those things they will shorten the number of possessions with an eye on keeping it within a score going into the fourth quarter. The Rams are the more talented team at maybe every position on the field. MVP-favorite Matthew Stafford needs to play like one. If he does, the Rams will roll to an easy, rocking chair win Wild Card weekend.

This is the Panthers first trip to the postseason since 2017. They lost in the Wild Card Round to New Orleans that season, 31-26. The Rams were in the playoffs last year. After defeating the Vikings 27-9 in the Wild Card round they lost 28-22 to the Eagles in the Divisional Round.

The up-tempo, shotgun-centric ""Air Raid"" (with adjustments) offense has been his thing. Good, bad, in the middle, regardless of location or role. He's always been a tireless worker: Back in 2022, ""Hard Knocks"" captured him waking up just after 3 a.m. and arriving at the Arizona Cardinals' practice facility before 4 a.m., citing his playing career not reaching the heights he wanted as a motivating factor. With the Washington Commanders, he and Daniels were consistently among the first people at the facility.

""I'm pretty consistent with the coaching style,"" Kingsbury said early in 2025 training camp, when he was coming off the Commanders' breakthrough.

NFL Power Rankings: Big miss on Seahawks and preseason top 10 as Chiefs, Lions miss postseason

Pete Prisco

And near the end of the year, Washington's disappointing 5-12 season that proved his ouster?

""Yeah, I've seen [the no-huddle offense] done at a high level you know, whether it's Arizona or here at a very high level and won games and had a lot of yards, a lot of success in that regard. So, I think I'm pretty confident, you know, in that style of play when the pieces are there that you can play a really high level, and it's a very challenging offensive stop.""

Kingsbury, 46, didn't have the pieces this year; that much is certain. Daniels played in just seven games, and he left three of those seven early. All parties involved wished Terry McLaurin's extension had been done earlier so he could have had more time to grow with Daniels in training camp and get into football shape: McLaurin suffered a quad injury in Week 3 and played in a career-low 10 games. The team's other top outside wide receiver, Noah Brown, appeared in just four games. The offensive line wasn't whole until mid-October.

And yet the Commanders still finished 12th in offensive success rate and won games with not only Daniels but Marcus Mariota and Josh Johnson. Players spoke glowingly of Kingsbury, with Daniels saying ""I love working with Kliff,"" and ""Me and him have a special relationship. Mariota praised Kingsbury's system for making things easy on the quarterback. McLaurin talked about the way he, his role and his alignments grew under Kingsbury and also complimented Kingsbury for being ""open to communication.""

But coach Dan Quinn wanted a more traditional run-heavy, clock management-driven, approach, ESPN's John Keim reported, even though that goes against what Kingsbury has always been. The Commanders had the fifth-highest rushing rate in the NFL over Kingsbury's two seasons as offensive coordinator, but they also had the most quarterback rushes in the NFL (24th-most running back runs). Kingsbury's system was tremendous for Daniels in Year 1. It was less successful in Year 2 for several reasons, some out of Kingsbury's control.

""There's a ton of different decisions I wish we would've made and I would've made, and more just like individual play calls than anything, you know, our style of play was a bit different,"" Kingsbury said. ""Like I said, trying to slow the games down, limit possessions, do things of that nature. But yeah, there are a ton of things I wish I would've done better as far as scheme and maximizing players and things of that nature.""

Kingsbury couldn't control injuries. He couldn't control the defense being one of the NFL's worst.

""We had a bunch of guys that were kind of in and out of the lineup, and it's a credit to this staff of getting these guys prepared,"" Mariota said.

It's not a ""wrong"" call from Quinn, per se, but it's certainly a big one. Sometimes circumstances change. Sometimes strategies change. The Commanders will have big changes ahead, and Quinn had better be right.

Kingsbury, meanwhile, will likely be in the running for both head coach and offensive coordinator gigs. Call his offense what you will, but it is not ""gimmicky"" in any sense of the word. Kingsbury showed flexibility and creativity as a play caller and play designer. The Commanders had a well-versed, multi-faceted rushing attack and a screen game that worked wonders at its peak. Kingsbury helped produce not only a career year McLaurin but a renaissance from Zach Ertz in his mid-30s and a bounce-back from Deebo Samuel in his late-20s. He often made do with castoffs and youngsters, elevating the games of players such as Noah Brown, Dyami Brown and Olamide Zaccheaus.

Here's where Kingsbury could end up next.

1. New York Giants offensive coordinator

Kingsbury has previously expressed a desire to return to head coaching, and he decided to remain in Washington last year, when he could have been one of the top candidates for an opening. How much a tough 2025 hurt his coaching candidacy remains to be determined, but his best fit could be to remain an offensive coordinator.

He'll want a mobile quarterback, versatile running game and some weapons to maximize that attack, and the Giants stand out as the team that fits the bill best. Jaxson Dart showed impressive rushing ability, and the Giants have a tandem of capable backs in bruiser Cam Skattebo as well as the speedier Tyrone Tracy Jr., who has quietly reached 1,000+ yards from scrimmage in each of his two seasons. Malik Nabers looked like a star in the making before an early-season knee injury, and Wan'Dale Robinson could be a versatile, movable chess piece as well. Tracy and Robinson in particular could help fuel Kingsbury's versatility as a play caller and designer.

2. Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator

Cam Ward quietly finished his rookie season strongly, throwing for eight touchdowns and just one interception over his last four full games (he left the season finale with a shoulder injury but won't need surgery). He's doesn't run like Murray, Daniels or Dart, but he's not a statue, either. He showed impressive escapability down the stretch of his debut season, and his sack numbers declined in kind.

Ward has said he wants to be involved in the coach-hiring process, and if the candidate at hand isn't Kingsbury, he would do well to pitch Kingsbury as the offensive coordinator. The Titans have a long way to go int he rebuild process, but Kingsbury has developed young quarterbacks everywhere he's been. Tennessee has some gifted if inconsistent wide receivers, too, in Himere Dike and Elic Ayomanor.

3. Giants coach

The Giants would do well to strongly consider Kingsbury for the main gig, not just a coordinator one. Kingsbury has undoubtedly learned from his time as the Cardinals' coach, which included him building a team from 3-13 the year before he arrived to 5-10, then 8-8, then 11-6. People often recall his final season -- 4-13 -- and his struggles down the second half of seasons most, but they forget how good of a job he did, with two-10th overall total offenses. He did it all with Kyler Murray a quarterback who not only had limitations but played his best ball under Kingsbury and now appears on his way out of Arizona.

Hiring Kingsbury would be a big bet. He would have to get the call at defensive coordinator right. The Giants really struggled on that side in 2025 but have foundational pieces along the line. It's a big market that comes with a ton of scrutiny. If Kingsbury is up for it, though, he and Dart could form a strong partnership.

4. Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator

Could Kingsbury's home be just a short drive north? The Ravens sent shockwaves through the NFL by firing John Harbaugh on Tuesday, ending an 18-year partnership with one of the NFL's most stable franchises.

Kingsbury and Lamar Jackson could be a fit for all the reasons listed about other quarterbacks: mobility, operation out of the shotgun, etc. The Ravens do have Derrick Henry, so Kingsbury might have to adjust to be more running back-centric, but he has been willing to adjust before. Zay Flowers seems like a strong fit for Kingsbury's quick-hitting passing schemes, too.

It's not a perfect fit. Jackson isn't a young quarterback like basically all the others Kingsbury has worked with. Running up-tempo seems at first glance incongruous for a team that might be better suited to grind some games out in the grimy, tough AFC North. But the Ravens need change badly. They didn't fire Harbaugh to keep the status quo. Kingsbury would have to interview well and show a clear plan for melding his style to Baltimore's personnel. Just don't count it out completely.

5. Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator

The Falcons fired coach Raheem Morris, and while that doesn't preclude offensive coordinator Zac Robinson from coming back, there's a reasonable chance whomever succeeds Morris will want to handpick his offensive coordinator. If that coach is a first-timer, having the experience of Kingsbury would be helpful; if it isn't a first-timer, Kingsbury could still fit the bill.

Atlanta has a strong offensive line, a superstar versatile running back in Bijan Robinson and a star wide receiver in Drake London. Quarterback is a big question, but Michael Penix Jr. has operated out of the shotgun his entire career, so there's at least some synergy there. Penix isn't a dual-threat guy, but Kingsbury has shown abilities to adapt. And if Penix turns out not to be the answer, Kingsbury could again be a mentor for another young quarterback.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/06/fdc4ff99-0ea6-4050-9875-90780935defa/thumbnail/1200x675/3f63c8e810d31bd436daa16fddd5a245/kliffkingsbury.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 18:01:36.417199

The Eagles are beginning their on-field practices on Jan. 7 for the Jan. 11 wildcard playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers on Jan. 11.

Before practice, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni wouldn't say if Johnson will be among those practicing. But Sirianni did rave about Johnson, who's in his 13th season and considered one of the top tackles in the NFL.

Sirianni called Johnson ""a difference maker."" That effusive praise could indicate that Sirianni is expecting Johnson, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, to return against the 49ers.

""Obviously, Lane’s a big difference maker,"" Sirianni said. ""I know he’s working like crazy to get himself back. We’ll see where that is this week. But he’s a difference-maker. He’s one of the best who’s ever done it.""

Fred Johnson has replaced Lane Johnson at right tackle for the past seven games. The Eagles have gone 3-4 this season without Lane Johnson. That was a snapshot of the vast disparity in the Eagles' record when Lane Johnson plays versus when he does not over his 13-year career.

The Eagles are 110-57-1 when Lane Johnson plays, a winning percentage of .658. They're 18-27 when the 35-year-old does not play, a winning percentage of .400.

It's easy to see why, although Sirianni wouldn't divulge those reasons because of ""scheme."" Basically, the Eagles don't need to provide help when Johnson is at right tackle, and that frees up other aspects of how the Eagles block.

That can open up running room for Saquon Barkley, and provide more time for quarterback Jalen Hurts to pass, or run himself.

""He allows you to do some different things,"" Sirianni said about Lane Johnson. ""Again, Fred has done a nice job when he came in and played for him. We won a lot of games with Fred in the lineup.

""Lane is just a difference-maker. And it can affect everything. There’s a reason he’s going to the Hall of Fame. There’s a reason he’s going to be in the Eagles Hall of Fame, the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He’s one of the best ever to do it at that position. And he shows that year in and year out … I’ve been with him for five years, and it just feels like he just keeps getting better and better.""

Raiders coaching candidates after Pete Carroll firing: Tom Brady ties to Patriots, plus fresh faces Garrett Podell 6.","The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.

We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. As of Tuesday afternoon, seven NFL teams have fired their coaches. The Tennessee Titans and New York Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season. The Atlanta Falcons fired Raheem Morris on Sunday night. And on Monday, the Cleveland Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Arizona Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon. The Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons on Tuesday afternoon.

In the wake of all of those changes, let's rank the coaching vacancies in order of their desirability.

Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.

1. Ravens

The Baltimore Ravens are the only team this coaching cycle that can offer prospective candidates the opportunity to coach a multi-time NFL MVP quarterback in Lamar Jackson.

Plus, running back Derrick Henry showed no signs of slowing down in his age-31 season in 2025, rushing for 1,585 yards -- the second-most in the entire NFL. There are also a couple All-Pro building blocks on defense with linebacker Roquan Smith and safety Kyle Hamilton. Baltimore should make a playoff return in 2026 no matter who their head coach is provided they reinforce Jackson's offensive line as well as their defensive line. The Ravens do have some cap space to play with at the moment with $12.4 million in effective cap space, according to OverTheCap.com. Moving off of defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike's contract down the road following his neck injury could free up significant cap space in the coming years.

2. Falcons

There are a couple of things working against the Falcons here: First and most importantly, there is extreme uncertainty surrounding the quarterback situation. Michael Penix Jr. is coming off yet another knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably not long for Atlanta given that the Falcons can save $22.5 million by cutting him (or $35 million by designating him as a post-June 1 release).

The Falcons also do not have a first-round pick in this year's draft after trading up for James Pearce Jr. in 2025 and are set to enter the offseason over the 2026 salary cap.

All that said, Atlanta has the most talent of any team with a head-coaching vacancy. Between Bijan Robinson and Drake London on offense, there is already a baseline level of star talent to build around. Kyle Pitts could be back. The offensive line is solid.

The defense slowed down after an incredibly hot start to the year but still finished the year 14th in EPA per play allowed. There is at least a foundation for success on that side of the ball, if you can land on the right defensive mind, whether as the head coach or coordinator. The Falcons also play in the NFC South, which is one of the worst divisions in football.

The Falcons are running this search in a strange way, though, with separate consulting firms leading the search for the coach and the general manager. Things could get weird if the GM doesn't have the chance to hire their preferred coach.

3. Giants

The Giants won't have the No. 1 pick in the draft like it seemed they would a few weeks ago, but they do have a few things working in their favor.

The first is the young talent on offense, and specifically at quarterback with Jaxson Dart, who showed flashes during his rookie season that he can be a strong option for the Giants under center. Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo are attractive as well, although they'll both be coming off of major injuries. And Andrew Thomas is an elite tackle.

Then there's the defense, which boasts one of the best fronts in the league -- or should, at least. So long as the Giants have Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns and Abdul Carter, they should be able to get after it up front. They need to improve on the second and third levels and they definitely need to get better against the run, but there's talent on this side of the ball.

A potential issue is the ownership and management situation, where John Mara is sadly in poor health and general manager Joe Schoen is set to return (and lead the coaching search) despite not exactly having distinguished himself in the role.

4. Titans

Tennessee restructured its front office over the weekend such that Mike Borgonzi will oversee the 53-man roster and lead the coaching search while Chad Brinker will handle the other football operations responsibilities. The Titans had one of the worst rosters and coaching situations in the NFL this season, but they might be set up to make a jump next year.

Cam Ward's overall numbers don't look great, but there were so many flashes of high-level talent when you turn on the film. He was let down by a decrepit supporting cast and has a chance to be much better next year if the Titans improve the talent around him. And they'll have every chance to do so because Tennessee is set to enter the offseason with over $105 million in cap space and the No. 4 pick in the draft.

They're not necessarily a candidate to go worst-to-first like the Bears and Patriots did this year, but they definitely have a chance to be a lot better next season if they hit on the right coach and use their budget and draft capital wisely, like those teams did.

5. Raiders

The Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players.

There is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.

One drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years.

6. Browns

The Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade.

What the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.

The Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)

7. Cardinals

Arizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall.

Arizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/06/4ef75398-b94a-4744-9a80-f94340397a00/thumbnail/1200x675/b9f6d4430764cbd0f2250182b0c81009/gettyimages-2254685268.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 17:01:40.112140

The MVP award is given to a player who had the most valuable season while All-Pro is a statistical recognition.","The NFL regular season has ended and the MVP debate continues.

It could be another close race with no clear front-runner. Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye have the best odds, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.

Playoff results won't matter because it's a regular-season award. Winners of the AP NFL awards will be revealed at ""NFL Honors"" on Feb. 5.

Stafford had an outstanding season for the Los Angeles Rams, leading them to a 12-5 record and the NFC's No. 5 seed. Maye led the New England Patriots (14-3) to a 10-win turnaround and the AFC's No. 2 seed in just his second season.

Stafford was first in the NFL with 4,707 yards and 46 touchdowns. His passer rating of 109.2 was second only to Maye, who finished at 113.5. Maye had 4,394 yards passing and 31 TDs. Both quarterbacks threw eight interceptions. Maye had the higher completion percentage, 72% to 65%.

Christian McCaffrey also belongs in the conversation after an outstanding do-it-all season in which he helped the injury-depleted San Francisco 49ers (12-5) overcome losing several key players and going long stretches without QB Brock Purdy. The Niners even reached Week 18 with a chance at the No. 1 seed before Seattle's defense shut them down in a 13-3 win.

A running back hasn't won the MVP award since Adrian Peterson in 2012.

Micah Parsons is worthy of consideration. Parsons tore his ACL during Green Bay's loss to Denver in Week 15. The Packers were 9-3-1 in games he finished; 0-4 in the others, including last week when they rested starters.

Quarterbacks have won the MVP award 12 straight seasons. Those QBs have played for a No. 1 seed nine times in that span and a No. 2 seed the other three.

Only three quarterbacks have ever won MVP on a team that didn't win its division. Peyton Manning did it in 2008, Steve McNair as a co-MVP in 2003 and Johnny Unitas in 1967, when the Colts went 11-1-2 but missed the playoffs.

Last year, Josh Allen edged Lamar Jackson for MVP. However, Jackson was the first-team All-Pro. It was the first time a first-team All-Pro didn't win the NFL MVP award since 1987, when John Elway was the MVP and Joe Montana received All-Pro honors.

The MVP award is given to a player who had the most valuable season while All-Pro is a statistical recognition. All-Pro rosters will be announced this week and the debate will still continue until next month.

Playoff seeding

The Detroit Lions proposed last season that playoff seeding should be based on winning percentage instead of automatically placing division winners in the top four spots.

NFL owners voted against it in May because a majority value the importance of teams winning their own division.

""I'm a division purist,"" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said.

The league will likely revisit this idea after a second straight season in which three teams with better records will play on the road during wild-card weekend.

The 49ers (12-5) play at the Philadelphia Eagles (11-6). The Rams (12-5) play at the Carolina Panthers (8-9). The Houston Texans (12-5) play at the Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7).

Last year, the teams with the better records went 1-2.

The Rams-Panthers matchup will be the ninth time a road team in the playoffs has at least four wins more than its opponent. The teams with the better records are just 2-6 in those games.

Defense needs help

Two of the teams with the NFL's top four defenses didn't even make the playoffs.

The Vikings (9-8) were third, allowing 282.6 yards per game. The Browns (5-12) finished fourth, giving up 283.6.

Both teams had quarterback issues. Minnesota lost starter J.J. McCarthy for seven games and backup Carson Wentz started five games, playing the final 2 1/2 games with a shoulder that required season-ending surgery.

The Browns started veteran Joe Flacco for four games, rookie Dillon Gabriel for six and rookie Shedeur Sanders the last seven.

Houston and Denver finished 1-2. The Broncos earned the AFC's No. 1 seed. The Texans got the No. 5 seed.

“You will see a lot of 2026 NFL mock draft pundits put Jeremiyah Love with the Chiefs at pick No.","To say the Kansas City Chiefs had a disappointing 2025 season would be quite an understatement. Not only did the team that won two of the last three Super Bowls and three of the last six finish out of the playoffs with only six wins, their lowest total since 2012, they played their final three games without future Hall of Fame quarterback Patrick Mahomes — and they start next season without him as well.

Mahomes suffered a season-ending knee injury in the Chiefs’ Week 15 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, and is now on a rehab timeline that could take him into the 2026 season. Even if he is ready for Week 1, there is little chance Mahomes will be at full strength.

But Mahomes has six years to go on his massive, 10-year, $450 million contract with Kansas City, and even if he didn’t, there is little chance that the Chiefs would look to replace him either through the draft or free agency.

How, then, does coach Andy Reid restructure his team’s offense either without Mahomes or with a weakened version of their already-legendary signal-caller? The answer, according to a new mock draft, will come in the backfield, with the top running back available out of the college ranks in 2026.

Notre Dame Rusher Topped 1,300 Yards in 2025

Thanks to their 6-11 record, the Chiefs will have their highest draft pick since 2013 when they held the No. 1 overall pick and used it on offensive tackle Eric Fisher.

In 2026, the Chiefs will pick at No. 9 in the first round. According to a mock draft by ClutchPoints released on Monday, Kansas City will use the pick on Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love, a Heisman Trophy finalist who rushed for 1,372 yards in 2025, eighth in the nation.

“You will see a lot of 2026 NFL mock draft pundits put Jeremiyah Love with the Chiefs at pick No. 9, and this one is no exception,” wrote ClutchPoints draft expert Tim Crean. “Arguably the best overall offensive player in the draft, Love fixes one of the Chiefs’ biggest issues, and building the offense around Love next season will help hold down the fort until Patrick Mahomes returns to full strength.”

Love Called ‘Complete Weapon’ on Offense

Crean was correct. According to the NFL Mock Draft Database, Love, who will be 21 years old by the time of the 2026 NFL draft, is the consensus pick among all major mock drafts to go to the Chiefs at No. 9.

If those projections prove correct, Love would be the first Notre Dame running back drafted in the first round since Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis went 10th overall to the Los Angeles Rams in 1993.

“Love is a dynamic and explosive running back who possesses the skill set to be a complete weapon in an NFL offense,” according to a scouting report by Damian Parson of Bleacher Report. “He combines home-run top-end speed with route-running and pass-catching ability to impact the offense in multiple ways.”

One obstacle to the Chiefs adding Love to their rebuilding roster out of the 2026 draft would be the New Orleans Saints, who are also reported to have interest in picking the Fighting Irish star.

The Saints own the No. 8 pick in the draft, one slot ahead of Kansas City, meaning the Chiefs may be forced to sacrifice some lower-round picks to trade up at least two spots in order to guarantee their shot at taking Love.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jeremiyah-love-draft-patrick-mahomes.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-07 15:01:38.059662

Two days after defeating Johnson's Chicago Bears in Week 18, Detroit fired offensive coordinator John Morton on Tuesday, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported.

The team later announced it had ""parted ways"" with Morton.

Morton was tabbed to fill the void left by Johnson when the former Lions OC left to take the top job in Chicago this past offseason, but he didn't retain play-calling duties for even one full season. Lions coach Dan Campbell took the responsibility from Morton prior to their Week 10 win over Washington, an explosive, lopsided triumph that appeared to instantly justify Campbell's decision.

At the time, Morton backed Campbell in his decision, telling reporters ""I fully support it. ... I want to do whatever it takes to win.""

In the end, however, Morton met the same fate as the last offensive coordinator to surrender play-calling duties to Campbell, Anthony Lynn, who gave up the responsibility in the 2021 season and parted with the Lions at the end of the campaign.

With Morton at the controls, Detroit posted a 5-3 record, averaged 28.8 offensive points per game and 350.8 yards per game. Once Campbell took over -- a period that included increased instability up front due to injury-related changes along the offensive line -- the Lions went 4-5, averaged nearly two fewer offensive points per game (26.9), but bumped up their yardage average to 393.1, per NFL Research.

Jared Goff's performance varied, too, but not in the fashion Lions fans would have liked. His completion percentage dropped by nearly 10 percentage points, he threw the same number of touchdowns (17) but two more interceptions (5) and his passer rating subsequently dropped from 115.2 to 98.6. Much of these declines could also be blamed on Detroit's fading running game, once a hallmark of the Lions' offensive operation that devolved into only a mild threat to opposing defenses.

Ultimately, the change didn't make the difference Campbell was seeking. With a struggling offensive line holding them back, the Lions struggled to build momentum toward a late-season playoff push, finishing 9-8 and out of the postseason. Their season-long totals dropped from landing in the top four in points per game (ranked first), points per drive (first), third-down percentage (fourth) and total yards per game (second) in 2024 to finishing second, seventh, 20th and fifth in 2025.

Following the Week 18 win, Campbell was brutally honest with himself, telling reporters he graded himself ""a freaking F"" for the job he did with his team in 2025.

""We've got nobody to blame but ourselves. But I really don't believe we're that far off,"" Campbell explained before foreshadowing Tuesday's staff move. ""There's a couple of things we can do, and I just want to make sure we go after it. I'm not saying we weren't hungry, but let's get that hunger back and we're going to bring in some guys to compete.""

In partnership with Jackson, Harbaugh and the Ravens re-emerged as yearly threats, missing the playoffs only in the 2021 season and this most recent one.
That will now be something for general manager Eric DeCosta and another head coach to answer.","A missed 44-yard field goal on the final play of the 2025 regular season will mark the end for one of the NFL's longest-tenured head coaches.

The Baltimore Ravens have fired John Harbaugh after narrowly failing to clinch the AFC North and a playoff spot that went with it in his 18th season with the team, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday.

Harbaugh, who took over the Ravens in 2008, ends his storied run helming the club with a 180-113 regular-season record, having reached 12 playoffs, four AFC title games and won Super Bowl XLVII. He leaves the winningest coach in franchise history by 100 victories.

""Following a comprehensive evaluation of the season and the overall direction of our organization, I decided to make a change at head coach. Today I informed John that he has been relieved of his duties,"" Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement on Tuesday. ""This was an incredibly difficult decision, given the tremendous 18 years we have spent together and the profound respect I have for John as a coach and, most importantly, as a great man of integrity.

""Throughout what I firmly believe is a Hall of Fame coaching career, John has delivered a Super Bowl championship to Baltimore and served as a steadfast pillar of humility and leadership. He and his family have deeply embedded themselves in this community. For these profound contributions, on and off the field, we should all be forever grateful.""

The Ravens have been among the most successful teams in the league under Harbaugh, but on the heels of an 8-9 season after entering September as a top Super Bowl contender, Baltimore has recognized a need for a change.

""I was hoping for a different kind of message on my last day here, someday, but that day has come today,"" Harbaugh said in a statement on Tuesday. ""It comes with disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE & APPRECIATION.

""Gratitude to the owner and organization who was willing to bring in a head coach who made his mark with Special Teams success. A difficult thing to do … and Appreciation for all the moments, all these years, that are etched into eternity.""

Baltimore was one of several NFL heavyweights to falter this season. The team started 1-5, unable to avoid digging a hole as star quarterback Lamar Jackson suffered a hamstring injury in Week 4 and missed three games. The defense was likewise dinged by injuries.

Five straight wins followed the Week 7 bye to claw back above .500, evidence of Harbaugh's culture, as well as the team's talent and mettle. But consecutive losses after that put Baltimore in desperation mode. Harbaugh and Co. entered the penultimate week of the season needing to win out and get lucky.

Jackson, a mainstay on the injury report all season, missed Week 17, but the Ravens still ran all over the Green Bay Packers for a win, and the aforementioned luck shined on them as the Pittsburgh Steelers were upset by the Cleveland Browns to set up a faceoff for the division on Sunday Night Football of Week 18.

A characteristically low-scoring affair between the Ravens and Steelers suddenly turned electric in the fourth quarter, featuring four lead changes in the final nine minutes of play. The Ravens nearly made it five thanks to a desperate fourth-down conversion and subsequent kneel-down to set up a 44-yard attempt by Tyler Loop, down, 26-24.

The rookie kicker instead missed his first career field goal attempt under 50 yards, sending the Ravens home for the playoffs and snapping a two-year streak of division titles.

In some ways it is fitting that Harbaugh's run as Ravens head coach ended via a battle to the wire against Mike Tomlin, the only longer-tenured active head coach, in their 40th head-to-head meeting.

It's the sixth time Harbaugh has missed the postseason and only the second time in the past eight years, but the overall struggle of the campaign and fickleness of championship windows apparently convinced Baltimore to try to jolt itself back into contention under a new voice.

""Our goal has always been and will always be to win Championships,"" Bisciotti said. ""We strive to consistently perform at the highest level on the field and be a team and organization our fans take pride in. I will always be grateful for the extraordinary hard work and dedication displayed by John and his staff throughout the many successful years. I wish he, Ingrid and Alison all the best going forward. ...

""We now begin the challenging, but exciting, process of identifying the next leader of our football team. We fully understand the expectations of our fans and everyone in the Ravens organization. Finding another strong leader and partner who will reflect these high standards is paramount.""

Harbaugh's departure will be considered hasty by some (or perhaps most), but the fact remains that the Ravens have not won a Super Bowl since the 2012 season. They've fallen short of the AFC Championship Game in all but one year since. Despite 11 double-digit-win seasons, Harbaugh-coached teams have too often become synonymous with late-game collapses; Baltimore has blown 46 fourth-quarter leads since 2008, tied for second-most during that span, per NFL Research.

Baltimore and Harbaugh had seemed close to a breakup years ago, during a three-plus season lull that followed the tremendous success experienced at the onset of his tenure.

In his first season, 2008, Harbaugh led the team all the way to the AFC Championship Game with a rookie Joe Flacco, kicking off a five-year stretch of consecutive playoff berths that was finally concluded with a Super Bowl victory.

Following an 8-8 season during a Super Bowl hangover in 2013 and a loss in the Divisional Round the following campaign, the Ravens failed to reach the postseason from 2015-17.

Heading into a Week 10 bye week at 4-5 in 2018, a split felt imminent. Only Harbaugh then handed the reins to Jackson, at the time a first-round rookie, and the Ravens rattled off wins in six of their last seven to take the AFC North.

In partnership with Jackson, Harbaugh and the Ravens re-emerged as yearly threats, missing the playoffs only in the 2021 season and this most recent one. Still, each of those postseason trips ended in disappointment, seemingly capped by a Divisional Round ceiling outside the '23 campaign.

Jackson has won two MVPs, but he dealt with a string of injuries from 2021-22 that contributed to murkiness over a potential extension in the 2023 offseason. One was eventually struck, though questions about his place in Baltimore were again raised during an injury-plagued downturn for the Ravens this season. He also declined to address his future immediately following the season-ending loss to the Steelers.

That will now be something for general manager Eric DeCosta and another head coach to answer.

Harbaugh, 63, only the third coach in Ravens history, will certainly be a candidate for any other team with a vacancy across the league.

The Ravens will move on in search of their fourth head coach in its 30-year history, hoping this season's setback was temporary and needing to find a way to go from so close for so many years to Super Bowl winner soon.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/eyw0rlaloqntoioqovar,N,,2026-01-07 14:02:50.511843

1. Quarterback Kyle Allen

2025 stats: 3 games

Twentyman: Starting quarterback Jared Goff did not miss a single game in 2025 as Allen was relegated to end-of-game duties with two pass attempts. He was a valuable resource for Goff in game preparation.

2. Linebacker Alex Anzalone

2025 stats: 16 games, 95 tackles (52 solo), 4 TFL, 2.5 sacks, 6 QB hits, 1 INT, 9 PD

Twentyman: Anzalone, 31, has been in Detroit since head coach Dan Campbell arrived in 2021 and has been one of the leaders on defense. He's been a versatile and reliable veteran in the linebacker corps with his ability to play all three spots.

3. Offensive lineman Kayode Awosika

2025 stats: 13 games, 2.5 sacks allowed, 0 penalties

Twentyman: Awosika has been a spot starter and key reserve playing in 49 games along Detroit's offensive line the last four seasons.

4. Offensive lineman Trystan Colon

2025 stats: 12 games, 1 sack allowed, 4 penalties

Twentyman: Colon made four starts for the Lions at guard and center and gave Detroit veteran depth along their offensive line having made 15 starts in Baltimore and Arizona before arriving in Detroit last offseason.

5. Linebacker Zach Cunningham

2025 stats: 4 games, 7 tackles (5 solo), 1 TFL

Twentyman: Cunningham was a versatile reserve and special teamer who played in just four games this season before a hamstring injury placed him on injured reserve.

6. Edge rusher Marcus Davenport

2025 stats: 8 games, 14 tackles, 1 TFL, 1 sack, 3 QB hits

Twentyman: Davenport dealt with injury again in 2025 and has totaled just 10 games played in his two seasons in Detroit.

7. Tight end Anthony Firkser

2025 stats: 7 games, 8 rec., 53 yds

Twentyman: Firkser played a bigger role toward the end of the season when the Lions had to dip into their tight end depth due to injury.

8. Offensive lineman Jamarco Jones

2025 stats: N/A

Twentyman: The Lions could have used Jones' veteran presence along an offensive line that dealt with injury all season long, but Jones was placed on season-ending injury reserve with an ankle injury before the regular season began.

9. Defensive lineman Roy Lopez

2025 stats: 17 games, 30 tackles (11 solo), 4 TFL, 2.0 sacks, 5 QB hits, 1 PD

Twentyman: Lopez was one of Detroit's better free agent signings last offseason. He was an impact player in the center of Detroit's defensive front with a proven track record of availability and production.

10. Defensive back Avonte Maddox

2025 stats: 14 games, 32 tackles (23 solo), 1 TFL, 1 INT, 4 PD, 1 FF

Twentyman: Like Lopez, Maddox was an important free agent acquisition last offseason bringing a veteran presence to Detroit's secondary and the versatility to play both safety and cornerback in Kelvin Sheppard's defense. He stepped in and played a big role when Detroit lost safeties Kerby Joseph and Brian Branch to injury.

11. Defensive back Arthur Maulet

2025 stats: 9 games, 14 tackles (11 solo), 1 INT, 2 PD

Twentyman: Maulet was asked to step in and play a role at nickel corner and on special teams in nine games this season and he made some splash plays.

12. Safety Jalen Mills

2025 stats: 3 games, 6 tackles (2 solo), 1 PD

Twentyman: The 10-year veteran was brought in when Detroit's numbers at safety started to deteriorate because of injury. He ended up playing three games with the Lions late in the year.

13. Edge Al-Quadin Muhammad

2025 stats: 17 games, 25 tackles (15 solo), 9 TFL, 11.0 sacks, 20 QB hits

Twentyman: It was a breakout eighth season for Muhammad, 30, who recorded career highs in sacks, tackles for loss and QB hits. He became just the 11th player in franchise history to produce a season with double-digit sacks.

14. Defensive lineman Levi Onwuzurike

2025 stats: N/A

Twentyman: Onwuzurike was coming off a career season in 2024 but never made it to the regular season in 2025 as he was placed on the PUP list to begin training camp with an ACL injury. The former second-round pick never had the consistent production the Lions were hoping for the last four seasons, mainly due to injury.

15. Defensive lineman Josh Paschal

2025 stats: N/A

Twentyman: Like Onwuzurike, injuries never seemed to let Paschal reach his full potential in Detroit. The former second-round pick underwent back surgery before the season. His practice window was opened in November but he never progressed enough to be activated to the 53-man roster. He had 5.0 sacks in 36 games played over three seasons.

16. Wide receiver Kalif Raymond

2025 stats: 15 games, 24 rec., 289 yds, 1 TD, 7.5 punt return avg. 1 TD, 26.8 kickoff return avg.

Twentyman: Raymond broke Mel Gray's franchise record for most punt return yards in team history this season. He's been a glue piece on the roster since 2021 and a player who can step in and play any receiver position.

17. Defensive lineman DJ Reader

2025 stats: 17 games, 28 tackles (11 solo), 4 QB hits

Twentyman: Reader has been a valuable veteran presence in the middle of Detroit's defensive line the last two seasons and he played in all 17 games this season. He was a mentor for rookie first-round pick Tyleik Williams. He was solid against the run but didn't offer a lot in terms of interior pass rush (17 hurries).

18. Cornerback Amik Robertson

2025 stats: 17 games, 52 tackles (43 solo), 2 TFL, 1 INT, 12 PD, 2 FF

Twentyman: Robertson was a rock in a fluctuating Lions secondary all season. He can play in the slot and out wide and the Lions relied on him heavily to wear multiple hats for their defense. He did allow a career-high seven touchdowns in his coverage area this season.

19. Linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez

2025 stats: 7 games, 12 tackles (9 solo), 1 TFL

Twentyman: Rodriguez returned in November from a torn ACL suffered last season and ended up playing in seven games with one start. He's been a core special teamer and key reserve at linebacker his first four seasons in Detroit.

20. Tackle Dan Skipper

2025 stats: 12 games, 0 sacks allowed, 1 penalty

Twentyman: Skipper has spent most of his eight seasons in the NFL in Detroit as a swing and reserve tackle making 16 starts over the last four seasons. He's become a cult hero to Lions fans. He said after Sunday's win over the Bears he was contemplating retirement this offseason.

21. Linebacker Grant Stuard

2025 stats: 17 games, 19 tackles (6 solo), 1 TFL

Twentyman: Stuard was brought in to be a special teams ace and finished the season leading Detroit with 13 special teams tackles on the year.

22. Safety Daniel Thomas

2025 stats: 12 games, 23 tackles (10 solo), 1 TFL, 1 PD

Twentyman: Thomas ended up making two starts at safety as Detroit was decimated by injury there. Thomas is a solid reserve having carved out a six-year career in Jacksonville and Detroit with 83 games under his belt (six starts).

23. Linebacker Ezekiel Turner

2025 stats: N/A

Twentyman: After playing in nine games as a reserve in 2024, Turner left Detroit's preseason finale in 2025 with an achilles injury that landed him on injured reserve before the 2025 season began.

24. Cornerback Rock Ya-Sin

2025 stats: 17 games, 47 tackles (27 solo), 2 QBH, 9 PD

Twentyman: Ya-Sin turned out to be a critical offseason signing by GM Brad Holmes as he played a big role in Detroit's secondary all season making six starts. Opponents completed just 51 percent of the passes thrown his way (25-for-49) with a 74.5 rating and just one touchdown allowed. He was one of Detroit's most consistent players in the secondary.

25. Tight end Shane Zylstra

2025 stats: 6 games, 3 rec., 20 yds

Twentyman: Zylstra made the team out of training camp as the No. 3 tight end but suffered an ankle injury Week 2 that landed him on IR. He returned in December to play a role after Detroit lost tight ends Sam LaPorta and Brock Wright due to injury.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/lions/mrydsuym5qqcmk8cfzo3,N,,2026-01-07 14:02:59.535315

The team will release two more injury reports, including a final injury report on Thursday with official playing status designations, before facing the Chicago Bears to open the postseason on Saturday night.

Here’s everything to know from the Packers' first injury report:

Participation report

Did not participate: CB/WR Bo Melton (knee)

Limited participation: DL Warren Brinson (foot), DB Javon Bullard (knee), LB Edgerrin Cooper (shoulder), LB Nick Niemann (pectoral), RT Zach Tom (back/knee), WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion), G John Williams (back), QB Malik Willis (right shoulder/hamstring)

Full participation: WR Matthew Golden (Achilles), DE Lukas Van Ness (foot)

Note: The Packers held a walk-through on Tuesday, so participation reports are an estimation.

Big things to know

-- A few injuries coming out of the regular season finale: defensive lineman Warren Brinson has a foot injury and was limited, slot cornerback Javon Bullard has a knee injury and was limited, receiver Matthew Golden has an Achilles injury and was a full participant and cornerback/receiver Bo Melton has a knee injury and was the team's lone DNP. Of this group, Melton -- who hurt his knee covering a punt on Sunday -- appears to be the only player in danger of not playing Saturday.

-- Bullard was able to practice Tuesday, confirming he is OK after suffering a knee injury scare in Minneapolis.

-- The Packers completely removed running back Josh Jacobs and quarterback Jordan Love from the injury report. Two of the offense's most important players are healthy entering the postseason.

-- Right tackle Zach Tom practiced, and coach Matt LaFleur said he expects Tom to return from a knee injury and play Saturday. His return would be huge for the offensive line.

-- Receiver Dontayvion Wicks remains in concussion protocol but was able to practice on Tuesday.

-- The Packers believe Malik Willis will be available as the backup quarterback, but he was limited again on Tuesday with two injuries. Desmond Ridder replaced Clayton Tune as the third quarterback on the 53-man roster.

-- The Bears also held a walk-through on Tuesday. Among those estimated as DNP: slot cornerback C.J. Gardner-Johnson (concussion), defensive end Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (concussion) and receiver Jahdae Walker (illness). The Bears designated cornerback Kyler Gordon (groin) and offensive tackle Braxton Jones for return from injured reserve, and both practiced on Tuesday.

-- It's possible Gordon could come off IR and play the slot. It's also possible Jones could come off IR and play left tackle, where rookie Ozzy Trapilo was limited on Tuesday.","https://packerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/images/smg/2024/10/16/SMGW/75708271007-57-114269.png?crop=1919,1079,x0,y0&width=1919&height=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 14:03:02.801553

""Sometimes when it's chaos in there, it's really hard to function as a quarterback,"" Day added.
Herbert has been battered and bloodied in 2025, and the data backs up just how much he willed the Chargers to the playoffs.
""To me, it was an MVP season,"" Chargers Offensive Coordinator Greg Roman said.
""Unfortunately, it didn't go our way and there's nothing I can do to change that,"" Herbert added.","At first glance, the play seemed innocent enough.

On the Chargers first offensive drive of a Week 13 home game against the Raiders, Justin Herbert scrambled to his left and picked up a single yard before being tackled by safety Jeremy Chinn.

Herbert headed back to the huddle, relayed the play call, promptly evaded the Las Vegas pass rush and fired a 10-yard touchdown pass to Quentin Johnston.

The Bolts defense forced a punt on the next Raiders drive. But when the offense trotted back onto the field, backup Trey Lance was leading the charge.

""We scored on that drive and had no idea,"" Chargers tackle Trey Pipkins III recalled. ""Justin hit a dude but came back to the huddle and wasn't grimacing or holding his hand.

""But when he didn't come back out we were like, 'Oh, what happened to Justin?,'"" Pipkins added.

Herbert had fractured his left hand, an injury he continues to play through.

But Lance's time in the huddle lasted just eight plays as Herbert put himself back in the game on third-and-10 from the Bolts 46-yard line.

Herbert hit Keenan Allen on an out route for 10 yards and the first down. Because of course he did.

""He comes running back out there,"" Pipkins said with a laugh. ""That's just who he is. You just love having him as your quarterback.""

The Chargers will play postseason football on Sunday night in New England.

But — to put it as simply as possible — the Bolts would not be here if it wasn't for their franchise quarterback.

Herbert's toughness is perhaps the story of the Chargers 2025 season, and even the quarterback himself acknowledged the perception he can create by showing teammates, coaches and the entire organization that he's willing to keep picking himself up off the turf.

""It's just part of the game of playing quarterback and expecting you're going to get hit and it's going to be tough,"" Herbert said after a Week 3 comeback win over the Broncos. ""You've got to stay gritty and know they're going to knock you down, but you have to get back up.

""The offensive line is looking at you, the receivers and tight ends, making sure you're the leader and stepping up and getting back up, for sure,"" Herbert added.

And those who have seen it up close marvel at what the 27-year-old has been able to withstand in his sixth NFL season.

""Where would we be without 10? Oh, man. Ain't no telling, bro,"" Khalil Mack said late in the 2025 season. ""Just knowing his tenacity and his heart and the grit and resolve that he plays with … having that at the quarterback position, you don't see that often.

""Over my 12 years, he's the most unique person I've seen at that position. There's some guys who have kind of had that, but it's something different with what he's been playing with and how he's been playing through it. It's somewhat crazy but also somewhat remarkable and unbelievable.""

Mack is a future Hall of Famer who is one of the steeliest players on the entire roster.

He came back from a gruesome elbow injury in just over a month when other players might have missed half the season. Few outwork him on the field or in the weight room.

Mack said last month that Herbert is the toughest quarterback he has ever played with. After all, what other quarterback would try to stiff arm a defender with a broken hand that Herbert had surgery on just seven days prior?

""Hands down. It's not close,"" Mack said. ""I played with some tough guys but he's another step above.""

Herbert has needed that physical and mental toughness in 2025.

The Chargers lost Pro Bowl left tackle Rashawn Slater to a knee injury before the season before.

The Bolts pivoted by moving standout young tackle Joe Alt from right to left tackle to protect Herbert's blindside.

But Alt's 2025 season lasted just six games as he was lost for the year with an ankle injury.

Backup linemen such as Jamaree Salyer and Pipkins were each also lost for multiple games.

The Chargers turned to multiple different starting options at tackle, including Trevor Penning, who was acquired at the 2025 trade deadline.

Austin Deculus, who was acquired in an August trade, made four starts in front of Herbert. And Bobby Hart made seven starts in front of Herbert despite the fact that the veteran was added to the roster in October and hadn't started a game since 2021.

All in all, the Chargers rolled through 10 different starting offensive line combinations and more than 20 different five-man configurations in front of Herbert.

""The thing that amazes me about him this year is that a lot of the pockets have been under duress and it really hasn't affected him as much as it would for most quarterbacks,"" Chargers quarterbacks coach Shane Day said in December. ""He's still finding ways to make the same throws and still finding ways to win games.

""Sometimes when it's chaos in there, it's really hard to function as a quarterback,"" Day added. ""But he finds a way to do it.""

Herbert has been battered and bloodied in 2025, and the data backs up just how much he willed the Chargers to the playoffs.

Herbert was sacked 54 times in 2025, the second-most in the NFL. That total is the third-most by a quarterback who won at least 11 games in the Super Bowl era.

He was also hit a whopping 129 times, tied for second-most by a quarterback in the past 20 seasons.

There were also 268 pressures, the sixth-most a quarterback has faced since 2016. And there were 109 quick pressures, the most in the league this season.

""Justin is a competitor. He's elite. And he never ceases to amaze me season to season,"" said Chargers left guard Zion Johnson. ""Even when I got here, I knew.

""He's a warrior and he's going to give everything he's got to win,"" Johnson added. ""It's just special when you have a quarterback like that who is willing to get down and dirty and get things done.""

Pipkins added: ""We've always known that he's just the ultimate competitor. If he can get out there, he's going to do it no matter what he has going on. We knew that. But the more times it happens it's just like, 'This dude is unbelievable.' It's just awesome to always see it happen.""

Not that Herbert ever let anyone notice the constant pestering he endured in the pocket.

""There's almost something about it, he takes that hit and there's no facial expression change, there's no limp, there's no grabbing,"" Chargers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh said earlier this season. ""It's almost like it didn't even happen.

""There's something in his competitive fire where it motivates him even more,"" Harbaugh added. ""It even takes him to another notch.""

The irony in all of this?

Herbert slimmed down in the offseason, according to Day, and focused on agility rather than bulking up. The quarterback rushed for a career-best 498 yards in 16 games.

""He made a concerted effort in the offseason to change his body. In the past, maybe his strategy was to get as big as he could to withstand these hits,"" Day said. ""But this year with his offseason and training camp he said, 'I'm going to get in the best shape of my life.'

""He got leaner, faster, is setting personal records for speed,"" Day continued. ""I think his mindset is now, 'I can't just absorb hits. I need to get out of there and make plays.'

""There's more opportunities [to run], but he's also ready for those moments and has gotten his body in peak condition to do it,"" Day added.

Herbert almost certainly will not win the NFL MVP award this season. But if you truly watch the games, you'll see that Herbert belongs in that conversation.

Sure, other quarterbacks might have gaudier stats and more wins. But few players, if anyone, had to endure the shoddy circumstances Herbert did in 2025.

""To me, it was an MVP season,"" Chargers Offensive Coordinator Greg Roman said. ""With all the attrition we've had and what he's been able to do to lead the team to a playoff berth … when you look around the league with other teams that have attrition such as this, the results aren't quite the same.

""When you really go back and look at it, the way he has gutted through and found a way to will us to victory,"" Roman continued. ""Those are the games that get you in the playoffs and you don't come by it easy.""

Roman later added: ""In terms of Justin and what he's had to deal with this year, I think it's a career-defining type of year.""

Herbert, of course, is looking for his first playoff win after not getting one after the 2022 and 2024 seasons.

The quarterback recently reflected on his most-recent outing, a four-interception performance in Houston as the Bolts lost in the Wild Card Round.

""I sure hope so,"" Herbert said when asked if learned anything from the loss to the Texans. ""I think those are games that, as hard as they are to watch, you have to learn from them.

""You watch [the turnovers] individually and see what went wrong on this play, what you could've done differently,"" Herbert continued. ""It's just part of the game.

""Unfortunately, it didn't go our way and there's nothing I can do to change that,"" Herbert added. ""It's more so what can you learn from it, how can you move forward and give everything you can to put this team in a position to win.""

Herbert later revealed that the Houston loss stuck with him for the majority of the offseason.

""I think it was one of those things you continue to think about,"" Herbert said. ""There are a lot of football games you just remember, whether they're good or whether they're bad, they stick with you. I think it's great learning experience.

""No one felt worse than I did after that game and I think it's important to continue to move forward and realize that it's what happened,"" Herbert continued. ""It would be crazy of me to deny the truth of what happened and to live in this reality where if I tried to block it out, I don't think that's doing any good.

""I think just moving on and understanding what it was and attack the next game like you've always prepared for,"" Herbert added.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chargers/vo1vtpi64mcoaehtz4n9,N,,2026-01-07 17:01:53.139249

The 27-year-old quarterback suffered a head injury in Week 16 against the Chicago Bears and was later placed under the league concussion protocol.

Love missed the Packers’ Week 17 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. He then ended up being sidelined again in Week 18 against the Minnesota Vikings despite already being cleared from the concussion protocol. Green Bay had already locked the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs heading into the Vikings game, which allowed the Packers to have their star quarterback sit out the season finale.

The Packers will face the Bears in the wild-card round on Saturday. This latest edition of this storied NFC North rivalry will have a lot more at stake, with the season on the line for both teams. The winner of Saturday’s single-elimination game will proceed to the divisional round to face either the San Francisco 49ers or the Philadelphia Eagles. It will be the end of the season for the losing team.

The good news for Green Bay is that Love is expected to start under center against the Bears. On Tuesday, the team announced that Love is off the injury report ahead of Saturday’s game.

It is worth noting that Tuesday’s practice was a walk-through for both teams, which is why the injury report is an estimation. However, the fact that Love wasn’t listed on the report falls in line with the expectation that he will be on the field on Saturday.

Packers head coach Matt LaFleur also confirmed on Tuesday that Love will be back against the Bears.

“There’s nobody else I’d rather have than Jordan,” LaFleur said.

Chicago is the No. 2 seed in the NFC, which gives them home-field advantage for Saturday’s contest. The Bears will host the Packers at Soldier Field, with kick-off scheduled for 8:00 p.m. ET.

Purpose: This study investigated the relationship between anthropometric and performance measures collected at the 2024 National Football League (NFL) Combine and playing time (PT) during the 2024 NFL regular season. Methods: Data from four anthropometric (Body Mass Index; Hand Size; Arm Length; Wingspan) and seven performance tests (40-yard Dash; 10-yard Split; Vertical Jump; Broad Jump; 3-Cone Drill; 20-Yard Shuttle; 225lb Bench Press) of 315 players were standardized into average Anthropometric Z-Scores (AZ), Performance Z-Scores (PZ) and Total Z-Scores (TZ) for analyses. PT was calculated as a player’s total number of regular season snaps during their 2024 rookie season. Pearson correlations were used to investigate the relationships (α = 0.05) between AZ, PZ, and TZ to PT. Players were also analyzed for potential relationships within each position group. Results: A significant, weak, positive correlation existed between PZ and PT (r = 0.19, p < 0.01) and TZ and PT (r = 0.20, p < 0.01) for all players. No relationship existed for AZ and PT (r = 0.02; p = 0.73). Additionally, significant relationships existed among: Offensive Line – PZ and PT (r = 0.33, p = 0.01) and TZ and PT (r = 0.35, p < 0.01); Wide Receiver – PZ and PT (r = 0.39, p = 0.03) and TZ and PT (r = 0.46, p < 0.01); Linebacker – TZ and PT (r = 0.39, p = 0.05). Conclusions: NFL Combine performance metrics may provide insight on PT, but anthropometric measurables were not related to PT. The lack of relationship within position groups indicates the NFL Combine may not be valuable in evaluating a rookie’s success on the field. Applications in Sport: Professionals who work with prospects may choose to train Combine specific techniques to maximize a prospect’s chances of playing in the NFL. However, individualized training that focuses on position specific demands or weaknesses that are not directly measured by NFL Combine tests may be more useful in increasing PT. The NFL Combine may be a useful supplement to all factors that go into an NFL team’s decision to draft a player.

INTRODUCTION

The National Football League (NFL) hosts an annual Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana of elite college football players. Only about 3% of college football players are invited to the NFL Combine and therefore represent those with the highest chance of being drafted into the NFL (4). The purpose of the NFL Combine is to allow coaches, scouts, and other team personnel representing the 32 NFL teams the opportunity to assess hundreds of players from all divisions of collegiate football.

Football has position-specific skills that are needed to excel at the highest level. However, there are similarities between each position. All positions need vertical and horizontal power, agility, and strength. During this weeklong event, players participate in a multitude of tests. These tests include anthropometric measurements (Height; Weight; Wingspan; Arm Length; Hand Size) and performance tests (40-yard dash; 10-yard split; Vertical Jump; Broad Jump; 3 Cone Drill; 20 Yard Shuttle; 225lb Bench Press). All the events in the NFL Combine have been shown to have face validity (4). NFL player personnel departments use the NFL Combine data as part of their criteria to determine whether to select a player in the upcoming NFL Draft.

While the NFL Combine tests are designed to determine that aptitude to play at the next level, research is conflicted on the ultimate usefulness of the NFL Combine in determining player performance and playing time (PT). Kuzmits and Adams (4) found no consistent significant relationship between NFL Combine tests and player performance during the years of 1999 to 2004. Research also noted that the NFL Combine from 2013 to 2015 lacked the ability to predict game performance when specifically analyzing first year game performance (3). Teramoto, Cross, and Willick (12) looked at whether the NFL Combine could predict future performance of Running Backs (RB) and Wide Receivers (WR). The results of this study were that the time on 10-yard split was the most important predictor of yards per attempt for RB while vertical jump was significantly associated with receiving yards per reception for WR. However, the measures cannot explain a large part of the variance in the future performance of RBs and WRs. Vincent et al. (15) looked at NFL Combine participants from 2005 to 2010 who then played in the NFL. Significant relationships were found between at least one NFL Combine measure and on-field success. Even though significant relationships were found the authors stated that the NFL Combine tests are only modest predictors of future performance. More recently, investigation of six physical skill tests at the NFL Combine to try and predict draft placement in the 2022 NFL Draft and showed no significant difference between drafted and nondrafted players in any of the six physical tests analyzed (14).

LaPlaca and McCullick (5) built on previous research looked at player performance from the years 2006 to 2018 and compared it to the NFL Combine from 2006 to 2016. They found that every position group, both offensive and defensive, had at least one NFL Combine test that was significantly correlated with player performance. The study made sure to disclose that even though they found significant correlations, the large sample size made it easier to find weaker correlations. A limitation that was discussed was that while the authors did use objective performance statistics such as Touchdowns scored, they also used a grading system through Pro Football Focus to determine player performance. This grading system was not purely objective because the grades are determined by multiple reviewers through the observation of game film. Therefore, the overall performance of each player was not entirely objective. Additionally, a robust study by Frank and colleagues (2) analyzed 20 years (2000-2018) of NFL Combine data and noted that for offensive positions, single measures often best predicted success, while various combinations of NFL Combine performance traits predicted success among defensive players. This study also suggested that NFL Combine data is best used in conjunction with scouting and personnel departments to supplement NFL draft decision making. Similarly, research was conducted looking at the impact of the NFL Combine on five-year performance data from the 2013-2017 NFL seasons and concluded that the NFL Combine lacked predictive ability during that timeframe (1). While historical research does exist in this field, each year provides another opportunity to determine the NFL Combine’s effectiveness in predicting success. Additionally, limited research exists discussing the relationship between NFL Combine Measurables and PT for first-year players. The primary purpose of this study was to determine if the anthropometric and performance measures of the athletes invited to the 2024 NFL Combine were related to PT during the 2024 NFL regular season.

METHODS

Participants

Participants for the data analysis in this study were college football players that participated in the 2024 NFL Combine (N = 315). Participants were also grouped by position for use of positional comparisons (Offensive Line [OL] (N = 70); Defensive Back [DB] (N = 67); Defensive Line [DL] (N = 50); Running Back [RB] (N = 29); Linebacker [LB] (N = 30); Quarterback [QB] (N = 14); Tight End [TE] (N = 16); Wide Receiver [WR] (N = 39)). All player positions were input based off their official designation at the time of the NFL Combine. Due to limited sample size (N = 6) and variations in specializations, NFL Combine athletes who were labeled Specialist (Kicker, Punter, Long Snapper) were excluded from analyses.

Procedures

Four anthropometric (Body Mass Index [BMI]; Hand Size; Arm Length; Wingspan) and seven performance measures (40-yard Dash; 10-yard Split; Vertical Jump; Broad Jump; 3-Cone Drill; 20-Yard Shuttle; 225lb Bench Press) were analyzed. BMI was calculated by the researchers using Height and Weight measurements taken at the NFL Combine. Full descriptions of the performance tests have been detailed previously by McShay (7).

The data from the NFL Combine was obtained from NFL.com/combine/tracker (8). Each participant’s scores were retrieved for every test that was completed. Standardization of data, via Z-scores, were created for every anthropometric and performance measure. The measures from the NFL Combine were standardized into averages for each player, taking each player’s combined Z-Score score and dividing by the number of NFL Combine events they participated in to account for players who did not complete every NFL Combine event. Standardized averages were created for Anthropometric Z-scores (AZ), consisting of the four anthropometric measures, Performance Z-scores (PZ), consisting of the seven performance measures, and Total Z-scores (TZ), consisting of all 11 NFL Combine measures, for analyses This method of standardization of NFL Combine data into Z-scores for analysis has previously been supported (1).

Once all NFL Combine data was standardized, researchers used Pro-football-reference.com (9) to retrieve offensive, defensive, and special teams snaps for each player during the 2024 NFL regular season. Each player’s total snap count was then combined to provide a single value to determine PT, which was used for analysis. Because of this study only requiring secondary analysis of data which is publicly available on web-based domains, which do not disclose individual’s health information, Institutional Review Board approval was not required, though the study was approved by the research institution.

Data Analyses

Pearson product moment correlations, using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, v29.0, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY), were used to determine the relationship (α = 0.05) between AZ, PZ, TZ to PT. Additionally, players were separated by position and Pearson product moment correlations (α = 0.05) were used to determine potential relationships within each group between AZ, PZ, and TZ, to PT. All data are presented as means ± standard deviation with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) unless otherwise stated.

RESULTS

Descriptive Statistics

Of the 321 athletes whose data were collected, 315 were used for analysis. A total of six athletes were excluded from analysis due to their position of Specialist (punter, kicker, long snapper) because only anthropometric data was collected on this group. Of the 315 athletes used for analysis, 312 (99%) completed all anthropometric measurements. There was more variability in the performance testing, with 25 (8%) completing all seven performance events, and 263 (83.5%) completing at least one performance event. When broken down by event, 220 (69.8%) completed the 40yd (4.73 ± 0.31s) with a 10yd split (1.63 ± 0.11s), 227 (72.1%) completed the VJ (34.0 ± 4.3in), 220 (69.8%) completed the BJ (117.9 ± 9.0in), 78 (24.8%) completed the 3C (7.30 ± 0.40s), 89 (28.3%) completed the PRO (4.44 ± 0.28s), and 100 (31.8%) completed the BP (21.9 ± 5.6reps). When examining snaps played over the 2024 regular season, 239 (75.9%) players went on to play at least one snap, with 224 (71.1%) averaging more than one snap per game over the course of the season.

Anthropometric Correlation Analysis

The results of the correlation analysis for AZ and PT are presented in Figure 1. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship between average AZ and PT for all players and separated by position group. No significant overall relationship existed for AZ and PT (n = 312; r = 0.02; p = 0.73).

Additionally, no significant relationships existed among position groups: OL (n = 70; r = 0.13; p = 0.29); RB (n = 29; r = 0.21; p = 0.29); WR (n = 37; r = 0.24; p = 0.16); TE (n = 16; r = 0.39; p = 0.14); QB (n = 13; r = 0.02; p = 0.95); DL (n = 50; r = -0.10; p = 0.52); LB (n = 30; r = 0.19; p = 0.33); DB (n = 67; r = -0.02; p = 0.89).

Performance Correlation Analysis

The results of the correlation analysis for PZ and PT are presented in Figure 2. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship between average PZ and PT for all players and separated by position group. A significant, weak, positive correlation existed between PZ and PT (n = 263; r = 0.19, 95%CI [0.07, 0.31]; p < 0.01). The positive direction of this relationship indicates that players who performed better at the NFL Combine played more snaps during the 2024 NFL regular season.

When separated by position groups, significant, positive relationships existed for the following groups: OL (n = 61; r = 0.33, 95%CI [0.09, 0.54]; p = 0.01); WR (n = 34; r = 0.39, 95%CI [0.06, 0.65]; p = 0.03). The positive direction of these relationships indicates that OL and WR who performed better at the NFL Combine accumulated more snaps during the 2024 NFL Regular season. No significant correlations were noted for: RB (n = 25; r = 0.31; p = 0.14); TE (n = 12; r = 0.07; p = 0.15); QB (n = 7; r = -0.39; p = 0.40); DL (n = 43; r = 0.30; p = 0.06); LB (n = 26; r = 0.31; p = 0.13); DB (n = 55; r = -0.02; p = 0.89).

Total Correlation Analysis

The results of the correlation analysis for TZ and PT are presented in Figure 3. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship between average TZ and PT for all players and separated by position group. A significant, weak, positive correlation existed between TZ and PT (r = 0.20, 95%CI [0.08, 0.31]; p < 0.01) for all players. The positive direction of this relationship indicates that players who had higher average TZ scores played more snaps in the 2024 NFL regular season.

When separated by position groups, significant, positive relationships existed for the following groups: OL (n = 61; r = 0.35, 95%CI [0.11, 0.56]; p < 0.01); WR (n = 34; r = 0.46, 95%CI [0.15, 0.69]; p < 0.01); LB (n = 26; r = 0.39, 95%CI [0.01, 0.68]; p = 0.05). The positive direction of these relationships indicates that players in these position groups who had higher average AZ scores played more snaps in the 2024 NFL Regular season. No significant correlations were noted for: RB (n = 25; r = 0.31; p = 0.14); TE (n = 12; r = 0.07; p = 0.85); QB (n = 7; r = -0.24; p = 0.61); DL (n = 43; r = 0.30; p = 0.06); DB (n = 55; r = 0.06; p = 0.70).

Discussion

The main finding of this study is that PZ and TZ may have a weak relationship to PT in a player’s first year in the NFL. There was no relationship between a player’s AZ and subsequent PT across all athletes nor when separated by position group. The study did find a significant weak positive correlation between average PZ and PT for all players. However, when separated by position groups significant, positive relationships existed for OL and WR. Finally, there was a significant weak positive correlation between TZ and PT for all players. When separated by position groups, significant, positive relationships existed for OL, WR, and LB.

There could be many reasons why these relationships exist for WR, LB, and OL. Previous movement analysis research for NFL players by position found that WR had highest in-game velocity and highest total running volume by an offensive position (6). Therefore, the 40-yard dash and 10-yard split may carry more importance among WR. The same study showed that LB had the most high-velocity efforts and high-velocity distance in game compared to all other positions. LB also showed the largest variability across player-games which is likely due to the roles that LB perform which include rushing the QB, play in space and cover offensive players, or primarily to tackle an opponent. Additionally, OL noted a positive relationship in the current study, with better NFL Combine performances leading to more PT. While previous research (11) has noted that OL have worse NFL Combine values compared to other positions, the nature of the OL position may lend itself to more direct relationships from NFL Combine performance, since these athletes require multidirectional power over limited space. The positional findings in the current study do support previous research that noted relationships between NFL Combine performance metrics and PT among WR (40-yard Dash, Vertical Jump), LB (40-yard Dash, 20-yd Shuttle) and OL (20-yard Shuttle, Vertical Jump) (1, 2).

The NFL is not the only sport that uses a combine to test and evaluate future players’ abilities. Teramoto et al. (13), investigated the National Basketball Association (NBA) scouting Combine to determine whether the NBA Combine could predict PT. The study showed that the NBA Combine metrics had minimal correlation with long-term performance. In the NBA, it was found that certain anthropometrics had slightly better predictive power than athletic tests, which contrasts with what researchers found about the 2024 NFL Combine. Both in the NFL and NBA Combine researchers have proposed that performance in college or in game is the biggest predictor of draft position and future performance (11, 13).

There are limitations associated with this study. As reported in the results only 25 (8%) of all prospects completed all seven performance events. Increasingly, players are opting out of some or all the NFL Combine process, due to injury concern, agent decision, recovering from an injury during the season, or to focus on performing well at individual workouts, where more variables can be controlled by that athlete. In the season being analyzed in this study, five of the first six picks in the NFL Draft did not participate in the NFL Combine process, which could impact these findings. A larger, more complete sample from all NFL Combine athletes would comprise a better representation of their athletic performance. Finally, players that played zero snaps their first year due to injury were included in analysis, due to limitations among researchers to determine the extent of every injury or whether a player was not on the field due to injury or coaching decisions. A player that may have had strong AZ, PZ, and TZ scores, but did not play during their rookie season because of injury, which would have impacted the relationship between those variables and PT.

CONCLUSIONS

Many studies have been conducted over the last 20 years to determine if and how NFL Combine measurables can predict performance in the NFL (1-6, 10, 12, 14, 15). These studies have found mostly found minimal relationships overall, though stronger relationships among certain position groups. Despite the general scientific consensus that the NFL Combine is not a strong predictor of future NFL success, a multitude of NFL Combine “prep courses” exist, with athletes paying for training specifically to improve in NFL Combine measurables. There has been scientific skepticism about these courses and their impact on performance at the NFL Combine and its translation to improved draft status or playing time. While these courses claim that they will improve an athlete’s chance of getting drafted, there is currently no scientific evidence to these claims (1, 4, 10). Training programs that focus on a prospect’s position specific demands or individual weaknesses that are not directly measured by NFL Combine tests may be more useful in increasing PT for that athlete. The results of the current study support the previous work in the literature, but do note that some position groups (OL, WR, LB) may benefit by improving NFL Combine-specific performance in the lead up to the NFL Combine and Draft.

APPLICATIONS IN SPORT

The results from the current study suggest PT among NFL rookies during the 2024 regular season could not be strongly predicted with data collected during the NFL Combine. However, due to the relationships that were found, specifically withing certain position groups, it may be important for athletes in those positions to train specifically for those performance tests to have a better chance at playing in their first year. The data can be important for NFL player personnel departments who may use data collected during the NFL Combine to influence drafting decisions. Due to the significant, but variable, nature of the relationships found in the current study, it appears that the NFL Combine may be a useful supplement to scouting, film analysis, interviews, and other factors that go into an NFL team’s decision to draft a player. However, it is apparent that there is more to determining PT during a rookie season than just superlative measurables collected during the NFL Combine.",https://thesportjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Sport-Journal-Temp-Logo-185-x-75-px-150x75-1.png,N,,2026-01-07 09:59:51.262266

Rather than practicing from Wednesday to Friday, they'll hold a walkthrough on Tuesday, followed by practices on Wednesday and Thursday.

Because they didn't practice today, the Rams' initial injury report is an estimation of players' participation. Davante Adams is making his way back from a hamstring injury that has kept him out for the last three weeks, but he's expected to return on Saturday. He was a full participant in practice for the first time since going down in Week 15.

Jordan Whittington is dealing with a knee injury suffered in Sunday's win over the Cardinals, so his status will be monitored during the week. Quentin Lake is also expected to return and was a full participant on Tuesday, while Kevin Dotson was listed as a non-participant once again to start the week; Sean McVay is unsure if he'll play against the Panthers.

Terrance Ferguson, who's expected to play in Saturday's game, was held out on Tuesday, but McVay previously said the team would be smart with his hamstring injury early in the week. Josh Wallace didn’t participate, either, and both Braden Fiske and Tyler Higbee were limited, too.

Those that reach the postseason – 14 of them to be exact (since 2020) – battle it out for the opportunity to end their season with the ultimate victory.

While the Minnesota Vikings will miss the postseason for the second time in three seasons, they finished the year in strong fashion. On Sunday, Minnesota defeated Green Bay 16-3; not only did the Vikings bookend a decade of games at U.S. Bank Stadium with a Border Battle victory over the Packers (the opponent in the venue's inaugural game), they closed the season on a five-game winning streak to finish the year with a 9-8 record.

Although a team experiencing a late-season hot streak is nothing new, only 11 NFL teams since 2020 have concluded their regular-season schedules with a win streak of five-plus games. The Vikings were one of four teams this season to finish the year on a heater, joining the Seahawks (seven consecutive wins), Jaguars (eight consecutive) and Texans (nine consecutive).

Additionally, the Vikings have recorded a win streak of five games or more in each of Kevin O'Connell's first four seasons as a head coach. According to NFL Media Research, that ties former St. Louis Rams Head Coach Mike Martz for the second-longest such streak to start a coaching career and it is the longest active streak in the league. Martz accomplished the feat with the Rams from 2000-2003.

J.J. McCarthy started Sunday's finale and was playing well against a Green Bay team resting most of its key players, but McCarthy left in the third quarter after appearing to aggravate his throwing-hand injury that caused him to miss Week 17's game. That injury in and of itself is not the story. It will heal over the coming months, just like the other injuries McCarthy has suffered over the past couple years. But the long-term questions about his constitution won't let up until he gets through a season relatively unscathed, and how much can Minnesota really trust him as the sole protector of the position? They finished the season 9-8 with a five-game win streak, so there's evidence to suggest the Vikings could be in contention a year from now, even with the questions at QB and the possibility of [Defensive Coordinator] Brian Flores leaving. How Minnesota approaches the offseason will be fascinating and telling.

J.J. McCarthy took himself out of Sunday's game due to a hand injury. Like everything else about McCarthy, it's sure to start a conversation about the second-year quarterback. McCarthy has played only 10 games in his career. He improved to 6-4 in those games, but he finished the season 38th among quarterbacks in EPA per dropback (minus-0.14). The Vikings don't have any other obvious answers at the position, but they need some.

Winning five in a row to end the season is a positive and also a reminder of what might have been, had Minnesota's quarterback play been even average. The Vikings approach at quarterback will be watched closely. Perhaps just as important will be if Defensive Coordinator Brian Flores returns. He should get some head-coaching interviews, and he could conceivably leave as a coordinator elsewhere since his contract is up.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/ltjcuksypaztnxjc5iah,N,,2026-01-07 12:00:39.332845

By going on long-term injured reserve, Fox has to miss 10 games and 24 days.
The Rangers called up journeyman goalie Spencer Martin, who started the year in the KHL before signing with the Rangers.

The Fox injury, though, has to factor into the team’s thinking.","NEW YORK — The New York Rangers were dealt a pair of injury blows on Tuesday, as Adam Fox will go on long-term injured reserve and Igor Shesterkin will go on injured reserve, a league source said. Fox will be reevaluated when eligible to come off LTIR, and Shesterkin will continue to be evaluated.

Fox, who returned from an upper-body injury Dec. 31, did not suffer any noticeable injury during Monday’s 3-2 loss to the Mammoth, though he did not play in overtime. He was for the Rangers’ final power play of the game and last appeared with 59 seconds left. The Rangers have already seen how difficult life is without him — especially on the power play — and will now face another prolonged stretch with him gone. He has 28 points in 30 games this season and has boasted strong underlying numbers.

By going on long-term injured reserve, Fox has to miss 10 games and 24 days. That means the earliest he can return is Jan. 31 against Pittsburgh. In the aftermath of Fox’s injury, the team called up Scott Morrow from AHL Hartford. Coach Mike Sullivan used him on the power play the last time Fox was out.

The Rangers went 6-5-3 when Fox was dealing with his shoulder injury and were outscored 39-34. The power play struggled mightily, converting on only 15 percent of its chances. (It scored on five of eight chances in the past three games with Fox back.)

Shesterkin suffered his injury in the first period Monday when Utah’s JJ Peterka drove to the net. The Mammoth forward made marginal contact with Shesterkin, but the goalie fell backwards into the net and slammed his blocker on the ice in pain. Rangers defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov and trainer Andy Hosler helped him off the ice. The goalie did not put any weight on his left leg. The injury appeared not to stem from the Peterka contact; Shesterkin’s left side never made contact with the Utah forward.

Losing Shesterkin for any time is a massive blow for the Rangers. Though the team’s defense has improved this season compared to 2024-25, the Rangers still rely heavily on their goaltending. Shesterkin, the Vezina Trophy winner as the NHL’s best goaltender in 2022, signed the richest goalie contract in history last season: an eight-year, $11.5 million average annual value deal. He’s in the first year of that contract.

Jonathan Quick will take on added responsibility with Shesterkin out. He has a .919 save percentage in 11 games this season. The 39-year-old two-time Stanley Cup winner has been an invaluable presence in the New York dressing room and has been strong as the No. 2 goalie, but needing him to take on a starter’s workload is a big ask. The last time he started at least 40 games in a season was 2022-23, and he had an .882 save percentage that year in 41 games with the Kings and Golden Knights.

The Rangers called up journeyman goalie Spencer Martin, who started the year in the KHL before signing with the Rangers. He has a .903 save percentage in three games. By calling him up, the Rangers passed over prospect Dylan Garand, who has a .908 save percentage in 17 games. That could potentially be to keep him in more consistent game action.

Depending on how badly the Rangers want to stay in the playoff picture, president and general manager Chris Drury could look to the trade market. Someone like Laurent Brossoit, a pending unrestricted free agent, could be an option with a low acquisition cost. He’s making his way back from double hip surgery and playing for AHL Rockford, where he has a .901 save percentage in six games. He has a .911 save percentage in 140 career games. His $3.3 million cap hit through the end of the season could make a deal tough, though Chicago could retain in a trade. Buffalo is currently carrying three goalies, so perhaps the Rangers could try to nab Alex Lyon from the Sabres.

The Fox injury, though, has to factor into the team’s thinking. New York is in last place in the East by points percentage, so trading prospects or draft picks — even lower-value ones — for a stopgap goalie simply might not make sense this season. The team won’t make the playoffs simply by staying afloat in the coming weeks: It has to make up ground, and that’s difficult for a team to do without arguably its two most important players.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/06124329/GettyImages-2254830755-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-07 13:02:16.715480

If he falls apart in this spot and Allen doesn't, then the Bills can certainly win this game.
Chargers at Patriots If I had to pick a game where the spread is probably right, it would be Packers-Bears.
I'm trying not to underrate the Steelers, and with their excellent home-field advantage my spread projection for this game is Pittsburgh -1.","We talked about how the market was treating teams potentially resting players last week in five games and went 4-1 on those picks, and now we turn from the games that mean little to the games that mean everything. The playoffs start Saturday with the Rams heading to Carolina to face a Panthers team that is a double-digit underdog in the matchup, a monster spread and one that has been impossible to cover in the past.

Think that's an exaggeration? Home underdogs of four points or more in playoff games are 9-0 ATS over the last 50 years and while the previous three all covered in a losing effort, the previous six all won outright. If you look at games where a team is catching more than seven points, then we have three previous examples, all coming in the last 15 years.

The most recent underdog of at least four points came during the 2020 playoffs when Tom Brady went to Washington to face a 7-9 team led by Taylor Heinicke as 10-point favorites. A field goal late in the first half got the Bucs just outside the number with an 18-7 halftime lead and then they did it again by extending their lead to 28-16 in the fourth quarter, but Washington scored a late TD and a 31-23 final left them with the cover.

Skipping two 4.5-point underdogs that covered, our second huge home dog came in the 2011 playoffs when Mike Tomlin took the best defense in the league into Denver to face a questionable Broncos offense led by Tim Tebow, which caused the home team to be catching 7.5 points. The Broncos led from the second quarter until late in the fourth when the Steelers tied the game, then an 80-yard TD to Demaryius Thomas gave Denver the outright win.

The year prior, the Saints marched into Seattle as 10-point favorites against a 7-9 Seahawks team that like the Broncos had been unimpressive on both sides of the ball entering the postseason. The Saints managed a 10-point lead early before the Seahawks stormed back and led the final 31 minutes of the game, emphasizing their victory with the unforgettable Beast Quake touchdown by Marshawn Lynch late in the 41-36 win.

So what's the takeaway? To me, it is incredibly hard for any team to walk into an opposing stadium as no-doubt winners and put together a performance to meet expectations, as you have to play a near-perfect game to cover such a big number on the road against a team -- even a mediocre team -- that was able to win its division. The 2020 Bucs went on to win the Super Bowl in dominant fashion against the Chiefs but when they failed to cover in the wild card round, they had four drives stall in the red zone and result in field goals and lost a fumble on another drive that was near field goal range.

The Rams are similar to that Bucs team with an elite QB late in his career paired with some great weapons and facing a team with a subpar offense that won a bad division, although that Washington team had a better defense than Carolina. My power ratings say this spread should be Rams -7, and I would certainly expect a result around that number more than I would covering as double-digit road favorites considering the history of those teams in the playoffs.

I'll have my spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.

Let's dive into our betting power ratings and then take a look at what the spread should be for every other game during Super Wild Card Weekend.

I have given a bump to the Eagles, Bills, Chargers and Packers with those four teams getting key players rest in Week 18 as that really seems to matter more often than not, especially for teams as beat up as those four rosters. The Rams and Seahawks stay in their own tier despite not resting players and while the gap is notable between them and the next tier, it's no so big that I think rematch -- potentially in the NFC Championship if the 49ers or Packers win this week -- is inevitable.

I feel like the Jaguars are the best team in the AFC right now but aren't being treated as such by the market, and I'm surprised they're underdogs to the Bills. I'm putting the Eagles alongside Jacksonville with the expectation the offense will be better with Lane Johnson expected to return this week. They don't have the offense of the Rams or the defense of the Seahawks, but they are probably better balanced than either so even at 5.5, I might have them a little low.

Three AFC teams sit as five points better than average, but I think two could be a point high, if not more. I gave the Bills credit for the rest and hopefully they'll be in as good shape for their game against Jacksonville as they've been in months from a health perspective, but that remains to be seen. The Patriots have not faced many tough offenses this year, splitting their games with a beat-up Bills squad while edging out a Bucs team at the beginning of its downturn and a Ravens team that lost Lamar Jackson midgame. Both of those teams didn't make the playoffs, so the only playoff teams New England has faced are the Bills, Steelers and Panthers.

The Chargers are going to be at the mercy of matchups moving forward with their patchwork offensive line, but Justin Herbert has overcome those limitations in the past and the defense is in top form, so I'm not ruling out Jim Harbaugh's team from making some noise in the postseason. I give them a slight edge over a less-proven Houston offense.

I have the 49ers and Packers side by side as I don't know what we're going to get from either, but I'm almost certain it'll be tied to player availability. San Francisco absolutely needs Trent Williams back against that Philadelphia front and comments from the weekend make it sound like he would've had a chance to play if the Week 18 game fell on Sunday, so I'd give him better than even odds to be back for the matchup. The Packers defense might be a major problem with the injuries it has sustained, so we'll see if Jordan Love and the offensive unit can catch fire and that possibility has me profiling those two NFC wild card teams similarly.

I'm not putting much confidence in a Bears team that beat expectations to win the division but looked mediocre for much of the regular season finale against the Lions at home. Chicago certainly has the feel of a one-and-done team who might be in for bigger things next season. I'm giving the Steelers a boost with T.J. Watt back and DK Metcalf returning for the wild-card round, and I feel like the easy out is to just keep underestimating them because the talent on paper might not be on par with many of the other playoff teams.

The Panthers, even as a below-average overall team, have a fighter's chance at beating a team they've already beat once at home, and we talked about the history of big road favorites above. Now, let's get into the other matchups.

Packers at Bears

This game is functionally a pick 'em with the Packers only favored on the money line by a few cents. My ratings give the Bears a slightly better chance to win as they would project a spread of Bears -1.5, and that's acknowledging Chicago has had one of the better home field advantages in the league recently. The Bears were 5-3 ATS at home this year but missed a cover in the win over the Giants by a half-point, and their other two ATS losses were close games against the Vikings to open the season and the Lions to close it.

I also think there's a bit of wiggle room to reduce the Packers' rating downward as my current number projects good health for the offense coming off the rest week. The defense lost one of the best edge rushers in the league in Micah Parsons, and the Devonte Wyatt injury leaves them a mess on the interior. Nate Hobbs went on IR late in the year and Trevon Diggs is trying to replace him on the fly. The defense may have avoided another disaster after Jevon Holland left the Week 18 game with a knee injury, but that's another issue a player has to play through. That's before we get to an offense that's lost Elgton Jenkins at center and is now hoping Zach Tom returns and is able to play up to his typical high level at right tackle, with key target Tucker Kraft also out and Josh Jacobs playing through injury much of the year.

We've seen plenty of upstarts with young quarterbacks like the Packers, Texans and Jaguars win a playoff game in their first trip to the postseason with that guy under center, so I'm not counting the Bears out just because they're upstarts. But it's going to take more consistency on both sides of the ball to get it done.

Bills at Jaguars

The market has made the Bills a slight 1.5-point favorite in this game, saying that Josh Allen is enough to overcome home field advantage and overall team strength. My ratings of course disagree, as I have the Jaguars as the better team on a neutral field and project them as a 2.5-point favorite in this game. That's even with giving the Bills a bump for resting players in Week 18.

The Bills have been mostly successful in games where they can run the ball, like the blowout win over the Jets with their starters resting, and not as successful in games where they can't run the ball, as happened in the loss to the Eagles the previous week. Allen has not been able to rely on his passing-game weapons as much, and his 25 passing touchdowns are the fewest since his first full season as starter. He's also been sacked more than ever, 40 times in all and on 8% of dropbacks where he didn't run for positive yards, which is well above its highest point since 2019. The defense has been its own issue, particularly defending the run, with six opponents rushing for at least 189 yards as the Bills finished 30th in yards per rush allowed. I already think I'm being aggressively positive with their rating, so that suggests the market hasn't bought into Jacksonville at all.

The Jaguars are a team that plays sound run defense with a quarterback that was playing like a darkhorse MVP candidate down the stretch, potentially shortening the gap between him and Allen. If he falls apart in this spot and Allen doesn't, then the Bills can certainly win this game. Take away the QBs and I see a much stronger roster on both sides of the ball from the home team.

49ers at Eagles

This line has seen some early movement to the Eagles, and I think that's right. My ratings give them a boost for the rest edge after last week and are counting on them to wipe away their inconsistency on offense from the regular season, and I have them as three points better than the 49ers, who like the Patriots played a relatively easy schedule this year, on a neutral field. In Philadelphia, my spread projection is Eagles -5.5.

An offensive lineman is never going to win MVP, but two tackles in this game certainly have a case to do so. The Eagles' season turned negative as usual after the Lane Johnson injury as they lost their next three games, beat two pushovers and then edged out the Bills in a bad game for the offense considering the opponent. The 49ers offense in the biggest spot of the year was non-functional without Trent Williams on the field in Week 18. It appears both guys are trending toward playing in this matchup, which is good news for getting the best possible version of these teams and especially for avoiding the worst. While the 49ers defense did their part in that game last week, they still have the potential to be the team's fatal flaw with how they played down the stretch.

For that to happen, the Eagles offense will need to finally pull it all together and start to look like the attack that ran through the playoffs last year before obliterating the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. They ranked just 19th in scoring offense and an unbelievable 23rd in yards per rush considering how unstoppable the ground game was last season. A healthy offensive line could help them get closer to that level than they've been for much of the season.

Chargers at Patriots

If I had to pick a game where the spread is probably right, it would be Packers-Bears. But this would be a close second. I think I'm pretty aggressive with my rating for both teams, and my spread projection for this matchup is Patriots -4.

I probably have the Chargers rated higher than most at 3.5 points better than average, which is in part due to them getting to rest last week. But I also think the team isn't getting enough credit for a defense that has held nine of its last 10 opponents to 20 points or fewer. That run includes four playoff teams, stopping a Broncos team fighting for the No. 1 seed from scoring an offensive touchdown while recovering from two early touchdowns allowed to Houston the previous week to keep the team in the game. They also generated five turnovers in an overtime win over the Eagles and three in a dominant victory against Pittsburgh. Their one bad performance in this stretch came against the Jaguars, who might be the hottest team in football.

There are plenty of Patriots naysayers due to their easy schedule but you can only beat who you play, and they have top-four scoring offenses and defenses on the season. The question is whether they have the edge rushers to take advantage of the Chargers' weakness at tackle, because if they don't and Justin Herbert can lead the team to 20 points, it might be enough to score the upset with how well the Chargers defense is playing.

Texans at Steelers

This game may keep bouncing between 3 and 3.5 as the market looks to buy in to the Texans and fade the Steelers, but maybe it shouldn't. Home underdogs between 3-4 points are 5-2 ATS in the last 10 years, and going back to our initial look at the Rams-Panthers game, all home 'dogs of three points or more are 10-3-1 ATS since the 2011 playoffs and 18-9-1 ATS since 1981. I'm trying not to underrate the Steelers, and with their excellent home-field advantage my spread projection for this game is Pittsburgh -1.

For how the Steelers offense is judged based on the personnel on paper, they've scored 25+ points in nine of their last 12 games, only getting shut down by the Browns and Chargers on the road and a Bills team that ran all over them. The Texans defense is second to none so it's possible we see a similar Pittsburgh offensive outing to what we saw in those Browns and Chargers games, but they also scored 23-25 points in three straight home games earlier in the year against the Vikings, Browns and Packers. The Texans also just gave up 30 points against Riley Leonard despite getting three takeaways, so they're not exactly in their best form.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/05/1e4e540c-5631-4b94-b3a3-59cccf8f3033/thumbnail/1200x675/cb457fbc3c5a18da849abf2b35679270/chuba-hubbard-panthers-rams.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 16:00:36.284471

Matt Prater reinjured his quad muscle during last Sunday’s victory over the Jets and his availability for Sunday’s AFC wildcard playoff game at Jacksonville is in question.

On Monday, coach Sean McDermott confirmed that, “Matt Prater suffered a little bit of an injury yesterday, as you guys saw it unfold during the game. He’s more day-to-day, which is a good sign, but we’re still going to more than likely bring some kickers in (Tuesday) for a workout. Kind of work with two plans, one where he’s able to go come Sunday and one where he’s perhaps not able to go.”

Bills kicker woes have been season long

The Bills have been scrambling at kicker all season. Tyler Bass suffered a pelvic injury in training camp and after appearing in one preseason game, he went on injured reserve where he has remained all season, ultimately undergoing surgery several weeks ago.

Prater was signed just before the season and has done a fine job filling in as he has made 18 of 20 field goals and 46 of 49 extra points. However, he originally hurt his quad muscle the week of the Cleveland game and missed the next two, so Michael Badgley was signed to the practice squad.

In those two games, Badgley missed two extra points including one against the Eagles that very likely cost the Bills a chance to win, a Week 17 loss that ultimately cost them the No. 5 seed and a wild-card trip to Pittsburgh to play a Steelers team that is inferior to Jacksonville.

Prater returned against New York but could not finish after making three extra points and kicking off three times, so that has led them to Wright as a contingency plan.

What to know about Matthew Wright

Wright has kicked in the NFL for eight different teams since entering the league in 2019, most recently for the Titans, Commanders and Texans this season and made all five field goals and four extra points that he attempted. For his career he has made 60 of 68 field goals.

In his last appearance on Nov. 16, Wright kicked a 35-yard field goal as time expired to give Houston a 16-13 victory over Tennessee. He was released days later when the Texans' regular kicker, Ka'imi Fairbarn, returned from an injury.

Obviously, this is not ideal for the Bills, especially in a playoff game that is expected to be close and could hinge on kick because regardless of whether Wright or Prater, a 41-year-old with, at minimum, a sore leg, is the kicker, neither is a match for the Jaguars’ Cam Little who is a legitimate weapon and one of the best in the NFL.

In his first two seasons Little has made 57 of 63 field goal attempts (90.5%) and 77 of 78 extra points (98.7%). From 50 yards and beyond he is 28 of 31 and that includes the two longest kicks in NFL history, a 68-yarder on Nov. 2 indoors against the Raiders, and a 67-yarder outdoors at home against the Titans last week.

This year, Little has made 30 of 34 field goals including his last 20, and when he was asked about that last Sunday he said, “Don’t say it too loud, man! Let’s relax! No, but 20 in a row, we’re at a good spot. I think our unit is doing a really good job like they always do.”

At 22 years old, the 2024 sixth-round draft pick is the youngest kicker in league history to reach 50 career field goals, nearly a full year ahead of when Kansas City’s Harrison Butker did that early in his second season in 2018.

With Little’s howitzer of a leg, if you send a kickoff into the end zone for a touchback against the Jaguars and they start a drive at the 35, they’re no more than two first downs away from being in Little’s range which puts an enormous amount of pressure on the opposing defense if a game comes down to the wire.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/17/SLST/87313664007-usatsi-27607280.jpg?crop=4533,2550,x0,y470&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 11:01:57.066012

Tate is projected as a top-10 pick in ESPN analyst Mel Kiper's current rankings, the latest in a gilded line of high-end Buckeye receivers. Tate caught 51 passes for 875 yards and nine touchdowns for Ohio State this year.

He did that in 11 games, as he missed three games because of injury. He flashed dominance throughout the year, as he had 183 yards receiving against Minnesota, five catches for 82 yards and a touchdown against Michigan, and 124 yards and a touchdown against Penn State.

Tate, who is 6-foot-3, 195 pounds, finishes his three-year career with 1,872 yards receiving and 14 touchdowns. In a program filled with the sport's top wide receiver prospects, he played in 13 games as a true freshman and flashed star power as a sophomore with 52 catches for 733 yards on Ohio State's national title winning team.

Tate's sophomore year included seven catches against Texas for 87 yards in the College Football Playoff semifinals.

""I'm proud of everything I've accomplished at Ohio State and will carry the lessons, relationships, and memories from this program with me forever,"" Tate said in a statement.

Tate projects as the latest OSU first-round receiver; over the past four years, there have been five first-rounders. Ohio State's run includes both Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave in 2022, Jaxon Smith-Njigba in 2023, Marvin Harrison Jr. in 2024 and Emeka Egbuka last year.

Last year, OSU was the first team in the common draft era to have wide receivers picked in the first round in four straight years. Tate projects to extend that unprecedented run.

Now, the Super Bowl-winning former Seahawks quarterback is facing a different kind of spotlight after revealing he played a key 2025 game for the New York Giants with what he described as a Grade 2 hamstring tear, an injury that did not appear on the team’s official injury reports. And Reuters noted an NFL investigation into “who knew what” is “likely forthcoming,” given the league’s sensitivity around injury transparency and gambling-related integrity concerns.

Wilson Says the Hamstring Tear Happened Right Before Week 2

Wilson told reporters he tore his hamstring on the final play of a Friday practice ahead of the Giants’ Week 2 matchup with the Dallas Cowboys, and said he felt he couldn’t disclose it. He added he sought treatment quietly — including work at the Dallas Mavericks’ facility — while trying to stay functional enough to play.

Despite the claimed limitation, Wilson put up a massive passing day in that Week 2 overtime loss, throwing for 450 yards and three touchdowns as New York fell 40-37.

Wilson’s hamstring issue never showed up on the Giants’ injury report that season, per the Reuters report, with his only listed ailment coming in Week 5 (ankle) while still practicing fully.

Key details (from Reuters):

Wilson said it was a “Grade 2” tear suffered before Week 2.

The injury was not on official Giants injury reports, per Reuters.

Reuters said an NFL investigation is “likely forthcoming.”

Why the Injury Report Angle Could Draw League Scrutiny

The NFL’s injury reporting rules are designed to protect public confidence and ensure “full and complete information on player availability,” with potential discipline for violations.

That’s why Wilson’s comments immediately raise uncomfortable questions: If the Giants knew, why wasn’t it reported? If the Giants didn’t know, how did a quarterback play through a significant injury without team awareness? Reuters reported it was unclear who, if anyone, in the organization was aware, but still flagged the likelihood of a league review, especially with broader sports attention on insider information and gambling concerns.

It’s also worth noting a Grade 2 hamstring tear can be a multi-week (sometimes longer) recovery type of injury in many cases, which makes the decision-making around availability and reporting even more sensitive.

What It Means for Wilson and Why Seahawks Fans Still Care

For Seahawks fans, Wilson’s name still moves traffic because his Seattle run is the defining chapter of his career: he won a Super Bowl, made multiple Pro Bowls, and became one of the franchise’s most important players before leaving after the 2021 season.

This story matters today for two reasons:

It’s a league-integrity storyline, not just an injury anecdote. If the NFL looks into it, the outcome could involve explanations from New York, or at minimum, more reporting about what the league believes happened behind the scenes.

Wilson is still trying to play in 2026. Reuters reported he insisted he plans to continue his career after his one-year Giants stint ended.

Seahawks inevitably will wonder if Wilson will retire as a Seahawk, so when his career enters the twilight, fans pay especially close attention.

What Happens Next

If this turns into a true “serial” NFL story, the next developments to watch are straightforward: any comment from the Giants, any statement from the league office, and any follow-up reporting that clarifies whether the injury was known internally or not.

Either way, Wilson’s admission has already reframed his 2025 season, and put a Seahawks legend back in the news cycle for reasons that go far beyond a box score.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2251906998.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780,N,,2026-01-07 09:59:58.434359

The New York Giants quarterback might be in trouble for not disclosing his injury until the season ended.

The Giants finished the season with two straight wins, the latest one coming against the division-rival Dallas Cowboys.

Both victories were led by rookie star Jaxson Dart, who replaced Wilson in Week 4 of the season.

While meeting with reporters at locker cleanout day, Wilson revealed he suffered a Grade 2 hamstring tear before his team’s Week 2 matchup against the Dallas Cowboys.

“I’m not blinking,” Wilson said when asked if he plans to keep playing.

“I know what I’m capable of. I think I showed that in Dallas, and I want to be able to do that again.

“You know, and just be ready to rock and roll, and be as healthy as possible and be ready to play ball.

“You know, I played that [Week 2] game, you know, I tore my hamstring on Friday in practice — the last play of practice. And I had a grade two [tear]. I couldn’t tell anybody.

“I had to go and play on it just because I knew the circumstance, I had to play on it, no matter what.

“I actually ended up going to the Dallas Mavericks’ facility, training. And, you know, kept it quiet, just trying to get treatment on it and just knowing that I probably couldn’t run from the goal line to the 10-yard line if I wanted to, but I feel like, you know, I got to play this game.”

This injury was never disclosed to the NFL, and likely force an investigation into the Giants.

However, Wilson wants to make sure the Giants don’t face any discipline for this, as he acted entirely alone.

“Not the @Giants fault!” he wrote on X.

“They didn’t know bc I didn’t want to tell anyone bc of the circumstances.

“I just had to play through it to try and go ball that day! Thought we were going to Win that wild crazy game!”

It is no secret these two NFL franchises not only know but have a strong dislike for each other. As two of the oldest franchises in the NFL, Green Bay and Chicago have met 212 times, with the Packers leading the series 109-97-6.

When talking about the history of the NFL, it is hard to name other franchises that have impacted the game more than these two. From Curly Lambeau to George Halas, from Vince Lombardi to Gale Sayers, from Bart Starr to Walter Payton, from Brett Favre to Brian Urlacher, and eventually Aaron Rodgers, the Bears (No. 1) and the Packers (No. 2) have the most Hall of Famers by a franchise in the NFL.

On top of that, Green Bay is at the top of the list of the franchises with the most wins in NFL history at 819. Who is second on that list? The Chicago Bears, with 809.

Adding to the history, the Packers stand alone as the NFL franchise with the most championships at 13, while Chicago places second with nine.

With all of the history and the 212 matchups between these two longtime rivals, it is strange that there have only been two playoff matchups in history. This week will mark the third installment of the series.

After sitting a majority of its starters in Week 18, Green Bay enters the Wild Card matchup on a four-game losing streak but relatively healthier than the last time these two teams met. As for Chicago, the Bears have enjoyed one of the franchise’s better seasons in recent memory and are looking to continue that on the back of second-year quarterback Caleb Williams.

“You definitely stick with your process that you believe in,” said Packers head coach Matt LaFleur, on how the Packers will change practice to get ready for the playoffs. “I think everybody just has to understand the magnitude of the playoffs and what that brings in regards to there is a finality to it, so you have to go play your best ball.”

With the NFL’s oldest rivalry set for matchup 213, the playoff record for both teams in the series is 1-1.

The first playoff matchup between the two teams came in 1941 during the Western Divisional Playoff. In that game Chicago came away victorious by a score of 33-14.

Chicago’s victory was fueled by a strong rushing effort from George McAfee and Norm Standlee, who finished with a combined 198 yards and two touchdowns on 29 carries. Bears Hall of Fame quarterback Sid Luckman finished the game completing 4-of-9 passes for 41 yards.

For Green Bay, quarterback Cecil Isbell completed 8-of-19 passes for 107 yards and a touchdown. Clarke Hinkle led the rushing attack for the Packers, totaling 17 yards and a touchdown on nine carries, while Tony Canadeo was held to 7 yards on five carries. Don Hutson recorded just 19 yards on one reception as well.

The win vaulted Chicago to the NFL Championship, where it would take down the New York Giants in a 37-9 win, sealing the franchise’s fifth championship.

Seventy years later, the two teams met for the second iteration of the rivalry in the playoffs, during the 2010-11 NFC Championship. In a cold January game in Chicago, Green Bay came out on top, winning 21-14.

Rodgers finished the game completing 17-of-30 passes for 244 yards but threw two interceptions. James Starks proved to be the spark for the Packers offense; the running back finished the game with 74 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries.

For Chicago, quarterback Jay Cutler was forced out of the game after completing 6-of-14 passes for 80 yards. In replacement, Caleb Hanie completed 13-of-20 passes for 153 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.

With Green Bay up 14-7 late in the fourth quarter, defensive lineman B.J. Raji came away with one of the most iconic plays in the rivalry, as he intercepted Hanie and returned it back 18 yards for a touchdown, giving the Packers a two-score lead and ultimately the insurance that Green Bay needed to win.

The Packers eventually knocked off the Pittsburgh Steelers in the ensuing Super Bowl, sealing the franchise’s 13th championship.

It is uncertain if the winner of the 2026 iteration of this matchup will go on to win the championship like in both previous playoff matchups, but one thing is certain: Saturday’s game is sure to be another classic game between the NFL’s two oldest rivals.",https://newmedia-wi.com/sites/default/files/Unknown_0.png,N,,2026-01-07 10:00:12.212504

The Key to Success for Playoffs Fantasy Drafts

It is tempting to target players on the No. 1 seeds from each conference, and sometimes that pays off. However, there are upsets almost every year in the playoffs, and the real edge is often found by identifying players from lower-seeded teams who will play multiple games.

Before ranking players as you would for a season-long draft, it is crucial to project how you think the games will unfold throughout the entire bracket. Once you have completed the bracket, note how many games you expect each player to play.

At that point, a useful cheat sheet can be created.

Advice on ""One-and-Done"" Players

Be careful when projecting players you believe will play only one playoff game.

Elite fantasy players who carried teams through the regular season are attractive, but in the playoffs, unless that player delivers a legendary performance in a loss, you risk passing on a elite player who could play multiple games. However, there is a risk-reward element if the draft cost is reasonable for a player you expect to exit early. And do not forget, teams surprise us every year. That player might end up making a deep playoff run.

My Process for Creating This Playoff Cheat Sheet

As noted, predicting the entire playoff bracket is the most important step. From there, placing players with the most projected games atop each position is straightforward. Adjustments are then made for elite players with ""one-and-done"" projections.

Most will not agree with my playoff projections, but that's OK. If you believe a team will advance farther or be eliminated earlier than I do, adjust those players accordingly.

Full disclosure: I have been saying for weeks that this will be one of the strangest playoff fields we have ever seen. I believed the bracket setup would expose some teams' biggest flaws. I did not intend to pick all lower seeds in the first round, but after breaking down the matchups, that is where I landed.

Injury Report

Quarterback

Jordan Love (concussion) will start the Packers' wild-card game. He was injured Week 16 and missed the following week before suiting up not playing last week when the team rested its starters.

Running Back

Omarion Hampton (questionable, ankle) did not play Week 18, as the Chargers rested their key players.

Ty Johnson (questionable, ankle) is day-to-day, according to Bills coach Sean McDermott.

J.K. Dobbins (injured reserve, foot) has a chance to return if the Broncos make a deep playoff run.

Jawhar Jordan (questionable, ankle) was injured Week 18.

Wide Receiver

Davante Adams (questionable, hamstring) missed the last three games, but early indications are that he will be ready to start.

Ricky Pearsall (questionable, knee) has been in and out of the lineup since Week 5 and did not play Week 18.

Rome Odunze (questionable, foot) missed the last five games but participated in limited practices ahead of Week 18.

Grant Calcaterra (questionable, ankle/knee) left Week 18 with injuries.

Kicker

Matt Prater (questionable, quadriceps) is considered ""more day-to-day,"" according to McDermott.

Quick Hits on Each Playoff Team

Rams: They faded late but should get Davante Adams back. The offense is elite, and the defense is good enough to fuel a playoff run.

Bills: Playing on the road with a leaky defense is not ideal, but this is a year where Josh Allen can drag the team to the finish line.

49ers: Despite disappearing in Week 18, this offense is capable of forcing shootouts, which is ideal for fantasy.

Seahawks: The defense is elite, but until Sam Darnold proves to be more than a strong regular-season performer, it is hard to believe in him.

Packers: The offense could step up, but the loss of Micah Parsons will catch up with the team in January.

Chargers: It would be great to see Justin Herbert make a run, but the offensive line is unlikely to give him the chance.

Broncos: A bye week and home-field advantage with a strong defense give them a chance. However, Bo Nix and his inconsistent mechanics are likely to limit Denver.

Texans: This is a championship-level defense, but a weak running game and poor offensive line could be Houston's downfall.

Patriots: It was a great season, and Drake Maye is an excellent quarterback. That said, the defense is unlikely to do enough, and the offensive line remains a concern in pass protection if New England has to chase points.

Bears: Between a weak defense and an inconsistent passing attack, Chicago appears to be a year or two away from its peak.

Eagles: The offense flashed at times, but it was maddening most weeks. It is tempting to believe Philadelphia can flip a switch, but nothing from the regular season suggests that will happen.

Jaguars: Jacksonville had a phenomenal second half of the season, but drawing Josh Allen in the first round is one of the worst possible matchups.

Steelers: A typical Mike Tomlin season: a winning record followed by an early playoff exit. The defense is not elite, and the offense is unreliable.

Panthers: Carolina lost more games than it won this year. They beat the Rams in a rainstorm, but this time the storm will be unleashed on the Panthers.

Which Other Key Bears are Stuck on Injury Report?","The Chicago Bears received a double dose of good news on the injury front ahead of their first practice for their NFL playoff game against the Green Bay Packers.

According to the team’s official transaction wire, the Bears designated cornerback Kyler Gordon and left tackle Braxton Jones for return from injured reserve, opening their 21-day practice windows and giving them a chance to potentially play against the Packers.

Gordon hasn’t played since Week 13’s win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Black Friday, but his return would boost a Bears defense that has rarely been at full strength in 2025. Gordon’s fill-in in the nickel role, C.J. Gardner-Johnson, is also currently in concussion protocol, giving them all the more reason to hope they can give Gordon the green light.

Meanwhile, Jones is attempting to work his way back to the roster after landing on IR with a knee injury on October 25. While the Bears are unlikely to turn away from rookie Ozzy Trapilo as their starting left tackle in favor of Jones after benching him earlier in the season, his return would give Chicago back its most experienced offensive tackle.

Gordon’s return to the 53-man roster would be objectively good news for the Bears. He was one of the league’s best and most consistent slot cornerbacks in 2024, regularly generating impact plays for the Bears both in coverage and at the line of scrimmage.

Unfortunately for Chicago, it is hard to imagine they’ll get the best version of Gordon in the playoffs if they activate him from injured reserve before kickoff against the Packers.

The Bears advertised big plans for Gordon in the offseason in the first year of Dennis Allen’s new defensive system, but injuries have limited him to just three games total in 2025. He suffered a hamstring injury in training camp that delayed his 2025 debut until October 13, then played only two games before a groin injury resulted in an IR stint.

Gordon returned to the active roster on Thanksgiving and played the next day against the Eagles, but he reaggravated the groin issue in Week 14 and has been down since.

Now, Gordon has still made an impact in his three games, tallying seven tackles, one sack and a fumble recovery on just 117 total defensive snaps, but the Bears should take their time scrutinizing Gordon’s abilities this week before trotting him out in the slot.

Which Other Key Bears are Stuck on Injury Report?

The Bears will now formally add Gordon and Jones to the injury report and give them the week of practice to potentially ramp up to activation, but they are not the only big names that Chicago will expectedly have on its injury report at the start of the playoffs.

Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze is, perhaps, the most consequential. The former top-10 draft pick has missed the past five games with a stress fracture in his left foot, but the team has intentionally held him out in hopes of having him available for the playoffs.

If all goes according to plan, Odunze should play for the first time since Black Friday when the Bears kick off against the Packers, but he must first make it through the week.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2253876328-e1767729524174.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-07 13:02:18.918103

That included 1,202 rushing yards on 311 carries and 924 receiving yards on 102 catches.
On first and second down in 2023, McCaffrey averaged 5.4 yards per carry, had 1,337 rushing yards and scored 14 rushing touchdowns.
This season, those same numbers were 3.9 yards per carry, 1,064 rushing yards and 7 rushing touchdowns.
They were outgained by 525 rushing yards last season, and their rush differential was plus-501 this season.","The NFL playoff field is set, and you know these teams. For months, you've been watching them, talking about them and drawing conclusions about them. But some of those conclusions are wrong.

It's not your fault. The week-to-week nature of the NFL lends itself quite naturally to missing the forest for the trees. You see a team one week, notice something about it, watch that same team a week or so later and notice the same thing again. And then you just figure that thing to be true -- that it's part of what defines that team.

But what we're doing here -- with the 18-week regular season concluded and four months' worth of data to sort through -- is step back, look at the bigger picture and figure out which of the things we think we know about each playoff team might not, in fact, be true. For some of these teams, our conclusions might be encouraging. For some, they might be cause for concern. But hopefully this offers at least a little bit of a different way to look at all 14 playoff teams as they get ready to prove us all right or wrong (or a little of both).

So here are our annual playoff myth-busters, with a big assist from ESPN researcher Paul ""Hembo"" Hembekides and the ESPN Research team. Let's start with the NFC, and teams are ordered by seeding.

Jump to a team:

BUF | CAR | CHI | DEN | GB

HOU | JAX | LAC | LAR | NE

PHI | PIT | SF | SEA

NFC

1. Seattle Seahawks

Myth: Their run game isn't good enough.

The Seahawks finished the season ranked 27th in the NFL in offensive rush EPA, which backs up the seasonlong narrative that they weren't running the ball consistently well and relied too much on their (admittedly outstanding) defense and wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Seattle scored the third-most points of any team in the regular season but finished outside the top 10 in rushing yards per game despite tying for third in rush attempts. Its 4.1 yards per carry was better than only seven teams (although three of those clubs also made the playoffs).

Why it's a myth: They've run the ball a lot better over the second half of the season.

From Weeks 10 through 18, Seattle's running backs ranked fourth in the league in offensive rush EPA, behind only those of the Ravens, Rams and Patriots. Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet combined for 2,183 scrimmage yards. Yes, other teams use two-back rotations that were more productive this season. The Rams' Kyren Williams and Blake Corum combined for 2,315 scrimmage yards. The Steelers' Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell had 2,314. But the point is not that Seattle runs the ball better than anyone, it's that it runs it well enough -- and better as the season has gone along.

Smith-Njigba is a brilliant and vital player, but his highest target-share game of the season came in a September loss to the 49ers. The Seahawks' offense began to ask more of its run game and less of Sam Darnold, Smith-Njigba and the pass game in the second half, and conclusions we were drawing about them in the first half might not hold up in the playoffs.

2. Chicago Bears

Myth: Caleb Williams' inaccuracy hurts the offense.

The Bears had a dominant run game this season. Their defense excelled at taking the ball away. And Williams -- their brilliantly talented second-year quarterback -- made some fourth-quarter magic in big wins. But his completion percentage of 58.1 is abysmal and ranked 32nd in the league among qualified starters. In this day and age, it's tough to imagine a team winning a Super Bowl with a quarterback who isn't completing 60% of his passes.

Why it's a myth: Williams has improved significantly at avoiding negative plays.

Williams led the NFL with 40 throwaways, which obviously affect completion percentages but aren't necessarily a bad thing. Five of the top seven completion percentage games of his season actually came in Bears losses, while they won nine of his 10 worst. He had the league's second-lowest pressure-to-sack ratio (behind Brock Purdy), his pressure-to-interception ratio was third best, and he threw nine touchdowns when pressured (behind only Justin Herbert's 10) to just one interception. Sure, his completion percentage when pressured was 36.4 and surely drags down the overall number. But that doesn't tell the whole story.

New coach Ben Johnson stressed to Williams when he got the job last year that, while avoiding interceptions was something he did well as a rookie, there were other negative plays he had to get better at avoiding if he and the offense wanted to have success. And Williams is doing an excellent job of staying away from interceptions and sacks, especially when he has faced pressure this season. That's a benefit to the offense no matter what the overall completion percentage says.

3. Philadelphia Eagles

Myth: Saquon Barkley is the key to the offense.

This time last season, the Eagles were a juggernaut on their way to a Super Bowl title. The key to the whole thing was Barkley's historic season. He had 2,005 rushing yards, 2,283 total yards from scrimmage and 15 total touchdowns in the 2024 regular season to lead an Eagles offense that was one of the best and most efficient in the league. This season, Barkley's production dipped significantly, down to 1,140 rushing yards, 1,413 scrimmage yards and 9 total touchdowns. An Eagles team that was fourth in offensive efficiency in 2024 ranked 19th in that same category in 2025.

Why it's a myth: It's actually Jalen Hurts.

While last season's offense seemed to center around Barkley and the Eagles' ability to generate explosive plays in the run game, this season's offense seems to much more closely follow the performance of the team's Super Bowl MVP quarterback. Barkley is averaging 91.5 scrimmage yards in Eagles wins this season and 81.4 in losses. He's averaging 3.9 yards per carry in wins and 4.7 in losses. Seven of his touchdowns have come in the Eagles' 11 wins, whereas he has five in losses. In other words, there doesn't seem to be evidence of a dramatic difference in Barkley's performance in wins versus his performance in losses.

Hurts, on the other hand, sees a great deal more variance. In Eagles wins, Hurts has a 64.2 QBR, a 5.1 completion percentage over expected (NFL Next Gen Stats), 19 touchdown passes and zero interceptions. In losses, he has a 38.2 QBR, a 0.1 CPOE, 6 touchdown passes and 6 interceptions. Just a lot of evidence to suggest that Philadelphia's success in 2025 is tied much more closely to Hurts' performance than it is to what Barkley does.

4. Carolina Panthers

Myth: They can't possibly beat the Rams again.

Carolina's Week 13 home upset of the Rams was one of the more surprising results of the entire regular season. The Rams came in as the hottest team in the league, having won six games in a row to get to 9-2. They had beaten the 49ers, Seahawks and Buccaneers in the previous three weeks and seemed poised to take control of the NFC playoff race. But on that rainy Sunday in Charlotte, Matthew Stafford threw two early interceptions and lost a crucial late-game fumble. Bryce Young threw two fourth-down touchdowns (and one third-down TD pass), and the Panthers got out with a 31-28 victory.

It felt a little fluky at the time, and with the Panthers limping to their division title with an 8-9 record, it feels unlikely to happen again in the wild-card round.

Why it's a myth: The Panthers can kind of beat anyone.

Sure, they can also lose to anyone. They were 8-9, after all. But Carolina had eight wins as an underdog this season, by far the most in the NFL. (The Steelers, Bears, Jaguars and Falcons each had five.) The Panthers will be the seventh team with a record of .500 or worse to host a wild-card game. Of the previous six, four won the contest.

The 2008 Chargers beat the Colts. The 2010 Seahawks beat the defending Super Bowl champion Saints in the Marshawn Lynch ""Beast Quake"" game. The Tim Tebow Broncos of 2011 knocked off the Steelers. And the 2014 Panthers beat the Cardinals. The last two teams to host a wild-card game with a regular-season record of .500 or worse did lose -- the 2020 Washington Football Team to the Buccaneers and the 2022 Buccaneers to the Cowboys. But the overall record of 4-2 certainly shows it can be done.

Carolina's big wide receivers were a problem for the Rams' cornerbacks in the first matchup and could be again if the Panthers can do a good enough job of keeping the Rams' rush off Young. All I'm saying is it wouldn't be the most stunning potential upset of the first round.

5. Los Angeles Rams

Myth: Matthew Stafford should win MVP because Drake Maye played a soft schedule.

It appears the MVP race is down to Rams veteran Stafford and Patriots second-year star Maye. The knock on Maye has been that he didn't beat anyone especially good. The only teams in the playoff field the Patriots beat this season were the Bills (to whom they also lost) and the Panthers (who finished the season with a losing record).

Stafford led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes, threw eight interceptions and had a Total QBR of 71.0 -- fourth best in the league. Maye had 4,394 passing yards, 31 touchdown passes, 8 interceptions and a league-leading Total QBR of 77.2.

Why it's a myth: Maye has just simply been better.

Total QBR adjusts for opponent quality in its calculation, so the fact that Maye finished first in the league in that category and Stafford fourth has nothing to do with strength of schedule. It also should matter that Maye played better against the soft parts of his schedule than Stafford did against his. Just look at games against NFC South opponents. The Patriots went 4-0 in those matchups, and Maye turned the ball over a total of three times. The Rams went 2-2 against the NFC South, and Stafford turned it over six times, including the fumble that probably cost the Rams the game against Carolina.

Overall, Maye was considerably better than Stafford in common opponent games. They played six of them. Maye was 6-0 with an 81.6 QBR and a 4.3 touchdown-to-interception ratio. Stafford was 4-2 with a 57.8 QBR and a 2.3 touchdown-to-interception ratio against those teams.

The only number that shows Stafford obviously better than Maye this season is the touchdown passes. But don't forget that a somewhat stunning 16 of Stafford's touchdown passes were 4 yards or less (Maye had nine) and eight came from the 1-yard line (Maye had three). Maye also had four rushing touchdowns, while Stafford hasn't had one since 2022.

Give the award to Stafford if you want, but don't do it because of relative strength of schedule. Maye had the better year, even once we adjust for that.

6. San Francisco 49ers

Myth: Christian McCaffrey just had his best season as a 49er.

In a season in which it felt like every significant player on the 49ers missed time with injury, McCaffrey did not. He played in all 17 games and was second in the league in yards from scrimmage with 2,126. That included 1,202 rushing yards on 311 carries and 924 receiving yards on 102 catches. Only five players in the league caught more passes than McCaffrey; four were wide receivers and one was a tight end. The next highest reception total among running backs in 2025 was Bijan Robinson's 79.

McCaffrey also had 17 total touchdowns (10 rushing, seven receiving), which put him third in the league behind Jonathan Taylor and Jahmyr Gibbs. Simply put, CMC was a rock when the Niners needed one. The only year in his career in which he posted more scrimmage yards was his 2019 season in Carolina, and the only two years in which he had more touchdowns were 2019 and his 2023 season in San Francisco.

Why it's a myth: Well, 2023 happened ... but his efficiency also wasn't great this season.

McCaffrey averaged only 3.9 yards per carry this season. That figure ranked 39th in the NFL, right behind Isiah Pacheco and ahead of Chuba Hubbard. And the 49ers' run game was very average, ranking 22nd in rush EPA. McCaffrey's contributions as a receiver are what made his season special and helped win fantasy leagues and drag the banged-up 49ers into the playoffs. But overall, his 2025 season doesn't hold a candle to 2023.

The starkest difference is in early-down efficiency. On first and second down in 2023, McCaffrey averaged 5.4 yards per carry, had 1,337 rushing yards and scored 14 rushing touchdowns. This season, those same numbers were 3.9 yards per carry, 1,064 rushing yards and 7 rushing touchdowns. Workmanlike, for sure, but not spectacular.

Again, McCaffrey was what the 49ers needed him to be this season -- a volume eater and target mismatch in the passing game. But he's not the explosive early-down difference-maker that he was a couple of years ago when the 49ers made it all the way to overtime in the Super Bowl.

7. Green Bay Packers

Myth: They don't have a true No. 1 wide receiver.

Packers coach Matt LaFleur had that famous quote a little over a year ago about how he wants ""to vomit"" when people ask him about his No. 1 wide receiver. LaFleur's point was that it doesn't matter -- that he and QB Jordan Love trust whoever's out there and that he kind of likes having an interchangeable group of WRs that he can mix and match depending on the week and the opponent.

The Packers didn't have a single receiver with more than 55 catches, 724 yards or 6 touchdowns in 2025. Last season, their team leaders in those categories had 55 catches, 857 yards and 7 touchdowns. The year before it was 64, 793 and 8. You get the idea.

Why it's a myth: Christian Watson.

Watson missed the first six games of this season while recovering from a knee injury, which has been his biggest problem as a pro. He returned around the same time that the Packers lost tight end Tucker Kraft to a season-ending injury and helped fill in a lot of the explosive-play element their offense lost when Kraft went down. Love's QBR is 77.7 when Watson is on the field and 69.5 when he's not. His completion percentage over expectation is 5.5% when Watson is on the field and 2.5% when he's not, per Next Gen Stats. His touchdown-to-interception ratio is 5.5 with Watson and 3.0 without. And in the 10 weeks this season in which Watson has played, Love's QBR of 76.7 is the second best in the NFL, behind only Purdy.

The 34th pick in the 2022 draft, Watson has the profile of a No. 1 WR. Injuries have kept him from consistently performing like one, but when he's out there, the effect he has on Love and the offense makes a strong case that he is a WR1.

AFC

1. Denver Broncos

Myth: Their record in close games is going to catch up with them.

The Broncos were 11-2 this season in games decided by eight points or fewer. They are proud of this. They do not view it as luck, and coach Sean Payton has said as much in news conferences. Players on the team have told me when I've covered their games this season that this was a major point of emphasis in their offseason. They were 2-6 in one-score games last season and wanted to be the kind of team that finished close contests off. They believe they're better equipped than their opponents to stay strong in the fourth quarter and make game-deciding plays in game-deciding moments -- especially in home games at Denver's high altitude.

All of that might be true, but decades' worth of data says this is the kind of thing that's prone to regression and won't stay the case if we give it long enough. Just look at the Chiefs, who went 11-0 in one-score games last season (12-0 if you count the playoffs) and were 1-9 in one-score contests in 2025. If it can catch up to Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid, you have to think it could catch up to anyone.

Why it's a myth: It isn't the 2026 season quite yet.

The natural regression to the mean when it comes to a team's record in one-score games doesn't have to happen in the same season. Over the past 10 seasons, 11 of the 20 teams to participate in the Super Bowl have had winning percentages better than .700 in their one-score games in that regular season. I just mentioned the Chiefs, but the Eagles -- the team that beat them in the Super Bowl -- were also 8-2 in one-score regular-season games in 2024. In 2022, when those same two teams met in the Super Bowl, the Chiefs had been 7-3 and the Eagles 7-1 in one-score games that regular season. The last Broncos team to win the Super Bowl, going back 10 years, was 9-3 in one-score games that regular season. The Panthers team they beat in that Super Bowl had gone 7-1 in one-score games.

Payton's point has seemed to be that there's some sort of art to winning close games, and that really good teams are just better at it. There's also a mentality a team can develop over the course of a season that convinces it that it's good at such a thing, and that could help in the critical moments in a league in which the week-to-week margins are so small. Point is, we have a lot of history that tells us teams that are great in one-score games can and do get to the Super Bowl.

2. New England Patriots

Myth: The Patriots' run defense is going to be a liability in the playoffs.

New England's run defense was a big talking point early in the season. Until Tampa Bay's Sean Tucker got 53 yards against the Pats in Week 10, no opposing running back had reached 50 rushing yards in a game. From Weeks 1 through 11, they ranked fifth in the NFL with 2.2 yards allowed before first contact per rush and 14th with a defensive rush success rate of 57.7%.

But from Weeks 12 through 17, the Patriots had one of the worst run defenses in the league. Over that six-week stretch, New England ranked 31st with 3.0 yards before first contact allowed per rush and 32nd with a 45.2% defensive rushing success rate. A team such as Buffalo, which rushed for 118 yards in its Week 5 loss to the Pats and 168 in its Week 15 victory in Foxborough, could be positioned to take advantage of a weakened Pats defense in a postseason matchup.

Why it's a myth: Milton Williams.

The big defensive tackle signed a four-year, $104 million deal with the Patriots in March in free agency. He got injured in the team's Week 11 game against the Jets and didn't return until Sunday's season finale against the Dolphins. That likely explains a lot about why the Patriots struggled so badly against the run from Weeks 12 through 17. New England spent big to sign Williams, who was drawing interest from multiple teams, and the numbers when he's on the field vs. when he's not indicate why that was a good idea -- and why his return bodes extremely well for New England's chances of shoring up that run defense in the playoffs. The Pats also expect to have injured linebacker Robert Spillane back in time for the postseason, which will help even more.

3. Jacksonville Jaguars

Myth: Trevor Lawrence is fixed and one of the best QBs in the league.

Lawrence threw 15 touchdown passes against just one interception in his final six games of the regular season. The Jaguars won their last eight games to secure a division title, and entering Sunday, they were still in position to potentially get the 1-seed in the AFC playoffs (though they did not). The first pick in the 2021 NFL draft, Lawrence appears to finally be living up to his potential under first-year coach Liam Coen and has led the Jaguars to their second 13-win season in team history -- first this century.

Why it's a myth: The stats say Lawrence is pretty much the same guy he has always been.

Lawrence's Total QBR for the season was 58.3, 15th best in the league and just a smidge ahead of where he has always been. From 2022 to 2024, his year-by-year Total QBR numbers were 56.1, 56.9 and 56.1. His completion percentage over expectation (Next Gen Stats) last season was minus-4.0, which ranked 33rd in a 32-team league. This year? It was minus-2.7, which ranked 28th.

Now, this isn't a criticism. Heck, the guy who's 33rd in CPOE is Caleb Williams, and his team is the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs. But the idea that Lawrence is playing better than he ever has isn't supported by the underlying numbers. Coen should be given credit for figuring out the whole picture around him and putting him in an offense that minimizes his weaknesses and maximizes his strengths. The Jaguars' rushing differential has seen the greatest year-over-year improvement of any team in the league. They were outgained by 525 rushing yards last season, and their rush differential was plus-501 this season.

Lawrence is the same player he has always been, just with a better structure around him. It's not necessarily that he's fixed; it's that maybe the Jaguars are.

4. Pittsburgh Steelers

Myth: This is still a classic Steelers defense.

T.J. Watt returned from a punctured lung for the regular-season finale against the Ravens. Cameron Heyward played inspired football Sunday night at age 36, looking determined to make sure this wasn't his or Aaron Rodgers' final game. Nick Herbig. Alex Highsmith. Patrick Queen. Jalen Ramsey. The names, man. The names give it the feel of a vintage Steelers, big-play defense that can get after quarterbacks and get the big stops in the big moments.

Only five teams in the league had more sacks than the Steelers' 48. Only three had more takeaways than their 27.

Why it's a myth: This team is way too reliant on sacks and turnovers.

The Steelers ranked 14th in the league in opponent points allowed per drive at 2.1 -- which is fine, kind of middle of the pack. On drives on which they didn't record a sack, however, that average points per drive goes up to 2.5, which ranked 23rd in the league. Their defense basically doesn't win unless it gets a sack.

The team also isn't great at scoring when it doesn't generate a turnover. Pittsburgh scored the 15th-most points in 2025, but it was third in scoring off turnovers behind only the Jaguars and Bears. A whopping 25.4% of Pittsburgh's points this season came off turnovers. Only the Browns (25.8%) had a higher such percentage, and they scored only 279 points (the Steelers had 391).

There is no doubt the Pittsburgh offense needs its defense's help. And the defense provided enough to get this team to 10 wins and a division title when Baltimore's rookie kicker missed from 44 yards Sunday night. But it feels like another season in which the playoff competition is going to make Pittsburgh look very run-of-the-mill.

5. Houston Texans

Myth: C.J. Stroud isn't the same player he was two years ago.

In 2023 when the Texans snagged the division title, Stroud was Offensive Rookie of the Year and finished in the top 10 in MVP voting. He threw for 4,108 yards that season, along with 23 touchdown passes and only five interceptions. But his production dipped in 2024. And this season, he missed three games with a concussion and is averaging about the same number of passing yards (217.2) as he did last season (219.2). He also threw just 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions.

Why it's a myth: He's still great when it matters and still isn't getting much help.

Stroud had the seventh-best QBR in the fourth quarter and the seventh best on third down in the entire league. He also had the seventh-best QBR when outside the pocket, which is of particular importance because the overhauled Houston offensive line still isn't doing much to protect him. That unit ranked 30th in pass block win rate, ahead of only the Lions and Chargers.

The OL also ranked dead last in run block win rate, which backs up the numbers that say the Texans' run game isn't helping anything, either. Houston's 108.9 rushing yards per game ranked 22nd in the league. It ranked 28th in the league at 3.9 yards per rush and 24th in the league in yards before first contact per rush.

The Texans are winning with defense, but when their offense has a good game, it tends to be because of Stroud, not in spite of him.

6. Buffalo Bills

Myth: Their run defense will keep them from getting to the Super Bowl.

Buffalo has struggled to stop the run all season. Only the Commanders, Giants, Jets and Bengals allowed more rushing yards this season than the 136.2 per game the Bills did. No one allowed more rushing touchdowns than the 24 Buffalo allowed, either. And it was 26th in defensive rush success rate and 31st in defensive rush EPA. No matter how you slice it, the Bills' run defense this season was terrible.

Why it's a myth: They might not have to play a great running team in the playoffs.

With Baltimore failing to make it into the field, the Patriots are the only playoff team besides Buffalo that ranked in the top 10 in the NFL in rushing yards per game. (And they had to run for 243 in Sunday's regular-season finale to get there.) The Chargers ranked 12th, the Broncos 16th, the Jaguars 20th, the Texans 22nd and the Steelers 26th.

Buffalo wouldn't be the worst run defense ever to reach the Super Bowl. (The 2006 Colts allowed 173 rushing yards per game in the regular season and were worse across the board in just about every metric.) But it would be one of the worst. The good news is, there isn't a team in the AFC that's nearly as good at running the ball as the Bills are.

7. Los Angeles Chargers

Myth: They ask too much of Justin Herbert to carry their offense.

The story of the Chargers' season has centered on their offensive line injuries. Both starting tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt, have been out with season-ending injuries for quite some time. Even though he sat out the final game, Herbert was contacted 206 times -- 34 more times than the next most contacted QB in the league (Maye). Only Geno Smith and Cam Ward were sacked more than the 54 times Herbert was dropped. He threw the most touchdowns when pressured (10) of anyone in the league, but only Joe Flacco and Sam Darnold threw more interceptions (7) when pressured than Herbert's six.

Why it's a myth: Their offense isn't that pass-heavy.

The Chargers dropped back to pass on 48.8% of their offensive plays, the 20th-highest rate in the league. Heck, the Steelers had a higher percentage of pass plays than the Chargers. Just 63.6% of their offensive yardage came via the pass, which was also the 20th-highest figure in the league.

The Chargers ranked 12th in the league in rushing yards per game, even with their top two running backs having missed huge chunks of the season with injury. They're just kind of a middle-of-the-road offense overall. Herbert does get hit too much, but it's not because they're putting him in an unusual number of vulnerable situations.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0106%2Fr1597084_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 05:58:59.040261

""It's something that I've been doing my entire career from college to NFL.
Byard's consistency and dependability are rarities in the NFL, yet unsurprising when given the type of players he idolized while growing up.
While Byard always possessed the playmaking abilities of a locker room leader, the two-time Bears captain didn't grow into a vocal leader until 2019.
""I always felt like, to be able to be a great leader, you had to be a great follower first,"" Byard shared.","During his sophomore season in 2017, Byard set a high bar for the remainder of his career, recording a league-best eight interceptions — the most in a season by a Titans player — while also adding two fumble recoveries.

Almost a decade later, Byard's has upheld that reputation. The Philadelphia native has posted at least four interceptions in six of his 10 seasons and, at 32 years old, leads a Bears defense that took the ball away a NFL-leading 33 times. In a league known for its unpredictable nature, Byard believes those stats speak the truth about who he is as a player.

""As consistent as they come,"" Byard affirmed. ""It's something that I've been doing my entire career from college to NFL. [I'm] just super proud about that.

""Anytime you can lead the league in any type of statistical category, especially when you talk about taking the ball away at the safety position, is something that I'm just super proud about.""

Byard's consistency and dependability are rarities in the NFL, yet unsurprising when given the type of players he idolized while growing up. His ""Holy Trinity"" of safeties in the modern era consists of Brian Dawkins, Troy Polamalu and, at the top, Ed Reed.

Both Reed and Polamalu played 12 NFL seasons and appeared in 174 and 158 games, respectively, while Dawkins spent 16 years in the league, totaling 224 games played. The tenacity and intensity with which all three safeties competed, along with their knack for taking the ball away, impressed Byard at a young age and provided a blueprint of the caliber of player he has strived to be.

""Ed Reed is my all-time favorite safety,"" Byard said. ""I mean, his ability to be a ball hawk, the energy level that he brought every single week, I watched his film when I was in college, I still watch his film now. He was a special talent.""

While Byard always possessed the playmaking abilities of a locker room leader, the two-time Bears captain didn't grow into a vocal leader until 2019.

Heading into his fourth season after signing his contract extension in Tennessee, Byard remembers asking veteran defensive tackle Jurrell Casey if he could break down the huddle a few times. The following year, he took over the role alongside DT Jeffrey Simmons.

""I always felt like, to be able to be a great leader, you had to be a great follower first,"" Byard shared. ""I just had great examples early in my career to watch in Tennessee and understand how it is to lead, and sometimes when you're called to be in that position, sometimes you've gotta go take it over. I just take a lot of pride in being able to motivate the guys, inspire the guys, but also do it with my play on the field as well.""

Byard now delivers pregame speeches for the Bears before each game and provides constant support to teammates in-game or throughout the week of preparation, elevating his status as a quintessential team captain.

""He's incredible,"" coach Ben Johnson said Dec. 2. ""I had a lot of respect for him from afar prior to coming into the building and it's nothing but grown from there. He's done a tremendous job taking care of his own business first and foremost.

""He's playing at a really high level on that back end, picking up a new scheme. And he is really leading the charge, not just for the defense, for the entire team. I lean into him heavily for just feeling the pulse for the locker room. He knows what winning looks like, and so his voice really carries a lot of weight for everybody in the building.""

With preparation for the playoffs well underway, Byard's leadership will be necessary inside Halas Hall. Since Sunday, Johnson has been preaching a ""new season"" mentality when it comes to the postseason. Byard — who has been a part of multiple postseason runs, including the Titans' run to the 2019 AFC Championship game — has embodied that mindset.

That started Tuesday just before noon, when Byard brought a Week 1-type of energy to his press conference following a morning session in the weight room. He spoke to the media for nearly 12 minutes, expressing his readiness for the week, his belief in the team and an understanding of what it will take to secure the Bears' first playoff victory since 2011.

""I'm extremely excited, extremely motivated,"" Byard said. ""My energy is up right now. Because at the end of the day, we've obviously had a really good season, division wins, all that other stuff, but everything is zero-zero right now. Even the playoff stats reset.

""We have a great opportunity to go on a run, and it's all about [doing] the best things we can do as far as film study, recovery, everything, and just come in with a great attitude because at the end of the day, we have a special opportunity in front of us and it starts with the Green Bay game.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bears/tkxvojybvfckdby2qwsf,N,,2026-01-07 05:59:02.996770

But he quickly stopped feeling sorry for himself knowing what was expected of him from his teammates – and they noticed.
Head coach Sean McVay pointed out how Adams' impact on the offense has extended beyond traditional stats, noting the yardage he's gained just off pass interference penalties drawn alone.
""I had high expectations for him, but I think what I've been so impressed with is how automatic (he is), his game day demeanor and just his everyday approach,"" McVay said.
This trip to the playoffs marks four years since Adams' last postseason appearance in his career.","WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. – Rams head coach Sean McVay is well aware of how much of a competitor Davante Adams is, so he's keenly aware of how the veteran wide receiver took the team's cautious approach to his hamstring injury that he re-aggravated in Week 14.

As much as it may have tested Adams' patience, the approach has him slated to return to action Saturday against the Panthers in the Wild Card round of the playoffs.

""I know it's pissed him off pretty good because of the competitor that he is,"" said McVay, who also told reporters last week that if Week 18 would've been a playoff game, Adams could've played. ""But he's got that look in his eye that I know he's ready to go.""

""It feels great (to be back),"" Adams said. ""I mean, it feels like it's been a year since I've been out there. It's only been less than a month now, but it's exciting. Excited to be back, for sure.""

Even 12 years into playing in the NFL, the veteran receiver said managing the first few days of being injured is something he's still learning. But he quickly stopped feeling sorry for himself knowing what was expected of him from his teammates – and they noticed.

""I was just talking about this with 'Q' (safety Quentin Lake) the other day,"" Adams said Tuesday when asked about the mental challenge of the last couple of weeks. ""How to manage the first few days is always like, feeling sorry for yourself. And then you realize, especially me being in a position I'm in, guys are looking at me for leadership and direction still in the midst of me dealing with and battling injuries. So, still gotta be there for them, being strong for the team, being present and just finding a way to still include myself into things and be helpful.""

""When he's been off the grass for us as of late with the injury, just watching him handle all of that as a human being but also as a teammate and how he has affected our team in a positive way in all those phases is really cool and unique,"" Stafford said. ""It just goes to show you what kind of person he is and what kind of player he is.""

Now healthy again – Adams was estimated as a full participant Tuesday – Adams can resume being a key piece to a 2025 Rams offense, especially in the red zone. Despite missing the final three weeks of the regular season, he still finished as the league leader in receiving touchdowns with 14.

Head coach Sean McVay pointed out how Adams' impact on the offense has extended beyond traditional stats, noting the yardage he's gained just off pass interference penalties drawn alone.

""I had high expectations for him, but I think what I've been so impressed with is how automatic (he is), his game day demeanor and just his everyday approach,"" McVay said. ""I had high expectations just because the way that I had admired his body of work from afar, but he's even better than I thought. More importantly, he's even better as a person. I've really loved to be able to get to know him.""

This trip to the playoffs marks four years since Adams' last postseason appearance in his career. While it makes him more grateful to be playing meaningful football at this point in the season, he also noted that he played in four NFC championships during his eight seasons with the Packers.

His standard and mindset is not simply just returning to the postseason.

""I was talking about this with a couple of the guys, like, you have to forgive me if we're not cheesing ear-to-ear after the first win,"" Adams said. ""Obviously we've got to go out there and do everything we've got to do to get that win, and we got to play the right type of ball first off in order to be in that position. But we got bigger goals in mind that to just survive the first round of the playoffs, so I think everybody's going to have that mindset of just being locked in the whole time and staying present and in the moment so we can take care of business this week and then get ready for the next week.""

When Adams signed with the Rams this past offseason, he noted that it was a ""great team that made a great push"" in 2024, and that he was ""just here to be another piece to hopefully get (them) over the hump"" after last season ended in the divisional round of the playoffs.

Now in position to do so with his regular season contributions playing a big role, he echoed those same sentiments.

""It's just an overall blessing for me,"" Adams said. ""I'm just a piece in this thing and that's what I mentioned to Sean before I got here and all the receivers when I got here. Just letting them know this is not the Davante show in any way, shape or form. This is just me coming here to hopefully help and push this team over edge and get where we ultimately want to be. Sean bringing me here and allowing me to be myself and go out there and put the ball in the end zone and help us win some games, I'm just excited to be back on the field and able to give us more opportunities to do that.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/rams/szwcpsjyooa7qsdercmr,N,,2026-01-07 05:59:14.280123

The Ravens fired head coach John Harbaugh on Tuesday, just two days after a loss to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers knocked them out of postseason contention. The defeat concluded a campaign that started with Super Bowl expectations but ended out of the playoffs for the first time in Baltimore since the 2021 season.

The Ravens announced Harbaugh's dismissal in a statement from team owner Steve Bisciotti, who wrote:

""Following a comprehensive evaluation of the season and the overall direction of our organization, I decided to make a change at head coach. ... This was an incredibly difficult decision, given the tremendous 18 years we have spent together and the profound respect I have for John as a coach and, more importantly, as a great man of integrity.""

Harbaugh released a statement of his own that the Ravens shared upon his dismissal.

""Well I was hoping for a different kind of message on my last day here, someday, but that day has come today,” Harbaugh wrote. “It comes with disappointment certainly, but more with gratitude and appreciation.""

Harbaugh's job may have come down in part to fateful missed field goal

The Ravens got off to a 1-5 start that was exacerbated by multiple injuries to two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson. They rallied to improve to 6-5 to get back into playoff contention and had a chance to make the postseason Sunday night. But they needed to beat the Steelers to clinch that berth, and they didn't.

The Ravens (8-9) were in a position to win Sunday's game after driving into field-goal range in the final seconds. But Tyler Loop missed a 44-yard attempt as time expired, and the Steelers held on for a 26-24 win that secured the AFC North and ended the Ravens' season.

The loss proved to be the final straw for Harbaugh's tenure in a tumultuous last season with the team. At 18 seasons, Harbaugh was the second-longest tenured head coach in the NFL behind Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin.

Per The Athletic's Dianna Russini, Harbaugh refused to consider moving on from offensive coordinator Todd Monken in his discussions with team management, and that became a ""key pressure point"" in his dismissal.

Losses, reported tension tank Super Bowl hopes

With Jackson and All-Pro running back Derrick Henry anchoring the offense of a team that finished 12-5 in 2024, the Ravens were picked by many as preseason favorites to win the Super Bowl. Those hopes in Baltimore were muted even before injuries began to derail Jackson's season.

Baltimore got off to a 1-2 start before Jackson injured his hamstring in a Week 4 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Ravens lost their next two starts with Cooper Rush at quarterback, but surged back into playoff contention in a weak AFC North with a five-game midseason win streak.

But the Ravens couldn't maintain that momentum as injuries hampered Jackson for the rest of the season and reports of discord between Harbaugh and Jackson surfaced. The Ravens closed with a 2-4 streak and missed the playoffs with an 8-9 record.

As the losses and rumblings of in-house tension mounted, so did the pressure on Harbaugh's job.

Harbaugh is a franchise stalwart who has coached the Ravens for more than half of their 30-year existence. He led the Ravens to the playoffs in 12 of his 18 seasons and finished with a losing record just three times.

He coached the Ravens to a Super Bowl championship after the 2012 season, defeating his brother Jim and the San Francisco 49ers in New Orleans. Under Harbaugh, the Ravens were a consistent winner and one of the NFL's standout franchises.

Disappointment in Jackson-Harbaugh era piled up

But disappointment and early exits in the postseason became the predominant theme of the Jackson era in Baltimore. With a two-time MVP at quarterback, the Ravens have failed to advance to the Super Bowl much less win one in Jackson's eight seasons with the team.

They've won the AFC North four times and posted 10-plus wins in six of Jackson's eight seasons. But they've been to the AFC championship game just once and are 3-6 in the postseason in that span.

Jackson is 28 and presumably has several years left in his prime. The Ravens ultimately decided they need new leadership to optimize the remainder of Jackson's tenure after repeatedly failing to meet expectations when the stakes were at their highest.

The Harbaugh era will ultimately be remembered fondly in Baltimore as one predominantly defined by winning. But Monday's decision was about building the future around Jackson.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9AjihHPUeATEAvE7GzXZkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/c05c4580-e5d6-11f0-9ffd-1fdbc152dd07,N,,2026-01-07 05:59:16.886774

Caleb Williams led the Chicago Bears to an 11-6 mark and the NFC North Division title en route to the NFC No. 2 seed while DeVonta Smith and the Philadelphia Eagles were also division champs with the same record and claimed the No. 3 seed.

Bryce Young and the Carolina Panthers won the NFC South at 8-9, squeaking in via a tiebreaker over the Baker Mayfield-led Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta.

In the AFC, Travis Hunter’s Jacksonville Jaguars earned the No. 3 seed, but the most recent Heisman winner has been sidelined since November with a knee injury and will not play in the postseason.

A year ago, Smith became the first Heisman winner to secure a Super Bowl ring since Charles Woodson in 2011 when he helped the Eagles beat Kansas City, 40-22. Now, Smith has a chance to become the first Heisman winner to win two straight Super Bowls and just the third to win two overall (which would equal the feat shared by the Cowboys’ Roger Staubach and the Raiders’ Jim Plunkett).

In addition to the Heisman winners, there are three Heisman runners-up and another five Heisman finalists in this year’s NFL playoff mix. The trio of runners-up include Jacksonville’s Trevor Lawrence (2020), Philadelphia’s Jalen Hurts (2019) and San Francisco’s Christian McCaffrey (2015).

Other finalists playing include Denver’s Box Nix (2023), Houston’s C.J. Stroud (2021-22), San Francisco’s Mac Jones (2020), Pittsburgh’s Jabrill Peppers (2016) and Los Angeles’ Stetson Bennett (2022), who is the Rams’ emergency QB.

A handful of other top 10 Heisman finishers are also in action, but none older than 2004 Heisman ninth-place finisher and Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers.

Two more Heisman winners — Baltimore teammates Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry — came within a play of joining the playoff fray, but the Ravens’ Week 18 game-ending field goal miss ended their season.

Henry finished as the league’s second-leading rusher with 1,595 yards on 307 carries, falling 27 yards short of his third career NFL rushing title. Henry’s 17 carries of 20 or more yards was a league-best while his 16 rushing scores were second-best.

Henry moved into 10th all-time on the NFL’s career rushing chart with 13,018 yards, moving past fellow Heisman winner Tony Dorsett in Week 17. Barry Sanders is the only Heisman winner with more career rushing yards (15,269). Henry is also now fourth on the NFL’s career rushing touchdown list (122) and needs one more to catch fellow Heisman winner Marcus Allen.

Williams, who guided the Bears to their first playoff berth since 2020, finished seventh in the NFL in passing yards (3,942) in his sophomore season while throwing 27 TDs, both career bests. He also rushed for 388 yards and his first three rushing scores.

Mayfield was 10th in passing yards (3,693) and threw 26 TDs. He leads active Heisman winners in NFL career passing yards (28.525) and is 65th on the career list.

Young, in guiding the Panthers back to the postseason for the first time since 2017, posted career highs in passing yards (3,011), completion percentage (63.6) and passing TDs (23).

Smith finished the regular season 17th in receiving yards (1,008) and tied for 21st with 77 receptions, including four for scores. It was his third 1,000-yard season with the Eagles and he now has 5,019 career receiving yards, 385 career receptions and 31 career TD catches.

Campbell helped pave a run game that demoralized the Dolphins and will be a big element of the Patriots’ first home playoff game since Tom Brady was QB.
As is fitting for this year’s playoff field, a Week 18 defeat didn’t hurt the Bears.
The shine should not be taken off of the first playoff game for Dave Canales and Bryce Young, though.
All signs point to the team drafting a quarterback this offseason after earning the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.","The playoff field is set, led by the top-ranked Seahawks, who have resided in the top spot here for multiple weeks now. They might enter the tournament as the favorites to win Super Bowl LX -- in the same stadium where they clinched the NFC’s top seed -- but this feels like one of the more wide-open postseasons in years. The Broncos, with their 11-2 mark in one-score games, are the AFC's top dogs.

There's no Patrick Mahomes or Lamar Jackson to frighten opponents. No Lions team to do the same. But also: Every playoff team seems to have a significant weakness that can't be overlooked.

Seattle, New England, Chicago and Jacksonville all missed the playoffs a year ago. Those are four of your top six seeds. The Eagles won it all last year, and at their best, they're capable of repeating -- but they also sat many starters on Sunday, ceding the second seed to the Bears.

This might be a year where a lower seed makes some real noise. Everyone will rightfully nominate the Rams and Bills as natural party crashers, but don't sleep on the Texans, Chargers and 49ers.

Playoff intrigue annually abounds, but there's seemingly more of an ""Anyone can win!"" to this postseason field than any in recent memory.

On a programming note, the Power Rankings will keep rolling along in the postseason, although we'll bid adieu to the 18 non-playoff teams next week. But fear not, we'll see them again soon. The offseason is closer than you think.

The Seahawks faced a 49ers team that had scored 90 points in its previous eight quarters, and Seattle summarily ground San Francisco's offense into a fine powder in a shocking performance. We knew the 'Hawks were good defensively, even in the debate for the NFL’s top unit this season -- but to nearly erase the Niners completely, holding them to 173 yards and three points, was a massive statement to the rest of the league. The Eagles won the Super Bowl last season with a similar profile: a swarming, ballhawking defense backed by a strong run game and a big-play passing outfit. I am willing to look past Jason Myers’ miserable game at Levi’s Stadium because of how good the kicker has been this season, especially in the previous two months. Assuming Seattle’s special teams don’t suddenly become an issue, I think turnovers are the one real Achilles’ heel that worries me. If the Seahawks can control the ball, they can win it all.

The Patriots played to win on Sunday, and they looked playoff-ready in thumping the Dolphins. The game was a little closer at one point than the score might have indicated, but the bottom line is New England took care of business and appears to be humming ahead of its matchup with the Chargers. The returns of Milton Williams and Will Campbell also were big positives, with Williams energizing the defensive front, even with a few early mishaps on that side of the ball. Campbell helped pave a run game that demoralized the Dolphins and will be a big element of the Patriots’ first home playoff game since Tom Brady was QB. Strangely, these Pats have a better record on the road (8-0) than at home (6-3), but they have to feel good about how they’re playing. They’ll need to find a pass rush against Justin Herbert, but Drake Maye can also match him throw for throw in what looks like an excellent matchup.

Jacksonville dawdled around on the first series of the game ... and then ripped off 41 unanswered points in a shellacking of Tennessee. The score and opponent aren’t that important, but the Jaguars' quick-strike ability is notable. They’ve had a few games in the second half of the season where they’ve just cranked up the afterburners -- including in the second halves against the Chargers and Broncos. During the eight-game win streak, the Jags have outscored its opponents by a count of 269 to 116. Possibly only getting one home game hurts a bit, but they were 7-2 at home and 6-2 on the road against a very competitive schedule. Getting past Buffalo on Wild Card Weekend will be no cakewalk, either. But the Jaguars have won some impressive games this season, have big-play potential in all three phases and are as poised to make a postseason run as they’ve been since 2017.

Some might view it as controversial, with the Broncos earning the AFC’s top seed, to keep them here. They’ve only lost once since September and will have home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Yet, the loss to the Jaguars and a few close wins have me a bit concerned. Even Broncos fans seemed to sense it when they were mildly booing Denver's offense on Sunday with the team less than a quarter away from clinching said top seed. The Broncos have not been a dominant team this season; they’ve been consistently very good, while also being guilty of leaving the back door open at times. There’s absolutely a path for Bo Nix and the defense to play well enough to get to Santa Clara, especially in this year’s field. But there’s also a scenario where Denver doesn't score enough points and doesn't get that key turnover defensively in a disappointing playoff loss. Which way will it end up?

It was a bittersweet end to the final regular season in Highmark Stadium. The Bills blew out the rival Jets despite sitting several key players, but they also know the chance of squeezing another home game into this season is extremely slim. Josh Allen rested his right foot after the first play of the game, giving him another week to heal and prepare for a tough Jacksonville team. That was the biggest development. But don’t overlook the Bills’ newest kicking drama, with Matt Prater leaving Sunday’s contest. Michael Badgley flamed out of his two-game tryout, and Prater’s status remains in question. The Bills have enough issues as it is; they don’t need another layer of uncertainty. If Allen is healthy, he’s good enough to cover up a lot of warts. But if that foot is still bothering him and Buffalo can’t find a way to play well in all three phases against a good opponent, it could be a one-and-done postseason.

Perhaps it’s a sign of growth, but after playing their last eight Wild Card Round games in the Saturday 4:30 p.m. ET slot, the Texans will head to Pittsburgh for a prime-time contest in which they are favored to win. They’ve won nine straight games, seven of them by one score, but they’re undoubtedly a steadier operation than the Steelers right now and clearly have a good opportunity in front of them. Defense travels, and even after their season-worst 30 points allowed to the Colts and their first-time starting QB, the Texans head into the playoffs with the second-best scoring D in the NFL. Houston's potential lies in how much C.J. Stroud and the offense produce. They’ve been good at taking care of the ball and posting respectable results most weeks, but the output must be kicked up a notch or two in order for the Texans to do some real damage in the playoffs.

Los Angeles locked up the fifth seed and a rematch against Carolina, which beat L.A. in Week 13. Back then, the Rams were presumably the best team in football, and the way they had finished the two prior seasons, it wasn’t hard to imagine them winning it all. Now? The road feels tougher, although not nearly impossible. Matthew Stafford capped an MVP-caliber campaign, roasting the Cardinals to finish the regular season on a high note after two straight losses, but now he and the Rams must return to the field where Stafford turned the ball over three times in that critical loss. They’re still big favorites over the Panthers and will have a chance to re-stoke the fires, but a grueling second-round playoff road game would await them. If Davante Adams is back and their defense can make stands, the Rams will have a chance to make a run. If not, it could be a surprisingly short postseason.

As is fitting for this year’s playoff field, a Week 18 defeat didn’t hurt the Bears. Losing to the Lions made for some nervous moments, but the Eagles’ loss ensured Chicago would end up as the second seed and get a third game against the rival Packers -- a team that nearly swept the Bears. It’s a fun and worthy playoff opener, to see if the Bears really have exorcized the demons that have plagued this franchise for decades. Between allowing explosive plays on defense and the offense stalling for long stretches, there are multiple worries at hand for Chicago on the eve of the playoffs. Only the Bengals, Commanders and Cowboys allowed more yards than the Bears this season, which is an atypical weakness for a team so high in the conference rankings. They’ve thrived by forcing turnovers and cashing in on late offensive drives. That’s an exciting but dangerous way to go. Have Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson bottled up enough late-game magic for January?

The 49ers came crashing down with a stunning short-circuiting offensively, even as good as Seattle’s defense is. The Niners’ explosive ability had been on full display in the previous three games, but the Seahawks just shut them down. The irony is that San Francisco's defense held Seattle to 13 points, although there were enough missed tackles and Seahawks self-inflicted wounds not to praise that effort too much. The bottom line is the 49ers cannot afford anything close to what happened to them offensively in that game. The offense is their bread and butter for making a surprise postseason run, and the voyage starts against a tough, pretty rested Eagles defense in Philadelphia. The Niners have faced some of the NFL’s best defenses -- Seattle, Cleveland, Houston, Jacksonville and the L.A. Rams -- with mixed results. They’re capable of making noise with Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle playing in peak form, but Week 18 cast some doubt on just how dangerous they truly are for the long haul.

The Eagles opted to punt on Week 18 to rest up for the playoffs, missing a chance to move up from the No. 3 seed to No. 2. That indifference could be viewed a number of ways, but it did give the Philly offense a chance to breathe a bit before the action gets thick. The defense should be championship-worthy, having shown it can dismantle quality opponents (SEE: wins over the Packers, Lions and Bills). It’ll be strength on strength against a Niners offense that can fill it up quickly, but San Francisco's Week 18 loss to Seattle is proof that the Eagles can prevail with elite defense. But can they score? Can they generate explosive plays and a consistently good run game? That might be the difference between playing one game and making a run at defending their title.

The Chargers seemed to be fine with the idea of going to Foxborough prior to Week 18, sitting Justin Herbert to give him a 14-day rest period as a runway to the game. Given the beating he's taken this season, that might have been the most prudent route. Rest for the likes of Khalil Mack, Derwin James and some offensive linemen probably helped, too. Los Angeles is good enough to beat New England if Herbert has time to operate, but outside of a dominant performance at Dallas, the Bolts haven’t played great on the road down the stretch. Without a complete offensive line, it's hard to imagine this team making a Super Bowl run. But with a capable defense and a miracle-working QB, winning a game or two wouldn’t be stunning.

The Steelers punched the last playoff ticket by surviving Sunday night’s regular-season finale against the rival Ravens, with a fourth quarter few will forget anytime soon. Pittsburgh has won four of five games heading into Monday’s wild-card matchup with Houston, although it would be wrong to call this team “hot” entering the playoffs. Sunday’s arduous win, along with the prior-week loss to the Browns, provided more than enough healthy skepticism about the Steelers’ postseason chances -- starting with this first game, in which they’re home underdogs. The return of DK Metcalf is a potential game-changer, as he was sorely missed during the two-game suspension. But we’re still on Aaron Rodgers watch, as his future continues to hang in the air while this team clings to postseason life. Moving the ball consistently against a wicked Texans defense is going to be a major challenge.

The Packers can take solace in the fact that they beat the Bears once, should have beaten them a second time in Chicago and now have a chance to make up for that missed opportunity. Losing four straight entering the playoffs doesn’t feel like the best run-up possible, but Green Bay should have something of a clean slate facing a team it clearly matches up well against. I’m assuming that Jordan Love will be starting after sitting the two games since he suffered a concussion at Chicago in Week 16. If he and his receivers can connect on a few vertical shots, Green Bay will have a chance to finish what it started a few weeks ago at Soldier Field. Not having Micah Parsons or Tucker Kraft likely means the Packers won’t win a Super Bowl this season, but a postseason victory over their rivals is right there for the taking.

That the Panthers won the division a day after losing to the Bucs, needing a tiebreaker in Atlanta to come through, is a fitting metaphor for the NFC South champs. This is a team with the third-best point differential in the division (minus-69, not so nice) and one that hasn’t won a game by more than seven points since September. Then again, these Panthers also played one of their best games at Bank of America Stadium against the Rams not that long ago and have a shot to beat them at home once again this Saturday. Los Angeles is arguably even less potent now than it was back then, although Carolina clearly is the underdog in this rematch. The shine should not be taken off of the first playoff game for Dave Canales and Bryce Young, though. The franchise’s investments in them have been rewarded to a degree. But it would be pretty stunning to see a sub-.500 team beat a Rams outfit that, until very recently, was considered the Super Bowl favorite.

Tyler Loop’s last-second kick went awry, and after all the teases and reminders of what the Ravens could be (or could have been), the season ended with a thud. Perhaps it just wasn’t their year, as the preponderance of evidence suggested. The 1-5 start. Lamar Jackson’s injuries. The early-season defensive struggles. Derrick Henry’s fumbles in an otherwise-brilliant campaign. Even Loop’s miss was a confounding surprise, considering how good the rookie had been for nearly the entire season. The ingredients were there for another dangerous playoff outfit, but they never quite came together as expected. What this means in the long term is anyone’s guess now, but it’s fair to say that, even with the occasionally scary potential Baltimore displayed this season, this never consistently looked like a team capable of making a Super Bowl run.

EDITOR'S UPDATE: The Ravens are firing head coach John Harbaugh, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported on Tuesday.

J.J. McCarthy started Sunday’s finale and was playing well against a Green Bay team resting most of its key players, but McCarthy left in the third quarter after appearing to aggravate the throwing-hand injury that caused him to miss Week 17’s game. That injury in and of itself is not the story. It will heal over the coming months, just like the other injuries McCarthy has suffered over the past couple years. But the long-term questions about his constitution won’t let up until he gets through a season relatively unscathed -- and how much can Minnesota really trust him as the sole protector of the position? The Vikings won their final five games to finish at 9-8, so there’s evidence to suggest they could be in contention a year from now, even with the questions at QB and the possibility of Brian Flores leaving. How Minnesota approaches the offseason will be fascinating and telling.

The Lions finished the season with the NFC North’s best point differential at plus-68, which was actually better than five NFC playoff teams. You can’t call this a successful season after Detroit missed the playoffs, but you can acknowledge that the team came up a few games short against a challenging schedule and that rebounding next season can’t at all be dismissed. Some tough decisions lie ahead, with multiple offensive linemen likely pondering retirement and a defense that still badly needs more depth and firepower. The Lions also need to regain their offensive mojo after a season in which fourth-down failures often cost them. The guts of a playoff contender were still there in the gut-check, game-winning drive against Chicago, and they could be back in 2026.

The Buccaneers' miserable second half of the season was punctuated with a victory that ended up not meaning enough. Eking out a win over the Panthers at home in Week 18 showed the team still had life, but Atlanta's victory over the Saints made that irrelevant. Tampa Bay made its bed by losing seven of eight games following the Week 9 bye. Prior to that, this looked like a Super Bowl-caliber operation on its best days. The finish was a cold reminder that the Bucs weren't actually that close. Even sneaking into the playoffs likely would have temporarily masked the reality that they were several key contributors short of the mark they wanted to hit. Baker Mayfield reached plenty of high notes this season, but his frustrating close is the backdrop to this reality: His contract is up after the 2026 campaign, and the Bucs must decide if his hell-or-high-water recklessness has long-term sustainability. An important offseason awaits this franchise.

Shane Steichen and Chris Ballard will return next season, and there's a path for pending free agent Daniel Jones to come back and finish what he couldn't during an occasionally brilliant 2025. Credit the Colts for going for it and striking while the iron was hot, sitting at 7-2 this season, but the Sauce Gardner trade temporarily backfired -- and the aftermath will be felt in the 2026 NFL Draft, as the Jets now own the 16th overall pick. That will sting come spring, when the Colts are left to address their needs after falling to make the playoffs for the fifth straight season. Did Riley Leonard show enough in his Week 18 start to make the Colts comfortable with a QB room of Anthony Richardson , Leonard and a recovering Jones? If so, the offseason focus could shift to the offensive line and a defense that must be repaired in order to improve.

Arthur Blank didn't even wait for the clock to strike midnight on Sunday, firing head coach Raheem Morris and GM Terry Fontenot after the Falcons beat the Saints and knocked the Bucs out of the postseason. Atlanta's strong finish, in which the Falcons won four straight and dropped the Rams in a prime-time game, was not enough to save the duo after the 4-9 start to the season. The talent suggests this could be a fascinating opening for both spots, especially in what appears to be a wide-open division. But there are questions about QB Michael Penix Jr. 's progression and whether his skill set matches what the yet-to-be-named new regime's vision will be. The Falcons fixed some things defensively, and they feature some explosive offensive talent (even with Kyle Pitts headed to free agency), possibly setting this up as a playoff contender next year, with the right new coach. Ben Johnson, Mike Vrabel and Liam Coen proved it's possible for new blood to have that effect, but Pete Carroll and Aaron Glenn simultaneously showed that improvement is far from guaranteed.

It clearly felt important to Brian Schottenheimer to go into New Jersey in Week 18 and beat a Giants team that had only defeated the Raiders since early October, and yet Dallas fell flat -- with several starters playing at least half the game. It was a frustrating finish, with the Cowboys losing four of their final five games following the dramatic win over the Chiefs on Thanksgiving, serving as a stark reminder of how much still must be done if they harbor any hopes of making a title run during Dak Prescott 's window. The overhaul has to start on Dallas' defense, which was one of the worst units in football this past season. Trevon Diggs ' release was just the first step. On Tuesday, the 'Boys fired defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus after one season on the job. One of the few bright spots for the unit, Jadeveon Clowney , had a career-high three sacks, a forced fumble and a recovery in Sunday's defeat, but he's set to become a free agent. How deep can Dallas go on a 32-year-old while stricken with cap-space issues? It's just one of many questions on that side of the ball this offseason.

After another season missing the playoffs, the Bengals announced that they're going to run it back for 2026, retaining head coach Zac Taylor and personnel head Duke Tobin, along with the franchise's major offensive pillars. Joe Burrow 's window keeps shrinking with every injury-riddled season that passes. And every encouraging development down the stretch in this lost campaign seemingly came with a stark reminder that Cincinnati remains an incomplete product. Perhaps even more pressing than Trey Hendrickson 's impending free agency is a need to continue overhauling a defense that ranked near the bottom of the NFL in several key categories. The Bengals currently find themselves in the netherworld between contending and rebuilding, and they've got to find a way out of that purgatory before it's too late.

The Saints became far more competitive down the stretch in Kellen Moore's first season, showing tangible growth with the move to QB Tyler Shough and finishing the campaign as a surprisingly effective team on defense. The four-game win streak was snapped by Week 18's loss to Atlanta, one that highlighted some real issues on special teams. The Saints won't compete for the playoffs next season unless they make major fixes to that element of the operation, and there are some aging veterans and long-time fixtures on each side of the ball whose futures remain up in the air. But there's at least a runway into 2026 and a hope that an added offseason of preparation should make the Shough-and-Moore-led offense a feared group next fall.

Andy Reid will be back, as will Patrick Mahomes , once his rehabilitation from knee surgery is completed, giving the Chiefs a second chance at competing. We still don't know Travis Kelce 's plans, and it appears as if there could be assistant coaching changes ahead, so there's only so much we can project for this team's immediate and long-term futures. But sprinkle dirt over the Chiefs' graves at your own risk. It might feel like they've hit rock bottom, at least by the standards established over the past decade, but they'll have an avenue toward re-emerging as contenders. To that end, how they go about doing it and how aggressive they are this offseason could be pretty telling.

The Dolphins hit a few high notes in the second half of 2025, but they face an offseason of change ahead. New GM candidates are being interviewed as you read this, and the future of QB Tua Tagovailoa will be the offseason talking point after he was benched for rookie Quinn Ewers . Tyreek Hill also will come into the crosshairs once again this offseason after the Dolphins delayed a split with him prior to this past season. Until the key front-office role is filled, we won't know much about Miami's plan -- although we do have a sense Mike McDaniel will stick around, based on reporting by the NFL Insiders. The inconsistencies of his past few seasons are too glaring to simply brush aside, but McDaniel still has a respectable record overall at 35-33. One way or another, Miami figures to make extensive changes this offseason.

Following a shocking return to irrelevance in 2025, the immediate future of the Commanders remains murky for now. Their defensive needs alone are almost too numerous to list. On top of that, the Commanders must find ways to protect and insulate Jayden Daniels better. Oh, and they'll have new coordinators on both sides of the ball, as Washington parted ways with OC Kliff Kingsbury and DC Joe Whitt Jr. on Tuesday. It appears on the surface that free agency will be an important route for the rebuilding process, with the Commanders currently ranking fifth in projected cap space, per Over The Cap. On the flip side, their draft-pick till has been thinned via past trades; losing 10 of their past 12 games netted them the No. 7 overall choice, but Washington won't have its second- or fourth-round picks in 2026. A return to the playoffs wouldn't be shocking if the defense improves and Daniels can get through the season healthy, but it shouldn't be assumed, either, given the way this past season went.

The Browns moved on from Kevin Stefanski, who should immediately become one of the more sought-after head-coaching candidates available. Such is life for the Browns, who remain a promising but disappointing team sailing through uncharted waters again, searching for some sort of respite after a 5-12 season. They were competitive at times down the stretch, winning their final two games, but they exited with even more questions about their future at football's two most indispensable roles: head coach and quarterback. Whatever promise Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel might hold as NFL signal-callers will remain subject to the next coach's vision and GM Andrew Berry's whim, and picking as high as they are in the draft (No. 6 overall, with the Jaguars' first-rounder also in their possession) puts them in prime QB country in the draft. Again. Who's ready for another Browns offseason?

GM Joe Schoen will be staying put and leading the search for the Giants’ next head coach in yet another offseason of significant change for the franchise. The team appears to have found its quarterback of the future in Jaxson Dart , though his performance and self-preservation skills still remain subject to scrutiny. The roster also features several high-end players who could help trigger an expedited rebuild next season, but the Giants are not nearly as flush with salary-cap space as they were a year ago. They’re not as well-stocked in the draft-pick department, either, with the Week 17 and 18 victories pushing them down to the No. 5 spot overall. They also lack a third-round pick. There are reasons to be optimistic about a quick turnaround, though, especially in a division that could be more up for grabs next season. But there’s also the cold reality that this team has lost double-digit games for three years running.

Cam Ward 's Week 18 shoulder injury marred a strong finish to his otherwise-frustrating rookie season, one that saw the first-year passer swimming mostly upstream during Tennessee’s 1-11 start. Assuming Ward’s injury doesn’t carry long-term concern, he'll be back -- paired with a new coach -- armed to make gains in 2026. The Titans’ draft class flashed some nice promise, and another fresh crop of talent from GM Mike Borgonzi and his staff could have the franchise running more smoothly in time. Even with some big-money misses in recent offseasons, the Titans are stocked with free-agent dollars and cap space. They should be prepared to partner Ward with better offensive weaponry and support staff, but they also can’t overlook all the shortcomings on defense.

Jonathan Gannon couldn’t survive a shockingly bad 2025 season -- his third (and worst) sub.-500 campaign in as many years. Arizona started out 2-0 but quickly fell off the wagon, dropping 14 of their final 15 games. At first, the losses were close and competitive, but too often down the stretch the team lacked competitiveness and appeared disinterested in fighting hard. As with many teams we’ve run through so far, the offseason to-do list appears pretty significant. After finding a head coach, Arizona must decide how to proceed with Kyler Murray , whose future with the club is cloudy, to say the least. There’s a pretty good battery of talent still here that the next coach will inherit, but the QB question -- especially in such a daunting division -- will hang over the Cardinals’ heads until it’s proven they’ve taken the right path forward.

It might seem hard to remember, but the Jets were fairly competitive for stretches this season. The final month was not one of those stretches, however, with defensive firepower long since traded away, no good solutions at quarterback and injuries further depleting the roster. There’s no other way to say it: Following their Week 13 win over the Falcons, the Jets were just non-competitive down the stretch. We’re not going to crush them for losing to the Bills on Sunday in what was likely the last NFL game at Highmark Stadium (even with Josh Allen playing only one snap), but to crash with that kind of thud is really disappointing. The interception-less streak is an incredible stat, and incredibly damning for a coach who cut his teeth coaching DBs and played the position as a pro. The Jets have major defensive holes, and they have no clear-cut identity on offense before they pick a quarterback and make a long-term decision on RB Breece Hall . Clinching the No. 2 overall selection and having the first-rounder they acquired from the Colts go way up in value after the trade are both nice windfalls, but New York's offseason to-do list is immensely long.

All signs point to the team drafting a quarterback this offseason after earning the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Raiders' last-place finish is a reflection of GM John Spytek’s failed Geno Smith trade from the 2025 offseason, but acquiring the veteran always seemed like a transitional move. And speaking of transitions, Vegas will have a new coaching staff in 2026 after the Pete Carroll experiment fell flat. Now all the focus must be on finding a leader who can dispel a losing culture, shepherd a young quarterback and rebuild trust inside and outside of the organization. It could be a monumental offseason for the program, as defensive pillar Maxx Crosby and the team appeared to be on different pages by season’s end, with his future very much hanging in the balance. The Raiders could be a golden rebuilding opportunity, but it’s also a team fraught with issues and major decisions.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/bs8uc5cpqbuhw05g1kvw,N,,2026-01-06 21:14:27.528691

Given his playing situation in Cincinnati, Taylor-Britt said he would be open to playing for a new team next season.","CINCINNATI -- Bengals cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt was sentenced to five days of jail time for a driving incident, an Ohio judge ruled Tuesday.

Taylor-Britt reached a plea deal regarding charges from an incident stemming on Sept. 14. Taylor was facing misdemeanor charges of driving without a license and reckless driving. The ruling was delivered after Hamilton County judge Bernie Bouchard declined to grant Taylor-Britt community service following a court hearing in Cincinnati.

The reckless driving charge is a misdemeanor charge punishable up to 30 days in jail, a $250 fine or a combination of both. After the verdict was delivered, Joseph Tekulve, Taylor-Britt's attorney, attempted to set a fixed date for the Bengals cornerback to serve his jail time.

Bouchard insisted that it be done immediately.

""That's a gift,"" Bouchard told Taylor-Britt on Tuesday. ""Five days instead of 30. He's got to do them now. It'll be over soon enough.""

City officials alleged that Taylor-Britt did a burnout on the wrong side of the road on Sept. 14, less than a half mile from Paycor Stadium following Cincinnati's Week 2 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

While court records indicate the incident occurred on Sept. 14, county attorneys testified in court that the incident in question occurred in June. A request for comment left for the Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney's office was not immediately returned.

The hearing Tuesday morning started initially without Taylor-Britt. Tekulve told Bouchard that the Bengals cornerback was available on standby and while a plea deal was on the verge of being reached, Taylor-Britt had not officially received a valid license.

""This is getting old,"" said Bouchard, who then instructed to Tekulve to have Taylor-Britt arrive at the courthouse before noon Tuesday under the likelihood of serving jail time.

Two hours later, Taylor-Britt entered the courthouse on crutches. He is recovering from a Lisfranc injury on his left foot that required surgery.

During the second half of Tuesday's hearing, Taylor-Britt made his guilty plea official.

""I just want to apologize, first and foremost for my actions that I've put everybody else through,"" Taylor-Britt said. ""Not intentional in [any] way.""

Tekulve said that Taylor-Britt was at a Kentucky transportation office Tuesday to receive his new license. The attorney also told the judge that Taylor-Britt has not driven since October and is selling the vehicle involved in the incident.

""I planned already to knock out those things that got me into this place,"" Taylor-Britt told Bouchard. ""Because it's not me.""

Bouchard was not moved. He took exception to why Taylor-Britt was driving without a license when the incident occurred.

""You're putting yourself and everybody else in danger on the street,"" Bouchard said. ""Why?""

""No reason at all,"" Taylor-Britt said.

Despite the plea and the cornerback's contrition, Bouchard sentenced Taylor-Britt to jail time immediately.

The trial date was initially set for Nov. 20 but then moved to Tuesday, two days after the end of Cincinnati's season. Taylor-Britt has not played since he was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 21 following the injury he suffered in a Week 11 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Taylor-Britt, 26, began the season as one of the team's starting outside cornerbacks. However, he was benched, a healthy scratch for the team's Week 7 game against Pittsburgh before returning to the starting role before the injury.

The 2022 second-round pick is set to be a free agent after the expiration of his rookie deal. Cincinnati currently has Dax Hill and DJ Turner II slotted as its top outside cornerbacks.

Taylor-Britt spoke to reporters Monday, before his criminal case was publicized by media reports. Given his playing situation in Cincinnati, Taylor-Britt said he would be open to playing for a new team next season.

To become a true legend, though, the running back knows more wins need to be part of the story.

""Everywhere I've been I've kind of been the rah-rah just because I'm loud and obnoxious,"" said Skattebo, reflecting on a reporter's question about becoming a phenomenon. ""But we still went 4-13. So, if you're the face of the franchise and you're not a good franchise, then there's still an issue and it's not that big of a deal (to be a fan favorite). But if I'm the face of the franchise when we're winning the Super Bowl, then you can ask me that question in a year or two.""

It was a wise response by a member of the young core looking to reverse the team's fortunes. Skattebo, along with close friend and quarterback Jaxson Dart, will take on even bigger roles now that the ""rookie"" label has been officially shed.

""It's hard to lead a team full of vets,"" Skattebo said. ""Vets look at rookies as rookies, so you have to kind of fight through that if you are a true leader and you fight through that for your rookie year. Things start to change when you're a leader and start to be able to step up and take the role they're supposed to.""

First, Skattebo needs to get healthy.

The fourth-round pick was on his way to a memorable debut campaign with seven total touchdowns in eight games, including a three-score performance during a Thursday night victory over the Eagles at MetLife Stadium.

Skattebo and the Giants were on top of the football world, but two games later, everyone witnessed his dislocated ankle in Philadelphia. Skattebo had to be taken to a local hospital for further evaluation and ultimately surgery.

Ten weeks later, Skattebo said he is on schedule and will soon start ""upping"" his speed. The main thing is getting back the upward movement of his foot, known as dorsiflexion, after being ""stuck"" in a boot for eight weeks.

Training camp is his ultimate goal for a return date, if not earlier for spring practices.

""I've kind of found different ways to show myself and be who I am (in that time), Skattebo said. ""The opportunities that have come from that have been awesome. Obviously, the main thing is football, so I'll get back to that when I'm ready to go. It's football from there on out.""

There is no doubt that he will be back to 100 percent.

""That's not even a question,"" Skattebo said. ""I'm going to be back. I've played seven games in the NFL and I got hurt. There's a long road ahead. That is not going to stop me.""

Then he can start helping his team on the field again as opposed to providing just moral support.

""It sucked because you can't be out there to help,"" Skattebo said. ""When you can't do something to make sure that your team is in a better position to win or you can't contribute at all other than having the energy on the sidelines and making sure the guys in the building have a positive mindset, it's hard to be in that situation. But I tried to take it as best as I could.""

The rookies will also move ahead with a new head coach. A common question in the final locker room session of the season was what are players looking for in the next man to lead the team.

Skattebo turned the question inward.

""No matter who the coach is, the players have got to step it up,"" he said. ""We have to lead an example for each other. Even (interim head coach Mike Kafka) just touched on it. We have to step up to each other and show that we care and have those hard conversations with each other.""

Skattebo added: ""This place is special. They're doing a good job drafting and I'm excited about this upcoming draft and seeing who stays around. I'm excited to build something here. No matter who is in this building, we have our quarterback, so I'm excited for that simply. We build the pieces around him to be successful, and I'm juiced to see what this franchise can be within the next five years.""

Speaking to the media after the Raiders concluded the regular season at 3-14, general manager John Spytek was asked if star defensive end Maxx Crosby is seen as “untradeable” or “untouchable” following a tumultuous finish to the year, when he walked out of the facility after being shut down for the final two games of the season amid a mid-season knee injury.

“I have a lot of respect for Maxx and how much he loves to play the game. I’ve had the opportunity in the last several weeks to spend a lot of time with Maxx and I think it’s been well documented that he didn’t love the idea of not playing football. You always want that from your best players and I think that’s why they’re your best players,” Spytek said, according to Sports Illustrated.

The Raiders exec added Crosby “embodies what a Raider is,” a sentiment he “continue[s] to believe.”

A fourth-round pick out of Eastern Michigan in 2019, Crosby has been a constant for the Raiders, even amid personnel upheaval, particularly the revolving door at head coach.

However, two days before the Raiders fired Carroll after one disappointing season at the helm, The Athletic reported “many believe Las Vegas will be open to moving its star pass rusher” if relations remain icy.

Despite the messy fallout from Crosby’s walkout, the 28-year-old was at Allegiant Stadium Sunday for the team’s final game of the year, a 14-12 victory over the Chiefs.

With the team now searching for its fourth head coach since 2022 — an initiative that will be guided by Spytek and minority owner Tom Brady — perhaps Las Vegas’ new leader will have input about Crosby’s future, whether that’s in Las Vegas or elsewhere.
