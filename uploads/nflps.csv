Meanwhile, the first playoff also brought a health setback to tight end George Kittle, who tore his Achilles tendon in the second quarter. He sustained the injury after making his first catch of the game and was seen clutching his ankle right after it. Now, San Francisco will navigate the playoffs without one of its most important stars.

,,2026-01-12 08:57:12+00:00,The Athletic,Conor Bradley's knee injury is cruel – and Liverpool's defence is stretched without him,Gregg Evans,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6961343/2026/01/11/conor-bradley-knee-injury-liverpool-defence/,"Conor Bradley knew from the start of this season that the spotlight would be on him.
As Bradley bulldozed into tackles and offered a combination of defensive solidity and effective attacking play, it became clear that his presence in this Liverpool team was crucial.
From a very young age, those who worked closely with Bradley said that he was “going to be different”.
This is his seventh injury setback in three and a half years with Liverpool’s first team, and the third of this campaign, but it is also the most serious by far.
There will be brighter chapters ahead but it might take a while for Bradley to come to terms with that.","Conor Bradley knew from the start of this season that the spotlight would be on him.

He anticipated the additional scrutiny after Trent Alexander-Arnold left for Real Madrid, understanding that if his performances at right-back did not match up, criticism could follow.

But Bradley, from Aghyaran in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, is made of stern stuff. When he was fit and firing, Bradley showed that, for all of Alexander-Arnold’s brilliance, there was no real need to worry about the England international’s exit. As Bradley bulldozed into tackles and offered a combination of defensive solidity and effective attacking play, it became clear that his presence in this Liverpool team was crucial.

From a very young age, those who worked closely with Bradley said that he was “going to be different”. Since joining Liverpool, he has been toughened up to handle the demands of playing for one of the world’s biggest clubs.

What academies don’t teach you, though, is how to stay strong when an injury ends your season and adds a cloud of uncertainty to a possible World Cup adventure. Football clubs can be supportive places during difficult times, but surely nobody within Liverpool’s Kirby training ground, and perhaps even Bradley’s inner circle, could find the words and actions to make him feel any better after sustaining a serious knee injury that requires surgery.

This is his seventh injury setback in three and a half years with Liverpool’s first team, and the third of this campaign, but it is also the most serious by far. If there’s anyone in top-level football who needs a pick-me-up — and not the Gabriel Martinelli type — it’s Bradley.

His season is over. The 22-year-old’s chance to establish himself as the first-choice right-back is on hold, and if he’s unfortunate, the World Cup this summer could be a stretch. At the very least, he will not be able to help Northern Ireland in their play-off semi-final against Italy in March. His international manager, Michael O’Neill, will be equally as frustrated while he faces up to the prospect of lining up without his most influential player.

Liverpool head coach Arne Slot had already admitted that he feared the worst when Bradley was forced off late into the 0-0 draw with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. As his right-back departed on a stretcher, Slot was seen wincing. His facial expressions seemed to reflect the concerns swirling around his head, especially as troubles down the right side of his team resurface.

However, it’s Bradley you have to feel sorry for, and he will need some time to process how the outcome could have been even more disheartening.

Importantly, he has not ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament but there is significant damage to the bone and the ligaments in his left knee. When the news is so fresh and the pain still raw, the timescale is less relevant, but five or six months is much better than nine to 12 months, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. You could forgive him for failing to compartmentalise and recognise that it could have been so much worse, given he won’t play for Liverpool again this season.

Perhaps the setbacks he has previously faced will help, even if the timing feels particularly bruising. Bradley missed four months at the start of the 2023-24 season due to a stress fracture in his back and, since then, he’s suffered ankle, hamstring and other muscle problems — but nothing as crushing as this.

With Alexander-Arnold out of the picture, Bradley was making big strides, particularly in recent weeks after returning to the squad to help tighten up the defence and offer some much-needed balance.

The right flank has been a constant source of frustration for Liverpool this season, with defenders Joe Gomez and Jeremie Frimpong missing at different times and Mohamed Salah out of form in attack.

Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones have both filled in at right-back but it was clear when Bradley returned before Christmas that he was best suited in the position. Bradley’s presence in defence also allowed Frimpong to play further forward, a valuable alternative in the absence of Salah, who scored in Egypt’s 3-2 win against Ivory Coast in their Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final on Saturday.

Slot may have to adjust things again when the Premier League resumes next weekend. He will also have little choice but to use Salah almost as soon as he returns, despite Frimpong’s pace and energy bringing a new dynamic to Liverpool’s attacks.

Frimpong used his recent spell on the sidelines to pack on extra muscle, increase speed and focus on yoga and pilates to help reduce the risk of further injuries. He will offer support to Bradley, as will other team-mates, but it won’t do much to lift the mood, as this setback has started the year off on a sour note.

The psychological challenge — regaining confidence, overcoming frustration, and staying mentally strong — will be as demanding as the physical rehabilitation ahead, especially because the narrative of his career over the past 18 months has been a relentless battle with injuries.

There will be brighter chapters ahead but it might take a while for Bradley to come to terms with that.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/11111227/GettyImages-2254684847-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-12 06:14:01.181720

San Francisco 49ers star tight end George Kittle suffered a torn Achilles in the second quarter of the Wild Card Round matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles, head coach Kyle Shanahan said after the team's 23-19 win.

Kittle was carted off the field after being tackled following a catch in the second quarter. He immediately grabbed at his right ankle, and replay showed him give way to Zach Baun's tackle without a fight to get off his leg.

Kittle was trying to encourage his teammates as he was being carted off, clapping in their direction. But it’s hard not to feel for the 32-year-old, who many consider the best tight end in the sport.

It’s a massive loss for the 49ers, as they try to take down the Eagles on the road to advance in the NFL Playoffs. The 49ers could’ve had the No. 1 seed, home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, and a bye week, but they fell to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 18 to lose the NFC West title and those perks.

The last time the 49ers traveled to Philadelphia for a playoff contest was the 2022 NFC Championship Game, which proved brutal in the injury department as well for them.

BROCK PURDY SAYS 49ERS HAVE A ‘CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER’ ENTERING PLAYOFFS AFTER MISSING LAST SEASON

Quarterback Brock Purdy tore his UCL in his throwing elbow, and after backup Josh Johnson also got hurt, the 49ers were left lifeless at the position in what was a beatdown as the Eagles went to the Super Bowl.

While it wasn’t Purdy, Kittle is a key piece of this entire team, let alone the offense. He provides valuable leadership whether he’s on the field or not, and injuries have kept him out during the regular season as well.

Kittle dealt with a hamstring injury that forced him to miss five of the first six games of the 49ers’ regular season games. They also had him miss Week 17 due to an ankle ailment suffered in Week 16 against the Indianapolis Colts.

The 49ers may have advanced to the Divisional Round, but Kittle won't be available to play moving forward.

With approximately 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter of Sunday's postseason matchup between the Bills and Jaguars - a game that saw CBS make an embarrassing early error - Buffalo's signal-caller Josh Allen tried to thread a pass through multiple defenders to Davis across the middle. But the ball deflected off the receiver's chest, leaving him vulnerable to a violent collision from safety Andrew Wingard and linebacker Foyesade Oluokun, who struck him simultaneously high and low.

Before the knee cartilage and ligament tear, Davis admitted he was already playing through discomfort from an injury he incurred against the Miami Dolphins in the final regular-season game of the 2023 campaign.

""My whole thing was I just never truly got to get healthy,"" he shared with reporters in September.

""I had hurt my knee here the last regular season game against Miami [Dolphins], and my knee just never got back to 100%. I was really struggling with trying to go full speed, and not being able to be the player I knew I could be in Jacksonville.

In rare fortunate news, the 49ers were bolstered by the inclusion of left tackle Trent Williams.

With Williams back in the line-up, San Francisco’s usually potent offence – which was held to just three points in Week 18 by the stout Seattle defence – immediately got an explosive play through the air to Demarcus Robinson and the veteran receiver popped up again for the go-ahead touchdown.

Entering Monday’s game there was little doubting San Francisco’s ability to move the ball, even against a stiff Philadelphia defence.

It was the other side of the ball, however, that was expected to be the problem and it didn’t take long for the Eagles to respond as a 29-yard run from Saquon Barkley helped set up Dallas Goedert for the jet sweep touchdown.

Kicker Jake Elliott’s tough season, however, continued as he missed the extra point to leave the score at 7-6 in San Francisco’s favour.

Goedert then later scored his second touchdown of the game to extend Philadelphia’s lead to 13-7 before San Francisco closed the gap with an Eddie Pineiro field goal before halftime.

While the Eagles were still in a relatively comfortable position it was far from a relaxed scene on the sideline as A.J. Brown clashed with head coach Nick Sirianni on the sideline.

The heated moment came after Brown dropped a pass on third-and-9 late in the second quarter, with Sirianni running over and yelling at his star receiver.

Eagles chief security officer Dom Disandro was forced to sep in and hold Brown back from Sirianni.

It was far from the first time Brown has voiced his frustrations publicly this season, with the star receiver previously sounding off about his usage both to reporters and on social media.

Both teams then traded field goals to open the second half before San Francisco got back in the end zone in creative fashion, with a trick play seeing Skyy Moore hand it off to Jauan Jennings on the jet sweep, who then found running back Christian McCaffrey.

That put the 49ers up 17-16 and while the Eagles regained the lead with another Elliott field goal, San Francisco continued to be far more efficient in converting on red-zone opportunities as Purdy scrambled and found McCaffrey open for his second touchdown of the game.

It ended up being the difference as the 49ers survived to set up a date with the Seahawks in the divisional round. Seattle already beat San Francisco 13-3 in Week 18.

JOSH ALLEN MAKES HISTORY IN THRILLING BILLS WIN

Earlier, NFL playoffs delivered after another thriller that went down to the wire, with the latest installment seeing the Buffalo Bills defeat the Jacksonville Jaguars 27-24.

With it, the Bills snapped a 33-year streak which had seen them fail to win a playoff game each season they did not win the AFC East.

While this is a much more flawed Buffalo team than the ones that have fallen short in the post-season in past years, the AFC also feels far more open with Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson out of the picture.

The Bills, meanwhile, still have one of the best quarterbacks in the league in Josh Allen and while he finished Monday’s game battered and bruised, he did more than enough to see Buffalo home with three touchdowns and 264 yards.

He also became the first player in NFL history to complete at least 80 per cent of his passes (minimum five attempts) and rush for multiple touchdowns in a playoff game.

The margins will be that much thinner for Buffalo with an underwhelming wide receiver room and depleted defence, but as long as No.17 is on the field this team will always have a chance.

On the other hand, it was a heartbreaking finish to a season that promised so much in Jacksonville but there is an overwhelming sense that the only way is up considering the development Trevor Lawrence showed in his first full year under new coach Liam Coen.

Buffalo’s glaring flaw during the regular season was its run defence, with the 2006 Indianapolis Colts being the only team to allow over five yards a carry and go on to make the Super Bowl.

The Bills finished the season conceding 5.1 yards per tote, and the leaky run defence was exposed on Jacksonville’s first scoring drive of the game as rookie running back Bhayshul Tuten had three-straight big runs to set up the Jaguars in the red zone.

Lawrence, having thrown an earlier pick to gift Buffalo the go-ahead field goal, then found second-year receiver Brian Thomas Jr. for the touchdown as Jacksonville overcame a shaky start to take a 7-3 lead.

Momentum had well and truly shifted in favour of the AFC South champions as Bills running back Ray Davis then fumbled on the kick-off return, immediately positioning the Jaguars in scoring territory.

But a key fourth down stop on a successful coach’s challenge from Sean McDermott saw Buffalo escape without giving up any points, and then – as he has done his entire career – Allen put the Bills on his back as he first found Keon Coleman for a 36-yard gain before then ploughing through defenders for the touchdown.

Allen got his leg folded up and made his second trip to the blue medical tent as a process, having previously been cleared for a concussion, while he also hurt a finger on his throwing hand when it hit the helmet of offensive lineman O’Cyrus Torrence.

The Jaguars got into field goal range for kicker Cam Little after a circus catch from Parker Washington, and while he had the distance his attempt sailed left of the posts.

Both teams added field goals in the third quarter with the game crying out for a hero to emerge and after Allen took his first sack of the day, Wishnowsky followed up a Buffalo 3-and-out with his worst punt of the day.

It set up Jacksonville to regain the lead and Lawrence ripped a touchdown to the underrated Washington, who has stepped up in a big way with the injury to rookie sensation Travis Hunter as one of the more dependable weapons in the passing game.

But as has been the case all wild card weekend, this was another game that seemed destined to go right up to the final play as Allen found standout tight end Dalton Kincaid open for the touchdown off a screen pump fake.

Jacksonville later retook the lead as Travis Etienne broke a tackle after a pop pass from Lawrence, with Washington again coming up clutch in the lead-up with a big catch.

It would end up coming down to the final seconds, however, as a battered Allen hurled the ball over 40 yards with defenders in his face to find Brandin Cooks for a chunk gain.

A few more completions and a Allen tush-push on 4th-and-1 set Buffalo up one yard out and Jacksonville, with no timeouts left, left the Bills score to set up a thrilling finish.

Instead, it was an anti-climatic ending as Lawrence’s first pass of the drive to Jakobi Meyers went high and was batted up, with Cole Bishop on the spot to pick it off and seal the win.

The Bills win now play the Broncos in the divisional round if the Patriots win against the Chargers later on Monday. Should L.A. win, Buffalo will take on the winner of the Steelers/Texans game.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/5d44bf960c0ba2f5b4c0b71f3b3f7f42,N,,2026-01-11 21:13:55.041057

The Birds were eliminated from the playoffs in a Wild Card loss at home to the San Francisco 49ers. Final score: 23 to 19.

19 points.

The most expensive offense in the NFL by far managed to muster just 19 measly points against the worst defense in the playoffs.

It’s not exactly like Vic Fangio’s defense played their A-game in this one but they more than carried their weight for most of the season. They at least produced two takeaways in the form of Quinyon Mitchell interceptions, allowing the Eagles to be +2 in turnover differential.

And yet a terrible, uninspiring, moribund, bland offensive performance doomed the Eagles in.

This performance wasn’t merely offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo’s fault. There were a lot of penalties and lack of execution (example: a Saquon Barkley third down drop). But it’s pretty difficult to argue that Patullo is part of the solution moving forward.

If you’re blaming Patullo, which is more than fair, you also have to blame Nick Sirianni. This was the head coach’s right-hand man since coming to Philly and clearly his pick for OC this year.

Sirianni also notably opted for a field goal on 4th-and-3 from the 49ers’ 15-yard line in the fourth quarter of this game instead of trying to go for a touchdown. They would be the last points the Eagles scored this season.

If there’s a silver lining to this loss, it’s that we don’t have to watch this entirely too frustrating 2025 Eagles offense again.

But the Eagles should’ve won this game. They were 5.5-point home favorites. They rested their starters in Week 18 to manufacture a bye week.

No good excuses for this season-ending loss.

And now an offseason with many questions to be answered.

Read on for a recap and stay tuned for BGN’s postgame coverage.

FIRST QUARTER

The Eagles won the coin toss and elected to defer. The 49ers took over at their own 24-yard line. Brock Purdy’s first pass attempt went for a 58-yard Demarcus Robinson catch-and-run with Quinyon Mitchell trailing that quieted the Philly crowd. The 49ers moved to 1st-and-goal at the 5-yard line. Two plays later, Purdy hit Robinson again with Mitchell trailing in the end zone for a touchdown. Rough series for Q, who was just named first-team All-Pro. Five plays, 74 yards, touchdown. First thought: Uh, what the hell, defense? Second thought: Not the first time we’ve seen the opposition have success on a first drive before Vic Fangio’s group tightened up after that. EAGLES 0, 49ers 7.

The Eagles took over at their own 37-yard line. The Eagles went with Saquon Barkley run for two yards and then a second for 29 yards into plus territory. Fred Johnson got banged up to force Matt Pryor into the game but just for one snap. The Eagles moved into the red zone with a Jalen Hurts completion to A.J. Brown. Facing 3rd-and-3, a Barkley carry picked up a first down at the 7-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-goal at the 1-yard line, the Eagles went with a handoff to Dallas Goedert (!) for the touchdown. Awesome opening drive for the offense to answer the 49ers’ score by going 63 yards in 10 plays for the score. But then Jake Elliott missed the extra point in windy conditions. EAGLES 6, 49ers 7.

The 49eres took over at their own 26-yard line. Mitchell bounced back from his very bad first drive with a pass breakup. Facing 3rd-and-6, Purdy’s pass was completed short of the sticks. Three-and-out.

The Eagles took over at their own 32-yard line after a mere 35-yard punt. Facing 3rd-and-7 after two Barkley runs, Hurts hit Darius Cooper (!) over the middle for a first down. Facing 3rd-and-2, a Barkley run resulted in no gain. Facing 4th-and-2, Nick Sirianni kept the offense on the field and Hurts’ pass for DeVonta Smith was broken up with the 49ers’ cornerback jumping the route. Nearly picked off. Liked the decision to go for it. Would’ve preferred trying to sneak twice starting on 3rd-and-2. Also looked like Hurts made the wrong read to hand off to Barkley instead of keeping on third down.

The 49ers took over at their own 48-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-9 after Cooper DeJean broke up a pass, Purdy took off running but was forced out of bounds by a hustling Moro Ojomo for just two yards. Second straight three-and-out for the 49ers offense.

The Eagles took at their own 6-yard line after Britain Covey let a punt take a 49ers bounce to pin the Eagles back. Hurts completed a pass to Brown for seven yards to end the first quarter.

SECOND QUARTER

Facing 3rd-and-10 after picking up two first downs, Jahan Dotson false started. Facing 3rd-and-15, Hurts hit DeVonta just short of the marker. Facing 4th-and-1 from their own 44-yard line, Sirianni kept the offense and went Tush Push for the first down! Love the aggression there. The Eagles moved into 49ers territory with a fake screen right and Hurts looking back left to get the ball to Barkley for 20 yards. Really nice design! The Eagles then started to feed Tank Bigsby (the team clearly saw my tweet) and he picked up 20 yards on three straight carries. Facing 3rd-and-5 at the 12-yard line, the Eagles went with a Barkley run to set up fourth down. Facing 4th-and-2, Hurts hit Dallas Goedert for a touchdown! But the score was called back for Cam Jurgens illegally being downfield … but then the refs announced no penalty. Jurgens was actively engaged with the defender and thus not illegally downfield. Legitimately excellent drive. Elliott barely made the extra point. EAGLES 13, 49ERS 7.

The 49ers took over at their own 23-yard line. George Kittle got carted off the field after a short reception. Purdy hit Jauan Jennings over the middle for another explosive play, this one for 45 yards with Cooper DeJean trailing (first Q and now Coop?!). Facing 3rd-and-1, Jordan Davis (who previously had a stop on second down) tackled Christian McCaffrey for a loss. Facing 4th-and-2, Kyle Shanahan kept the offense on the field … but took the 49ers’ second timeout. Facing 4th-and-2 for real, the 49ers quickly put their field goal unit on the team and Eddy Piniero made a 36-yard field goal in the wind. The Eagles will gladly live with the 49ers taking three in that spot. EAGLES 13, 49ERS 10.

The Eagles took over at their own 35-yard line with 2:50 on the clock and three timeouts to work with. Hurts took a deep shot to A.J. Brown, who was open, but missed him. Facing 3rd-and-4, Fred Johnson false started. Facing 3rd-and-9, Hurts had DeVonta Smith running wide open on a crossing route for a first down but Hurts went downfield to Brown again and the receiver couldn’t make the contested catch. Missed opportunities. Punt.

The 49ers took over at their own 23-yard line with 1:51 on the clock and one timeout to work with. Facing 3rd-and-11 after Jalen Carter sacked Purdy, the 49ers had a free play with the Eagles jumping early but the 49ers declined it with a Purdy first down completion to Robinson against Adoree’ Jackson’s soft coverage anyway. Not ready to run a play, the 49ers had to burn their final timeout with the clock already stopped at 1:02. Facing 3rd-and-10, Purdy hit tight end Jake Tonges for a first down. Facing 3rd-and-5 with 0:08 on the clock after the 49ers oddly didn’t spike the ball to stop the clock earlier, the 49ers intentionally ran Purdy to try to get him out of bounds for a long field goal attempt. The Eagles almost failed to get him out … but after review, it was determined Quinyon Mitchell forced a Purdy fumble that ended the first half and prevented a 49ers field goal attempt. Phew! Got lucky the 49ers really botched that there.

THIRD QUARTER

The Eagles took over at their own 30-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-3 after two Barkley runs, Hurts hit Barkley in the flat for a would-be first down but the running back didn’t look the ball in and started to glance downfield before securing the catch. Killer mistake. Three-and-out.

Braden Mann’s punt went 58 yards to be fair caught at the 5-yard line. The 49ers picked up two first downs to move to their own 33-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-1, the 49ers went QB sneak for the first down. Purdy was then intercepted by Q, who jumped the route! A much-needed momentum boost.

The Eagles took over at their own 48-yard line. The Eagles picked up a first down on a designed run for Jalen Hurts … that was called back due to holding on Cam Jurgens. Looked like a weak flag. For some dumb reason, the Eagles decided to run the ball on 2nd-and-18 and ran for a loss. Facing 3rd-and-19, Hurts checked down to Goedert for five yards. 3 plays, -9 yards after the takeaway by the defense. Another big missed opportunity.

The 49ers took over at their own 20-yard line after Mann’s punt bounced into the end zone for a touchback. Facing 3rd-and-9, Vic Fangio brought the blitz and Purdy got hit as he threw while also seemingly not being on the same page as CMC for an incompletion. Big stop by Fangio’s squad. Vintage 2025 Eagles: weak offense, strong defense.

The Eagles took over at the plus 46-yard line with after a mere 25-yard punt by the 49ers. The Eagles picked up a first down (what a miracle). Facing 3rd-and-3, Barkley took a draw into open space for a very easy first down run. Facing 3rd-and-13 after Barkley ran for a loss (MAYBE STOP RUNNING ON SECOND-AND-LONG?), Hurts took a designed run for four yards. Could’ve been good to do that on second down instead! Elliott came in for the 41-yard field goal attempt … and made it. 10 plays to gain just 23 yards, lol. EAGLES 16, 49ERS 10.

The 49ers took over at their own 33-yard line and only needed one play to move into plus territory. Facing 3rd-and-1 at the plus 31-yard line, the 49ers went QB sneak to get a first down and end the third quarter.

FOURTH QUARTER

The 49ers went with some trickeration to begin the fourth quarter with Jennings throwing a touchdown pass to a wide open CMC to give the 49ers the lead. Good call by Shanahan. EAGLES 16, 49ers 17.

The Eagles took over at their own 35-yard line. Hurts to Barkley resulted in a first down by a Cooper holding penalty (looked tacky to me) set the offense back instead. Then Goedert dropped a pass. Facing 2nd-and-20, the Eagles went with a RUN for seven yards. Facing 3rd-and-13, Hurts bailed a clean pocket, rolled right, and threw the ball away. Awful possession! 3 plays, -3 yards.

The 49ers took over at their own 31-yard line. The 49ers picked up one first down but then Purdy threw another interception to Q!

The Eagles took over at their own 38-yard line. Hurts ran for a first down and the 49ers got called for unnecessary roughness to add 15 more yards (BS penalty to me since Hurts slid into the defender but, hey, they often call that, so, smart play by Hurts). The Eagles moved just outside of the red zone by pounding the rock with Barkley. Facing 3rd-and-9 after the refs didn’t call what could’ve been pass interference on the 49ers, Hurts hit Will Shipley for six yards. Sirianni should’ve kept the offense on the field to go for it but he settled for a 33-yard field goal make. Not sure you can merely trust this offense to get in scoring position again. EAGLES 19, 49ERS 17.

The 49ers took over at their own 34-yard line with 7:55 left in the game. The 49ers moved into field goal range. The 49ers moved into the red zone with a Purdy sack wiped out by a Reed Blankenship holding penalty. The 49ers moved into first-and-goal at the 10-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-goal at the 4-yard line after a DeJean PBU, Purdy JUST stepped up to avoid Nolan Smith (who was clearly held by Trent Williams) and then hit CMC for the touchdown. 10-play, 66-yard TD drive by the 49ers. SF missed the extra point. EAGLES 19, 49ERS 23.

The Eagles took over at their own 35-yard line with 2:54 on the clock and all three timeouts to work with. Facing 3rd-and-5, Hurts hit Brown but the wide receiver dropped the ball. Ouch. Facing 4th-and-5 from their own 40-yard line, Hurts hit Goedert for a first down as the clock rolled down to the two-minute warning. Phew. Clutch completion. Another Hurts completion to DeVonta resulted in another first down. And then again for another. Facing 3rd-and-11, Hurts’ pass to DeVonta was a tad high (still catchable) and incompletion. Facing 4th-and-11, Sirianni called a timeout that left the Eagles with just two in the event the Eagles turned the ball over on downs. Facing 4th-and-11 for real, Hurts’ throw over the middle to Goedert in traffic was broken up and incomplete. Season.

EAGLES LINEUP NOTES

Michael Carter II was in at safety ahead of Marcus Epps on the Eagles’ second defensive drive.

Given the time of Kittle's injury, the likely expectation is that he will work towards being available for the 49ers' first regular season game of the 2026 season.
The injury occurred after Kittle caught a six-yard pass with about six minutes to play before halftime.

He caught eight passes for 88 yards and a score the previous week in a win over the Titans.","George Kittle was carted off the field during the second quarter of the San Francisco 49ers' NFC wild card playoff game win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Kittle was quickly ruled out for the remainder of the game, and after the contest it was confirmed that he had torn his right Achilles after a catch.

While an Achilles tear can sometimes take up to a year to recover from, future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers returned to the practice field less than four months after sustaining the injury during the first week of the 2023 regular season. Given the time of Kittle's injury, the likely expectation is that he will work towards being available for the 49ers' first regular season game of the 2026 season.

The injury occurred after Kittle caught a six-yard pass with about six minutes to play before halftime. Cameras showed Kittle not putting any weight on his right leg after getting out of the cart and into the 49ers' locker room.

He clapped as he was being carted off the field, perhaps in an effort to motivate his teammates. The Eagles had a 13-10 lead at the time of Kittle's injury. Despite his absence, the 49ers posted a 23-19 upset win over the defending Super Bowl champions. San Francisco will now face the division rival Seattle Seahawks next weekend in the NFC divisional round.

Kittle had just one reception prior to leaving Sunday's game. San Francisco's offense was led in the first half by wideout Demarcus Robinson, who caught three passes for 66 yards that included a two-yard touchdown pass. Wideout Jauan Jennings came up with a 45-yard catch that set up a field goal.

Robinson finished the night with a game-high 111 yards receiving. The 49ers received a big second half from Pro Bowl running back Christian McCaffrey, who scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter that included the game-winning score with just under three minutes left.

While the 49ers found a win to beat the Eagles, Kittle's absence will be a critical loss moving forward for a 49ers team that has been no stranger this season when it comes to significant injuries. San Francisco went into the playoffs without linebacker Fred Warner, pass rushers Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams, and wideouts Ricky Pearsall and Brandon Aiyuk. Now, they'll have to press on without one of the best tight ends of this era.

Despite missing six games this season due to injuries, Kittle continued to play at a high level while being named to his seventh Pro Bowl. He caught 45 passes during his final seven regular-season games that included seven catches for 115 yards and a score during the 49ers' Week 16 win over the Colts. He caught eight passes for 88 yards and a score the previous week in a win over the Titans.

As alluded to above, the 49ers have overcome injuries all season.

Storylines to watch in Eagles-49ers

The chess match between 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan and Eagles defense coordinator Vic Fangio will be one of the most intriguing storylines to watch in Sunday's game in South Philly. Shanahan and Fangio are considered some of the best offensive and defensive play callers in the sport, and the matchup could decide who moves on to the divisional round. The two have a mutual respect for each other. Shanahan has previously tried to get Fangio to be his defensive coordinator in San Francisco, but it hasn't worked out.

Can the Eagles and Saquon Barkley get the running game going vs. the 49ers? It's been a much different season for Barkley compared to his first season in Philadelphia, but the matchup on paper against the Niners could lead to success for the Eagles. The 49ers' defense is decimated with injuries, and they just got gashed on the ground by the Seattle Seahawks in the regular season finale.

Speaking of injuries, the Niners and Eagles both have some big-name players with injuries heading into the wild-card round. The Niners will be without defensive stars Fred Warner and Nick Bosa vs. the Eagles. Warner's backup, Tatum Bethune, suffered a season-ending injury last weekend. Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams is active against the Eagles, while wide receiver Ricky Pearsall is out. Linebacker Nakobe Dean will return for the Eagles, but All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson is out against San Francisco, which means Fred Johnson will start.

Eagles-49ers postseason history

The Eagles and 49ers have only met two times in the playoffs. The last meeting happened in the NFC championship game in the 2022 season, where the Eagles defeated the Niners 31-7 before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII. In that game, the 49ers were decimated at quarterback as Brock Purdy and Josh Johnson suffered injuries.

But the bigger concern is the status of quarterback Josh Allen.

Allen headed to the blue medical tent after a third-down run late in the first quarter. With Buffalo facing a third down just outside the red zone, Joe Brady dialed up a run for Buffalo’s quarterback to move the chains. But at the end of the play two Jacksonville defenders — Travon Walker and Josh Hines-Allen — landed awkwardly on Allen’s head and neck area.

You can see the play here:

Allen exited the medical tent and picked up a tablet to start reviewing plays, so it is expected that Allen will remain in the game. According to Tracy Wolfson on CBS Sports, Allen was cleared after an evaluation for a concussion.

However, the Bills quarterback has been dealing with a foot injury in recent weeks, and while he was cleared to play Sunday against Jacksonville, Allen has been playing through the condition these past few games.

Update: You can add another issue to the list for the Bills quarterback. Allen scored on a touchdown run in the second quarter, but now there is concern over the quarterback’s knee:

He was the first culture-resetting addition following the departure of Kyrie Irving and Terry Rozier that summer.

Williams spent four seasons in Boston, emerging as a valuable member of the bench rotation. He was part of the Celtics team that made it to the NBA Finals in 2022 under Ime Udoka. However, the versatile forward was ultimately traded to the Dallas Mavericks in a three-team trade.

Unfortunately for Williams, his time in Dallas was short-lived, and he was jettisoned to the Charlotte Hornets within months. Then, last season, in Williams’ first full campaign with the Hornets, disaster struck. The Tennessee product tore both his ACL and meniscus while facing the Milwaukee Bucks.

On Saturday, January 10, Williams finally made his return to the court. Head coach Charles Lee gave him 13 minutes of playing time off the bench. Williams ended the night with 9 points and 8 rebounds, although he struggled from the floor, hitting 3-of-10 from the field.

Charlotte ended the night with a win, defeating the Utah Jazz 150-95. As such, Williams’ shooting struggles were easily brushed under the rug. Furthermore, after nearly 14 months on the sidelines, he can be forgiven if he’s a little out of rhythm.

Not many teams have overcome the amount of important injuries that the 49ers have this season. In the first half Sunday they lost tight end George Kittle in the first half to what appeared to be an Achilles injury. And the 49ers won anyway, upsetting the Eagles 23-19 in the NFC wild-card round in a victory that ended Philadelphia’s quest for a second straight Super Bowl title.

The 49ers went 12-5 and had a shot at the No. 1 seed in the NFC all the way until the final game of the season despite several injuries through the season. When they lost Kittle in Sunday’s game, they had at least been through that situation before. Receiver Jauan Jennings threw a touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey in a key turning point at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and McCaffrey caught another touchdown in the final three minutes to give the 49ers a late lead. The Eagles drove to the 49ers’ 20-yard line but that’s when San Francisco’s defense tightened up, and on a fourth-and-11 Jalen Hurts threw into triple coverage over the middle and it was batted down incomplete.

The Eagles’ season ends in a massive disappointment, but it couldn’t have been too surprising based on how inconsistent they had been. Their offense never found its footing during the regular season and Sunday was more of the same, with a lack of execution and hardly any big plays. The dominant team that won a Super Bowl last season rarely showed up this season, and that carried over to the playoffs.

The 49ers deserve credit though. There haven’t been many teams better at overcoming adversity.

Here are some of the top moments in 49ers Super Bowl history:

Dominant Victories

Super Bowl XXIV (1989): The 49ers, led by Joe Montana, absolutely crushed the Denver Broncos with a final score of 55-10. This remains the biggest blowout in Super Bowl history. ""55-10 The biggest blowout in Super Bowl history. When Joe Montana and the Niners TORCHED the Broncos in Super Bowl 24.""

The 1989 49ers are often cited as one of the greatest teams in NFL history, with a stacked roster and a dominant playoff run. ""The 1989 San Francisco 49ers were one of the most dominant teams in NFL history.""

Heartbreaking Losses

Super Bowl LIV (2020): The 49ers had a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter but ultimately collapsed, losing to the Kansas City Chiefs. ""I totally forgot the Niners had a 10 point lead and got a pick with 12 minutes left in the game. That should've been enough to close the game out.""

This game was particularly painful for 49ers fans, as they had a high chance of winning according to ESPN's win probability chart. ""According to ESPN's win probability chart, the 49ers had a ~95% chance to win after that Mahomes pick in the 4th.""

Memorable Playoff Moments

NFC Championship 2014: Richard Sherman's iconic postgame interview after the Seahawks beat the 49ers remains a legendary moment. ""When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that’s the result you gon’ get.""

Sherman's raw emotion and direct call-out of Michael Crabtree added a dramatic flair to the intense rivalry between the two teams. ""Sherman was elite on the field, but man he was unhinged... he made up all sorts of beef just to hype himself up.""

Current Aspirations

2025 Season: The 49ers are openly thinking about the Super Bowl, with players like Fred Warner expressing their determination. ""You’re dang right I think about it — are you kidding me?""

The team has faced significant injuries but is still in contention for a top seed, showing their resilience. ""The fact that Purdy was missing and we have all these injuries and are still in contention for the 1 seed (I think?) is crazy.""

Fun Facts

17-Game Season Impact: There's speculation that the extended season might be contributing to the increased number of injuries. ""I want to say it's either the 17 game season finally having cumulative impact or there aren't actually more injuries.""

NFC West Trend: Every NFC West team that has been the #1 seed since 1999 has made it to the Super Bowl. ""Every NFC West team to be the #1-seed ended up making the Super Bowl since the 1999 Rams.""

Niners tight end George Kittle suffered an Achilles injury in the second quarter of Sunday's wild-card game against the Eagles, was carted off the field and was quickly ruled out by San Francisco.

The seven-time Pro Bowler was being tackled by safety Marcus Epps toward the sideline when his calf appeared to pop as he planted it in the ground. He went down and received medical attention before being helped onto a cart.

Quarterback Brock Purdy and other teammates tapped him on the helmet as Kittle headed into the locker room, reminiscent of the last time these two teams met in the postseason and Purdy suffered an early elbow injury.

In the '23 NFC title game, Purdy went down on the team's first drive, taking the wind out of the 49ers' sails before an eventual 31-7 loss.

This time around, calamity struck on the team's fourth possession, though the injury occurred on Kittle's first catch of the day.

At the time of his departure, the 49ers were trailing, 13-7. They went on to finish the drive with a field goal.

Such a gut-sinking injury to one of the team's biggest star is unfortunately familiar to the Niners both in years past facing the Eagles and in the narrative of their 2025 season.

The sixth-seeded 49ers reached the postseason despite dealing with myriad injuries on both sides of the ball. Purdy missed eight games due to a turf toe injury, and his pass-catching corps seemed to be a revolving door of walking wounded. Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, the defense's two most vital players, played a combined nine games, with Bosa out for the season and Warner banking on a deep playoff run for a chance at returning.

Despite the injury, the 49ers went on to a 23-19 win to end Philadelphia's season and advance to a divisional round matchup against the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks in a rematch of the regular-season finale for both teams. Like they've done all season, the 49ers persevered through injury to pick up the win.

Kittle's season, meanwhile, is done. And he'll face a long road to recovery at 32 years old.

Kittle left the field on the back of a cart shortly after sustaining his injury in the second quarter. The 49ers ruled him out shortly after he left the field and announced that he'd injured his Achilles tendon. Philadelphia held a 13-7 lead at the time of Kittle's injury midway through the second quarter.

The injury occurred when Kittle planted his right leg while being tackled after making a catch.

Kittle remained down on his back with his right leg in the air. Trainers tended to Kittle on the field before he eventually took a seat on the back of a cart. Kittle sat upright and waved to fans as he was driven off the field.

The 49ers finished 12-5 and made it to the playoffs despite injuries to several key players, including season-ending injuries to All-Pro defenders Nick Bosa (torn ACL) and Fred Warner (fractured ankle). Kittle missed six regular-season games with a torn hamstring, but returned to finish another strong season that earned him his seventh Pro Bowl berth.

George Kittle had to be carted off the field after he suffered an Achilles injury after making a catch and being tackled along the sideline with 5:58 left in the second quarter of Sunday’s wild-card clash against the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field.

The former All-Pro caught a short first-down pass for six yards from Brock Purdy near the right sideline. He never quite had his footing as he was tackled by Eagles safety Marcus Epps.

Kittle, one of the most dynamic pass-catching tight ends in the league, immediately grabbed the back of his right ankle, which appeared to get twisted as he was driven out of bounds.

It was his first catch of the game.

49ers owner Jed York and Kittle’s wife, Claire, walked into the team’s locker room and appeared visibly somber in the wake of the crushing injury, The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reported.

The seven-time Pro Bowler played just 11 games this season, as he was limited by injuries, including missing five contests with a hamstring injury.

When on the field, Kittle remained very productive with 57 catches for 628 yards and seven touchdowns.

The Eagles led the 49ers at the time of the injury, 13-7. Philadelphia took a 13-10 lead into the half.

The 49ers are looking to return to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2024, when they lost to the Chiefs.

The injury occurred after Kittle caught a 6-yard pass from Brock Purdy on the right sideline. The veteran tight end tried to push off on his right leg as Eagles safety Marcus Epps approached to make the tackle but it gave out.

Kittle remained down after the play and grabbed his right leg. The 49ers' medical staff came onto the field to tend to him. He was loaded onto the cart due to the injury and immediately taken back to the locker room.

Here's what to know about Kittle's injury.

George Kittle injury update

Kittle has been ruled out for the remainder of Sunday's game because of an Achilles injury, the 49ers announced. They did not immediately provide any additional information on the 32-year-old tight end's prognosis.

Kittle recorded one catch for six yards before leaving Sunday's game because of the injury.

Who is George Kittle's backup?

Luke Farrell is listed as the 49ers' top backup to Kittle. The 6-5, 250-pound tight end is best known for his blocking abilities and played about 36% of San Francisco's offensive snaps during the 2025 NFL season.

Farrell recorded 11 catches for 85 yards and caught the first two touchdowns of his career. The fifth-year veteran spent the first four seasons of his career with the Jacksonville Jaguars before signing with the 49ers in free agency.

49ers TE depth chart

The 49ers have three tight ends on their 53-man roster. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

George Kittle

Luke Farrell

Jake Tonges

While Farrell will be the immediate replacement for Kittle, Tonges should see plenty of action as well. The California product only played five fewer snaps than Farrell this season and served as the team's primary pass-catching tight end when Kittle was out of the lineup earlier in the season.

Tonges logged 34 catches for 293 yards and five touchdowns in 2025. His production came after failing to log a single reception across his first three NFL seasons.

Ickey Ekwonu sustained a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee during Saturday’s wild-card round loss to the Los Angeles Rams, according to head coach Dave Canales on Sunday. Ekwonu was injured during the second series of the 34-31 defeat at Bank of America Stadium.

“Timeline-wise, all of those times vary and all that, but it is significant,” Canales said Sunday. “It’s going require surgery, so prayers and thoughts for Ickey. Just battled for us, and worked on some things along the season. Just a guy that I love, a guy that I trust out there, and so we’ll all be with him the whole way. And with him a speedy recovery as he comes back.”

Ekwonu, the team’s first-round pick in 2022, is set to play on the fifth and final year of his rookie contract in 2026. He has been eligible for a contract extension since the conclusion of the 2024 season, but the team picked up his fifth-year option last offseason instead.

Ekwonu was replaced by veteran Yosh Nijman against the Rams. Nijman had previously filled in for Ekwonu for two starts at left tackle during the regular season. Nijman is a pending unrestricted free agent in March.

“Yosh stepped in there and allowed us to play some good ball,” Canales said.

With Ekwonu likely to undergo a long rehabilitation process, the Panthers will need to figure out if they want to keep Nijman as experienced insurance or look for a help at left tackle elsewhere.

Starting center Cade Mays and versatile veterans Austin Corbett and Brady Christensen are also set to become free agents in 2026. Christensen has been on the shelf since the midway point of the season with an Achilles injury.

According to Over the Cap, the Panthers are projected to have the third-highest offensive line payroll in the NFL in 2026. That $86.6 million total is without Mays, Nijman, Corbett and Christensen factored into the math.

Tank Bigbsy follows his running mate’s lead and smashes the Eagles to just 10 yards out with two punishing runs for 16 yards total. On 2 and 3 they run it again with Barkley who loses two yards. They run AGAIN and come up short. 4th and 2, Hurts keeps and rolls out to his right … TOUCHDOWN … to Dallas Goedert. Only it isn’t, intelligible man downfield on Cam Jurgens. Wait, it IS a touchdown. The referees pick the flag up. Make your mind up.

Share

So close. Saquon Barkey almost hits the home run from a short pass. He waits patiently for the play to develop and holes to move and shift for him to race through only for the last defender to snag him by the ankles to save the touchdown. He gains 20 yards and the Eagles have about 26 to travel for the score. Monster drive from the five-yard line.

OK that was a so-so start … UNTIL … Purdy lays one to midfield for Demarcus Robinson who has no one behind him to bring him down. He races down field for 61 yards! What?! CMC then grabs a 1st down and the 49ers are 1st and Goal in the blink of an eye,

Trevor Lawrence is warming his arm up on the sideline … while Allen bumps over for the score and another lead change rather than burning any clock. The Jags just let them score so they give the quarterback enough time to go and win it or Cam Little to tie it up with a long range field goal.

That lead change now ties the most ever switches in NFL history in the fourth quarter of a playoff game with four. Scenes.

Bills 20-24 Jaguars 1:04, 4th quarter

Buffalo edge down field and bring up 3rd and 4. Still loads of time left with three timeouts. This is the game now. Allen slants it to Khalil Shakir who fights to the line through a defender and is short. 4th and inches. Everything is riding on this. The tush push gets the inches, then they RUMBLE in for the score. WHAT?! They had no business pushing the QB that far, there was 10 yards to go and they just carry him forward and IN! Or is he? The call on the field is touchdown but they come back and say Allen is short. Isn’t that a better outcome though? They can get the score on the goal line and use more clock. Drama!

Wow. The Jags heat up Josh Allen but the QB lets fly and finds Brandin Cooks … WIDE OPEN … 36 yards. Thank you very much. What a massive shot that was on Allen. He eats it up, the throw is perfect even so. Nails. 20 yards to go to retake the lead and win this nail-biter? If they do make it, that ability to withstand everything a defense can throw at him and make the big play is what makes Allen so special.

T Lawrence to T Etienne for 14 yards

The touchdowns just keep coming. Buffalo’s defense just wilts totally as Lawrence rolls to his right and lofts one to his running back Travis Etienne. A defender has a great chance to bring him down but whiffs the tackle completely. Jacksonville take the lead again with Lawrence’s third touchdown pass of the day.

Bills 20-17 Jaguars 4:51, 4th quarter

Parker Washington is having a day. Lawrence finds his man again for a 31-yard gain and Liam Coen throws the ball back to Washington on the next play with a design run. Jacksonville are in the red zone now and grab another 1st down with a wildcat snap to Travis Etienne.

Bills 20-17 Jaguars 7:10, 4th quarter

Buffalo force a quick 3rd down as the blitz gets to Trevor Lawrence and bats down the pass. Eight yards remain to move those sticks. Lawrence drops back deep and rolls … the throw is off but Christian Benford is burned for defensive holding. That could be costly, needless hold.

Another lead change! After Allen converts the 4th down, the QB fakes a screen pass then pings one at his tight end Dalton Kincaid. The big man has a few steps and just makes it into the left corner of the end zone before being smashed out on to the sidelines. Perfect timing on the throw to find Kincaid in space before reaching the waiting defender.

Buffalo go play action. It works a treat. The linebackers all crunch down and Dawson Knox is wide open to make a 24-yard grab. Next Gabe Davis does Gabe Davis things and lets a catch bounce off his chest anticipating contact. Davis was unfortunately right about the viciousness of it as he has to be helped off the field. With about 30 to go a short pass brings up 3rd and 6. Allen takes off on the scramble … but he slides and they give the 1st down. Looks dodgy and the Jags challenge.

A long pass to Brandin Cooks is overturned for an incompletion putting the Bills on 3rd and 7 at midfield. The short pass has no chance. What to do on 4th and 4? A timeout for the Jags adds to the thinking time … the musing on Allen’s throwing hand continues. Give it a rest lads. They are going for it or so they would like the Jags to believe. Delay of the game and punt. Lawrence has a minute to drive with two timeouts. What a punt that was though right into the corner to the two-yard line!

The Jaguars flipped their record from 3-14 last season to 13-4 in head coach Liam Coen’s first year. Buffalo is in an unfamiliar position as it finished second in the AFC East and will be on the road in the wild-card round for the first time since Josh Allen’s second NFL season.

The AFC East has a new champion this year in New England, which won the division title for the first time since 2019 … which means Buffalo will need to win multiple road games to get over the hump and make it to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 1990s.

Allen had another big year with 39 total touchdowns (25 passing, 14 rushing) and 3,668 yards through the air. Buffalo fell to Kansas City in a thriller last postseason and won’t have an easy road this year.

Jacksonville won its first AFC South title since 2022 this season, finishing with the second-most wins in the conference. The Jaguars won the second-most games in franchise history and earned the franchise’s first double-digit win campaign since they won 10 games in 2017 and made it to the AFC championship game. Coen may have unlocked something in Trevor Lawrence that could carry the Jaguars through the postseason.

Quarterback Josh Allen was spotted entering the blue medical tent following the Bills' scoring drive.

Allen headed to the medical tent after running up the middle for two yards on a third-and-6. The 2024 NFL MVP was thrown to the ground at the end of the play but was able to leave the field under his own power.

The Bills did not immediately provide an update on Allen's status. He was seen standing on Buffalo's sideline shortly after being checked out by the team's medical staff.

CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson reported Allen was checked for a concussion by the independent neurologist on staff for Sunday's game. He cleared the NFL's concussion protocol and will be eligible to return when the Bills next get the ball.

Mitchell Trubisky is the Bills' backup quarterback and would be called upon to enter the game if Allen can't go for any reason.

They have the 19th pick of the 2026 draft after winning the NFC South to draw a first-place schedule in the upcoming season.
Ekwonu's rookie deal ran through the 2025 season, but Carolina picked up his fifth-year option.
That means he is under contract through the 2026 season with an upcoming cap value of more than $17.5 million fully guaranteed.
""Just a guy that I love, a guy that I really trust out there,"" Canales said of Ekwonu.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Coach Dave Canales said the Carolina Panthers will have to adjust their offseason draft and free agency planning after learning starting left tackle Ickey Ekwonu suffered a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee in the first quarter of Saturday's 34-31 playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams.

The typical recovery time for the injury is six to 12 months, which means the sixth pick of the 2022 draft will miss the entire offseason program and potentially all of the 2026 season.

""Timeline wise, all those times vary, but it's significant,"" Canales said Sunday as the team was cut loose for the offseason following Carolina's first playoff appearance since 2017. ""It's going to require surgery. Prayers and thoughts for Ickey.""

Canales was with the Seattle Seahawks in 2016 when tight end Jimmy Graham returned from the same injury in just under nine months. That timeline has been described as ""extraordinary"" for an injury that has been known to dramatically shorten careers.

Canales said the Panthers (8-10), who haven't selected an offensive lineman in the past two drafts, will have to take Ekwonu's injury into consideration as they move forward.

They have the 19th pick of the 2026 draft after winning the NFC South to draw a first-place schedule in the upcoming season.

""It is something we have to consider, knowing we're going to go through a full offseason -- what's the timeline, how does that affect training camp, roster numbers and all of that,'' Canales said.

Ekwonu's rookie deal ran through the 2025 season, but Carolina picked up his fifth-year option. That means he is under contract through the 2026 season with an upcoming cap value of more than $17.5 million fully guaranteed.

But the injury could impact Carolina's long-term commitment to Ekwonu.

Carolina has five other linemen who are free agents. They are guard/center Austin Corbett, backup tackle Yosh Nijman, center/guard Cade Mays, backup tackle/guard Brady Christensen and backup lineman Jake Curhan.

""Just a guy that I love, a guy that I really trust out there,"" Canales said of Ekwonu. ""We'll all be with him the whole way. We wish him a speedy recovery as he comes back.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0111%2Fr1599226_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 16:00:31.554467

Coach Kyle Shanahan said Williams was able to practice on a limited basis for a second straight day Friday, while Pearsall missed all three days of practice for San Francisco this week.

Williams said he was confident he would be able to return for the first time since injuring his hamstring on the first snap in Week 17, but it will be a game-time decision.

The 49ers listed four other players on the active roster as questionable, including starting cornerback Renardo Green, who was limited Friday after hurting his ankle at practice. Linebackers Dee Winters (ankle) and Luke Gifford (quadriceps), and defensive lineman Keion White were also questionable.

Winters didn't practice all week, Gifford missed practice both Thursday and Friday, and White returned to practice Friday on a limited basis after sitting out the previous two days.

Jacob Cowing, who had his practice window open this week, is officially listed as questionable but is not expected to be activated from injured reserve from a hamstring injury.

The Eagles listed three players as questionable for the game, including star right tackle Lane Johnson, who has missed the last seven games with a foot injury. Linebacker Azeez Ojulari (hamstring) and guard Brett Toth (concussion) were also questionable for the Eagles.

The status of Williams and Pearsall will be important for the 49ers, who struggled on offense without them in a 13-3 loss last week to Seattle.

The Niners have averaged just 2.8 yards per carry running to the left side since Williams got hurt on the opening snap of the win against Chicago on Dec. 28.

It would be unstoppable for some stretches during a game and inept for others. Now that the Eagles are in the playoffs, can they put together a complete game on offense when they face the San Francisco 49ers in an NFL Wild Card Playoff Game?

The Eagles could get a significant boost if right tackle Lane Johnson returns after missing seven games with a foot injury. If he does return, that should help protect quarterback Jalen Hurts and create running room for Saquon Barkley.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

At least the Eagles defense should give them a chance. The defense has been among the NFL's stingiest over the second half of the season. From Weeks 10-17, the Eagles have allowed an average of 14.5 points per game, the best in the NFL during that stretch.

But 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who had 2,126 yards from scrimmage this season, along with tight end George Kittle could be a handful.

Eagles downgrade O-lineman to out; Lane Johnson questionable

The Eagles downgraded backup center/guard Brett Toth from questionable to out on Jan. 10. Toth suffered a concussion against the Commanders on Jan. 4. Toth practiced on a limited basis on Jan. 8, and fully on Jan. 9. But apparently, he didn't get cleared by an independent neurologist in order to be eligible to play.

Toth is the primary backup for center Cam Jurgens and left guard Landon Dickerson. Without Toth, it's likely that rookie Drew Kendall will be the backup center and Matt Pryor the backup at left guard.

Eagles vs. 49ers prediction

Eagles 30, 49ers 17: Here comes the referendum on offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. If the Eagles can't outscore a 49ers' defense reeling from injuries, well, it's hard to see Patullo coming back next season. And really, the Eagles should have all of the advantages on offense: They're rested, healthy, at home, and seemingly ready to unleash QB Jalen Hurts and RB Saquon Barkley. Still, it's the Eagles' defense that will make the difference − again. − Martin Frank

The MVP candidate did not miss a snap, and refused to leave the game with his team's season hanging in the balance.

X-rays on Stafford's finger were negative and there was no dislocation after the hit, which appeared to happen after crunching his hand on Panthers defensive end D.J. Wonnum's arm, NFL Media reports. Given the prognosis, it's unlikely Stafford will miss any time with the Rams' divisional round playoff opponent looming next weekend.

""I got a finger bent back,"" Stafford said after the game. ""They saw it on the TV, on the sideline or whatever. I didn't, obviously, know exactly what had happened. It wasn't pleasant. It wasn't great. We'll see what it is. Was obviously able to finish the game and throw it decent. You know, once the ball's snapped, the adrenaline's pretty good. So we'll hopefully, you know, just keep it going,""

After the injury, Stafford misfired on 10 of his next 12 pass attempts including an interception. He rebounded in the fourth quarter with a pair of touchdown drives, capped by scoring tosses to Kyren Williams and Colby Parkinson. The 19-yard completion to Parkinson gave the Rams a 34-31 lead with 38 seconds to play, capping a seven-play, 71-yard drive after the Panthers just regained the advantage.

Stafford finished with 304 yards passing, three touchdowns and the lone turnover as the Rams moved on to the divisional round of the postseason.

[NFL injury updates live]

49ers LT Trent Williams hopeful to play

San Francisco 49ers left tackle Trent Williams was a limited participant during practice on Thursday and Friday, after sitting out on Wednesday with a hamstring injury he suffered in Week 17.

Williams usually rests on the first day of practice during a game week, but head coach Kyle Shanahan clarified that wasn't the case, saying the All-Pro was still hurt. Williams said Friday he's confident he can play on Sunday.

“Honestly, I’m kind of pushing the limits on how much [time] is required for it,” Williams said Friday. “So it will probably be in the back of my mind for a little bit. But once I get out there and get the juices flowing and the adrenaline going, I don’t think it should be a big problem.”

Receiver Ricky Pearsall did not practice Friday, but was spotted on a side field this week. Shanahan said Wednesday that Pearsall aggravated the PCL injury that has limited him this season during Week 17.

Lane Johnson questionable for Eagles

Lane Johnson (foot) has been listed as questionable for the Philadelphia Eagles' Sunday meeting with the San Francisco 49ers. Johnson was limited in practice this week after being out since Week 11 with a Lisfranc injury.

“Lane’s a big difference maker, and I know he is working crazy to get himself back, and we will see where that is this week,” head coach Nick Sirianni said this week. “But he’s a difference maker. … He’s one of the best that’s ever done it. I think I kind of get too much into scheme with that. But yeah, he allows you to do some different things.”

Their core of Hunt, left guard Damien Lewis, and right tackle Taylor Moton are all under contract through 2027.","He was smiling and joking with teammates as he left the locker room on crutches with a brace on his knee, but that belied the uncertainty ahead of him.

""It was hard, man, because Ickey was excited,"" guard Robert Hunt said. ""Ickey was ready to play. Ickey had a lot of juice. Ickey was ready to play, man, and to lose that energy, it was kind of tough, but Yosh stepped in and did a really good job.

""I mean, I love Ickey, man. Ickey came in and joked, you know, he's just being Ickey, so, Icky's all right. Ickey's going to attack it the right way. Ickey's going to be OK, and Ickey's going to come back.

Ekwonu had missed the Dec. 21 Buccaneers game here with a knee issue, and quarterback Bryce Young said that Ekwonu has been battling throughout the year to stay on the field for the 15 games he played (he missed the opener while recovering from a preseason appendectomy.

""I feel for him, so much, such a warrior,"" quarterback Bryce Young said. ""Obviously he's played so much, and probably from the outside looking in you'd think he's just been in perfect health, but he's been battling every week. He's been in the training room, doing all the little things.

""He's been pushing through a lot of pain, and you know he's a warrior. He's a huge part of, of us as a team. I really feel for him, so, yeah, it's tough to see that.""

That wasn't the only injury, as Hunt left the game in the first half, but returned in the second after what was announced as a pectoral injury.

""Literally a couple of plays in my right pec pops,"" Hunt said afterward. ""But I don't think it's off of the bone, so if it wasn't off the bone, I was going to play.""

As alarming as that thing a football player just said was, he came back and played the second half, and that was impressive considering what he went through.

He went on injured reserve after Week 2 with a torn biceps, but was activated this week to play in a playoff setting.

""I mean, it took a lot, man, but I just attacked it every day, attacked every day,"" Hunt said. ""I never had a question that I wasn't going to play. I mean I'm just a guy that's optimistic.""

The Panthers have general reason to be optimistic.

Their core of Hunt, left guard Damien Lewis, and right tackle Taylor Moton are all under contract through 2027.

But they have five unrestricted free agents that make up the bulk of the depth they leaned on this year (Saturday was the 12th different combination of starters in 18 games this year).

After the Panthers took a late fourth-quarter lead on a beautiful pass from QB Bryce Young to the back corner of the end zone where WR Jalen Coker made a great catching while being tackled, the Rams marched down the field and answered with a touchdown of their own that took the lead for good in the final minute.

Back in Week 18, the Panthers had a win-and-in game against their division rival Buccaneers to win the NFC South and secure a home playoff game. Carolina ended up losing that game in Tampa, 16-14, in an ugly game played in the rain. Young outplayed Bucs QB Baker Mayfield, but the Panthers had just 19 total rushing yards and turned it over three times and never got any consistent momentum on offense.

However, due to the mechanics of a three-way tie for the NFC South lead between the Panthers, Buccaneers, and Falcons, Carolina won the division and hosted Los Angeles on Saturday. It didn’t go the way the Panthers hoped, but it was their first playoff game since 2017 and builds some momentum for Young and Panthers HC Dave Canales.

NFL Delivers Punishment to a Carolina Panthers Defender Before the Rams Game

Ahead of the Rams game, the Panthers got the news that one of their players was hit with a fine by the league for his actions against Tampa Bay. Panthers CB Mike Jackson was fined $11,593 for a taunting penalty he received late in the first quarter of that game.

Against the Buccaneers, Jackson had seven tackles. He was sensational for Carolina against the Rams, finishing the wildcard game with three tackles, four passes defensed, and a third-quarter interception that set up the Panthers’ first go-ahead touchdown. Los Angeles continually attacked him on the outside — as they’d rather target him than former All-Pro CB Jaycee Horn — but he stepped up time and time again with big stops and huge plays when his team needed him most.

Carolina Panthers QB Bryce Young Had a Fantastic Postseason Debut

The game didn’t go his way, but Young was sensational in his first postseason action. He’d had an up and down third season in Carolina, having some huge moments — including the fourth quarter of the Panthers’ Week 13 win over the Rams — but also had some struggles, particularly in high-volume passing game scripts.

Against the Rams in the wildcard round, Young went 21 of 40 for 264 yards, with one touchdown and one interception. He also ran three times for 24 yards and a second-quarter touchdown to give Carolina some momentum going into halftime.

The completion percentage and yards per attempt numbers might not jump off the page, but it felt like every time the Panthers needed a big play, Young stepped up. He made big plays downfield when his team needed him, though he and his team ultimately came up just short.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2253835929-e1768096956751.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-11 11:59:29.782249

On top of that, though, he will serve as the next man up at all positions other than center on Saturday, as the Packers have ruled out right tackle Zach Tom, who has been dealing with back and knee injuries.

Tom’s last game played was Week 15 against the Denver Broncos, when he played fewer than half of the team’s snaps before going down with a knee issue. At the start of the week, head coach Matt LaFleur said that the expectation was that Tom was going to play this round of the playoffs, but Tom went from a limited participant on both Tuesday and Wednesday to a non-participant on Thursday’s practice, a move that was described as a “rest day” by the staff. Obviously, though, something changed throughout the course of the week.

Add this to your list of Packers’ offensive line bad luck in the postseason, be it David Bakhtiari’s injury in a practice on New Year’s Eve in 2021, last year, when Elgton Jenkins, who is currently on the injured reserve, went down against the Philadelphia Eagles or when Green Bay had the bright idea to start Billy Turner at left tackle, after never playing there previously for the Packers, in a playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers.

Tom is expected to be replaced by Jordan Morgan, who has served as his injury replacement over the past couple of weeks. Behind him, it will be Kinnard, who is expected to serve as the backup at both tackle and guard positions.

Beyond Tom, the Packers ruled receiver Dontayvion Wicks out on Friday after a full two-week stint in the NFL’s concussion protocol. To make up for Dontayvion Wicks being out and Savion Williams and Bo Melton being placed on the injured reserve, the Packers have brought up two former practice squad receivers, Jakobie Keeney-James and Isaiah Neyor.

Up to a pool of 54 gameday players to make up their 48-man active gameday roster, the Packers also make four healthy scratches on Saturday: QB Desmond Ridder, WR Jakobie Keeney-James, DE Collin Oliver and CB Jaylin Simpson. QB Malik Willis, DT Warren Brinson, LB Nick Niemann and S Javon Bullard will all play after being listed as questionable going into the weekend.

The Jacksonville Jaguars have the youngest kicker in the NFL who currently holds the league record for longest two made field goals.

Buffalo is banking on Prater being available and effective when the Bills travel to play the Jaguars at 1 p.m. Sunday.

Matt Prater, 41, is considered day-to-day with a quadriceps injury that has kept him out 2 1/2 of the last three games. Bills head coach Sean McDermott called the nagging injury ""unfortunate.""

Meanwhile, Jacksonville's Cam Little has made 20 straight field goals entering the playoffs, including an NFL-record 68-yarder on Nov. 2 and a 67-yarder, the second longest in league history, last week.

Is Matt Prater playing today?

Prater is expected to play in the wild-card game against the Jaguars on Sunday. His was officially questionable on the final injury report. Prater sat out Wednesday's walkthrough, participated in full at Thursday's practice and rested on Friday.

The Bills signed veteran Matthew Wright to the practice squad Tuesday but did not elevate him.

Prater will be the only kicker available. Buffalo could utilize punter Mitch Wishnowsky on kickoffs and choose to attempt 2-point conversions after touchdowns.

Bills running back Ray Davis is the team's unofficial emergency kicker. He made an extra point in the preseason and attempted an onside kick for Buffalo in Week 10. Davis was named first-team All-Pro as a kickoff returner on Saturday.

Prater re-aggravated his right quadriceps injury that kept him out of the previous two games in the season finale.

He made all three of his extra point attempts in the first half but did not play in the second half of the Bills' 35-8 win over the New York Jets. Buffalo went for 2-point conversion attempts on each of its second-half touchdowns and punter Mitch Wishnowsky handled kickoff duties.

""Kind of work with two plans, one where he’s able to go come Sunday and one where he’s perhaps not able to go,"" McDermott said on Monday.

Ray Davis (emergency kicker)

Prater has made 18 of 20 field-goal attempts and 46 of 49 extra points for 100 points in 15 games this season. The 19-year veteran holds the NFL record with 82 field goals of at least 50 yards. He held the league record for longest made field goal, 64 yards, from 2013-2021.

Wright kicked in four games this season for the Titans, Commanders and Texans, going 5-for-5 on field goals and 4 of 4 on extra points. He's made 60 of 68 field goal attempts and 45 of 47 extra points in 33 career appearances.

The Bills signed veteran Michael Badgley with Prater out Weeks 16 and 17, but released him on Dec. 29 after he continued to be plagued with extra point struggles. Badgley played two games with the Bills, missing an extra point in his first game and having an extra point blocked in his second game. The latter complicated the Bills' comeback attempt and ability to tie or take the lead in the final seconds of a 13-12 loss to the Eagles.

Tyler Bass, the Bills’ starting kicker from 2020-24, has been on injured reserve all season with hip and groin injuries.

“I know we’ve spent all week saying there was nothing that was going to keep Lane Johnson off the field,” NFL Network’s Mike Garofolo said on Saturday, January 10. “Well .. there is some concern he could miss this game. He was limited in practice all week and he looked good in spurts. But that’s a tough injury. That’s a painful injury. I would say that he’s a legitimate game-time decision.”

The Eagles, the No. 3 seed in the NFC Playoffs, open their Super Bowl title defense at home against the No. 6 seed San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, January 11, at 4:30 p.m. EST on Fox.

For Philadelphia, much of their success seems to be tied to Johnson, a likely future Pro Football Hall of Famer, being in the lineup.

From The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jeff McLane on Tuesday, January 5: “Eagles RT Lane Johnson is expected to practice on Wednesday for the first time since he suffered a Lisfranc foot injury vs. the Lions on Nov. 16, per NFL sources. Johnson has made progress in his recovery, but still has to test his right foot before the team makes a decision on his availability for Sunday’s wild card game vs. the 49ers … The Eagles went 3-4 in the 7 games he sat out because of the foot injury, and are now 18-28 in games he hasn’t played during his 13-year career. Johnson has missed just one playoff game — a wild card loss to the Seahawks in 2020 — out of possible 15 in his career.

Now, Green Bay can make it a game early with Jordan Love exploiting a Bears defense that allowed 27.3 PPG and 5.9 yards per play from Weeks 8-17. However, Love will also throw an interception in this game, and the inability of the Packers defense to generate a stop leads to Chicago winning by two scores at Soldier Field.""

Edwards and left tackle Ozzy Trapilo.

Edwards is feared to have suffered a fracture fibula, coach Ben Johnson said after the game, while Trapilo suffered a patellar tendon injury. Both injuries will likely sideline them for the rest of the season, starting with next week’s divisional round game against either the Philadelphia Eagles or Los Angeles Rams.

Edwards was carted off the field in the second quarter with a gruesome ankle injury after his left foot stepped on Packers wide receiver Christian Watson’s foot. Edwards left the field with his leg in an air cast and was later ruled out of the game at Soldier Field.

The game broadcast showed Bears chairman George McCaskey hurrying down the hallway to be with Edwards as he headed to the X-ray room.

D’Marco Jackson, a 2022 fifth-round pick in his first year with the Bears, took Edwards’ place on the field. The Bears were already thin at linebacker, with Noah Sewell placed on injured reserve after suffering an Achilles injury in Week 17 against the San Francisco 49ers. Linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga was unable to suit up for the game due to a concussion.

Trapilo, a rookie second-round pick, was injured late in the fourth quarter. He was able to get off the field on his own but was in obvious pain.

Edwards injury crushing for team and player

Edwards missed seven games this season, so the defense has a backup in Jackson, who’s gotten reps in Edwards’ spot. Not only is there a drop-off in experience, but it continues if the Bears want to be in their base defense. Sewell is on IR, Ogbongbemiga (concussion) is out, so Jalen Reeves-Maybin — brought back to the team late this week — appears to be the third linebacker.

Edwards, who signed a contract extension last March, grew up a Bears fan. This had to be crushing for him to have to leave a playoff game at Soldier Field. A winner of the team’s Piccolo Award last season, he’s respected in the building, and you could tell how much it hurt his teammates to see him have to leave the game. The defense is getting gashed, and losing a starter like Edwards isn’t going to help. — Bears beat writer Kevin Fishbain",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/10205648/AP26011068228524-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-11 09:57:54.375388

He tossed an interception in the third quarter on an underthrown pass and would have been picked off again in the fourth quarter had it not been for two-time Pro Bowl wideout Puka Nacua's superb defensive back impression.

Stafford was mostly on the money in the final frame, though. He completed 12-of-15 passes for 143 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, the second a 19-yard game-winner to tight end Colby Parkinson.

""Yeah, I got a finger bent back,"" the 17-year veteran said postgame, when asked about his right hand. ""They saw it on the TV on the sideline or whatever. I didn't obviously know exactly what had happened.

""It wasn't pleasant. It wasn't great. We'll see what it is. I was obviously able to finish the game and throw it decent. Once the ball's snapped, the adrenaline's pretty good, so we'll hopefully just keep it going.""

Stafford will seemingly be fine, though, as NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Sunday morning that X-rays were negative on the QB's finger.

Stafford entered top five all time in NFL game-winning drives. He engineered his latest on the road in Bank of America Stadium with the Rams' season hanging in the balance.

""He was steady. It was MVP type of stuff, what he did,"" L.A. head coach Sean McVay said of Stafford, who finished with 304 yards and three touchdowns through the air.

""Just good, calm. I thought he redirected a couple of the protections that allowed him not to be hot where we would've been. And on all those plays, he ended up finding completions, and he got a bunch of different guys involved. I thought he saw the field really well. And that's why we're advancing, because of his leadership.""

There seems to be a sense that Johnson is going to try very hard to suit up. But it doesn’t sound like a lock that he’ll be ready to go.

The latest update comes from NFL insider Mike Garafolo, who had the following to say on Saturday afternoon (bold emphasis mine):

“Lane Johnson, listed as questionable, and I know we’ve said all week: ‘There is nothing that’s going to keep Lane Johsnon off the field.’ Well, Ian Rapoport and I have been doing our calls today, and there’s some concern he could miss this game. He was limited in practice all week. He looked good in spurts but that’s a tough injury, it’s a painful injury. I would say that this is a legitimate game-time decision.”

No inside information here but I wonder if the Eagles are wondering if they can try to get by with sitting Lane for one more week. The 49ers have the worst pass rush in the NFL with a league-low 20 sacks. Of course, it’s hard to merely assume you’re going to win a playoff game and being too conservative with Lane could come back to haunt the team.

Stafford suffered an injury to his throwing hand while attempting a pass at the end of the first half. The 37-year-old quarterback banged his hand on D.J. Wonnum's arm while trying to follow through.

Stafford immediately recoiled in pain after the play and doubled over on the ground, clutching his hand.

Stafford was able to stay in the game despite the injury and immediately flashed a thumbs-up to Sean McVay after the play. Nonetheless, the veteran quarterback endured some uncharacteristic struggles with his accuracy throughout the third quarter, leading many to wonder about the severity of his potential injury.

Here's what to know about Stafford's hand as the Rams start to look ahead toward the NFL's divisional round.

Matthew Stafford injury update

Stafford was asked about his hand injury during a postgame news conference. He told reporters he ""got a finger bent back"" on the play in question, which led to his reaction on the field.

""They saw it on the TV on the sideline or whatever. I didn't obviously know exactly what had happened,"" Stafford explained. ""It wasn't pleasant. It wasn't great.""

Stafford didn't seem overly worried about the injury being a long-term issue for him.

""We'll see what it is,"" Stafford said. ""I was obviously able to finish the game and throw it decent. Once the ball's snapped, the adrenaline's pretty good. So we'll hopefully just keep it going.""

Nonetheless, Stafford's practice status will warrant monitoring as the Rams prepare for their divisional-round playoff game.

Who is the Rams backup QB?

If Stafford's injury ends up being worse in severity than initially anticipated, Los Angeles would turn to Jimmy Garoppolo to lead it as the team chases a Super Bowl.

Garoppolo, 34, is in his second season with the Rams. He didn't attempt a pass this season but went 0-1 as a starter for Sean McVay's squad last year while completing 27 of 41 passes for 334 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.

Garoppolo has started 64 games across his 12 NFL seasons since being a second-round pick by the New England Patriots in the 2014 NFL Draft. The Eastern Illinois product has a 43-21 career record across those starts and helped lead the San Francisco 49ers to Super Bowl 54. They lost that game 31-20 to the Kansas City Chiefs in what was Patrick Mahomes' first career Super Bowl win.

It has been a tough return to the postseason for the Bears, who haven't played a home playoff game since the 2018 season. They faced a 21-3 halftime deficit against the Green Bay Packers, who couldn't be stopped in the first half.

While trying to stage a second-half comeback, something they've done all season, things got a little funky when Williams went down favoring his ankle early in the third quarter.

The quarterback rolled out to his right, hoping to make for a manageable fourth down try. Instead the pass fell incomplete and Williams fell to the turf, favoring that ankle.

Replays showed that the quarterback rolled it after letting go of the ball. He landed awkwardly and appeared to be in pain, but limped off the field. He didn't require a stint in the blue medical tent and returned to action on Chicago's next drive, facing a 21-6 deficit.

The Amazon Prime broadcast mentioned that Williams was not attended to by training staff while on the sideline.

Caleb Williams injury update

Williams didn't miss a play after rolling his ankle and wasn't attended to by the Bears training staff while on the sideline.

It doesn't appear to be an issue that will keep the quarterback out of the game, but it could compromise some of his mobility.

Should that become an issue and force a change at the most important position in sports, Tyson Bagent would be Williams' replacement.

Tottenham’s top scorer in the Premier League this season was taken off after half an hour with the score 1-0 to Villa, holding the back of his left leg.

The north London side have played four games in 2026 already, with only two full rest days between each. The Brazil international has featured in every match this season, scoring seven in the Premier League and once in the Champions League.

“It could look like that,” the head coach said when asked if it was a hamstring injury after the game. “I think there (are) a few injuries across the Premier League.

“I think it’s something for the football authorities to look into as well. We played five games in 13 days. Four in 10, one of the few clubs who did that. And it’s our third time this season. That’s just the most tricky thing. With two days between. We are dealing with it. We’re doing everything we can to compete in it, but that’s a tough schedule.”

Earlier on Saturday, Tino Livramento was forced off with what Eddie Howe said he thought was a hamstring injury, as Newcastle United are facing a similarly relentless schedule.

After going 2-0 down in the first half, Tottenham pulled one back via Wilson Odobert but could not equalise and the game finished 2-1. Their FA Cup third round exit capped off a disappointing week in which they lost to Bournemouth and drew to Sunderland despite going ahead in both games.

The loss of Richarlison has been the fourth injury in this time, as Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Bergvall and Rodrigo Bentancur have also been sidelined.

Tottenham have Dominic Solanke back, however, after an ankle issue that has limited him to only three appearances this season and forced him to undergo surgery. The forward was substituted on in the 83rd minute of Saturday’s FA Cup tie.

Ricky Pearsall Injury Update: Will He Play on Sunday vs. Eagles?

Pearsall re-aggravated his PCL and tweaked his ankle in the 49ers’ 42-38 victory over the Bears in Week 17. Before getting hurt, he led San Fran with 5 catches for 85 receiving yards and looked primed to help his team make a run in the playoffs.

After Pearsall's absence in Week 18, he didn't practice all week, leaving his status in serious question leading up to the biggest game of the season.

Even though Pearsall hasn’t taken any reps in practice, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan expressed that he still has “a chance” to play against the Eagles on Sunday.

Pearsall is a critical piece of the 49ers' passing game, and his presence could swing San Francisco’s chances on Sunday. The team is 8-1 with Pearsall and 4-4 without him this year.

In nine regular-season games during his sophomore campaign, Pearsall hauled in 36 passes for 528 yards. He was targeted 53 times.

San Francisco 49ers' Offensive Outlook for Wild Card Game

Pearsall's questionable status casts uncertainty over the 49ers' receiving corps for Sunday's Wild Card Round showdown.

If the 49ers' stud WR is sidelined, TE George Kittle becomes the premier pass-catching option for QB Brock Purdy. Kittle has been a model of consistency, posting 628 receiving yards and 7 TDs while averaging 11.0 yards per reception (YPR).

Kittle's chemistry with Purdy has been on full display all year. His target share (21.6%, fourth-most), first-read targets (45, sixth-most), and first-read target share (25.3%, third-most) showcase the trust between QB and TE. Without Pearsall, Kittle had 29 receptions for 303 receiving yards and 3 TDs in six games.

George Kittle PrizePicks Projections vs. Eagles: 4.5 Receptions (Goblin), 59.5 receiving yards, 7.5 targets

49ers WR Jauan Jennings also has been a big part of the offense in Pearsall’s absence, posting 28 receptions for 301 yards and 3 TDs in seven outings. Jennings’ 11.7 YPR during the regular season showcases his big-play ability.

If the 49ers are forced to play catch-up without Pearsall, both Kittle and Jennings could carry significant upside.

""Total team effort. Obviously had some mistakes along the way. I turned it over,"" said Stafford.

""So a lot to clean up. But we found a way to win it late,"" he added.

The Rams had entered what proved a nervy, unpredictable and error-strewn clash as overwhelming favorites against a Carolina team that reached the playoffs despite finishing the regular season with an 8-9 losing record.

And the Los Angeles franchise started the NFC's first post-season clash with surgical precision.

Star wide receiver Puka Nacua grabbed all three passes of Los Angeles' opening drive, including a 14-yard touchdown reception.

He then received a lateral pass from Stafford and rushed five yards for his second touchdown and a 14-0 lead.

But the Panthers immediately fought back.

A seven-play, 65-yard drive from kickoff ended with a rushing touchdown for Chuba Hubbard.

The Rams grew nervy, spurning chances to build their lead. Suffering a blow to his hand in the second quarter, Stafford missed seven passes in a row. Nacua dropped a touchdown opportunity.

Quarterback Bryce Young -- chosen by Carolina first overall in the 2023 draft -- showed his athleticism in a 16-yard scramble for a touchdown just before half time.

With pressure mounting in the second half, Stafford saw a pass intercepted, and the Panthers took their first lead of the night with another Hubbard rushing touchdown.

The Rams regained their composure, with Stafford finding Kyren Williams for a no-look TD pass.

But there was a dramatic twist ahead. With barely four minutes left, the Panthers blocked a fourth-down punt to regain possession at the Rams' 30-yard line.

Young found wide receiver Jalen Coker for the go-ahead touchdown.

Finally, Stafford again pulled it back, locating Colby Parkinson for a 19-yard game-winning touchdown.

""I believe in my teammates. I know they believe in me,"" said a relieved Stafford.

Despite the narrow victory, the Rams are among the favorites for this year's Super Bowl, which will be played in California, at the home of their NFC rivals the San Francisco 49ers.

The 49ers will play defending champions Philadelphia in a Sunday wild card game.

Later Saturday, the Chicago Bears host the Green Bay Packers in the latest installment of the white hot rivalry between the NFC North giants.

Other wild card round highlights include Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills against the resurgent Jacksonville Jaguars.

The Green Bay Packers' All-Pro edge rusher won't be playing in the team's wild-card playoff game against the Chicago Bears on Saturday, Jan. 10, but he's in attendance at Soldier Field.

And he didn't walk into the stadium alone.

Trevon Diggs, the Packers' newest cornerback and good friend to Parsons from their days in Dallas, was there to wait for him.

Parsons, while wearing a brace on his left knee, was using forearm crutches, to assist in his walking.

Diggs, who will be playing in just his second game with the Packers, was rocking an oversized fur coat and leather pants.

The Packers signed Diggs on Dec. 31 after the former All-Pro cornerback was released by the Cowboys on Dec. 30. His signing reunited Diggs and Parsons, who were teammates for several years in Dallas.

The Packers acquired Parsons in late August days before the start of the regular season in a blockbuster trade with the Cowboys. His season, however, was cut short after he suffered the ACL injury last month in a Week 15 game. Despite missing the last three games, Parsons earned his fourth All-Pro recognition in his first five seasons after registering 12.5 sacks.

Parsons hasn't wasted time in attacking his recovery. He shared a video on his social media during a rehab session this week in Green Bay, saying ""One week out! Let’s make the crazy look normal.""

Parsons added that he's getting ""stronger!""

But Parsons isn't sugarcoating his road ahead, though.

In a response to a comment on X on Jan. 9, Parsons wrote that ""this recovery process is incredibly challenging and painful.

Rams inactives today vs. Panthers The Rams have announced their seven inactives for Saturday's game against the Panthers.","On the day where he earned his first All-Pro honor, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford battled through injury and led two fourth-quarter touchdown drives to secure a 34-31 victory over the host Carolina Panthers.

Stafford started the game hot before he appeared to hurt the index finger of his throwing hand in the second quarter. Carolina made the most of some Rams miscues in the first half to keep pace with the NFC West runners-up; Los Angeles held just a 17-14 lead at halftime.

The teams traded field goals in the third quarter and Stafford threw his lone interception of the game to close the frame.

Carolina capitalized to take a 24-20 lead with a Chuba Hubbard touchdown on a short field. Los Angeles took the lead minutes later with a touchdown from Stafford to Kyren Williams.

The Rams looked set for a three-and-out on their next drive but Carolina's Isaiah Simmons blocked the punt and gave the ball back to Hubbard, Bryce Young and company on a short field one again. Young found Jalen Coker to go ahead 31-27 with less than three minutes to go in the game.

But Stafford came through on the ensuing drive with a signature seven-play, 71-yard drive culminating in a pass to Colby Parkinson that the tight end took past the goal line for the game-winning score.

Stafford finished the game 24-for-42 passing for 304 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. Los Angeles now awaits the results of Bears-Packers and Eagles-49ers to determine who they will play in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs.

Here's how it all happened:

Rams vs. Panthers takeaways

Rams survive un-special teams: Los Angeles' five losses in 2025 were by a total of 17 points, a a pair of them featured mistakes on special teams: a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown against Philadelphia and a punt return touchdown allowed against Seattle. This time, the Rams pulled through despite a late blocked punt thanks to Stafford's magic.

Carolina and the Young guns: The 8-9 Panthers were double-digit underdogs at home. After the first quarter, things looked grim for Carolina. Bryce Young shook off an early interception and the Rams' pass rush to put together one of the best performances of his career. Carolina can enter the offseason confident with how things went, even in a loss.

LA reset: Stafford looked to have played through a finger injury. Depending on how things go for the rest of wild-card weekend, Los Angeles could be back in Seattle for a third matchup between the two teams. The Seahawks and their ferocious defense took the weekend off after getting the No. 1 seed. Stafford needs to rest that hand ahead of what could be a dogfight to reach the NFC champonship game.

Panthers-Rams score update: Colby Parkinson secures epic TD catch

Los Angeles needed just two minutes to drive 71 yards on seven plays. Matthew Stafford found tight end Colby Parkinson on the right sideline on first-and-10 from the Panthers' 19-yard line and Parkinson made the twisting catch into the end zone. Harrison Mevis' kick is good and the Rams take the lead again with 38 seconds left.

Rams 34, Panthers 31

Panthers-Rams score update: Jalen Coker puts Panthers ahead late

Carolina's back on top after the blocked punt. Facing third-and-3 from the Rams' 7-yard line, Bryce Young found Jalen Coker in the corner of the end zone for a touchdown. Ryan Fitzgerald knocked through the extra point to give the Panthers a critical four-point lead with 2:39 to go in the game.

Panthers 31, Rams 27

Panthers-Rams update: Isaiah Simmons makes huge play for Panthers

Carolina's defense forced Los Angeles to punt late in the fourth quarter. But instead of getting the ball on their side of the 50, Panthers linebacker Isaiah Simmons blocked the punt to give the Panthers the ball at the Rams' 30-yard line. They're down three points with less than three minutes to go.

Panthers-Rams score update: Stafford finds Kyren Williams for score

Los Angeles answered the Panthers' go-ahead touchdown with one of their own. Kyren Williams converted a critical fourth-and-1 in Carolina territory. Five plays later, he took a pass from Matthew Stafford in for a touchdown from 13 yards out. Harrison Mevis' extra point is good and Los Angeles re-takes the lead with 8:47 to go in the fourth quarter.

Rams 27, Panthers 24

Panthers-Rams score update: Carolina takes lead

Carolina capitalized on Matthew Stafford's interception and went 62 yards in just four plays to score the go-ahead touchdown. Chuba Hubbard notched his second touchdown of the game from three yards out and Ryan Fitzgerald's extra point is good for the Panthers to take a four-point lead.

Panthers-Rams score update: Carolina ties it up in third

The Panthers' offense put together the longest drive of the game by going 59 yards on 13 plays in more than seven minutes of game time. Carolina couldn't convert on 3rd and 7 from the Rams' 32-yard line so the Panthers settled for a game-tying field goal attempt. Ryan Fitzgerald knocked it through from 46 yards out to tie the game with 7:29 left in the third quarter.

Who is the Panthers' backup QB?

Bryce Young is playing well in his playoff debut today after an early interception. If he goes down, the Panthers have three-time Pro Bowler Andy Dalton to take over in a pinch.

Panthers-Rams score update: Bryce Young does it himself

Carolina forced another turnover on downs against the Los Angeles offense to get a chance to score before halftime. The Panthers' offense did just that by driving 81 yards in just five plays. Young dropped back on third-and-10 from the Rams' 16-yard line and got loose for a rushing touchdown. The extra point is good and the Panthers cut the deficit with less than a minute until halftime.

Who is the Thiccer Kicker?

Rams kicker Harrison Mevis – aptly nicknamed the ""Thiccer Kicker"" for his stout, 6-foot, 245-pound frame – is in his first season of NFL action after spending time in the UFL in 2025. He spent time with the Panthers in 2024 during the offseason.

What happened to Isaiah Simmons?

The former first-round pick by the Arizona Cardinals signed with the Carolina Panthers' practice squad in late November. He'd signed with the Cardinals after getting cut by the Green Bay Packers during training camp. Simmons was moved to the Panthers' active roster after an injury to linebacker Trevin Wallace.

Harrison Mevis' kick is good and the Rams have a two-score lead early in the second quarter.

We know that Johnson is officially listed as questionable to play after being limited in practice all week.

There seems to be a sense that Johnson is going to try very hard to suit up. But it doesn’t sound like a lock that he’ll be ready to go.

The latest update comes from NFL insider Mike Garafolo, who had the following to say on Saturday afternoon (bold emphasis mine):

“Lane Johnson, listed as questionable, and I know we’ve said all week: ‘There is nothing that’s going to keep Lane Johsnon off the field.’ Well, Ian Rapoport and I have been doing our calls today, and there’s some concern he could miss this game. He was limited in practice all week. He looked good in spurts but that’s a tough injury, it’s a painful injury. I would say that this is a legitimate game-time decision.”

No inside information here but I wonder if the Eagles are wondering if they can try to get by with sitting Lane for one more week. The 49ers have the worst pass rush in the NFL with a league-low 20 sacks. Of course, it’s hard to merely assume you’re going to win a playoff game and being too conservative with Lane could come back to haunt the team.

Ahead of the 2022 World Cup, Pepi left FC Dallas for FC Augsburg in a move that could not have gone worse, ultimately contributing to him missing out on the 2022 World Cup roster.
During the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, Pepi played in 16 matches for the German club and failed to score.","Another injury has hit the United States men's national team with the Eredivisie returning from their winter break as striker Ricardo Pepi had to be withdrawn from PSV's match versus Excelsior in the 26th minute after breaking his arm. The former FC Dallas man collided with the post when scoring, with the club confirming a forearm fracture.

""The 23-year-old forward will undergo surgery [Sunday]. Pepi is expected to be sidelined for about two months,"" PSV posted on social media.

This puts his status for the March international break's big games against Portugal and Belgium in the air, but these are games when Pepi will be needed. Any injury to players can potentially put their participation in the 2026 World Cup at risk. We're now only 152 days out from the World Cup kicking off in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which isn't very much time if an injury causes a player to miss a few months. Pepi's injury comes during a good run of form for the striker.

That goal was the fifth consecutive Eredivisie game that Pepi has scored in for PSV as he's pushing for a consistent starting role at the club while also solidifying his place as the number two striker for the USMNT behind Folarin Balogun. A strong change of pace option off the bench for the USMNT, Pepi now has 11 goals and two assists in 22 appearances for PSV in all competitions. He's been especially effective in Champions League play, where he has scored three goals and assisted one more in only 149 minutes of play.

Despite that success, Pepi didn't see it translate to national team play during 2025. Only making one appearance for 15 minutes under Mauricio Pochettino, he's someone who has something to prove in these upcoming matches, which is where any kind of injury can be a concern. Pepi hasn't scored for the USMNT since November of 2024, but as one of the most talented young players in the pool, he'll be pushing for a spot at the World Cup if given opportunities to prove himself.

Ahead of the 2022 World Cup, Pepi left FC Dallas for FC Augsburg in a move that could not have gone worse, ultimately contributing to him missing out on the 2022 World Cup roster. During the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, Pepi played in 16 matches for the German club and failed to score.

Johnson hasn't played since Week 11 because of a Lisfranc sprain.

Since the start of the 2016 season, the Eagles are 96-41-1 when Johnson starts. They're 15-27 when Johnson doesn't start, including 3-4 this season.

Johnson appeared in 10 games during the regular season. He got hurt in Week 11 against the Detroit Lions but was never placed on injured reserve.

""Lane's a big difference maker and I know he is working crazy to get himself back and we will see where that is this week,"" Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni said. ""But he's a difference maker. ... He's one of the best that's ever done it. I think I kind of get too much into scheme with that. But yeah, he allows you to do some different things.""

The Eagles are looking to repeat as Super Bowl champions. They will not accomplish that goal without Johnson in the lineup.

A future Hall of Famer, Johnson is a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Eagles. It will be fascinating to see if Philadelphia can win it all again this season. For that to happen, the offense has to wake up.

""The playoffs are fun, man, fun,"" Eagles WR DeVonta Smith said. ""It's kind of the thrill that you get knowing that it's win or go home. I like the thrill of it and I like what's at stake. The games are a little different – the weather is changing a little bit, it's a lot colder and I would say people are more amped up a little bit, maybe.

""You don't try to make it more than what it is. You don't try to get overhyped. It's the reason why you play this game.""

The Eagles were 19th in the NFL in points per game and fifth in points per game allowed during the regular season. They went 11-6 and won the NFC East again.

The NFL playoffs begin with two games Saturday, one of which features the Panthers hosting the Rams. It will be their second meeting this season after the Panthers pulled off the upset with a win over the Rams in Week 13. Let's break down this matchup and highlight three wagers to consider.

Mike Barner's season record: 50-45 (-5.23 units)

Panthers vs. Rams Betting Odds

Panthers: Spread +10.5 (-110 Caesars), +460 Moneyline (FanDuel)

Rams: Spread -10.5 (-105 DraftKings), -575 Moneyline (Fanatics)

Game Total: Over 45.5 (-110 Fanatics), Under 46.5 (-118 FanDuel)

Davante Adams (hamstring) is slated to make his return for the Rams after missing the final three games of the regular season. The Panthers don't have any injuries of note among their top offensive skill players.

Panthers vs. Rams Betting Picks

Kyren Williams - Over 64.5 Rushing Yards (-114 FanDuel)

Blake Corum was more involved down the stretch for the Rams, but his presence didn't have a negative impact on Williams. Over the final six games of the season, Williams finished with at least 70 rushing yards five times. With regards to this prop, Willliams posted at least 65 rushing yards in 13 of his 17 games.

When Williams faced the Panthers previously, he ran for 72 yards and one touchdown on 13 carries. The Panthers allowed 4.59 yards per carry to running backs during the regular season, which was the ninth-highest mark in the league. In a game in which Williams could approach 15 rushing attempts, his chances of reaching at least 65 rushing yards are favorable.

Tetairoa McMillan - Over 55.5 Receiving Yards (-114 FanDuel)

Bryce Young threw for at least 200 yards in only four of his 16 games. However, that didn't stop McMillan from reaching 1,000 receiving yards in his rookie season. McMillan was able to remain successful because he had a 25.8 percent target share and received 44.9 percent of the Panthers' air yards. Also helping his cause was his average depth of target of 11.7 yards.

McMillan only received two targets the last time he played the Rams, catching one of them for a 43-yard touchdown. He finished the regular season with at least 73 receiving yards in two of his final three games. Overall, he logged at least 60 receiving yards in a game nine times. Expect him to get more targets his second time facing the Rams, which could help him hit this over.

Bryce Young - Over 0.5 Interceptions (-109 DraftKings)

Young was picked off 11 times during the regular season. That included him throwing at least one interception in five of his last nine games. He wasn't intercepted by the Rams in Week 13, and he even tied his season high with three touchdown passes in that game.

While the Rams didn't pick off Young in their first meeting with the Panthers, they had 16 interceptions during the regular season. That tied them with the Falcons for the sixth-most in the league. If the Rams race out to a big lead early, then the Panthers might be forced to throw the ball more than they'd normally like to in the second half. If that scenario unfolds, there could be even more opportunities for Young to throw a pick. These are appealing odds to take a chance on this wager.

Panthers vs. Rams Prediction

It was shocking that the Panthers defeated the Rams during the regular season. It would be even crazier if they pulled off another win in the playoffs. It does help the Panthers that this game will also be played at home, where they went 5-3 this season. They were only 3-6 on the road. Still, look for the Rams to come out firing and avenge that regular season loss with a lopsided victory.","https://res.cloudinary.com/rotowire/image/upload/ar_16:7,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto:custom_no_override,q_auto,w_800/jmbz2bo8iocncjvonxga.jpg",N,,2026-01-10 17:59:53.594694

Trey McBride's continued rise as a superstar was the highlight of former Rams in the 2025 NFL season.

There were also several rookies finding homes and veterans in key roles across the NFL.

Here's a look at how all former Rams in the NFL fared in 2025:

Trey McBride, Arizona Cardinals

It was a record-setting season for the fourth-year tight end as he set an NFL mark for receptions in a season by a tight end with 126. It's his second 100-plus reception season in a row. McBride had 1,239 yards and a career-high 11 receiving touchdowns.

McBride, considered one of the best tight ends — if not the best — in the NFL, now has 347 career receptions with 3,475 yards and 17 touchdowns. The Cardinals missed the playoffs and will have a new head coach for the 2026 season.

Tory Horton, Seattle Seahawks

It was a productive rookie season for Horton on one of the NFL's best teams before injury shortened his season. Horton was sidelined midseason with a shin injury that is likely to keep him out of the playoffs.

Horton played eight games and the receiver had 13 catches for 161 yards and five receiving touchdowns. He also had 238 punt return yards, including taking one back for a touchdown. Seattle is the top seed in the NFC.

Trent Sieg, Dallas Cowboys

The eighth-year player continued as the starting long-snapper. The 2025 season was his third in the role for Dallas after five with the Raiders.

Adam Prentice, Denver Broncos

The fifth-year fullback was picked in the preseason by the Broncos and has carved out an important role for one of the best teams in the NFL. Prentice has 10 carries for 44 yards and six catches for 53 yards. All are career highs.

The fullback spent the first four seasons of his career with New Orleans. The Broncos are the No. 1 seed in the AFC and have a first-round playoff bye.

Drew Moss, Tennessee Titans

The rookie offensive lineman made the San Francisco 49ers' 53-man roster as an undrafted free agent. He appeared in five games as a reserve lineman before being waived midway through the season. He was claimed by the Tennessee Titans but did not appear in any games with the Titans.

Dom Jones, Cleveland Browns

The rookie defensive back made the Cleveland roster as an undrafted free agent. He went on to appear in eight games in 2025, making five tackles.

Chigozie Anusiem, Las Vegas Raiders

The second-year pro has cycled through several rosters. The defensive back was with Washington's practice squad for much of 2024 before joining Cleveland's practice squad. He was with Cleveland in the 2025 preseason before being waived and then signed to Arizona.

Late in the 2025 season, he was signed off Arizona's practice squad by Las Vegas. Anusiem appeared in three games for the Raiders and recorded one tackle.

Mohamed Kamara, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The second-year pro was waived by Miami (the team that drafted him) in preseason and then signed to Tampa Bay's practice squad. Kamara appeared in three games in the regular season for Tampa Bay but did not record any stats.

Barry Wesley, New Orleans Saints

The offensive lineman joined the Saints in the offseason but did not see the field for the Saints in 2025.

Shaquil Barrett

The longtime NFL sack-master announced his retirement in the summer of 2024 before announcing his intention to return. The Dolphins carried his rights but waived him, allowing Barrett to re-sign with Tampa Bay (where he won a Super Bowl) late in 2024, but he wasn't on the team in 2025 and is now retired.

Michael Gallup

Gallup retired before the 2024 season but attempted a comeback and signed by Washington ahead of the 2025 season. Gallup was released by the Commanders after catching four passes for 40 yards in three preseason games and was not picked up by any team since.

Ryan Stonehouse

The punter was released in preseason by Miami after losing a battle for the spot to Jake Bailey. Stonehouse led the league in gross average yards per punt each of his first two pro seasons, becoming the first player in league history to lead that category in their first two seasons. Stonehouse suffered a bad leg injury late in his second season but returned to punt in 2024. He was not picked up following his release by Miami.

Dequan Jackson

The linebacker has spent time on the Jacksonville and Miami practice squads previously. He was released by Miami in preseason and didn't sign elsewhere.","https://www.coloradoan.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/08/PFTC/88090369007-usatsi-27223270.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-10 16:59:20.997599

Will Kyler Gordon play vs. Packers?

The Bears are expected to get back nickel cornerback Kyler Gordon in time for Saturday night's playoff game against the Packers. Gordon has spent time on injured reserve on two separate occasions this season, most recently for a groin injury that's held him out for the last five games. Chicago is expected to activate Gordon off IR just in time for this wild-card game. But, for now, he's questionable.

Will Rome Odunze suit up in wild-card playoffs?

Just as the defense is getting back a key player, the Bears offense is getting back wide receiver Rome Odunze in time for their most important game of the season. Odunze has missed the last five games with a foot injury, and after attempting a return in Week 15 against the Browns, Odunze reaggravated his foot injury and missed the remainder of the regular season. Odunze practiced all week, including in full on Friday, and he has no injury designation heading into this game.

Per the NFL reporter Joe Buscaglia, the Bills WR Joshua Palmer has been downgraded to OUT for Sunday’s Wild Card matchup against the Jaguars. The news hit the team after he was injured.

And along with him, the Bills will be without starting middle linebacker Terrel Bernard and rookie defensive back Maxwell Hairston, as both are sidelined with injuries. However, placekicker Matt Prater and linebacker Shaq Thompson are game-time decisions.

Palmer has been ruled out with an ankle injury after initially being listed as questionable to play against the Jaguars on Sunday Night Football, the team announced Saturday.

27-year-old Palmer is in the first year of his three-year deal with the Bills. It is a contract that counts $11.9 million against the 2025 salary cap. His season never really got into a rhythm after he hurt his ankle in Buffalo’s October 13 loss to Houston.

He started the year strong, hauling in 14 passes for 236 yards over the first six games. But once he returned to the lineup, it was a different story. Over the final six weeks of the regular season, Palmer managed just eight catches for 69 yards and never found the end zone.

Now, as Palmer is out, Buffalo’s available pool of wide receivers for Sunday’s game includes Khalil Shakir, Tyrell Shavers, Brandin Cooks, Gabe Davis, and Keon Coleman.

No Panthers were named to the All-Pro team this year, but Jacyee Horn and Mike Jackson were sixth and seventh in overall voting at their position.

And then there were 14.

With the regular season in the books, wild-card weekend kicks off with six games spread out across three days. Six teams in each conference square off while the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks, the top seeds of the AFC and NFC, respectively, enjoy their bye weeks.

It’s truly a wide-open postseason featuring numerous contenders but no clear-cut, dominant force of a team.

The action kicks off with two NFC showdowns on Saturday before another three (two in the AFC and one NFC) games take place Sunday. Monday night’s meeting between the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers caps the action.

Here are the most compelling storylines to follow in each of this weekend’s playoff contests.

The vets versus the new kids

No. 5 Los Angeles Rams at No. 4 Carolina Panthers, 4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday, Fox

And so they meet again. It was Week 13 of the regular season. The Rams came to Charlotte, riding a six-game win streak and regarded by many as one of the best teams in football. Given L.A.’s excellence and the seesaw nature of the Panthers’ season, the oddsmakers favored the visitors by 10 points. However, the Rams wound up having an error-plagued day and fell in a 31-28 stunner.

Now, these teams meet again with extremely high stakes. It’s the Panthers’ first home playoff game in 10 years and only their second postseason contest since 2017. They have limped into the playoffs, having lost four of their last five and two straight, but had their path to the playoffs cleared thanks to the Atlanta Falcons defeating NFC South rivals Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New Orleans Saints. It’ll be interesting to see how this young team responds to the moment. On one hand, few expected them to reach this point, so the Panthers shouldn’t be dealing with immense pressure. At the same time, the intensity of the postseason can prove rather overwhelming for first-timers, especially when facing a heavily seasoned team like the Rams, who are making their sixth playoff appearance since 2017.

The Panthers will look to establish their run game to ease pressure on Bryce Young. That recipe served them well last time around. They rushed for a combined 164 yards and Young completed 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions.

Still, they’ll be facing a highly motivated Rams team that hasn’t at all forgotten about their Week 13 shortcoming in Charlotte.

Sean McVay’s squad boasts a dynamic and balanced offense and an imposing defense, and this time, they enter this meeting as 10 1/2 point favorites. Quarterback Matthew Stafford, who led the NFL with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes this season, will play in his 11th career postseason game. He has recorded multiple touchdown passes in eight consecutive playoff games — a feat only previously performed by Aaron Rodgers (nine straight games with the Green Bay Packers) and Joe Flacco (eight with the Baltimore Ravens).

Stafford said that aside from winning, he has one main goal for this rematch with Carolina.

“I’d like to not throw it to their team,” Stafford told reporters this week. “I think that was the story of the game when you think about it.”

If the Rams can avoid self-inflicted mistakes, victory should be theirs.

The rubber match

Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears, 8 p.m. ET, Saturday, Prime Video

After going 1-1 against each other during the regular season (with the home team winning each time), the Packers and Bears face off for the third time since Week 14. Neither enters the postseason on a particularly stellar note. Green Bay has lost four straight, and Chicago has dropped two in a row.

The Bears find themselves in the playoffs for the first time since the 2020 season and the second time since the 2018 season, yet they seek their first playoff victory since 2010, when they reached the conference championship. First-year coach Ben Johnson has seemingly managed to push all of the right buttons while guiding second-year quarterback Caleb Williams and the Bears on this journey of resurgence. Williams, who passed for a career-high 3,942 yards and 27 touchdowns, has posted five straight multi-touchdown games and looks to continue the streak this week while facing a Green Bay defense that is still trying to overcome the loss of Micah Parsons. Williams doesn’t have to do it alone, however. Green Bay has struggled mightily against the run, surrendering an average of 198 rushing yards in the last three games. The Bears’ tandem of D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai could be in for a big day.

Green Bay welcomes back quarterback Jordan Love, who hasn’t played since Week 16, and running back Josh Jacobs (out since Week 17). There’s a good bit of pressure on Love as he enters the fourth playoff game of his career. The Packers moved on from Rodgers following the 2022 season with the belief Love could better elevate the team, but thus far, Green Bay has gone 1-2 in the playoffs and hasn’t reached the conference championship since the 2020 campaign. In his most recent postseason outing, Love threw three interceptions and no touchdown passes in a 22-10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last season.

The previous two meetings came down to the final play of the game, so look for another hotly contested shootout as two of the league’s most talented play-calling head coaches, Johnson and Matt LaFleur, face off.

Allen under pressure; Jaguars rising

Buffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET, Sunday, CBS

It’s still hard to believe that of the AFC’s upper echelon of elite passers, only Josh Allen has reached the playoffs. Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow … all home for the postseason. For years, Mahomes and the Chiefs stood in Allen and Buffalo’s way. In 2023, Cincinnati sent the Bills packing. And Jackson has always given the Buffalo defense fits. With those obstacles removed, the door appears as open as ever for Allen and his team. Because of that, they enter the playoffs under more pressure than ever before.

Allen turned in another MVP-caliber season and certainly is one of the most seasoned quarterbacks in the playoffs. His 13 games (7-6 record) trail only Rodgers’ 22 (12-10 record). From there, the AFC playoff field features a huge drop-off in the experience department as C.J. Stroud has played four playoff games (2-2), Trevor Lawrence (1-1) and Justin Herbert (0-2) just two. Bo Nix lost in his postseason debut last season, and Drake Maye will make his playoff debut this year. The experience should serve Allen well. However, he may be working with one of the most limited supporting casts he has had in years. Yes, James Cook led the NFL in rushing this season, but Buffalo’s receiving unit features no threat capable of consistently winning one-on-one matchups. And the Bills’ defense struggles mightily against the run and ranks near the bottom third of the league in sacks. Therefore, Allen will have to don the cape once again.

Newcomer Jacksonville, which rebounded from a 4-13 record in 2024 to go 13-4 in Liam Coen’s first season as head coach, could pose plenty of challenges for Allen and the Bills, however. One of the hottest teams in the league, the Jaguars have won eight straight, winning those games by an average margin of 19.1 points per game. The Jaguars boast the league’s No. 1 rushing defense, holding opponents to 85.6 yards per contest, which could cause problems for Cook. Jacksonville’s defense also has forced 31 takeaways — the most in the AFC. On the other side of the ball, Jacksonville — led by running back Travis Etienne Jr. — averages 115.1 rushing yards per game. However, the Bills’ greatest weakness on defense is stopping the run. Buffalo gave up 136.2 rushing yards per game — fifth-most in the NFL.

Jacksonville’s offense has thrived under Coen’s direction, averaging 27.9 points per game, and spearheading the attack is Lawrence, the first pick of the 2021 draft, who, rather than blossoming into a generational talent, had instead battled inconsistencies and injury. He has, however, steadily improved in this first season with his new coach, throwing for a career-high 29 touchdown passes and rushing for another nine. A playoff win would go a long way toward changing the narrative surrounding the 26-year-old, while helping him reach the lofty potential once placed upon him.

The longshots versus the champs

San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles, 4:30 p.m. ET, Sunday, FOX

Two of the NFC’s top teams for the better part of the last decade, but also owners of lofty expectations and less-than-ideal situations, face off at Lincoln Financial Field — the 49ers and Eagles.

The visiting 49ers really have no business even being in this game. Injuries have ravaged this team, robbing it of some of its most impactful stars like Nick Bosa and Fred Warner. And yet, Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff have managed to keep their team afloat, plugging in young reserves and positioning them for impactful contributions. The 49ers have gotten healthier on offense as the season has gone along. Quarterback Brock Purdy, who missed eight games with injury, closed out the month of December on a tear, averaging 297.6 passing yards and 3.6 touchdowns per game. And much of San Francisco’s offensive success can be credited to running back Christian McCaffrey, who has rushed for 1,202 yards and 10 touchdowns while also recording 924 receiving yards and seven touchdown catches.

Defensively, the 49ers’ injuries have continued to mount. The 49ers just lost middle linebacker Tatum Bethune to a groin injury after he had filled in admirably for Warner, who has missed the bulk of the season with a dislocated ankle. Now, defensive coordinator Robert Saleh turns to 33-year-old Eric Kendricks to help anchor the defense.

San Francisco braces for an Eagles offense that boasts great weapons like Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, and yet the offense has struggled all season long to live up to its potential and execute consistently. Injuries have hampered the offensive line, and quarterback Jalen Hurts has at times appeared tentative rather than the aggressive passer and scrambler that helped lead the Eagles to victory in the Super Bowl. It’s anyone’s guess which Philadelphia offense will show up Sunday, but the potential for greatness is indeed there. So too is the support of a dominant defense that features playmakers at every level, and because of that Vic Fangio juggernaut, it’s hard to bet against the Eagles.

Battle of the generals

Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots, 8 p.m. ET, Sunday, NBC

Two of the most highly-regarded head coaches in the league face off as Mike Vrabel’s Patriots welcome Jim Harbaugh’s Chargers to Foxboro, Mass. The former linebacker and former quarterback have some similarities in their philosophies. Both have established a strong culture of accountability and discipline. Both pride themselves on toughness, grit and physicality, and their teams have adopted that mindset.

The success of Vrabel’s Patriots has ranked among the biggest stories of the year. He took over a team that went 4-13 in back-to-back seasons and quickly whipped his players into shape. The Patriots have regained a place among the league’s elite and spent the season battling Denver for the No. 1 seed. Meanwhile, Harbaugh directs a resilient bunch that has overcome injuries at key positions, including their starting offensive tackles. A year after going 11-6 to reach the playoffs in Harbaugh’s first season at the helm, the Chargers again posted an 11-6 record and now seek their first playoff victory under Harbaugh and the franchise’s first since 2018.

This could be a shootout between promising young quarterbacks Justin Herbert and Drake Maye. Herbert is making his third playoff appearance and this season has carried his team while playing through injury and also shrugging off the struggles of a battered offensive line to pass for 3,727 yards (ninth-most), 26 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Meanwhile, Maye has put up MVP-caliber numbers in his second pro season. Maye’s 4,394 yards ranked fourth in the NFL, and his 31 touchdowns ranked third. Furthermore, Maye is adept at using his legs to help extend plays and keep defenses off balance. Maye must deliver his heroics while facing a Chargers defense that ranks among the top five in yards and interceptions, and top 10 in sacks, while holding quarterbacks to a league-low passer rating of 75.0.

Both of these offenses strive for balance despite the talent each boasts at quarterback. The Patriots rank sixth in the league with 128.9 rushing yards per game, while the Chargers rank 12th with 121.6 per contest.

Young guns versus aging legends

Houston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers, 8:15 p.m. ET, Monday, ESPN/ABC

In many ways, Houston and Pittsburgh represent opposite ends of the spectrum. The Texans rank among the young ascending teams in the league and are led by 41-year-old head coach Demeco Ryans and Stroud, the team’s 24-year-old quarterback. The Steelers, meanwhile, rank among the oldest in the league and are led by 53-year-old Mike Tomlin, who is in his 19th season, and the 42-year-old Rodgers.

The Texans have reached the postseason for a third straight season, but aren’t satisfied with just being here. They want to make a deep run and bring a long-suffering fan base its first Lombardi Trophy. The Steelers, on the other hand, have gone 17 years since they won their last Super Bowl, and they have worked hard to extend their window of contention and hope for one more championship run before Father Time turns out the lights on this era.

Rodgers has proved he still has something left in the tank, but Pittsburgh has its limitations on offense, particularly when it comes to explosive play-making threats. Fortunately for the Steelers, wide receiver DK Metcalf makes his return from the two-game suspension for his incident with a heckling fan three weeks ago. The Steelers hope that getting their big target back helps reinvigorate the offense.

Protecting Rodgers against the Texans’ ferocious pass rush represents a tall task, though. Houston has the top-rated defense in the league and ranks among the leaders in sacks, with Danielle Hunter (15) and Will Anderson Jr. (12) leading the way. The Texans have held opponents to just 17.4 points per game.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/09154958/GettyImages-2254969683-scaled-e1767991902956.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-10 16:59:43.438567

Quarterback Drake Maye and punt returner Marcus Jones were both voted to the second team at their respective positions.

Maye, 23, started all 17 of the Patriots’ games this season and in his second year as a pro developed into one of its best quarterbacks. Completing 354 of 492 pass attempts, he led the NFL with a completion rate of 72% Maye also threw for 4,394 yards, 31 touchdowns and 8 interceptions.

He also led the league in several other statistical categories such as passer rating (113.5), yards per attempt (8.9), net yards per attempt (7.8), expected points added per play (0.313) and completion percentage above expectation (10.8). Nonetheless, Maye missed out on first-team All-Pro honors to Los Angeles Rams QB Matthew Stafford, who can now be considered the favorite to win the NFL MVP award as well.

Stafford received 31 first-team votes compared to Maye’s 18.

Jones, 27, is in his fourth year in the NFL and continues to be one of the league’s most electric returners. In 2025, he ran back 21 punts for 363 yards and an average of 17.3 yards per return. He also scored a pair of touchdowns, tying the league lead with a group of players including the Tennessee Titans’ Chimere Dike, the eventual first-team All-Pro selection ahead of him.

In total, nine Patriots received All-Pro votes this season. Besides Maye and Jones, wide receiver Stefon Diggs, tight end Hunter Henry, right guard Mike Onwenu, cornerback Christian Gonzalez, safety Jaylinn Hawkins, kickoff returner Antonio Gibson and special teamer Brenden Schooler. Jones also received votes as a slot cornerback.

Last year, two members of the Patriots were voted All-Pros. Brenden Schooler was named first-team special teamer, with Christian Gonzalez announced as a second-team cornerback.

It’s a huge bummer any time a player suffers a long injury, especially one as great as Davis.","Anthony Davis was the biggest name on the NBA trade block following the Trae Young trade to the Washington Wizards. Now the Mavs star is out indefinitely with a ligament damage in his left hand suffered in Thursday’s loss to the Utah Jazz. Davis could need surgery, and he’s likely to be sidelined beyond the Feb. 5 trade deadline, essentially taking him off the market.

It’s brutal blow for Davis just as he started playing his best ball of the year, but it’s hardly surprising. Davis is one of the most injury prone superstars of this era, and his lack of availability was always going to factor into his trade value just as much as his massive contract. Davis is owed $58.4 million in Dallas next year, then has a $62.7 million player option for the 2026-27 season. He turns 33 years in March.

This injury shouldn’t have a long-term impact on Davis the same way a lower-body injury would. While Mavs fans are bummed to see him go down before a potential trade out of a town, I actually think this could be a blessing in disguise for Dallas for a few different reasons.

Davis didn’t have much trade value right now anyway

Could the Mavs had landed a first-round pick back for Davis in a trade? That’s the big question, and I’m dubious. Instead, the most likely deal out there was from the Atlanta Hawks, and seemed to be headlined by Kristaps Porzingis and Zaccharie Risacher. This move would have cleared up Dallas’ cap sheet long-term with Porzingis on an expiring deal, but it wouldn’t have moved the needle for its long-term roster building plans all that much in my opinion. Risacher, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024, has been wildly disappointing this season, with a −1.8 EPM that ranks in the 35th percentile of all players. My own 2024 pre-draft board doesn’t look very good right now, but I had Risacher ranked outside the top-10, so it was always shocking to see him go No. 1 overall.

There just didn’t seem to be a good deal out there for the Mavs, so this injury isn’t costing them some huge haul of assets.

The Mavs can ethically tank for the loaded 2026 NBA Draft now

Dallas has to make its 2026 first-round pick count. The Mavs do not control their first-round pick in 2027 (top-2 protected to Charlotte), 2028 (swapped to OKC), 2029 (swapped to Houston), or 2030 (swapped to San Antonio). That was the cost of the Mavs trying to build around Luka Doncic, and now all those picks are handicapping the team’s ability to build around Flagg.

The Mavs had to tank this year, but the NBA lottery gods typically don’t reward blatant tankers. Instead, the ping-pong balls tend to bounce the right way for teams dealing bad luck. Look no further than the 2025 lottery results, when Dallas cashed in long-shot odds for Flagg after the Doncic trade, and the Spurs jumped way up to No. 2 after Victor Wembanyama’s season-ending injury. The Mavs now get to check the bad luck box while losing lots of games to improve their lottery position with Davis out. Dallas’ ownership group (the same people who didn’t block the Luka trade) didn’t seem to want to tank, and now the team doesn’t really have any choice.

For all his issues, Davis is still really good, and taking him off the floor is going to hurt the Mavs’ on-court product quite a bit.

If the Mavs traded Davis, the pieces they would have gotten back would have helped them win games to some extent (Porzingis has been awesome this year when he’s been available, for example). If they kept Davis, he would have probably had them pushing for the play-in tournament. This injury essentially ensures that Dallas’ lottery odds will go up more than they would have in any other scenario. Mavs fans, read my new mock draft here.

Now Dallas gets to see Davis with Kyrie Irving, Cooper Flagg, and their 2026 pick

Kyrie Irving will be back at full strength from his torn ACL next year that has sidelined him all season. Flagg will be in his second season and should take a huge leap. This hand injury won’t linger for Davis, and the Mavs will be debuting a top-10 rookie draft pick (ideally top-3 for their sake).

The Mavs can’t tank next season because Charlotte very likely has their pick. They also can’t tank in the three years after that. Dallas’ best move feels like praying for lottery luck, then seeing what Davis and Kyrie can do next to Flagg and their 2026 rookie while tinkering with the pieces around the margins. This plan requires A.J. Dybantsa, Cameron Boozer, or Darryn Peterson to really hit big, but that’s the case for most team-building plans. Luck is a huge part of NBA success. It took a ridiculous amount of luck for the Mavs to land Flagg, and they will need more to build a decent team around him in the West with so many future picks already out the door before he arrived.

Davis has two years under contract after this season. He’s still really good when he’s at his best. Flagg is absolute stud, and Boozer, Peterson, and Dybantsa have a chance to be every bit as good. Dallas could be pretty interesting next year if the chips fall the right way. It’s a huge bummer any time a player suffers a long injury, especially one as great as Davis. This one might eventually work out in Dallas’ favor, though.",https://platform.sbnation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2254729373.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C34.899851784887&w=1200,N,,2026-01-10 18:00:04.932861

At the end of the picks, I'll note a few teams that I like based on the spread.
Packers (-2) at Bears: The Packers and Bears both enter the playoffs on losing streaks.
The Bears haven't made the playoffs since the 2020 season and they haven't won a playoff game since the 2010 season.
Close game, Eagles win, unsatisfyingly.","For the gambling degenerates, here are my Wild Card Round NFL picks. The team logos indicate who I think will win the game, not necessarily cover the spread. At the end of the picks, I'll note a few teams that I like based on the spread.

Rams (-10.5) at Panthers: The Panthers played their best game of the season against the Rams back in Week 13, when they ran it 40 times for 164 yards, and Bryce Young was efficient when they threw, completing 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards, 3 TDs, and 0 INTs. They successfully shortened the game, won the turnover battle 3-0, and outlasted the Rams in a major upset that would ultimately have NFC seeding implications.

A lot of things had to go right for the Panthers to win that day, and they did. Credit them for making big plays both on offense and defense.

But ultimately, the Rams are simply the far more talented team, and lightning is unlikely to strike twice.

Packers (-2) at Bears: The Packers and Bears both enter the playoffs on losing streaks. The Bears dropped two straight close games to the 49ers and Lions, while the Packers enter the postseason having lost four straight, to the Broncos, Bears, Ravens, and Vikings.

The Packers have lost four major contributors for the season to injuries:

EDGE Micah Parsons: Torn ACL

TE Tucker Kraft: Torn ACL

C Elgton Jenkins: Broken fibula

iDL Devonte Wyatt: Broken ankle

Parsons is one of the best defensive players in the NFL, Kraft was having an All-Pro type of season, Jenkins is one of their two best offensive linemen, and Wyatt is a good starter. It's hard to lose that kind of firepower and make a playoff run.

The players who are still available got to rest their bodies a bit, as the Packers sat starters Week 18, and Jordan Love will return to the field in the playoffs after missing the last two games.

The Bears haven't made the playoffs since the 2020 season and they haven't won a playoff game since the 2010 season. That means that they're not battle tested, but it also means that Soldier Field is going to be rocking on Saturday if the Bears get a lead.

This matchup feels pretty simple to me. The Packers are too banged up to make any kind of playoff run, and the Bears led the NFL with a turnover differential of +22. Love will make some mistakes in front of a hostile crowd, and the Bears advance.

Bills (-1.5) at Jaguars: We're used to seeing the Bills in the playoffs, and despite their lack of a Super Bowl appearance during the Josh Allen era, they have won at least one playoff game every year in each of the last five seasons. I assume that is why they are favored in this matchup over the Jags, who haven't even been to the playoffs since the 2022 season.

But the Bills are unimpressive to me. They have a high-powered rushing attack, and that's about it. They might have the least threatening passing game weapons of any team in the playoffs, and they struggled to stop the run for the vast majority of the season.

Meanwhile, the Jags have won eight straight, with a point differential of +153 (!) in those games, or average margin of victory of 19.1 points. This team is legit, and arguably the hottest team in the NFL entering the postseason.

49ers at Eagles (-5.5): The 49ers' offense was on fire near the end of the season, as they had a six-game winning streak during which they scored 36.7 points per game. And then they got hammered by the Seahawks Week 18 in a 13-3 game that wasn't as close as the score might indicate.

Their offense was a weird study this week. They score points, but when you drill down on some specific areas of their offense, they don't feel super impressive. For example, Christian McCaffrey was second in the NFL in yards from scrimmage, and yet he averaged just 3.8 yards per carry and had his worst broken tackle stats of his career. Also, they love working the middle of the field, which would have been a good thing in years past against the Eagles, but not anymore with the Eagles' star power at linebacker and in slot corner Cooper DeJean.

On the other side of the ball, the injury-depleted 49ers can't rush the passer, they're coming off one of the worst tackling performances of the entire season (league-wide), their small corners are theoretically bad matchups for the Eagles' receivers, and the Eagles are rested while the 49ers were on the wrong end of a physical beatdown a last Saturday against the Seahawks.

The Eagles' offense has been extremely disappointing this season, but they got an ideal first round matchup. Close game, Eagles win, unsatisfyingly.

Chargers at Patri*ts (-3.5): I like the Chargers' defense quite a bit, but the Patriots have scored at least 26 points in each of their last eight games, and at least 23 points in each of their last 14 games. They scored 30 or more points in eight of their games. They're consistent, and occasionally explosive.

The Chargers have major injury issues on their offensive line, and they can't protect Justin Herbert, so at least his stans will have another excuse when he's one-and-done in the playoffs again.

Texans (-3) at Steelers: In my opinion, the Texans and Eagles have the two best defenses in the playoffs, with the Seahawks a close third.

However, the Steelers' style of play could match up well against Houston. Aaron Rodgers gets the ball out quickly, which should help offset the Texans' awesome pass rush duo of Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter to some degree. And on the back end, Derek Stingley (oblique) and Kamari Lassiter (ankle/knee) are both on the injury report.

I like the Texans to win, but I think it'll be a close game that could go either way. Against the spread, I'll take the Steelers and the 3 points.",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/USATSI_19886062_EKtroOe.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 16:59:50.906838

Kyle Shanahan said Green has a foot injury that happened during practice, which is why he was added to the injury report.

Shanahan also said Pearsall wasn’t able to do anything during Friday’s session, while Williams was limited. Since Pearsall has played all season, Shanahan said there is still a chance he could suit up on Sunday, despite not practicing during the week.

Despite being listed as questionable, Shanahan said his mind has not changed about playing Cowing this weekend: “Jake’s just different. It was his first practice this year, just this week,” citing how Cowing not practicing all year plays a part.

Shanahan said the 49ers could “possibly” make multiple maneuvers with the roster outside of the two elevations from the practice squad, given all of the injuries.

Shanahan said he has not been told whether they will open Fred Warner’s practice window with a win.

Shanahan was asked a hypothetical question: If it were a playoff game, would Ricky and Dee be out? He said, “Last week wasn’t a playoff game, and I didn’t look at it any different. I’d say there’s no different in this week and last week.”

If Winters can’t play, Garret Wallow will make his first start. Shanahan said the 49ers were fortunate to get Wallow off the Broncos’ practice squad: “If he does have the possibility to start, we feel very good about him.

Omarion Hampton Injury Update: Will He Play on Sunday vs. Patriots?

This isn’t the first time Hampton has been hampered by an ankle issue. Back in Week 5’s 27-10 loss to the Washington Commanders, he sustained a sprain that led to him not returning until Week 14.

Over the next four games, the first-round pick averaged 57.8 rushing yards and 14 receiving yards while adding 3 total TDs. Right when he started to look like the player the Chargers took 22nd overall last April, he got banged up again.

Fortunately, it doesn’t appear to be anything too major. Hampton was listed by Los Angeles as questionable for Sunday, but he plans to play. This comes after he missed practice on Wednesday and Thursday before progressing to limited participation on Friday.

Given the importance of the playoffs, Hampton and the Chargers seem to be making the most of the situation in a win-or-go-home scenario.

Chargers’ Offensive Outlook for Wild Card Round vs. Patriots

The primary player who could be affected by Hampton’s expected return is RB Kimani Vidal. He's the Chargers’ leading rusher, pacing the field with 155 carries for 643 yards and 3 TDs. He also hauled in 16 passes for 136 yards and another score.

Los Angeles and their promising rookie face a tall task on Sunday. The Patriots allowed the fifth-fewest rushing yards to RBs (1,311) in the regular season. Additionally, per SumerSports, their -0.05 EPA per play on defense ranks 11th.

Hampton being available might also assist QB Justin Herbert. Among signal-callers with 250+ plays, he trailed only Buffalo Bills superstar Josh Allen in rushing yards with 498 from Weeks 1-17. In Weeks 6-13, without Hampton, he went over 30 rushing yards three separate times.

Two Hampton-specific things that can come to Herbert’s aid are tackle evasion and receiving. Per NFL Pro, despite being contacted on 52.4% of his carries this year, the first-year man forced a missed tackle on 29.8% of tries. Of 64 RBs with 50+ rushes in 2025-26, his 12.32% target share was 10th.

Problem is, the bets the Colts are making could be considered risky given who they're betting on.
They're betting on Ballard, who has a losing record as a general manager despite consistently solid draft results and an ability to build competitive rosters.
On Steichen, the questions center on why he wasn't able to squeeze more out of the Colts down the stretch.
NFL ownership is a big job, and the Colts' new owner is making some big bets early in her tenure.","INDIANAPOLIS -- Jim Irsay gained a reputation as one of the NFL's most prominent -- and eccentric -- owners during his decades presiding over the Indianapolis Colts.

But after his death last year, his daughters emerged from their dad's substantial shadow and began to develop identities of their own. Oldest daughter Carlie Irsay-Gordon -- the team's principal owner and the public face of the organization -- has only recently come into the national consciousness, largely for her habit of watching and charting games from the sideline while listening to coaches on a headset.

She has come to be known as an open-minded, ever-present owner who believes in learning the granular details of every aspect of the organization, from special teams to scouting.

But, with this week's decision to retain embattled general manager Chris Ballard and coach Shane Steichen after a collapse of historic proportions, Irsay-Gordon's short tenure might come to be defined by something else: Her big gambles.

The Colts finished 2025 with seven straight losses, raising expectations among the team's fan base that structural changes might be coming after a fifth consecutive season of missing the postseason.

Instead, Irsay-Gordon and her sisters, Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson, are doubling down on their current leadership and the men's ability to ""replicate"" the magic the team briefly captured during it's fast start to the season that was derailed by crippling injuries. The Colts finished 8-9 and missed the playoffs, becoming the first team since the 1995 Raiders to miss the postseason after an 8-2 start.

""We experienced a lot of progress, which gives us optimism for the future and the direction we are heading as a team,"" Irsay-Gordon said.

Problem is, the bets the Colts are making could be considered risky given who they're betting on.

They're betting on Ballard, who has a losing record as a general manager despite consistently solid draft results and an ability to build competitive rosters. His failure to find a long-term answer at quarterback alone might have doomed him long ago in some organizations.

They're betting on Steichen, who is a highly respected offensive coach who has gotten a lot out of quarterbacks with limitations but hasn't found a way to get the Colts across the finish line in late-season games when the playoffs were at stake.

And they're betting on quarterback Daniel Jones, the centerpiece of Ballard and Steichen's 2026 plan despite his upcoming free agency in the spring and the ruptured Achilles tendon injury he will be rehabbing for months to come -- perhaps even into next season.

When it comes to Ballard in particular, Irsay-Gordon said she considered the entirety of his nine-year tenure, during which Ballard's teams have made the playoffs twice and won just a single postseason game. But Ballard's willingness to alter his approach to team-building last season serves as the basis for Irsay-Gordon's confidence that he can re-create the team that looked primed for a deep playoff run two months ago.

Ballard, Irsay-Gordon said, ""was able to adapt and change the way as far as how he works on the roster and assembles the roster, and we believe that he is capable of replicating that next season.""

Ballard used free agency much more aggressively last spring and executed a midseason trade for star cornerback Sauce Gardner that represents the boldest trade of his career as a GM. Irsay-Gordon seemed to support the approach and suggested she'd like it to continue. But that means green-lighting some high-stakes moves for an executive with a very mixed track record.

On Steichen, the questions center on why he wasn't able to squeeze more out of the Colts down the stretch. Granted, their top two quarterbacks were unavailable -- Jones and Anthony Richardson Sr. both finished the season on injured reserve. The Colts were also missing top cornerbacks Gardner and Charvarius Ward, as well as defensive tackle DeForest Buckner.

Even Irsay-Gordon acknowledged the shortcomings.

""Adversity struck,"" she said, ""but no matter what the circumstances are, we have to be able to find a way to win and finish games.""

Even so, Irsay-Gordon seems to be willing to bank on Steichen's ability to overcome this flaw next season.

And then there is endorsement of the plan to proceed with efforts to re-sign Jones and prepare for next season with an intention of him being the starting quarterback. Achilles injuries require lengthy rehabilitation, and players still can experience initial limitations in their mobility even after returning.

Jones also has a long injury history that must be taken into account if the Colts entertain a multiyear contract. There is some belief within the organization that Jones could be a long-term solution at quarterback for a team that has had different opening-day starters in eight of the past nine seasons.

""[Jones] knew he had something to prove and I think he did a great job,"" Irsay-Gordon said. She added, ""we've had a drought [at quarterback] and we were able to really show that we're able to execute at a high level on the field. ... It was promising what he was able to do.""

Is the quarterback plan flawed? Irsay-Gordon declined to comment on Jones' injury.

NFL ownership is a big job, and the Colts' new owner is making some big bets early in her tenure. How they play out will dictate how much success her team enjoys in 2026.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0108%2Fr1598218_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 13:13:03.235669

Jacksonville Jaguars final injury report

Starting left tackle Cole Van Lanen is officially questionable for Sunday with a knee injury.

Van Lanen suffered the injury in last week’s game against the Tennessee Titans, which forced him to exit the game early.

Van Lanen did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday, but did return and was limited on Friday.

If Van Lanen can’t go this week, we likely see Walker Little at left tackle. Little started there for most of the season before Van Lanen took over.

Also along the offensive line, the Jaguars will be getting right guard Patrick Mekari back. He missed the last two games with a back injury.

Montaric Brown, Jarrian Jones, Greg Newsome, and Danny Striggow, all of whom were on the injury report this week as well, are good to go.

That's a good thing",Christian Clark,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6959049/2026/01/10/anthony-davis-injury-mavericks-draft-pick/,"For the third time in his 11-month tenure with the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony Davis is going to miss an extended stretch of games.
Where does this leave the Mavericks and Davis, whom Dallas was trying to trade before he went down again?

Davis’ injury makes it clear which direction the Mavericks need to go.","For the third time in his 11-month tenure with the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony Davis is going to miss an extended stretch of games.

Davis’ latest injury occurred late in the fourth quarter Thursday against the Utah Jazz when he suffered ligament damage in his left hand trying to defend Lauri Markkanen’s drive to the basket. He will see a hand specialist to determine if he needs surgery, yet he’s expected to be sidelined for several weeks even if that procedure is not necessary, a league source told The Athletic.

Where does this leave the Mavericks and Davis, whom Dallas was trying to trade before he went down again? The consensus among NBA personnel The Athletic contacted Friday was that Dallas won’t be able to trade Davis before Feb. 5. Davis’ trade value was already low because of his contract (he is owed $58.5 million next season and holds a $62.8 million player option in 2027-28) and his durability concerns. This hand injury only lowers his trade value.

If there’s any silver lining for Mavericks fans, it’s that their team should not be good for the rest of this season. The Mavericks have gone 10-10 with Davis in the lineup this campaign and 4-14 without him. That the Mavericks have played at an 18-win pace without Davis this season is a good thing.

Why? After this year, the Mavericks don’t have outright control of their own first-round pick again until 2031. That means it’s absolutely critical they are able to draft a franchise building block this June.

Last spring, the Mavericks were gifted the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card for the disastrous Luka Dončić trade when they won the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes. Flagg, who turned 19 last month, has been one of the best teenagers to ever put on an NBA uniform. He scored 42 points when Dallas visited Utah in December and narrowly missed becoming the youngest player ever to record a triple-double in Thursday’s rematch between the teams in Salt Lake City.

As good as Flagg already is, the Mavericks will need to put more elite young talent around him to have a chance to be competitive with their I-35 neighbors to the north (Oklahoma City Thunder) and the south (San Antonio Spurs).

The Thunder used 22- and 24-win seasons to put championship talent around their face of the franchise, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. They drafted Josh Giddey at No. 6 in 2022 and later flipped him in a trade for defensive ace Alex Caruso. Then, in 2023, Oklahoma City chose Chet Holmgren with the No. 2 selection. Holmgren doubles as one of the NBA’s best rim protectors and a hyper-efficient complementary offensive player.

Meanwhile, the Spurs, who are second in the West behind the Thunder, have picked in the top four in each of the last three drafts. They chose Victor Wembanyama No. 1 in 2023, Stephon Castle No. 4 in 2024 and Dylan Harper No. 2 in last year’s draft.

The Mavericks need to find a running mate for Flagg in this year’s draft. As unfortunate as Davis’ latest injury was, the reality is his absence helps Dallas’ chances of having a high lottery pick and possibly leaping into the top four again, where it could find its own version of Holmgren or Castle.

As of Friday evening, the Mavericks (14-24) had a 26.3 percent chance of winding up with a top-four selection. No matter how poorly they play the rest of the way, it will be difficult for them to finish with a worse record than teams like the Indiana Pacers (7-31), Washington Wizards (10-27), Brooklyn Nets (11-24), New Orleans Pelicans (9-31) or Sacramento Kings (8-30).

Without Davis, though, it’s in play for the Mavericks to have a worse record than the Jazz (13-24, and in need of a poor finish because they must surrender their pick to the Thunder unless it falls in the top eight) or the Los Angeles Clippers (14-23, and who owe their pick to the Thunder no matter what happens).

Davis’ injury makes it clear which direction the Mavericks need to go. The best teams in their conference were built with multiple high-level lottery picks.

The Mavericks can resume trade talks for Davis this summer. For the next four months, the best thing they can do is be bad, which won’t be difficult without their $54 million player in the lineup.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/10003235/GettyImages-2255008401-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-10 14:59:52.126528

On paper, Houston owns a slight offensive advantage, but observers of both teams will admit neither boasts an explosive attack.","For all of their offensive struggles, the Houston Texans remain an imposing force in the AFC because of a relentless defense that strikes fear in the hearts of the opposition. Their SWARM defense -- an acronym created by head coach DeMeco Ryans that stands for special work ethic and relentless mindset -- has lived up to the mantra in 2025, posting the lowest average yards allowed per game (277.2) in the NFL and narrowly missing out on finishing as the league's best scoring defense at 17.4 points per game allowed. The unit has carried Houston back to the postseason, where the Texans hope to advance beyond the Divisional Round for the first time in franchise history after falling to Baltimore and Kansas City in each of the last two seasons. In order to get there, they must first clear Pittsburgh on the prime-time stage.

At long last, Pittsburgh seemed to be hitting its stride offensively in Week 14 and finally opened up the air attack by relying on its big-bodied go route master Metcalf in a 27-22 win over Baltimore. Two weeks later, Metcalf got into an altercation with a fan in Detroit and was suspended for the final two games, robbing Rodgers of his best target. Since then, the Steelers have trudged through a six-point output in an upset loss to the Browns -- which included a goal-to-go scenario in which they certainly could have used Metcalf for a back-corner fade -- and edged past the Ravens in Week 18 in a game in which running back Kenneth Gainwell finished as Pittsburgh's leading receiver. Simply, the Steelers need Metcalf and will be ecstatic to welcome him back at the perfect time when they face the NFL's top defense that includes an elite corner in Derek Stingley Jr.. The Steelers WR owns a three-inch height advantage over Stingley, but that alone doesn't guarantee he'll find success. His presence, however, increases the Steelers' chances of finding some; Houston cannot simply load the box to stop running back Jaylen Warren (or Gainwell) with Metcalf also on the field.

The Texans' story in 2024 centered on their beleaguered offensive line, an obvious weakness Houston attempted to address in 2025 but never quite figured out entirely. The unit is better than it was last season -- C.J. Stroud has taken only 23 sacks after going down 52 times in 2024 -- and Stroud isn't making as many pressure-related mistakes as he did a year ago; however, they're still far from a rock-solid unit when it comes to pass protection. The running game isn't a well-oiled operation, either: Houston ranks 22nd in rushing yards per game and the team's leading rusher, rookie Woody Marks, is averaging just 3.6 yards per carry. If there's an area in which the Steelers can capitalize, it's with their front seven, a group that includes a rather deep pass-rushing corps headlined by T.J. Watt (who returned from a lung injury in Week 18) and should be able to find success on third-and-long. If the Texans need points late, it's going to be an uphill battle. They'll have to focus on getting the ball out quickly and control time of possession, or hope their defense can help them win the field position battle and take some of the load off their offense in order to have the best chance to win.

On paper, Houston owns a slight offensive advantage, but observers of both teams will admit neither boasts an explosive attack. Houston has the edge defensively, meaning we could be in for a low-scoring affair in Pittsburgh -- which also means the outcome might rely heavily on the right feet of Pittsburgh's Chris Boswell and Houston's Ka'imi Fairbairn. In a typical year, that wouldn't be an issue for Steelers fans; Boswell has been ultra reliable over the course of his 11 seasons in Pittsburgh. But Boswell posted his lowest field goal conversion percentage (84.4) since 2022 this season, and although it didn't end up hurting them, Steelers fans might still have visions of Boswell's missed extra point that opened the door for the Ravens to nearly win in Week 18's de facto AFC North title game. Fairbairn, meanwhile, has been absolute nails in 2025, proving to be one of the most reliable point producers on the Texans roster by routinely drilling kicks attempted at or near the edge of his range. Inside of 50 yards, he's a perfect 35 for 35 this season and has posted a 91.7 conversion rate overall (his four misses came from 50-plus yards, but he's converted 9 of 13 such attempts). It's not the most seductive note in a playoff game, but we all know these games can often rest on the foot of a kicker -- and we're in for a battle of stalwarts on Monday night.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/c6erc8drag6xvxjdiqaz,N,,2026-01-10 12:14:04.316934

Packers player to watch

QB Jordan Love: He hasn't played in a game since a helmet-to-helmet hit from Chicago's Austin Booker in the second quarter of the Dec. 20 Packers-Bears game sent him into concussion protocol. Love was cleared before Green Bay's regular-season finale, but the Packers opted to rest him for the playoffs. Love has nine touchdown passes and only two interceptions in six games against the Bears.

Bears player to watch

QB Caleb Williams. The Bears envisioned deep playoff runs on a regular basis when they drafted Williams with the No. 1 overall pick last year. They hope this is just the start. Williams threw for a franchise-record 3,942 yards with 27 touchdowns and just seven interceptions. Though his completion percentage ranked last among qualifying leaders, he became more and more comfortable in coach Ben Johnson's system.

Key matchup

Chicago's running backs against Green Bay's defensive line. Though the Bears' run game emerged as one of the best this season behind a retooled line, it was hard to tell against Detroit. Chicago managed just 65 yards rushing, with D'Andre Swift held to 40 yards on 10 attempts and rookie Kyle Monangai finishing with 14 yards on six carries. With Swift running for 1,087 yards and Monangai adding 783, the Bears were the only team with two 750-yard rushers. Green Bay struggled to stop the run in recent weeks, with Devonte Wyatt (ankle) and then Micah Parsons (knee) suffering season-ending injuries. The Packers gave up 150 yards rushing to the Bears in their most recent meeting and then allowed Derrick Henry to run for 216 yards and four touchdowns in a 41-24 loss to Baltimore.

Series notes

The Packers are 30-7 against the Bears counting the playoffs since the start of the 2008 season, with the past four games coming down to the wire. In 2024, both came down to field-goal attempts by Chicago's Cairo Santos on the final play - one that got blocked and one that was successful. This season, Green Bay hung on to win 28-21 in Week 14 at Lambeau Field when Keisean Nixon intercepted Williams in the end zone with 22 seconds remaining. Chicago returned the favor two weeks later, rallying from 10 down in the final two minutes of regulation before Williams threw a 46-yard touchdown to DJ Moore in overtime. This is the third playoff game between the longtime rivals - all in Chicago. The Bears won a Western Division playoff game over the Packers 33-14 at Wrigley Field on Dec. 14, 1941. The Packers beat the Bears 21-14 in an NFC championship game at Soldier Field on Jan. 23, 2011.

Here's how you can watch the game.

Chicago and Green Bay split their two regular season games, with the Packers topping the Bears 28-21 in Green Bay in Week 14, and the Bears beating the Packers 22-16 in Week 16 at Soldier Field.

Rome Odunze and Kyler Gordon expected to return from injuries

Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze, who has missed the past five games with a foot injury, has no injury designation for Saturday night, and is expected to play, although he said he might have some plaing time limitations.

""For me, I'm looking to be out there as much as possible, and make as many plays as I can. At the end of the day, it's all or nothing for this game, and until the Super Bowl, until the end of the season. So I want to contribute as much as possible, and put everything that I have out there on that field,"" he said on Wednesday.

Bears nickel cornerback Kyler Gordon is listed as questionable for the game after missing the past five games with a groin injury. Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen has said he expects Gordon to be part of the game plan.

""It gives us another playmaker. Obviously, it's been unfortunate we haven't had him much this season,, but he was a guy coming into the season that we were really excited about, and I feel like he can help us make some plays and help us win,"" Allen said.

Jordan Love to be back under center for Packers

Quarterback Jordan Love, who was knocked out of the Week 16 game against the Bears with a concussion, will get the start on Saturday.

Love cleared the league's concussion protocol ahead of the Packers' season finale, but was held out in Week 18 after the team had already locked up the No. 7 seed in the playoffs.

Wicks, who went down early against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 17, missed Week 18’s action and was listed as questionable for Saturday’s game against the Chicago Bears in the wild card round. Wicks was a limited participant throughout the week, but head coach Matt LaFleur stated in press conferences that Wicks had not yet fully passed through the protocol.

Beyond Wicks, the Packers have five questionable players on their injury report this week, after making nearly 30 transactions (or over 30, depending on how you count them) over the last two weeks to make up for their injury situation. Those questionable players are quarterback Malik Willis (shoulder/hamstring), right tackle Zach Tom (back/knee), defensive lineman Warren Brinson (foot), linebacker Nick Niemann and safety Javon Bullard (knee).

LaFleur has previously stated that Willis will be available this week, along with confirming that Bullard is “okay” after his injury. Tom was also a player that LaFleur said the expectation was that he would play, but he missed Thursday’s practice with a rest day, a sign that the tackle potentially had a setback.

Niemann was called up from the injured reserve this week. If he can’t go, expect practice squad linebacker Jamon Johnson to take his place on special teams. Brinson is a bit of an unknown, as he was able to finish the game against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 18. It was a surprise that he was listed as questionable during yesterday’s final injury report of the week.

Without Wicks, the Packers will have Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, Matthew Golden and Jakobie Keeney-James available at the receiver position against the Bears. Five is a low number to carry on gameday at the position, at least for Green Bay, but with the potential of Johnson and a tight end (Packers only have two on the 53-man roster) coming up from the practice squad to play on Saturday, the potential to add a sixth receiver as the roster stands now is limited.

The Green Bay Packers will go on the road to take on the Chicago Bears in the NFL Playoffs for just the third time in the century-old rivalry. The team that wins this weekend will continue their season for at least one more week, while the loser’s season will end.

The Packers are 1-1 against the division champion Bears this season, winning the first matchup at Lambeau Field and losing the second at Soldier Field.

Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love was knocked out of the second game against Chicago with a concussion after a helmet-to-helmet hit. Saturday will mark his first in-game action since.

Love told reporters this week that he isn’t worried about being rusty after missing two games, and he’s “excited” for the matchup. He said big games like this one are “what you want as a player.”

“It’s win or go home. Everybody knows what’s at stake,” he said. “The intensity will be there. The emotions will be there. It’s a rivalry game and a playoff game.”

Love has led Green Bay to the playoffs in each of his first three seasons as the team’s starting signal-caller. But this year’s Packers team is coming into the matchup with more than a dozen players on injured reserve, including star pass rusher Micah Parsons.

The Packers traded two first-round draft picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark for Parsons at the start of the season. Parsons tore his ACL in mid-December, after becoming the first player in NFL history to record at least 12 sacks in each of his first five seasons on Thanksgiving Day.

Green Bay rested most of its starters last week in a 16-3 loss to the Minnesota Vikings to end the regular season on a four-game losing streak.

Running back Josh Jacobs, who has dealt with a lingering knee injury for much of the latter part of the season, did not play in Minnesota. He told reporters this week he feels “pretty good” after the week off.

“I’m not gonna say I like not playing, but obviously these moments and these types of games (are) where it really matters the most,” he said of Saturday’s contest. “It’s going to be fun, and I like that I’m going to be able to hit the ground running.”

Green Bay faces a resurgent Chicago team led by first-year head coach Ben Johnson and quarterback Caleb Williams, a former first overall draft pick. Under Johnson, the Bears ranked 6th in total offense this season.

Packers head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters this week that Williams is a “dynamic” player who’s difficult to defend.

“He is dynamic back there (with) his ability to make people miss, get out of the pocket (and) make throws from in the pocket,” LaFleur said. “I think he’s playing really, really good football right now.”

Chicago won the NFC North division title with a record of 11-6. Green Bay secured a wild card playoff spot with its record of 9-7-1. The Packers haven’t won the NFC North since 2021.

Green Bay last faced the Bears in the playoffs in 2011. The Packers won that matchup 21-14 en route to winning Super Bowl 45. Before that, the Bears won the lone playoff matchup between the rivals in 1941, one week after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

At a press conference this week, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley acknowledged the added weight of facing the Bears in the postseason.

“This is one of the biggest rivalries in all of football, one that I have watched for a very long time,” he said. “(It) did not end the way we wanted the last time we played there. I am going to do everything in my power to focus on every minute that I have to give this organization and our players everything I got to go win this game.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25342014215132-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:14:12.425102

When the NFL decided not to place the Houston Texans in the Saturday 4:30 p.m. ET window to open wild-card weekend, a spot famously named “Shakey’s Game” by Bill Simmons and Cousin Sal, the league proved that nothing is truly sacred. The Texans have made the playoffs eight times in their young history, and all eight times, they played in that window.

This year, Houston will play on Monday night instead, against Pittsburgh, to cap off a weekend-long football extravaganza (which also includes the College Football Playoff semifinals!).

Three of the six games on wild-card weekend feature a quarterback making his playoff debut. Traditionally, debutants have not performed well against the spread. It has been one of the most widely cited trends in recent years; playoff-rookie quarterbacks are 20-39-1 (34 percent) against the spread and 20-40 straight up since 2002, per Action Network. This week, the trend will be tested by Bryce Young, Caleb Williams, and Drake Maye, who all play at home.

Here are my thoughts on all six games, including best bets. All lines are from FanDuel as of Thursday morning.

Los Angeles Rams at Carolina Panthers (+10.5)

The regular-season meeting between these two teams was decidedly weird because Matthew Stafford threw multiple first-half interceptions (including a pick-six). The Rams were stuck playing from behind, and Carolina leaned heavily on the run game, with 35 combined attempts for Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard. That type of game is pretty unlikely to repeat.

Panthers defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, formerly of the Rams, will have a considerably healthier roster for this game than he did for the first meeting. Star corner Jaycee Horn, safety Tre’von Moehrig, and linebacker Christian Rozeboom didn’t play last time. The Panthers probably won’t turn Stafford over three times again, but they should improve on their 7.6 yards per play allowed from that game.

My main concern for Carolina in this matchup exists on the other side of the ball. How will the team consistently score? For a month now, this offense has been pretty anemic.

The Panthers established an early-season formula that really worked for them by running the ball at one of the highest rates in the league. In the first nine weeks, Carolina had the sixth-most efficient run offense by EPA per rush.

Since Week 10, that plan has failed to continue producing dividends. The Panthers are still running the ball at one of the highest rates in the league (when compared to expected pass rates), but the offense has not maintained those impressive early-season efficiency levels. Their run game has dipped to 23rd in EPA per rush. You can definitely throw the ball on the Rams’ secondary, but how much faith do we have in Bryce Young to do that if he’s playing from behind and forced into clear passing situations?

One of my favorite ways to evaluate quarterback performance is to look at how efficient a passer is in obvious passing downs. Of 45 quarterbacks with at least 100 attempts, Young finished 33rd in success rate on third or fourth down with 5-plus yards to go. For comparison, Stafford finished 13th in the same metric.

Home underdogs of seven-plus points have fared very well in the last 15 years of NFL wild-card history. Remember the Beast Quake? Tebowing? Taylor Heinicke going toe-to-toe with Tom Brady? This has all the makings of a potential Backdoor Bryce cover with a late score, just like Carolina’s Week 18 loss to the Buccaneers.

Verdict: Bet under 46.5 (–110)

Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (+1.5)

If the season’s first two games between these two are any indication, football fans are in for more late-game drama in this battle for NFC North supremacy. The market ratings on these two teams have changed considerably since the Packers were a 6.5-point home favorite on December 7. Green Bay pulled off a red zone stand in the final minute, won by seven, and claimed first place at 9-3-1. It was the last regular-season game they’d win. The injuries and losses piled up from there, and now the defense is borderline unrecognizable compared to the group that was as reliable and balanced as any in the league for the first three months.

The Micah Parsons injury, especially, swung the market against the Packers, who ended up an underdog in the second meeting between these two teams, on December 20. Fast-forward three weeks, and we have the same teams in the same building, and it’s priced as an effective toss-up. The market took note of the Bears’ horrid defensive showing against the 49ers in Week 17, as well as how Chicago followed that up at home with a dud against the already-eliminated Lions in Week 18.

The biggest challenge in assessing this game is trying to figure out what the Packers defense is at this point. Even before Parsons went down, the Packers were not exactly posting excellent defensive metrics week to week.

Defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley has dialed up the blitz rate in recent weeks to try to generate more pressure without Parsons, but it’s left the back end of the defense more vulnerable to the big plays they were so elite at preventing for the majority of the season.

Chicago’s revamped offensive line is graded among the league’s best this season, and as a result, Caleb Williams should have plenty of time to create the big plays out of structure that have defined his sophomore season.

With neither of these defenses generating much pressure on the opposing quarterback, this ought to be a higher-scoring game than the last meeting at Soldier Field. Add in the potential for some light snow to coat the field at the benefit of the offenses, and there should be more points scored than the market currently indicates.

When in doubt and dealing with two relatively even teams, I will take my chances with the superior passing offense. In this game, that is the Packers, who rank second in EPA per dropback.

Verdict: Bet Packers ML (–112)

Buffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars (+1.5)

On paper, this is the most evenly balanced and highest-projected-scoring game of the first round of the playoffs. With Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow, and Patrick Mahomes out of the playoffs, Josh Allen may never get a better chance to reach the Super Bowl. To do that, he’ll have to overcome one of the worst overall rosters he’s had throughout his time in Buffalo. The Bills have had issues stopping the run at the second and third levels all year long. Their defense gives up explosive plays constantly. The offense lacks players who can separate at an elite level, and this was on full display when they played high-quality secondaries like the Texans’ and Eagles’ and could barely move the ball and score.

It’s hard to imagine this team actually lifting the Lombardi Trophy in February unless Allen goes on a generational run. This matchup is favorable on paper for the Jaguars for a few reasons.

Jacksonville’s run defense has been quietly elite this year. The Jaguars rank seventh in rush success rate allowed and third in EPA per rush. Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady has a tendency to fall a little bit too in love with the run game, and the result is an offense that isn’t actually as efficient as one with Josh Allen at quarterback should be. Allen has done plenty to bail them out on the money downs (he has elite numbers in obvious passing situations), but it’s still a difficult tightrope to walk.

The Jaguars are better on script than the Bills. The Jaguars are tied for fourth in the NFL in first-half points per game, while Buffalo is 10th. The Jaguars like to begin games by throwing the ball, whereas Buffalo looks to establish James Cook and the running game. Only the Jets and Ravens ran the ball more often in the first half this season than Buffalo. The Jaguars, meanwhile, actually passed the ball in the first half at the fifth-highest rate. If Brady tries to match the Jaguars offensively by running into the teeth of Jacksonville’s defense, that may not go well for Buffalo. There’s no reason Brady shouldn’t unleash his superhuman quarterback early, but will he?

For all the talk of the Patriots’ easy schedule, Buffalo’s schedule doesn’t get enough press. Like the rest of the AFC East teams, the Bills benefited plenty from a favorable schedule of opponents. They did have a few tricky matchups against the Texans, Eagles, and Chiefs as a “reward” for finishing first in the division last year, but overall, they faced the second-easiest schedule in the NFL by DVOA this season.

Verdict: Lean Jaguars +1.5

San Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (–4.5)

Even though the Niners offense was in supernova form for most of the final seven weeks, the 13-3 loss to Seattle at home last Saturday exposed some real cracks ahead of a road playoff game against one of the league’s best defenses.

Since Brock Purdy returned from injury in Week 11, he ranks second in the NFL in quarterback efficiency. Four of those last seven games came against bad defensive opponents (the Cardinals, Colts, Titans, and Bears), and the 49ers averaged 42 points per game in those four. However, when San Francisco stepped up in class and played much tougher defenses (Cleveland and Seattle), its performance dropped off considerably. In two games against the Browns and Seahawks, the Niners managed only 252 and 173 yards, respectively.

The market opened the Eagles as a three-point favorite on Sunday once the matchup was confirmed, and it’s been mostly one-way action toward the Eagles since then. These two teams are also trending in opposite directions injury-wise, as the Eagles are expected to have star right tackle Lane Johnson back, while the 49ers are even more injured now than they were a couple of weeks ago. Trent Williams and Ricky Pearsall are both questionable to play, and the linebacker situation is dangerously thin following the season-ending injury to Tatum Bethune.

Williams is one of the most impactful players in the entire sport, but in this matchup, Pearsall is just as important. The Eagles are elite at defending tight ends and grade out well against top receivers thanks to their linebackers, as well as Cooper DeJean and Quinyon Mitchell in coverage. The Eagles’ biggest defensive weakness is against no. 2 wide receivers (where Pearsall would slot in); they allow the second-most yards per game against that position. This is not a favorable matchup at all for George Kittle, who was injured prior to the Week 18 loss in which he put up a measly 29 yards. Now, Kittle faces the defense that allows the second-fewest yards per game (28.6) to tight ends.

Offensively, the Eagles have one of the most fascinating profiles in the league. We’ve all watched them enough to know that their offense is not aesthetically pleasing, but under the hood, it’s also very unusual. The Eagles have the most efficient red zone offense in the NFL, but they also feature the fifth-highest three-and-out rate in the league. You would naturally expect these two numbers to balance each other out across an entire season, but they really haven’t. Which number do you believe is more signal and less noise? I would personally say that the red zone number is noisier and not something I would bet on to continue, especially since Philly was actually worse in the red zone last season despite a more effective tush push and a better overall offense.

The 49ers are super vulnerable over the middle of the field right now due to all of their linebacker injuries, but are the Eagles the team to actually exploit that? Philadelphia seldom throws over the middle in this Kevin Patullo offense. On paper, this is a very favorable matchup for Dallas Goedert, but the Eagles haven’t committed to regularly featuring him week to week.

The Niners should play a ton of zone coverage and force the Eagles to be methodical. With the Eagles offense typically showing up for only one half a game, and with the concerns about the Niners’ offensive matchup here, this could be a low-scoring battle controlled by the Philly defense.

Verdict: Bet under 44.5 (–110) and George Kittle under 59.5 yards (–110)

Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots (–3.5)

At this point, I’m sure that Patriots fans are tired of hearing about how easy their schedule was. I get it. You can only play the teams you’re matched up against, and the Patriots did everything they were supposed to do and more against that weak schedule. At the same time, it’s difficult to make a proper judgment of them relative to their AFC playoff peers. They played only two games against teams with winning records all season long—their two matchups against Buffalo. Drake Maye could quite possibly win MVP, but he went up against the easiest schedule of opposing defenses by DVOA.

The key battle in this game will be Maye’s surgical ability to push the ball down the field—the Patriots lead the league in offensive explosive play rate—versus a defense that has allowed the second-fewest plays of 20-plus yards in the entire NFL. Curiously, Chargers coordinator Jesse Minter’s defense has seriously struggled when facing teams that can efficiently run the ball. When they were on the road against Jacksonville, or even facing a team like the pre-collapse Colts, we saw the limitations of their defense against those types of teams.

But New England hasn’t really had a consistent running game at any point this year. It has hit some big plays but is mediocre on a down-to-down basis. The Patriots will unleash Maye as a passer, and they’ll score points, but Justin Herbert should be able to match him against a considerably vulnerable secondary.

The Chargers’ offensive line is their biggest liability due to the injuries, but it’s not like the Patriots have an elite pass rush to exploit this. New England finished the regular season right around league average in pressure rate (12th overall, 15th in the second half of the season).

Verdict: Bet Chargers +3.5 (–110) and over 46 points (–110)

Houston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers (+3)

The market opened with the Texans as a 2.5-point favorite on Sunday after Tyler Loop’s field goal sailed wide right. It jumped straight to three overnight, and the Texans peaked as a 3.5-point favorite before it settled into its current position.

The Steelers’ recent playoff performances have been shambolic, but there is a huge gap between the 2022 Chiefs, 2023 Bills, and 2024 Ravens and this version of the Houston Texans. The Steelers usually limp into the playoffs and draw a vastly superior foe with an elite quarterback and an excellent offense that can expose the limitations of the Steelers’ defensive scheme. That’s not the case with Houston’s inconsistent offense that still has issues keeping C.J. Stroud clean in the pocket. Pittsburgh has struggled against quality run games, too. Houston doesn’t have that at all. Even though Woody Marks has given them some more juice out of the backfield at times this season, the Texans finished the year 30th in rushing success rate.

Pittsburgh’s offense allows the lowest pressure rate in the NFL because Aaron Rodgers is getting rid of the ball so fast that the opposing pass rush can’t really get there in time. As a result, Rodgers also has the lowest average depth of target in the NFL. The Texans are the best pass defense overall, and that’s also true for passes within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage. Houston plays so aggressively downhill that the door is cracked open for Rodgers to leverage that against them and create an explosive play or two. Otherwise, it’s really hard to see Pittsburgh sustaining long and methodical drives in this game, but maybe it can hit enough big plays with the return of DK Metcalf to keep this game competitive. Personally, I think it will.

Davis’ left hand injury reduces the odds the Mavericks are able to move him before Feb. 5, which could force Dallas to resume its efforts to trade him this summer.
Even before Davis hurt his left hand, there were concerns throughout the league about his long history of durability issues.","The Dallas Mavericks are likely to be without Anthony Davis for several weeks, at a minimum, after he suffered ligament damage in his left hand in Thursday’s game against the Utah Jazz, a league source told The Athletic.

In a statement, the team announced that Davis is “currently seeking multiple opinions” after medical imaging revealed the diagnosis. Davis is expected to meet with a hand specialist, the league source told The Athletic. It’s unclear if Davis will need surgery but he is expected to miss extended time even if he decides a non-surgical route to recovery is best.

Davis, 32, was injured Thursday while trying to prevent Utah Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen from driving to the basket. Davis’ left hand got scrunched up against Markkanen’s body. As Davis exited the floor, he doubled over in pain.

Before Davis’ latest injury, the Mavericks were actively exploring the trade market for him. The Athletic reported earlier this week that the Atlanta Hawks and the Toronto Raptors were two of the teams that had registered interest in him. Davis’ left hand injury reduces the odds the Mavericks are able to move him before Feb. 5, which could force Dallas to resume its efforts to trade him this summer.

Davis, whom the Mavericks acquired in the Luka Dončić trade last February, has played in 31 games in Dallas while missing 42 games. He missed close to six weeks last season with a left adductor strain, then was out for most of November of this season while he recovered from a left calf strain. He is owed $58.5 million next season and holds a $62.8 million player option in 2027-28.

Even before Davis hurt his left hand, there were concerns throughout the league about his long history of durability issues. He has played in at least 70 games just once in the previous eight seasons.

The Mavericks, who were forced to play the final 2:08 of Thursday’s game without Davis, lost 116-114, falling to 14-24 this season. They are in 11th place in the Western Conference as the midpoint of the regular season approaches. Dallas controls its 2026 first-round pick but doesn’t have outright control of its first-round pick again until 2031.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/09165355/GettyImages-2254730377-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-10 04:59:08.357743

Honestly, A, if you're a fan of parity in the NFL, this is the NFL playoffs for you because, as you said, it's wide open this year.
MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.
MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.
That's Martenzie Johnson from ESPN and Andscape, talking about the NFL playoffs that kick off tomorrow.","A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

NFL playoffs kick off tomorrow, with really no team looking like a lock to make their way to Santa Clara, California's Super Bowl 60. Let's get into it with Martenzie Johnson of ESPN and Andscape. So, Martenzie, I mean, what are you looking at in this playoffs, which, to me, looks wide open for the first time in a while?

MARTENZIE JOHNSON: Yeah. Honestly, A, if you're a fan of parity in the NFL, this is the NFL playoffs for you because, as you said, it's wide open this year. And it's because of one reason, A, and one reason only - the Kansas City Chiefs did not make the playoffs.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. They're the big - they've been, like, this big wall that every team has had to go through to try and, you know, win a Super Bowl and they've always seemed to, like, shut everyone down. So, like, it's weird. The team that's not in the playoffs is the team that everyone's kind of looking at.

JOHNSON: Yeah, exactly. But if you want to talk about the teams that are in the playoffs, there's two I'm looking at, specifically. Neither of which is the No.1 seed - Denver Broncos or the Seattle Seahawks. It's actually the Philadelphia Eagles, who are the defending champions. We're talking about the Chiefs, but the Eagles did win the Super Bowl last year. And on the other side, the Buffalo Bills, who, I believe, are the 6 seed.

And they've always run into that buzzsaw of either the Kansas City Chiefs or the Baltimore Ravens. But lucky enough for Josh Allen...

MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).

JOHNSON: ...He doesn't have to worry about either of those teams this year. So this is why I think this is finally the year for the Bills. Unfortunately, for the Bills, Josh Allen has a leg injury that prevented him from playing in the last week of the season.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.

JOHNSON: But beyond that, I still like the Bills.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And you know what? That leads right into the next thing I was going to ask you, Martenzie, because the two quarterbacks that have the most to prove are probably Josh Allen of the Bills and also Jalen Hurts of the Eagles because, like, to get into that elite tier of, like, Mahomes and Brady, Jalen Hurts has to win multiple Super Bowls. He's got one in the books. He needs another.

JOHNSON: Yeah. And Jalen, if you've watched the Eagles, then you know he hasn't looked great.

MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).

JOHNSON: In fact, he's had two games...

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.

JOHNSON: ...This season, A, where he didn't complete a pass in the second half. That's unheard of for the NFL where passing is a premium. That's all they want to do.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.

JOHNSON: But the Eagles have one of the best defenses in the league and they still have Saquon Barkley. They still have A.J. Brown. They still have DeVonta Smith. So he might have not looked good in the regular season, but I've seen Jalen Hurts in two Super Bowls playing against those same Chiefs that we're talking about and he has looked excellent. So he might not good - might not look good in the regular season, but I trust that man when it comes to the playoffs.

MARTÍNEZ: All right. So the Eagles and Bills are your two teams getting to the Super Bowl. Like, if you had to pick, like, a dark horse team, none of those two teams, some - another team that might make a run, what team would it be? Please say Chargers. Please say Chargers. Please say Chargers. Please say Chargers (laughter).

JOHNSON: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, A.

MARTÍNEZ: You know how many times I've heard I'm sorry from people I've asked that question?

(CROSSTALK)

JOHNSON: And that's one of the reasons why. They don't have a offensive line. But I'm going to say the Houston Texans...

MARTÍNEZ: Oh, wow.

JOHNSON: ...Which might be a surprise to some, because if you watched the early part of the season, you saw that they started off two and four. They lost their quarterback, C.J. Stroud, for a couple games due to a concussion. But, A, out of nowhere, they won 10 of their last 11 games...

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.

JOHNSON: ...Nine of their last games. They have one of the best defenses in the league. And their quarterback, which you want in a quarterback, A, he does not turn the ball over, in C.J. Stroud. And Nico Collins, a wide receiver, he's not a household name but he's one of the best in the NFL.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And if the Texans do win that game that's against the Steelers, that could be Aaron Rodgers' last game in the NFL. I mean, he's always kind of talking about it being the last game and that might be the last one, if indeed, he loses that one. We'll see, though. That one's going to be a good one. All right. That's Martenzie Johnson from ESPN and Andscape, talking about the NFL playoffs that kick off tomorrow. Martenzie, thanks a lot.

JOHNSON: Thank you, A.

Star right tackle Lane Johnson is expected to return after missing seven games with a foot sprain.

In contrast, the San Francisco 49ers are dealing with significant injuries to several key players.

PHILADELPHIA − An entire regular season was building for this point as the Eagles begin their playoff run with an NFC Wild Card Playoff Game against the 49ers on Jan. 11.

That's because unlike their counterparts, the Eagles are rested and almost healthy.

Star right tackle Lane Johnson is listed as questionable to play on the Eagles' final injury report of the week after missing seven games with a foot sprain. He was listed as a limited participant in practice all three days this week.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

""Obviously, Lane's a phenomenal football player,"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. ""So anytime he's on the field, you are pumped about that. He's continuing to grind through and he's a warrior. He does everything he can possibly do to be out there with us.""

The rest of the starting offensive line had a much-needed pseudo bye week in the regular-season finale against the Commanders on Jan. 4, despite the 24-17 loss that cost the Eagles the No. 2 seed, and thus a second-round home game if the seedings hold through the first round.

Still, is that more important than being healthy going into the playoffs?

In this case, assuming Johnson plays, the Eagles will have 21 out of 22 starters available against the 49ers, the only absentee being rookie safety Drew Mukuba, who broke his fibula against the Dallas Cowboys on Nov. 23 and is on injured reserve.

That's not an accident, especially against the 49ers, who could be missing several key players.

""At the end of the day as a head coach, you have to make sure you're doing the things to make sure your guys are fresh while also making sure they're ready for that football game, and making sure that their skills are being sharpened and ironed out every single day of the week,"" Sirianni said. ""There's always a balance with that.""

That includes the players who aren't injured, specifically quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley.

Both have had a lighter workload this season, whether that's by design or the way games have played out, as Sirianni has said often. Still, Hurts has clearly run less than he has in the past, with only 421 yards on 105 carries. His previous career lows for a full season were 605 yards (2023) and 139 carries (2021).

Barkley, meanwhile, had 317 touches during the regular season compared with 378 last season. Barkley's counterpart on the 49ers, Christian McCaffrey, led the NFL in touches with 413 this season.

Barkley's production dipped from rushing for 2,005 yards in 2024 to 1,140 this season. Then again, he did appear to get stronger as the season went along. Barkley went from averaging 3.3 yards per carry in the first seven games, to 4.7 in the last nine games that he played in.

""I’m excited to get the run game going,"" Barkley said. ""But the most important thing is winning football, and however it looks. That’s the best thing about the playoffs. If we win every game the way we won against Buffalo (13-12 on Dec. 28), no one is going to care.

""No one is going to feel like we didn’t do enough on offense. ... That’s my favorite thing about the playoffs − stats don’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning the game, and I’m excited about that.""

It's a different story for the 49ers. They were already without their two best defensive players in edge rusher Nick Bosa and linebacker Fred Warner, and star left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall missed the Jan. 4 game against Seattle.

And the 49ers had to play their starters in that game in hopes of getting the No. 1 seed. The 49ers lost linebacker Tatum Bethune for the season and could be without his counterpart in Dee Winters, both injured during the Seahawks game.

Williams, Pearsall and Winters were all listed as questionable for the game. Pearsall didn’t practice at all this week.

As for Johnson's possible return, these were his first practices since he suffered the Lisfranc sprain on Nov. 16 against the Detroit Lions.

Johnson, of course, is considered one of the top tackles in the NFL. And his presence allows the Eagles to expand their blocking schemes, which should open up holes for Barkley to run through, and create more time for Hurts to pass or enable him to find a crease to run himself.

""You guys know Lane. Everybody knows Lane. He’s a Hall of Famer; he’s a stud,"" center Cam Jurgens said. ""That speaks for itself, and having him back in the room is just awesome from his personality. He makes the room a little lighter. We love having him in there. He means so much to us.""

Eagles injury report

The Eagles also listed OL Brett Toth (concussion) and OLB Azeez Ojulari (hamstring) as questionable. Ojulari is still on injured reserve, so if he returns, the Eagles would need to free up a roster spot.","https://www.delawareonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/25/PWIL/87468998007-usatsi-17412742-168394616-lowres.jpg?crop=1737,977,x0,y0&width=1737&height=977&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-09 22:58:11.611097

With the Packers being philosophically run first, the target tree gets pruned plenty, depending on game flow. Wicks wouldn’t enough work to be a safe play in most fantasy games, but his absence does make it a little easier to use Jayden Reed and Bo Melton in DFS games, but it probably doesn’t move the needle all that much.",https://platform.sbnation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2249081933.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.737486874974%2C100%2C78.525026250052&w=1200,N,,2026-01-09 22:58:14.466668

Tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle), cornerback Renardo Green (foot), defensive end Keion White (groin), linebacker Luke Gifford (quad), linebacker Dee Winters (ankle) and receiver Jacob Cowing (hamstring) were all listed as questionable, coach Kyle Shanahan announced Friday.

“We’re going to Round 1 of the playoffs, playing as good of football as we can, being as prepared as we can and cutting it loose for three and a half hours,” a terse Shanahan said when asked about the mood of the team while dealing with the injuries.

Some of those injuries loom large for the 49ers, who hit the road to play the Eagles, 1:25 p.m. Pacific in Philadelphia. The 49ers had a chance at the No. 1 seed, which would’ve given them a first-round bye and an extra week to heal up, had they been able to defeat the Seattle Seahawks last Saturday at Levi’s Stadium.

Instead, the 49ers played their worst offensive game of the season and dropped to the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoffs.

Trent Williams

Williams practiced Thursday and Friday after straining his hamstring on the first offensive snap of the Week 17 win over the Chicago Bears, as he tried to chase down Bears linebacker T.J. Edwards during his pick-six.

Williams missed the finale against the Seahawks but was listed as a limited participant during the final two sessions of the week.

Ricky Pearsall

Pearsall, who missed six games in the middle of the season with a knee injury, didn’t practice this week after missing the season finale against Seattle while being listed with knee and ankle injuries. He missed two of the last three games, and appeared to aggravate the injury against the Bears during his five-catch, 85-yard performance. The 2024 first-round draft pick was among the league leaders in yards per catch (16.4) during his four games before the initial knee injury.

Shanahan said Pearsall still has a chance to play Sunday despite not practicing at all this week.

Renardo Green, Dee Winters and others

Green, who missed Weeks 16 and 17 with a neck injury, landed on the injury report with a foot issue that came up during Friday’s practice.

“He zinged something today,” Shanahan said.

If Green can’t go, Darrell Luter Jr. would likely be the top option to replace him.

White has appeared in all nine games since the 49ers acquired him in a trade with the New England Patriots in late October. He’s played 57% of the snaps while replacing Nick Bosa and first-round draft pick Mykel Williams on the edges of the 49ers’ defensive line.

If Winters can’t play, the 49ers could be forced to rely on players they added late in the season. Veteran Eric Kendricks, who signed Dec. 22, could play “Mike” linebacker next to Garrett Wallow, who was added Dec. 8.

Kyzir White could also be in the mix after signing to the practice squad on Wednesday. He could be elevated to the active roster in time for Sunday’s game.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/9g5o4c/picture314267796/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/2244760763-GI.JPG,N,,2026-01-10 00:13:50.088693

Asked whether Pearsall and Winters would have been ruled out for a non-playoff game, Niners coach Kyle Shanahan demurred on Friday afternoon.
Receiver Jacob Cowing, who opened his practice window this week, is also listed as questionable but will not be activated for Sunday, according to Shanahan.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Despite a handful of key players battling injury this week, the San Francisco 49ers did not rule any of them out in advance of Sunday's NFC wild-card showdown against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Left tackle Trent Williams (right hamstring), receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle) and linebacker Dee Winters (ankle) are among six Niners on the active roster that the team is listing as questionable for Sunday. Linebacker Luke Gifford (quad), defensive lineman Keion White (groin) and cornerback Renardo Green (foot) are the others.

Not all questionable designations are created equal, however. Williams, who injured his hamstring on the first offensive snap of a Dec. 28 win against the Chicago Bears and didn't play last week against the Seattle Seahawks, appeared to be trending in the right direction this week.

Williams did not practice on Wednesday but was a limited participant on Thursday and Friday. On the other side of that, Pearsall and Winters did not participate in any of the practices this week. Williams told reporters Friday he will be a game time decision but is ""confident"" he will play Sunday.

Pearsall was also injured in the Chicago game and did not play against Seattle. Winters sustained his injury against the Seahawks.

Asked whether Pearsall and Winters would have been ruled out for a non-playoff game, Niners coach Kyle Shanahan demurred on Friday afternoon.

""I don't know,"" Shanahan said. ""It's a big hypothetical. Last week wasn't a playoff game, and I didn't look at it any different. I would say there's no difference in last week and this week.""

Like Williams, White also appeared to progress as the week went on. He didn't practice on Wednesday or Thursday but was limited on Friday. Gifford and Green went the opposite direction as Gifford participated on Wednesday but not Thursday or Friday and Green was added to the injury report Friday with a foot issue.

The uncertainty on the injury front could leave the 49ers particularly thin at linebacker. San Francisco already placed Tatum Bethune, the replacement for middle linebacker Fred Warner (ankle), on injured reserve earlier this week with a torn groin. If Winters and Gifford can't play, the Niners would likely start veteran Eric Kendricks and Garret Wallow against the Eagles.

Kendricks joined the Niners on Nov. 26 while the team claimed Wallow off waivers on Dec. 8. Veteran linebacker Kyzir White, who signed to the practice squad earlier this week, is also expected to be available with Curtis Robinson the only other healthy option on the active roster. Jalen Graham is another option to be elevated from the practice squad.

Shanahan said the lack of healthy linebackers could force the Niners to make multiple roster moves on Saturday beyond the two standard practice squad elevations.

""Depending on how that goes, we would possibly have to do that,"" Shanahan said. ""You're only allowed to have two elevations, so if we needed more than that, we'd have to make a roster move.""

While Shanahan said Monday that a potential Warner return wouldn't come until the NFC Championship Game at the earliest, Warner was seen doing some work on the side this week for the first time since fracturing his right ankle in Week 6. Shanahan said he hasn't yet been told that Warner could open his 21-day practice window next week if the Niners were able to beat Philadelphia.

Receiver Jacob Cowing, who opened his practice window this week, is also listed as questionable but will not be activated for Sunday, according to Shanahan.

Now, the 49ers will wait and see how their long flight to Philadelphia goes before making final determinations on their injured players. After playing three games in 13 days, Shanahan said having a full week of preparation plus an extra day (the Niners played Seattle last Saturday), was beneficial.

""I think it really added up,"" Shanahan said. ""Seeing the players on Wednesday, we all kind of joked that it felt like we just came back from a bye week because it kind of did. It was our first time having a normal routine in about three weeks and just getting away for a little bit. I think guys felt much more rested as the previous three.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0711%2Fr1357459_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 23:58:49.153312

Bills at Jaguars (1 p.m.
49ers at Eagles (4:30 p.m.","The 2025 NFL playoffs kick off with a six-game slate as part of NFL Super Wild Card Weekend. The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos secured first-round byes as the top seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively, and 12 other teams will be fighting to advance to the Divisional Round next week. Many teams were able to rest starters in Week 18 to get healthy for the playoffs, but there are still some notable injuries that bettors should keep in mind for these six wild card games. Here, we break down those injuries as well as the latest NFL betting lines from DraftKings Sportsbook. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Rams at Panthers (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)

LAR WR Davante Adams (quad, will play)

Despite missing three games to close out the year, star Rams receiver Davante Adams led the NFL in receiving touchdowns with 14. Los Angeles dropped two of those three games without Adams to fall out of the race for the NFC West and No. 1 seed in the conference. Now, Adams will return for Saturday's matchup with the Panthers, who beat Los Angeles 31-28 in Carolina at the end of November.

Los Angeles is a 10.5-point favorite. The total is 45.5.

Packers at Bears (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)

GB QB Jordan Love (concussion, will play)

GB QB Malik Willis (shoulder and hamstring, questionable)

GB WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion, out)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, will play)

The Packers get Jordan Love back after he was banged up to close out the year, though his backup, Malik Willis, is questionable to suit up behind him. Additionally, receiver Dontayvion Wicks is out for Green Bay after a 332-yard season. As for Chicago, the Bears will get receiver Rome Odunze back after a foot injury cost him considerable time late in the season. Odunze missed the final five games of 2025 after tallying 661 yards and six touchdowns over 12 games.

Green Bay is a slight 1.5-point favorite on the road here, and the total is 44.5.

Bills at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET, Sunday)

BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, will play)

BUFF RB Ty Johnson (ankle, questionable)

This matchup sees the No. 1 rushing offense in the Bills face off with the Jaguars' No. 1-ranked run defense. That will be a key matchup to watch, and Buffalo receiving back Ty Johnson is questionable. He had 263 receiving yards and five total touchdowns as the backup to NFL rushing leader James Cook. The good news for the Bills is Josh Allen's favorite target is back, as tight end Dalton Kincaid is off the injury report after missing considerable time with a nagging knee injury.

Buffalo is a 1.5-point road favorite. And at 51.5, this total is the highest of the entire six-game Wild Card Weekend slate.

49ers at Eagles (4:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)

SF OT Trent Williams (hamstring, questionable)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, questionable)

After missing nearly half of the season, star Philadelphia right tackle Lane Johnson appears to be on track to return to the lineup on Sunday as he practiced this week and is listed as questionable. The 49ers are also hoping to get their star tackle back as left tackle Trent Williams is questionable after missing Week 18. Second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is also questionable. He's missed eight games in 2025.

The Eagles are -6 on the spread and the total is 44.5.

Chargers at Patriots (8 p.m. ET, Sunday)

LAC RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, questionable)

NE WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring, questionable)

The Chargers have been utterly decimated by injuries on offense this year, particularly at running back and offensive line. Star rookie back Omarion Hampton missed eight games this year but still compiled 737 scrimmage yards and five touchdowns in nine games. He's questionable for this contest with an ankle injury, though he told reporters he expects to play on Sunday. As for the Patriots, explosive receiver Kayshon Boutte is questionable. He cooled off after a three-week stretch with four touchdowns, but Boutte can take the tops off of defenses for Drake Maye.

New England is favored by 3.5 points. The total is 45.5.

Texans at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

PITT RB Jaylen Warren (illness, TBD)

The final injury report for this Monday showdown doesn't come out until Saturday, but one big name who missed practice this week is Steelers starting running back Jaylen Warren. Warren is dealing with an illness, per the report, which is likely a better sign than a different injury. Warren had 958 rushing yards in his first full season as the Steelers' lead running back.

Houston is favored by 3-points. The total is 38.5 -- the lowest of the first round.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/09/df4cbc0c-03b2-4b5b-ba37-e863ffb135a9/thumbnail/1200x675/0268f50b718554674000b06327917327/omarion-hampton.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 20:01:09.194875

Here are the notable injury updates and the injury reports for each of the six playoff teams this weekend.

Bears WR Rome Odunze back for Packers game

Caleb Williams will get a weapon back for his first NFL playoff game, with Rome Odunze off the injury list and ready to return. The second-year wide receiver has been out since Week 13 with a foot injury.

“I’m planning on playing,” Odunze said Wednesday. “But I’ve been planning on playing for weeks.”

Odunze was the Bears' leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown receptions when he exited the lineup. He said Wednesday his stamina isn't fully back yet, but he's confident he can help.

""As long as I have the option to be out there and contribute, I’m going to give it my all,"" Odunze said. ""I believe I can make a difference.”

[NFL injury updates live]

Cornerback Kyler Gordon is also expected to play against the Green Bay Packers after missing the final five regular-season games with a groin issue. He is currently listed as ""questionable.""

""He looked good yesterday. We'll see what it looks like again today both him and Rome, you know,"" said head coach Ben Johnson. ""It's good to have them both back out there. They're excited. They're moving around well and we'll see if they can help us out this weekend.""

49ers LT Trent Williams hopeful to play

San Francisco 49ers left tackle Trent Williams was a limited participant during practice on Thursday and Friday, after sitting out on Wednesday with a hamstring injury he suffered in Week 17.

Williams usually rests on the first day of practice during a game week, but head coach Kyle Shanahan clarified that wasn't the case, saying the All-Pro was still hurt. Williams said Friday he's confident he can play on Sunday.

Receiver Ricky Pearsall did not practice Friday, but was spotted on a side field this week. Shanahan said Wednesday that Pearsall aggravated the PCL injury that has limited him this season during Week 17.

Lane Johnson questionable for Eagles

Lane Johnson (foot) has been listed as questionable for the Philadelphia Eagles' Sunday meeting with the San Francisco 49ers. Johnson was limited in practice this week after being out since Week 11 with a Lisfranc injury.

“Lane’s a big difference maker, and I know he is working crazy to get himself back, and we will see where that is this week,” head coach Nick Sirianni said this week. “But he’s a difference maker. … He’s one of the best that’s ever done it. I think I kind of get too much into scheme with that. But yeah, he allows you to do some different things.”

Allen won the FedEx Air award last year in addition to the Most Valuable Player Award. Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase was last year's FedEx Ground award winner.

Concussion protocol and an ankle injury had kept the starters off the field since Week 16 and Week 13, respectively.","The New England Patriots will be down one starter against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Nose tackle Khyiris Tonga has been ruled out for the wild card after staying sidelined for a third straight week due to a foot injury, head coach Mike Vrabel announced during his Friday press conference.

But elsewhere, wide receiver Kayshon Boutte, offensive tackle Thayer Munford Jr. and outside linebacker Harold Landry III all close in on the playoffs with questionable game statuses.

Here’s the final injury report ahead of Sunday’s 8 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.

Since sustaining a foot injury in December against the Baltimore Ravens, Tonga has been a non-participant for nine consecutive practices. A third matchup among the No. 2 seed’s inactives is ahead. The all-purpose defensive tackle’s inaugural campaign in Foxborough has brought 24 tackles along with a pair of stops for loss, a pair of quarterback hits and a pair of batted passes. He stands with 337 snaps on defense, 14 snaps on offense and 65 snaps on special teams.

Head coach Jim Harbaugh’s side has ruled out two and listed six others as questionable, including the reigning No. 22 overall pick from the University of North Carolina.

The Patriots added Boutte to the injury report midway through the week. The perimeter wideout, listed as a limited participant, previously missed two games in November because of a hamstring injury and finished the campaign with 33 catches for 551 yards and a career-high six touchdowns.

Additional questionable designations reside on the offensive line and off the edges. Munford, who has made two starts in jumbo sets and tallied 100 offensive snaps since rejoining the AFC East champions, sat out Thursday’s practice due to a knee issue. And Landry has continued to practice in a partial capacity due to a knee issue of his own. New England’s sack leader had been ruled out for back-to-back games to end the regular season before ramping up for the playoffs.

Rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson, who was not in attendance for Friday’s practice due to personal reasons, will go without a game designation versus the Chargers. The same green light goes for rookie left guard Jared Wilson and veteran inside linebacker Robert Spillane. Concussion protocol and an ankle injury had kept the starters off the field since Week 16 and Week 13, respectively. Returns are on deck after upgrading to full.

After receiving treatment on the pitch, Bradley was taken off on a stretcher and left the stadium on crutches with his left knee in a brace.
“I don’t know Gabriel Martinelli but he comes across as a nice guy,” Slot said in his post-match press conference.
But it doesn’t look great if Conor has the injury which we fear he might have.","Gabriel Martinelli is not expected to face further action from the Football Association after the Arsenal forward attempted to push injured Liverpool full-back Conor Bradley off the pitch during Thursday’s Premier League fixture.

Bradley, 22, landed awkwardly on the touchline as he tried to clear the ball in stoppage time of the 0-0 draw. He immediately appeared in physical pain and grabbed his knee as he fell to the ground. Martinelli, 24, dropped the ball on Bradley, who then shuffled slightly to ensure he was on the pitch. The Arsenal forward grabbed the Northern Ireland international by the shoulder and neck and pushed him back towards the touchline.

Martinelli was shown a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor. Given the incident was spotted by the on-field referee and action taken during the game, the Brazil international is not expected to face any retrospective disciplinary sanctions from English football’s governing body.

After receiving treatment on the pitch, Bradley was taken off on a stretcher and left the stadium on crutches with his left knee in a brace.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said at full time he would speak to Martinelli, who subsequently apologised on social media and stated he had not been aware of the severity of Bradley’s injury

“Knowing Gabi, if anybody knows Gabi, he’s an incredible, lovely guy, and probably he didn’t realise what happened,” Arteta told a post-match press conference. “I will have a word with him now to understand that, but probably he didn’t recognise what happened.”

The incident triggered a mass confrontation between the two teams and both Martinelli and Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate were shown yellow cards.

“Conor and l have messaged and l’ve already apologised to him,” Martinelli wrote on Instagram. “I really didn’t understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment.

“I want to say I’m deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.”

Liverpool head coach Arne Slot explained Bradley would undergo scans to determine the full extent of the injury but said he “fears the worst” for the right-back.

Slot also said he believed Martinelli did not realise the seriousness of Bradley’s injury and was sympathetic to the Arsenal player’s frustrations given how common time-wasting and feigning injury is in the latter stages of matches.

“I don’t know Gabriel Martinelli but he comes across as a nice guy,” Slot said in his post-match press conference.

“I think the problem for him is, and it’s a problem in general in football, that there is so much time-wasting and players pretending they are injured in the final parts of the game. You can then sometimes be annoyed if you want to score a goal that you think the player is time-wasting.

“I cannot ask of Gabriel Martinelli in the 94th minute when it’s so emotional for him to understand he is playing Liverpool – a team when we played Leeds and a player was held but didn’t go to the floor, or played West Ham United and my players try to drag (Lucas) Paqueta out of a situation where he was getting a second yellow card.

“I’m 100 per cent sure that if he knew what the injury might be that he would never do (what he did). But it doesn’t look great if Conor has the injury which we fear he might have.

“I think when we see the video we both probably think the same, but we have to wait on the scans if it’s that bad.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/08183630/GettyImages-2254687410.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-09 21:58:48.795839

Before perhaps one of the most unpredictable playoffs we've ever seen get underway, we'll have to account for injuries -- who is suiting up and who isn't for their respective teams -- this weekend. Every team playing in the wild card round, except for the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers who play on Monday night, has released their final injury report with game statuses. Let's take a look at who is in, who is out and whose status is still up in the air.

All wild card weekend NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.

Saturday

Los Angeles Rams at Carolina Panthers

Rams: G Kevin Dotson (ankle), WR Jordan Whittington (knee) OUT; TE Terrance Ferguson (hamstring), CB Josh Wallace (ankle) QUESTIONABLE

Panthers: G Chandler Zavala (calf) OUT

The visiting Los Angeles Rams will be without starting right guard Kevin Dotson (ankle) after he didn't practice all week. That's a big blow for the Rams as Dotson was Pro Football Focus' third-highest ranked guard in the NFL with an 86.4 offensive grade this season. Wide receiver Jordan Whittingham (knee) was also ruled out after not practicing all week.

The good news for the Rams is 2025 NFL receiving touchdowns leader Davante Adams, with 14 this season, is back after missing the last three games with a hamstring injury. Adams practiced fully all week and does not have a game status, meaning he is good to go. His eight career playoff receiving touchdowns are the most by an active NFL wide receiver.

Carolina Panthers guard Chandler Zavala (calf) was ruled out despite practicing fully all week.

Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears

Packers: WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion) OUT; S Javon Bullard (knee), DL Warren Brinson (foot), LB Nick Niemann (pectoral), RT Zach Tom (back/knee), QB Malik Willis (right shoulder/hamstring) QUESTIONABLE

The rest of the Packers' questionable players -- safety Javon Bullard (knee), defensive lineman Warren Brinson, linebacker Nick Niemann (pectoral) and quarterback Malik Willis (right shoulder/hamstring) -- with the exception of right tackle Zach Tom (back/knee) were limited practice participants all week. Tom practiced in a limited fashion on Tuesday and Wednesday before being given a rest day by head coach Matt LaFleur on Thursday.

The host Chicago Bears will be without three players because of concussions after all three didn't practice at all this week: safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson, linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga and edge rusher Joe Tryon-Shoyinka. Two players who have been on injured reserve, left tackle Braxton Jones (knee) and cornerback Kyler Gordon (groin), are attempting to come back off of injured reserve and are listed as questionable. Jones practiced fully this week while Gordon was limited on Tuesday and Wednesday before practicing fully on Thursday.

Jaguars: LT Cole Van Lanen (knee) QUESTIONABLE

The Bills ruled out both linebacker Terrel Bernard (calf) and cornerback Maxwell Hairston (ankle) after they each didn't practice all week.

Philadelphia Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson (foot) is questionable after being a limited practice participant all week. Edge rusher Azeez Ojulari (hamstring) is questionable after practicing fully all week, and offensive lineman Brett Toth (concussion) is questionable after practicing for the first time this week on Friday in a limited fashion.

Los Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots

Ironically, with San Francisco so injured throughout the season, McCaffrey was a steady force available for all 17 games.","The 2025 NFL regular season was a wild one, and the award debates are no different. These are my picks for awards, from Most Valuable Player to Coach of the Year. As is clear, I don’t care if people—many who might not even watch the games and/or will stat watch or use borderline meaningless things like EPA—think any of these picks are “out there.”

MVP: Bo Nix, Broncos

2025 NFL MVP is going to Matthew Stafford or Drake Maye. No doubt they had excellent seasons. But Broncos quarterback Bo Nix is my pick. I went in depth with my reasoning here if you have time for a 10-minute YouTube video, but to sum:

First, Nix’s 2025 season actually stacks up nicely with Lamar Jackson’s 2023 MVP campaign:

And keep in mind that Jackson had a stronger supporting cast—plus the No. 1 defense in football. For as high-upside as the Broncos defense is, especially in terms of sacking the quarterback, I think it’s fair to say that Baltimore’s unit under Mike Macdonald (which took the ball away twice as much) was a better group.

Stafford had two costly performances in losses to the Panthers and Falcons, and MVP winners very rarely come from teams that didn’t win the division (granted, the NFC West uncommonly stacked).

Maye played one of the easiest schedules in NFL history—with just one win over a team with a winning record and a bad performance with two turnovers and five sacks taken in the only non-Bills matchup with a winning team (the Steelers).

There were no such performances from Nix where it cost his team. Some games might not have had the prettiest passing numbers. For example, take Week 18, when the Bronco secured the No. 1 seed. Sean Payton and company knew they would dominate defensively, so there was no need for the offense to try to light up the scoreboard. Nix played smart football, keeping some drives moving with his legs in a game he was under a lot more pressure than you’d expect. Being the least sacked quarterback in the league has more to do with his play than anything.

But when Nix was needed—like lighting up the Packers, or picking up the defense when it couldn’t get off the field at Washington, or when he helped put up 33 fourth-quarter points in an insane comeback versus the Giants in a game the other side of the ball mostly struggled—he came through.

In wins over the Eagles, Texans, Chiefs (once when Patrick Mahomes played), and Packers, the second-year quarterback stepped up his game and played like a clear Most Valuable Player.

Nix had seven game-winning drives total, including five fourth-quarter comebacks.

Stafford and Maye had one game-winning drive each. That’s certainly not some determining factor for MVP—not even close. But it speaks to the value Nix brought to his team in 2025.

This is the criteria for Most Valuable Player: “The award honors a player who had the most valuable season.”

It’s not about, “if this player would’ve been here” or “this player has the best stats.” It’s the player who had the most valuable season, and Nix has a strong case while helping Denver win 14 games, taking the AFC West and the AFC’s top seed.

If this was a few decades ago, I bet Nix would be getting legitimate MVP talk. But the ultra-negative sports media machine isn’t going to let that happen this quickly after they said the guy couldn’t play over the past year-plus.

Unfortunately, dominant mainstream and consensus groupthink would paint the idea of Bo Nix as the NFL MVP as a complete joke. They said the same thing when Josh Allen was playing like an MVP earlier in his career, remaining in constant denial until he kept up that level of play year after year before finally winning MVP last season.

Offensive Player of the Year: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks

Stepping up as the clear No. 1 wide receiver in Seattle, Jaxon Smith-Njigba posted a monstrous 119/1,793/10 line for the No. 1 seed in the conference. The scorching start to the season, when it looked like Calvin Johnson’s single-season record was at serious risk of being broken, set the tone—and he didn’t slow up much from there. JSN had at least both four receptions and 72 yards in every game except for one (a 26-0 win over the Vikings when the offense didn’t have to do a ton), breaking out as undoubtedly one of the top weapons in football. The speed and pace which Smith-Njigba runs his routes allows him to get open and do serious damage to opposing secondaries, as he did all 2025.

Defensive Player of the Year: Myles Garrett, Browns

This one needs little explanation, with Myles Garrett breaking the single-season sack record with 23.0. While he was going to be Defensive Player of the Year regardless, the Browns star certainly cut it close—getting shut out in Week 17 before finally breaking the record in the final minutes of the Week 18 win against the Bengals. The former No. 1 overall pick commands rare attention from opposing offenses, so to still be able to finish plays with sacks as much as he does is super impressive.

Offensive Rookie of the Year: Harold Fannin Jr., Browns

There are several players who had Offensive Rookie of the Year type of seasons, but I don’t understand why Harold Fannin Jr. isn’t getting more recognition for the year he had. From the jump, Fannin was a versatile, productive piece for Cleveland—displaying the skillset that made him a steal in the third round. Fannin caught a pass in all 16 games (he missed Week 18 due to injury), was the difference in his final game with a touchdown catch in the Browns’ upset win over the Steelers, and ended with 72 receptions for 731 yards and six touchdowns as a tight end—along with another score on the ground. It was extremely close between Tetairoa McMillan, who hit 1,000 yards receiving, and Fannin for my ultimate selection; but I opt for the consistency of Fannin.

Defensive Rookie of the Year: James Pearce Jr., Falcons

Respectfully, this award might speak to how media narratives and groupthink take over, with the voters going overwhelmingly for Browns rookie linebacker Carson Schwesinger, who racked up 156 total tackles, 2.5 sacks, and two interceptions in Jim Schwartz’s defense. But James Pearce Jr.’s rookie campaign is being totally discounted, probably in part because many of the narrative drivers thought the Falcons were dumb for trading their 2026 first-round pick to draft him. Pearce had 10.5 sacks for Atlanta, becoming the first rookie to do so since Micah Parsons—and the 37th rookie in history with double-digit sacks. The Tennessee product was explosive off the edge getting pressure and finishing at the quarterback for an Atlanta defense that showed major flashes of top-level play when at their best—and Pearce along with fellow rookies Jalon Walker and Xavier Watts boosted them.

Comeback Player of the Year: Christian McCaffrey, 49ers

Comeback Player of the Year has other options like Dak Prescott and Aidan Hutchinson (and even Philip Rivers given that return to the field after five years), but Christian McCaffrey had his 2024 season totally derailed by injury—and he bounced back to play every game while handling 413 touches for the 49ers. Ironically, with San Francisco so injured throughout the season, McCaffrey was a steady force available for all 17 games. He ran for 1,202 yards and 10 touchdowns while adding 102 receptions for 924 yards and seven receiving scores. CMC is the Comeback Player of the Year.

Coach of the Year: Mike Macdonald, Seahawks

This was the most difficult award to pick in my opinion, with all of Ben Johnson (winning the stacked NFC North in Year 1 is highly impressive), Kyle Shanahan (12 wins with all those injuries), Mike Vrabel (taking the Pats from one of the worst records in the league to 14 wins), Liam Coen (immediately getting the Jags to play his style of ball and go 13-4 while winning the AFC South), and Sean Payton (toppling the Chiefs in a division that also includes the Chargers, and with a somewhat limited supporting cast on offense and the J.K.

Johnson was limited for all three practices this week. The team probably would’ve liked to see him get at least one full session in. Lane might start at right tackle anyway but it doesn’t seem like a lock at the moment. The expectation is that’ll try to play at less than 100%. If he can’t go or has to leave the game early, it’ll be Fred Johnson in his place once again.

Toth missed practice on Wednesday and Thursday before being upgraded to limited participation on Friday. There’s a chance he could clear concussion protocol in time to play on Sunday. If he’s not cleared, the Eagles will be without their top backup at the interior offensive line positions. Matt Pryor and Drew Kendall will move up the depth chart in that case.

The Eagles opened Ojulari’s 21-day practice window to return from injured reserve earlier this week but there’s no indication they’re in a rush to activate him to the roster when they already have ample edge rusher depth.

Carter and Goedert were notably upgraded to full go on Friday after being limited on Wednesday and Thursday.

The Eagles have until 4:00 PM Eastern on Saturday to temporarily elevate up to two players from the practice squad to play on Sunday. Long snapper Charley Hughlett will be one of those elevations.

Smith unexpectedly retired from football on October 13. Alexander was placed on this list on November 12.

The Eagles opened Ojulari’s 21-day practice window to return from IR on January 7. Mukuba is eligible to return from IR but presumably not healthy enough to play. Practice windows to return from IR were previously opened for Lampkin and Hinton but the Eagles did not activate them before they closed, thus ending their seasons. BVS, Wilson, and Okoronkwo suffered season-ending injuries.

Seems to me like San Francisco is trying to lean into competitive advantage by being as vague as possible with their injury report.

Williams was limited for the second day in a row. 49ers reporters noted he was working off to the side, away from the team’s other offensive linemen. Seems like he might try to play but it might be a stretch. The point spread for this game opening at Eagles -3 and moving to Eagles -6 suggests Williams might not play.

Pearsall did not participate in practice this week. It’s pretty rare for players to play after not practicing at all leading up to the game. Guessing he won’t suit up, which hurts the 49ers’ offense.

Winters also did not participate in practice this week. Gifford was limited on Wednesday but missed practice on Thursday and Friday. With that in mind, it looks like the 49ers will start Eric Kendricks and Garret Wallow at off-ball linebacker. Two players who’ve barely played at all this season.

Green was unexpectedly added to Friday’s report with a foot injury. Would be tough for an already banged up Niners defense to lose a starting CB on short notice.

White was upgraded to limited on Friday. He might be able to suit up.

Cowing was full go in practice all week so he might be activated from injured reserve to help make up for the potential Pearsall absence.",https://platform.bleedinggreennation.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2026/01/imagn-26690309.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.743314999773%2C100%2C78.513370000455&w=1200,N,,2026-01-09 18:02:38.286172

The Jaguars are a good team, but the Bills should move on and secure their first road playoff win since McDermott arrived.","The Buffalo Bills will have an opportunity for a full-circle NFL playoff moment Sunday when they take on the Jacksonville Jaguars on the road in the AFC’s wild-card round.

EverBank Stadium was where the Bills played their first postseason game after breaking the infamous 17-year playoff drought. This is also the first time they’ve played the Jaguars in the playoffs since that fateful day in 2017, a Bills loss.

If ever there was a place for them to win their first road playoff game under coach Sean McDermott, it’s Jacksonville. But to do that, they’ll need their best assets ready to go.

Buffalo’s injuries have dictated its season. Injuries are never an excuse, and they happen to every team, but the Bills have been going through it this season. According to Sports Info Solutions, Buffalo had the third-highest number of games missed due to injury in 2025, with 297, and they are atop the AFC rankings. For context, that is almost double what the Jaguars have incurred this year (150).

Injuries during games were common, but the less common scenarios were what caused frustration. There was the pregame calf injury for defensive tackle DaQuan Jones that left the Bills short-handed against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 6. Not to mention all the mid- and late-week practice injuries the Bills had to contend with during the season that wound up costing players at least a game or two.

There wasn’t a single day during the 2025 regular season when the Bills had all 53 members of their active roster available and practicing. Out of a possible 34 practice squad elevations to get through the game, the Bills used 33.

The defense has been the most impacted, by far. One of its star players, Ed Oliver, played in only three games this year and remains on injured reserve. The Bills lost key rotational pass rusher Michael Hoecht after just two highly impactful games to a season-ending torn Achilles tendon. And though the Bills haven’t incurred many other season-altering injuries, adding up all the little stuff has impacted their progress.

The only defensive tackle who didn’t miss at least one game due to injury or suspension was rookie Deone Walker. The Bills were without Oliver for 14 games, Jones missed four and rookie T.J. Sanders missed five, and those are just the main ones.

At linebacker, Terrel Bernard missed five games, and Matt Milano and Shaq Thompson missed four — none occurred in the same game.

The defensive backs saw top cornerback Christian Benford miss two games and nickel corner Taron Johnson miss three. Safeties Taylor Rapp and Damar Hamlin had their regular seasons end in October, and even Jordan Poyer missed two games to end the regular season.

But as the Bills get closer to the postseason, things are looking up for the first time in a long time on the injury front.

Although Oliver isn’t returning this week, the Bills are talking like he’s getting close. And though they didn’t give a target date, the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter by the day. The Bills opened the 21-day practice window for Hamlin, their reserve safety, and even if it isn’t this week, Hamlin could be back into a special teams role before long.

On top of those, all of the recent injuries that cost players games are looking up.

Poyer, who became an indispensable part of the starting lineup when he took over in Week 8, missed the last two games with a hamstring injury. Poyer certainly seemed optimistic about his chances to play, and that’s putting it lightly.

“I feel good. I feel ready to go. I feel ready to play. I’m excited to play,” Poyer told The Athletic.

Jones, a key defensive starter all season, has also missed the last two games after aggravating a calf injury from earlier in the year. Though he wasn’t as outright in saying he’d be playing Sunday, there was a certain insinuation.

“Listen, if we had a game that we had to play to continue our season, I’m playing in ’em,” Jones told The Athletic on Wednesday. “It was just really for rest — make sure I’m good to go for, you know, the game that truly mattered at this point.”

Tight end Dalton Kincaid appears to be following the same track as last week, as he was limited all week before playing against the New York Jets. When Kincaid is healthy and in the lineup, he is vital to the passing attack.

Heck, even the kicker situation is looking up. Matt Prater aggravated a quad injury that cost him two games, and it forced the Bills to sign kicker Matthew Wright to the practice squad just in case. However, Prater was a full participant Thursday, which is a positive sign.

Even if Prater can’t go, the Bills will at least have a kicker in Wright, who has had a good record in Jacksonville. Wright has made 15 of his 17 field goal attempts at EverBank Stadium during the regular season, and he didn’t miss a kick over his last five games played there.

Not to bury the lede, but quarterback Josh Allen is as healthy as he could be and is moving around extremely well during practice. This is a change from previous weeks, when Allen at least favored his injured foot. But with almost two weeks off from game action, the Bills are likely to have the full Allen experience for the playoffs.

Still on brand, the Bills have a handful of injuries to contend with this week. But in each of those cases, it’s not putting them in a worse position with the player who would be taking up the injured player’s usual role.

Linebacker Terrel Bernard, who began the year as the starting middle linebacker, hasn’t been spotted on the practice field for the past two weeks because of a Week 17 calf injury. Though Bernard has struggled this season, Thompson has been an upgrade for the Bills when he’s had to play a full complement of snaps.

Rookie cornerback Maxwell Hairston, who has been splitting series with veteran Tre’Davious White as the co-running mate to No. 1 corner Christian Benford, injured his ankle against the Jets. However, despite having a pair of interceptions, Hairston has been outplayed by White since the arrangement began in late October. The biggest concern about an injury to Hairston is the depth behind Benford and White.

Running back Ty Johnson hasn’t practiced yet this week because of an ankle injury from Week 18 and has been their go-to third-down back during the season. But Ray Davis is a more-than-capable fill-in, and Johnson’s potential absence might just mean more James Cook — and more of the 2025 NFL rushing leader is never a bad thing.

Wide receiver Joshua Palmer has also been unable to practice with an ankle injury, though his standing on the receivers depth chart has plummeted in recent weeks. Palmer was one of three receivers the Bills used prominently in their get-through-it-and-rest-the-starters Week 18 game against the Jets. Palmer’s minimal time, if he misses, would likely move snaps toward the top three of Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks and Tyrell Shavers even more. Then there’s Gabe Davis, who will be bringing what he called “a little extra” when going up against the Jaguars, his 2024 team.

Although it isn’t perfect from an injury perspective, as it hasn’t been for the entire season for the Bills, they might just be the most meaningfully healthy they’ve been all season, just when they need it the most.

Projected practice squad elevations: DE Andre Jones Jr., LB Baylon Spector

Projected inactives: WR Joshua Palmer, TE Keleki Latu, OT Tylan Grable, DT Larry Ogunjobi, LB Terrel Bernard, CB Maxwell Hairston, S Jordan Hancock

Prediction: Bills 29, Jaguars 24

The Bills head into their wild-card matchup against a Jaguars team that is one of the hottest in the NFL. The Jaguars’ eight-game win streak is the fourth longest of the 2025 season and the second-longest active streak, behind only the Houston Texans’ nine. Going into Jacksonville and defeating this team won’t be a small feat. It’s likely to be a tight game, but some things are working in the Bills’ favor.

When the Bills are on offense, the health of Kincaid and the emergence of Cooks can contribute against a zone-heavy Jaguars defense that can be picked apart through the air. Even still, the Bills will need their running game to become the two-dimensional attack they so crave. The Jaguars have a very good run defense, with standouts like defensive tackle DaVon Hamilton and linebacker Foyesade Oluokun, who can challenge an offense. The Jaguars played a similarly structured Denver Broncos team recently, though, which, like the Bills, boasts one of the best offensive lines in the league. The Broncos also busted a few explosive runs from R.J. Harvey, who has similar acceleration to Cook, with Cook being the superior all-around player. The Bills should be able to move the ball and put up points against this Jaguars defense.

On defense, the Jaguars will be a big challenge to the Bills’ unit, which has played far better as of late. Jacksonville has several skill players who can impact the game. The Bills will need to be gap sound against a solid rushing team, and they have to be wary of the explosive runs that Travis Etienne and Bhayshul Tuten are capable of, though it helps that the Bills are likely to have Jones back in the lineup at defensive tackle.

One of the most difficult decisions the Bills might have is which receiver between Brian Thomas Jr. and Jakobi Meyers they’ll choose to make Benford, their top cornerback, travel with. Thomas is the big-play threat, but Meyers has quickly become an impact piece to their offense. Taron Johnson will also have his hands full with slot receiver Parker Washington. One injury to monitor is to Jaguars left tackle Cole Van Lanen, who didn’t practice Wednesday or Thursday because of a knee injury. If Van Lanen can’t go, it will likely put backup tackle Walker Little in the game and give the Bills defensive end a plus matchup. And when Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence is pressured, his impact goes down significantly.

Ultimately, I think the Bills will win in a close game that might come down to the final possession — whether that’s the Bills scoring a go-ahead touchdown or the Jaguars being denied a late-game go-ahead opportunity. Despite some of the Jaguars’ great parts, the Bills should be able to find success, most notably in their rushing game against some of Jacksonville’s rotational defensive linemen. The Jaguars are a good team, but the Bills should move on and secure their first road playoff win since McDermott arrived.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/08224148/GettyImages-2252397764-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-09 20:01:40.639811

Who helps Allen overcome his road playoff woes? Bills quarterback Josh Allen is 0-4 in road playoff games in his career, the last three losses taking place in Kansas City (K.C. eliminated Buffalo from the postseason in four of the last five seasons). Buffalo's heartbreak hasn't fallen squarely on Allen, who surpassed 270 total yards of offense in all four of his career road playoff games, averaging 351.0 yards per game, including a postseason career-high 397 yards against the Chiefs in the 2021 Divisional Round. The Jaguars have allowed 270-plus total yards to seven different quarterbacks in 2025, so Allen could be primed for a productive outing as long as his sore foot holds up. But which pass catchers step up for him has been a week in, week out mystery. Buffalo is one of six teams that didn't have a player with 725-plus receiving yards. Khalil Shakir led the receiving corps as Allen's go-to option on short passing plays while tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox produced in Buffalo's often-used 11-personnel scheme. The lack of a deep threat for Allen in 2025 has been glaring. Second-year wideout Keon Coleman underwhelmed and Josh Palmer struggled to stay healthy and build a rapport, leading the Bills to bring back Gabe Davis and add veteran Brandin Cooks late this season. Tyrell Shavers has shown flashes downfield but remains a situational threat. It's not to say one of Allen's receivers has the ability to break out against the Jaguars' pass defense, which can be seen as the unit's soft spot (218.1 yards per game; 21st in NFL) -- the question is who will help get the Bills' star QB out of this postseason road slump. Allen has won at least one playoff game in five straight appearances, the longest streak in league history by a player without reaching the Super Bowl in that span, per NFL Research. Allen's playoff shortcomings figure to be a constant underlying storyline during Sunday's game, especially with his archnemesis (Chiefs) out of the running, but before furthering that discussion, the reigning MVP must first do something he's never done in the playoffs: win on the road. He's shown up consistently despite the results, but who also rises to the occasion is the prevailing question.

Watch out for Jacksonville's X-factors. The Jaguars joined the 2025 Patriots and 1999 Colts as the only teams in NFL history to win 13-plus games in the following season after losing 13-plus games -- an impressive turnaround facilitated by Liam Coen. Jacksonville's rookie head coach and offensive play-caller has been a revelation who has unlocked Trevor Lawrence, who posted a career-high 38 total touchdowns while leading a Jaguars offense that averaged a franchise-record 27.9 points per game in 2025. Coen's influence has brought a persistent passing offense to Jacksonville that is peaking at the right time. Lawrence has spread the ball to a solid wide-receiving trio in Parker Washington, Brian Thomas Jr. and Jakobi Meyers, who was acquired in a midseason trade. Tight end Brenton Strange served as Lawrence's security blanket. Washington led the team with 847 yards off 58 receptions, 17 of which have been for 20-plus yard gains. The Jaguars' home run hitter comes into Sunday hot with 347 receiving yards and two touchdowns in his last three games, but his play-making isn't limited to offensive play. Washington brought his 2025 touchdown total to seven with a pair of scores on punt returns, becoming the first player to have 750-plus receiving yards and multiple punt return TDs in a single season since DeSean Jackson did it in 2009. Washington is a sneaky X-factor the Bills must keep an eye on, but Jacksonville's kicker is another key element who could come into play. Cam Little made the two longest field goals in NFL history this season, a record-breaking 68-yarder in Week 11 and a 67-yard FG in Week 18. A kicking weapon like that is a scary proposition for opposing teams, especially at the end of each half and potentially overtime.

Divergent ground attacks could shape outcome. James Cook, Buffalo's most reliable offensive playmaker outside of Allen and the NFL's rushing champion in 2025, will lock horns with the league's top-ranked defense against the run -- the 10th such matchup of bests in NFL playoff history, per NFL Research. The Jaguars yielded 85.6 yards per game on the ground and 68.0 YPG to running backs; that kind of dependability often pigeon-holed opposing offenses and created opportunity for a defense that forced 31 takeaways (23 interceptions, nine fumbles; 2nd in NFL). The Bills, of course, led the league in rushing with Josh Allen and Ray Davis also producing. Meanwhile, stopping the run has been a struggle for the Bills defense all season (allowing 136.2 YPG) and that's been somewhat of a shock from Sean McDermott's team. Jacksonville began the season with a balanced attack, leading Travis Etienne to his third 1,000 yard campaign, but running the ball consistently has been an issue as of late with Etienne averaging 3.6 yards per carry since Week 10. However, that decline hasn't prevented the Jaguars from winning their last eight games. Not allowing Jacksonville to find its ground groove on Sunday will be crucial for the Bills, who boast the league's top passing defense and thrive on controlling games by keeping their offense on the field with Cook rushing and Allen making back-breaking plays.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/dibb9ceeozsyzxdsjvq1,N,,2026-01-09 21:58:52.889311

Vrabel's goals were to win the AFC East, host home playoff games, and compete for championships.","The Patriots are preparing to host their first home playoff game in six seasons when they welcome the Chargers to Gillette Stadium, and New England's roster is in relatively good shape for Sunday night.

On Friday, New England ruled out NT Khyiris Tonga (foot) and listed WR Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) OLB Harold Landry III (knee), and OT Thayer Munford Jr. (knee) as questionable for Sunday night's Wild Card matchup. Although being down their run-stuffing nose tackle is notable, Tonga is the lone Patriot on the active roster who doesn't have a chance to play on Sunday night. Given that we're heading into the 19th week of the season, that's encouraging.

​That said, Tonga's absence will be felt on both sides of the ball, as it has been since he suffered his foot injury in a Week 16 win over the Ravens. The big nose tackle hasn't played since exiting the win in Baltimore after having significant roles on the interior defensive line and as a short-yardage blocker in jumbo packages offensively. Without Tonga in recent weeks, the Patriots have relied on defensive tackles Christian Barmore, Cory Durden, Eric Gregory, and practice-squad elevations Jeremiah Pharms Jr. and Leonard Taylor III, while standout DT Milton Williams returned from injured reserve in Week 18.

Williams played 26 snaps in his first game action since suffering a high-ankle sprain in a Week 11 win over the Jets. In those 26 plays, Williams logged a tackle for loss against the run and one quarterback pressure, while helping free up Barmore for a 1-on-1 rush on a second-quarter sack. Williams' return gave the Patriots defense a huge boost, as he is an impact player who can shed blocks and make plays in the backfield.

On Sunday night, the hope is that the defense will get a similar bump from the returns of captains Robert Spillane and Harold Landry III. Spillane's last snaps came before New England's bye week in a Week 13 win over the Giants. Since then, the starting linebacker has been sidelined due to an ankle injury. Spillane won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's night's game, meaning he is expected to play. Earlier this week, Spillane spoke about his potential return, adding that returning for the playoffs was his goal.

""Yes sir,"" Spillane replied when asked if he'll be ready to play on Sunday night. ""It was always a goal to be ready for Week 1 of the playoffs. It means everything to be out there. Obviously, you want to be a factor in these games. So that's the major goal this week: get healthy, be a good teammate, do whatever I can to be out there Sunday.""

During his multi-week absence, LB Jack Gibbens stepped into Spillane's role as the Patriots starting MIKE linebacker. Gibbens made the most of the opportunity, flashing impressive instincts in coverage while also logging five run stuffs. However, Spillane still leads the Patriots with 18 run stuffs despite playing in only 13 games. The captain is by far the team's best run-stopping linebacker and is the primary signal-caller on the field.

Along those same lines, the team hopes a few weeks of rest will do edge rusher Harold Landry III some good, after the captain sat out the final two games of the regular season. Landry has been managing a knee injury that dates back to a scare in a Week 6 win over the Saints. After playing through the injury for several weeks, the Patriots decided to shut Landry down after clinching a playoff berth. Before the injury, Landry had a 2.7% sack rate and pressured opposing quarterbacks on 10.7% of his pass rushes. Since the injury, Landry has been registering a sack on 1.8% of his rushes with a 7.3% pressure rate. If the rest does wonders for Landry, his playoff performance could be closer to the player he was to start the season.

With a trio of starters returning to the lineup, the Patriots defense should improve. They already got impact plays from Williams in his return, and now Landry and Spillane are expected to return. In particular, the hope is that the run defense returns to form. In the first 10 weeks, New England's defense was fourth in rush EPA allowed. Without some of their top defenders down the stretch, the Patriots defense finished their last six games ranked 21st in rush EPA. Hopefully, getting the defense back to mostly full strength allows New England to exploit a weakness in the Chargers along their offensive line.

Offensively, WR Kayshon Boutte popped up on the injury report with a hamstring injury this week. After practicing in full on Wednesday, Boutte was limited in the last two sessions and is officially questionable. The Patriots are already thin at wide receiver without veteran Mack Hollins, who is on injured reserve. New England's fully healthy wideouts are Stefon Diggs, Kyle Williams, DeMario Douglas, and Efton Chism III. Hopefully, Boutte, who has been a productive outside deep threat, will be able to suit up on Sunday night, which seems to be the plan barring anything unforeseen.

The Patriots also have some unknowns along the offensive line heading into Sunday night due to injury and illness. During the week, starting RT Morgan Moses and C Garrett Bradbury both missed practices due to illness. The expectation is that both will play, but New England is still unsure about the status of third tackle Thayer Munford Jr., who missed Thursday's practice due to his knee injury.

Munford Jr., who has played the jumbo tight end role for the Patriots over the last several weeks. In their last four games, New England has played 56 snaps with six offensive linemen on the field, third-most in the NFL, and Munford has been the primary extra offensive lineman. In those six O-Line packages, the Patriots are averaging 8.3 yards per play with 11 explosive plays, so one would expect that OC Josh McDaniels would like to have the jumbo package at his disposal in the postseason.

If he can't go, backup tackle Vederian Lowe, who has also been battling an illness, could be the sixth offensive lineman this week. New England could also turn to top backup Ben Brown in that role. Either way, the jumbo tight end has been an important role in the Patriots offense over the last month, so Munford being questionable to play isn't an insignificant injury.

At left guard, head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed that rookie Jared Wilson will start on Sunday night. On Friday, Wilson shed his red non-contact jersey at practice, indicating that Wilson cleared concussion protocol. Wilson has started all 13 games he's been healthy in this season and Vrabel told reporters on Friday that the rookie will get the start now that he has cleared concussion protocol after some discussion about sticking with Brown.

As for Los Angeles, the big injury question for the Chargers is the status of rookie RB Omarion Hampton (ankle). Hampton returned to practice in a limited capacity on Friday and is officially questionable for Sunday night due to his ankle injury. The first-round rookie is Los Angeles's lead-back when healthy, but has battled injuries in his first season. Hampton told reporters in Los Angeles that he plans to play on Sunday, but the Chargers will likely lean on RB Kimani Vidal if the talented rookie is out.

Along with hosting their first home playoff game since 2019, New England is aiming to check another box in Mike Vrabel's to-do list when he took over as head coach in January. Vrabel's goals were to win the AFC East, host home playoff games, and compete for championships. In his first season as head coach, the Patriots won the division and will host a home playoff game, so next up on the checklist is winning playoff games, adding extra validity to the Patriots terrific 14-3 regular season.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/yfitxzdrilyeir1kdw3a,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:16.076249

The Chargers officially listed Hampton as questionable for Sunday. He participated in practice in a limited capacity Friday, marking his first on-field work since Week 17.

""I'm super excited,"" Hampton said of potentially playing in his first playoff game.

Hampton, the Chargers' first-round rookie, has seen his season hindered by injuries. He was placed on injured reserve after the Chargers' Week 5 loss to the Washington Commanders with a fracture in his left ankle. He returned in Week 14 against the Eagles, only to sustain an injury to his other ankle in Week 17 against the Houston Texans.

""It's definitely been different, but it's something I've just got to keep getting treatment on and bounce back from,"" Hampton said of the injuries.

Hampton said he wasn't sure about the severity of his injury, but it occurred early in the fourth quarter against Houston when he was tackled by linebacker Henry To'oTo'o. Despite the injury, Hampton stayed in the game, finishing with 29 rushing yards, a touchdown, and 31 receiving yards.

""I definitely didn't want to give up on my team,"" Hampton said. ""I just wanted to help my team out as much as I could, so I kept my head down and kept playing.""

Hampton got off to a slow start early in the season but quickly became one of the Chargers' most important offensive pieces after veteran running back Najee Harris suffered a season-ending Achilles rupture in the first half of the Chargers' Week 3 game against the Denver Broncos.

With Harris sidelined, Los Angeles leaned heavily on Hampton, who broke out with a team-high 129 yards from scrimmage and his first NFL touchdown in a 23-20 win.

Since returning in Week 14, Hampton has picked up where he left off. His best performance came against the Dallas Cowboys, when he rushed 16 times for 85 yards and a touchdown.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1222%2Fr1592668_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 18:02:41.869501

“He will not practice today, which is not unusual for a kicker,” McDermott said. “Thought he did some good things (Thursday), but we’ll see how he trends as we get closer to the game.”

Buffalo Bills injury list before Jaguars game

As far as the rest of the injury list, McDermott confirmed that cornerback Max Hairston (ankle) and linebacker Terrel Bernard (calf) will not be able to play, while wide receiver Joshua Palmer (ankle) and running back Ty Johnson (ankle) will be listed as questionable.

Prater missed two games with a quad muscle injury, returned to play in the season finale last week against New York, but aggravated the injury and could not finish the game.

Bills add kicker for insurance

The Bills signed kicker Matthew Wright to the practice squad Tuesday and he has been getting ready in practice this week in case Prater can’t go. Prater did practice Thursday and McDermott said things went well.

It’s possible that Wright may get the call if the Bills don’t want to risk losing Prater during the game. Another option could be to use a practice squad elevation on Wright to serve in an emergency capacity if the 41-year-old Prater were to get hurt again during the game.

“There’s multiple things we’re trying to balance,” McDermott said. “We’ve dealt with a lot of injures this year, so nothing new having to balance some of those things. But we’re on top of it. There’s a delicate balance and you wish you had enough spots. There’s positions you’re concerned if you have enough to get you through.”

Having to use a game-day roster spot on a backup kicker is obviously not ideal, but there’s no tomorrow in the postseason and it might not be a bad idea because the Bills can’t afford not having a kicker in a game of this magnitude, especially one that is expected to be close and could come down to a do-or-die kick.

Good news on Buffalo Bills injury report

Based on their practice status during the week, it looks like safety Jordan Poyer and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones, who were both inactive last week, will return. And linebacker Shaq Thompson and tight end Dalton Kincaid, who were also limited each day, are also ready to go.

Thompson was held out last week while Kincaid played because he had missed several games and needed a tuneup heading into the postseason, and he caught three passes for 48 yards.

Here we are, with the Pittsburgh Steelers being the first team to challenge that assertion.

Houston makes its third consecutive trip to the postseason and is pursuing its third straight win in the wild-card round. Pittsburgh will try to avoid losing a wild-card playoff game for the third year in a row, looking to Aaron Rodgers to lift the Steelers to the divisional round for the first time since the 2017 season. Rodgers last played in the postseason in 2022, finishing his second-to-last season with the Green Bay Packers.

Previous meeting this season

These two teams did not face each other during the regular season. The last time Houston played Pittsburgh was during the 2023 season (unless you count the 2024 preseason), DeMeco Ryans’ first as the Texans’ head coach. Kenny Pickett was the Steelers’ quarterback and Najee Harris started at running back then.

C.J. Stroud threw for 308 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Nico Collins tallied 7 receptions for 168 yards and two scores in Houston’s 30-6 rout at home.

The Steelers have had a clean injury report throughout the week, with only Jaylen Warren missing practice time due to illness. However, Pittsburgh apparently believes the team’s leading rusher will recover in time for Monday night’s kickoff.

The Texans had two starters miss practice this week, cornerback Kamari Lassiter and left guard Tytus Howard. Lassiter tied for the team lead with four interceptions and was third with 91 tackles, while Howard started 16 games this season.

The head coaches

Strangely, Ryans might be the more secure coach in this matchup. The Texans are ascendant in his third season as he’s built the best defense in the NFL. Losing in the wild-card round might take some shine off that status, but Houston is clearly building a contender. Pittsburgh seemingly avoided a difficult decision by winning its regular-season finale to clinch the AFC North and a playoff berth. Yet if the Steelers lose badly to Houston, Tomlin and the team may mutually decide that it’s time for a change.

Key player for the Steelers

Pittsburgh needed a reliable starting quarterback, which is what led the team to sign Rodgers. But making it to the playoffs hasn’t been the issue. The Steelers qualified for the postseason in five of the past six seasons. With Rodgers, the hope was that he had one more vintage season left to advance further in the playoffs. But he threw for five total touchdowns while averaging 247 passing yards in the Steelers’ final five games. Is he capable of more against a defense that allowed 277 yards per game and has been unbeatable in its past nine games?

Key player for the Texans

Befitting their status as the NFL’s top defense, the Texans have standouts among their front seven and secondary. As mentioned above, four players had four interceptions. Defensive end Danielle Hunter led the team with 15 sacks. Yet the most disruptive player is on the opposite end of the line from Hunter, edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. The third-year pro has provided the stellar production Houston anticipated after making him the No. 3 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. The Steelers are surely aware that Anderson has 20 tackles for loss and 23 quarterback hits this season. Rodgers could see a lot of him on Monday night.

Prediction

Pittsburgh’s reward for winning the AFC North and making the playoffs is meeting the team nobody supposedly wanted to play. (Whether the Texans have the NFL’s most ferocious defense is a discussion that should include the Denver Broncos.) Additionally, the Steelers backed into the postseason, advancing thanks to Ravens kicker Tyler Loop shanking a 44-yard field-goal attempt wide right as time expired.

Houston’s defense may also be acclaimed because it compensates for a subpar offense. The Texans ranked No. 18 in total offense and averaged 24 points per game. Quarterback C.J. Stroud threw for 200 yards or fewer in three of his past five games. That might give the Steelers a chance. But Houston’s strength is too much to overcome.

Stafford led the NFL with a career-high 46 touchdown passes and 4,707 passing yards this season.

The 37-year-old quarterback overcame an offseason back injury and potential trade talks.

WOODLAND HILLS, CA. – Los Angeles Rams guard Steve Avila still finds it surreal that he’s teammates with Matthew Stafford.

“There are times like I'm like, ‘Wow, that's Matthew Stafford.' Like, I was 9 years old when he got drafted,” Avila told USA TODAY Sports. “It is awesome. I mean, especially just with the season that he's had, and just being able to be a part of that is just amazing.”

Avila’s elementary school recollection of Stafford might make the 37-year-old feel old, but the quarterback’s performed this year like an aging fine red wine.

Stafford led the NFL and broke a franchise record with a career-high 46 touchdown passes to just eight interceptions. Those 46 touchdowns are the second-most thrown in a single season by an NFL quarterback age 37 or older. Additionally, he became the third player in NFL history with at least 45 touchdown passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season, according to NFL Research. His 4,707 passing yards also topped the league.

Stafford threw four touchdown passes in Week 18 alone and became third player in NFL history with multiple touchdown passes in 15 games in a season. He earned his fourth career player of the week honor for his performance in the team’s season finale.

'He is the MVP'

The Rams quarterback’s statistics indicate he’s defying Father Time, and he might’ve just capped off the best regular season of his career.

Stafford is the frontrunner to win MVP, courtesy of BetMGM as of Jan. 4. For all his plaudits, the Super Bowl 56 champion and three-time Pro Bowler has never won the award.

Rams players believe the award should be added this year to Stafford's already impressive resume.

“He is the MVP. There's no ifs ands or buts about it,” Rams running back Blake Corum told USA TODAY Sports. “The season he’s had is ridiculous. The career he's had is just tremendous.”

MVP voting for the regular season concluded on Monday. The recipient of the award won’t be revealed until the NFL Honors ceremony on Feb. 5.

“I hope everybody has their head screwed on right and knows exactly that he's the most valuable person in the league,” Avila said.

Stafford had a humble response when asked by USA TODAY Sports about his MVP candidacy and diverted the credit to the team.

“As far as being a candidate, I just wanted to play as good as I possibly can this year like I do every season,” Stafford said. “Obviously, I have great football players around me and coaches around me that give myself and our offense a chance and opportunity to succeed. We were able to do that.”

Stafford: 'I didn't know if I would get there'

What makes Stafford’s stellar year even more impressive is what he’s overcome this season – a campaign that almost didn’t happen.

The Rams granted Stafford’s agent permission to speak to other teams about a trade last February, before the sides agreed to a contract restructure later that month. But a subsequent aggravated disk in his back would cause Stafford to miss most of training camp.

“There were some lean moments. It was touch and go there for a little bit,” Stafford recalled. “A lot of treatments and things that I did to try and help myself get to this point. I didn't know if I would get there but I went out there and it was wait and see, let's see what happens. Luckily it turned out pretty good.”

Pretty good is an understatement. Stafford started all 17 regular-season games, led the NFL in passing yards and touchdowns and is an odds-on favorite to win MVP.

Stafford’s now about to embark on another playoff journey in his fifth season as the Rams QB. Following a 2021 blockbuster trade with the Detroit Lions, Stafford led the Rams to a Super Bowl title his first season in Los Angeles. Stafford and the Rams have their sights set on another Lombardi Trophy, and maybe some additional hardware for the trophy case along the way.

“What a guy that you just watch that is totally present. He's enjoying the moment and I think that's when we're at our best. I think this team has taken on a lot of the great traits, the toughness mentally and physically, and just the overall enjoyment for the chance to go compete, but also the ability to celebrate your teammates. He's elevated everybody that he's around, but it's been really impressive,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “I wouldn't say I'm surprised though. This has been consistent for him over the five years that we've been together. I’m just grateful to be able to have the opportunity to be partnered up with him.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/08/USAT/88077152007-usatsi-27933520.jpg?crop=4193,2359,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-09 16:01:02.110120

Here are the final game statuses for the week:

Questionable: RT Lane Johnson (foot), OL Brett Toth (concussion), OLB Azeez Ojulari (hamstring)

As the Eagles held their final practice Friday ahead of hosting the 49ers in the wild-card round on Sunday, all 53 players on their active roster were practicing.

The two players who were not practicing on Thursday — LG Landon Dickerson (rest) and OL Brett Toth (concussion) — returned, which means all 53 players were there.

It also means that the Eagles should have 21 of 22 starters available against the 49ers on Sunday, assuming Johnson (foot) makes his return. While Johnson is officially listed as questionable, things during the week have seemed to be trending toward a return.

Meanwhile, the 49ers have a lengthy injury report heading into this game:

Johnson (foot) was practicing again on Friday for the third straight day after missing the last seven weeks with a Lisfranc sprain he suffered on Nov. 16 against the Lions. Johnson has been limited the first two days of the week. In addition to Johnson, the other three players who were limited on Thursday — DT Jalen Carter (hip), TE Dallas Goedert (knee) and TE Grant Calcaterra (ankle) — were all practicing again too and none of them have game statuses.

The only starter who won't be available for the playoffs is rookie safety Drew Mukuba, who fractured his ankle in late November and needed surgery.

The Eagles’ health going into the playoffs, especially against a banged-up 49ers team, should not go unnoticed. They had 22 of 22 starters available for Super Bowl LVII and had 21 of 22 available for Super Bowl LIX last year. The Eagles, as an organization, are proud about how healthy they have been in recent seasons.

“There's two things that need to happen,” head coach Nick Sirianni said earlier this week. “You've got to have your players available, and you do different things to make sure that happens throughout the year, but it is so important that you continue to get better as the season goes on. I think our guys have a great balance and we do a good job of balancing that intensity at practice. There's no [lack] of intensity at practice; When we're out there, we're ripping it, but I think our guys know how to practice, they know how to practice efficiently. We've had a tendency of getting better while also having guys healthy. We continue to tweak the process of what we do. Great people in this building to help us make decisions. There's a lot that goes into that.

“Then you've got guys that are truly committed to this game because they love this game and they want to be the best versions [of] themselves they possibly can be. You could have all the resources in the world [and] if the guys aren't using them, it's for nothing. But our guys do such a good job of using the resources they have, taking care of themselves, and I think we have a pretty good process. As an organization, I think we take a lot of pride in that.”",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2023/05/johnson_l_GettyImages-1237390053.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:27.134051

The Chargers have a very balanced passing attack, with four receivers between 641 and 741 pass yards this season.
The Chargers and Patriots each rank in the top half of the league of rushing yards and yards per carry, but they've taken different routes to get there.
New England has leaned more on the run game down the stretch, with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson filling big roles.
Like the Chargers, the Patriots' run blocking has been spotty at times, but the return of Campbell last week boosted the offensive line.","Drake Maye turned in an MVP-caliber season in Year 2, meshing well with new offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, a revamped offensive line and a new cast of receivers. Maye's downfield touch and accuracy, along with his scrambling ability, has made New England's offense a bear to defend, racking up more than 300 yards in every game and scoring 23 or more points in their past 14 games. It's also impressive how Maye has avoided turnovers, with only 11 on the season -- three games with two turnovers, five games with one and nine with zero giveaways. Stefon Diggs is the go-to guy in key situations, and they're a bit thin at wide receiver with Mack Hollins out. But Maye has good options at tight end with Hunter Henry and Austin Hooper, and they've used RBs Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson more as pass catchers recently. Having left tackle Will Campbell back in Week 18 also appeared to upgrade the offensive line. The Chargers are mostly excellent defensively, with more INTs (19) than pass TDs allowed (16) in 2025. Coordinator Jesse Minter operates a disciplined, zone-heavy and opportunistic unit. He will try to confuse Maye by disguising coverage pre- and post-snap, and Los Angeles has a pass rush that can get home, led by Tuli Tuipulotu, Khalil Mack and Odafe Oweh -- all rested and ready to pursue. Safety Derwin James is an X-factor in the middle of the Chargers defense whom the Patriots must respect, although tight ends have done some damage against them late in the season.

Justin Herbert has been a miracle worker at times for the Chargers, finding ways to thrive in spite of injury and poor protection up front. He sat out Week 18, protecting his broken left hand, and now the question once again is how good his protection will be against New England. Jamaree Salyer, the team's third left tackle this season, sat out the past two games with a hamstring injury, though he's luckily off the injury report. The Patriots will need a disciplined rush; Herbert has been terrific outside the pocket as a thrower and scrambler, able to get out of trouble and sting defenses, but he also has been sacked three or more times in 10 of his 16 starts. The Patriots' sack percentage (6.64%, 20th) doesn't tell the whole story, as their pressure rate (35.9%, per Next Gen Stats) ranks 10th, and it's possible they get Harold Landry (knee; questionable) back. New England also has generally kept the big plays under wraps this season, allowing only 42 passes of 20-plus yards (tied for seventh-best) and only three plays of 40-plus (tied for second). The Chargers have a very balanced passing attack, with four receivers between 641 and 741 pass yards this season. Keep an eye on rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden II, who has shaky hands but explosive ability, especially against a New England defense that has struggled to contain good receivers at the position. The Patriots will give up some catches with their zone-heavy scheme, but between limiting explosive pass plays and having eyes on mobile quarterbacks, reducing their scramble potential, the Chargers might have to work their way up and down the field more gradually.

The Chargers and Patriots each rank in the top half of the league of rushing yards and yards per carry, but they've taken different routes to get there. The Chargers hope to have Omarion Hampton back from injury -- the running back is questionable due to an ankle injury but said he expected to play -- and Kimani Vidal has added a layer of explosiveness to the backfield. However, the blocking hasn't always allowed them to thrive consistently. Justin Herbert's scrambling has helped to give those rushing totals a cosmetic boost at times, too. The Patriots' run defense looks good on the stat sheet, allowing only 101.7 yards per game (sixth), but they've been carved up a bit late in the season by the likes of Breece Hall, Derrick Henry and James Cook. The return of defensive tackle Milton Williams appeared to help the run defense last week, and the Patriots are set to get linebacker Robert Spillane (foot) back from injury (though defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga will miss). New England has leaned more on the run game down the stretch, with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson filling big roles. Stevenson has been on a heater of late, averaging 9.6 yards per carry and scoring six TDs in his past four games, and Henderson is the big-play dynamo with four TDs of 50-plus yards this season. Like the Chargers, the Patriots' run blocking has been spotty at times, but the return of Campbell last week boosted the offensive line. The Chargers' run defense has been very good this season, with Saquon Barkley the last one to really hurt them back in Week 14, but the Patriots likely will be patient with the run game and keep pounding away, especially if they gain an early lead.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/snucdj6enzp0op5heg9v,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:31.186880

Inefficiencies on early downs and predictable passing routes led the Eagles offense to a league-high 28.1% three-and-out rate in 2025.
In the first four weeks of the season, the Niners allowed 280.5 yards per game and 165 pass yards per tilt.
Can Robert Saleh's zombie crew keep the Eagles offense spiraling, or will Hurts & Co. get back on track to jumpstart their postseason run?","Sunday afternoon's bout at Lincoln Financial Field will feature two seasoned playoff opponents. Either the Eagles or 49ers have represented the NFC in the Super Bowl in each of the last three seasons (Eagles in 2024 and 2022; Niners in 2023).

The wild-card bout marks the playoff rematch of the 2022 NFC Championship Game. Hopefully, Brock Purdy can stay healthy for more than one series this time. On that day, the Niners QB tore his UCL on the first drive of the game, and the Eagles steamrolled to a 31-7 win. That game feels eons ago.

Sunday, both Philly and San Francisco enter with a host of questions.

Kyle Shanahan's club is a MASH unit, particularly on defense, after losing stars Nick Bosa, Fred Warner and many others, sapping the unit of its potency. Offensively, Trent Williams is dealing with a hamstring injury, and receiver Ricky Pearsall has been dealing with a PCL issue for the bulk of the season.

The Eagles have injury concerns of their own, most significantly along the offensive line, but the main question for the reigning Super Bowl champs is whether Nick Sirianni's offense can finally hit a groove heading into the postseason tournament after frustrating inconsistencies have plagued the unit all campaign. Does the offense have enough to beat good teams? The Eagles went 2-3 and averaged 19.4 points per game against teams with a .600+ win percentage in 2025. Against teams under .600, they went 9-3 and averaged 23.5 PPG.

The Eagles are 5-0 at home in the playoffs under Sirianni, 0-2 on the road and 1-1 in Super Bowls (neutral site). The 49ers have reached the NFC Championship Game in each season they have made the playoffs under Shanahan, and San Francisco is 6-0 in Wild Card/Divisional Round games since 2019.

1) Can the Eagles offense take advantage of a banged-up 49ers D?

The Eagles have scored 22.3 points per game in 2025 (19th in the NFL and the fewest in the Nick Sirianni era) and averaged 311.2 total yards per game (24th in the league and the third-fewest of any playoff team).

Given the names on the Eagles offense, the numbers are mind-numbing. An offense with Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith shouldn't be so easily slowed. Offensive line issues have been a major factor in the spiral, as the Eagles fell from the top unit last season. With Lane Johnson set to return and others getting rest last week, the hope is that Philly's blocking will improve during the playoff run.

The unimaginative offense run by Kevin Patullo has earned the ire of Philly fans. It's been particularly predictable in the passing attack, which averaged 194.3 pass yards per game, good for 23rd in the NFL and the second-fewest among playoff teams (Carolina, 179.3).

Inefficiencies on early downs and predictable passing routes led the Eagles offense to a league-high 28.1% three-and-out rate in 2025.

Hurts hasn't been the quarterback who steamrolled through the playoffs last year, with a trove of missed passes peppering his season. However, his ability to protect the football has been key to the Eagles' success in close games. Philly is 11-2 when Hurts doesn't have an interception this season (0-3 in games with one or more).

Fortunately for the Eagles, they'll face a Niners defense that struggles to get after the quarterback, ranking last in the NFL with 20 sacks and creating just six interceptions, tied for the second-fewest. San Francisco is the first team to make the playoffs in a season with 20 or fewer sacks and fewer than 10 INTs.

The 49ers' inability to disrupt the passer has left their secondary vulnerable. Since Week 5, San Francisco has allowed 358.6 yards per game, seventh-most in the NFL, and 253.2 passing yards per game, third-most. In the first four weeks of the season, the Niners allowed 280.5 yards per game and 165 pass yards per tilt.

Can Robert Saleh's zombie crew keep the Eagles offense spiraling, or will Hurts & Co. get back on track to jumpstart their postseason run?

2) High-powered 49ers offense vs. Eagles' menacing D

Upon Brock Purdy's return in Week 11, the Niners offense was a buzzsaw, averaging 35.7 points per game from Weeks 11-17, before getting waylaid by the top-seeded Seahawks in Week 18 sans all-world left tackle Trent Williams. Purdy ranks third in total TDs (19) and passer rating (105.6) since his return.

With the starter under center, the Niners offense is a blitzkrieg, able to dice up defenses with play-action over the middle and on intermediate routes. Using a diverse set of playmakers, from Christian McCaffrey out of the backfield to Jauan Jennings, Kendrick Bourne and Ricky Pearsall (when healthy), San Francisco's passing attack is lethal when it gets rolling. The 49ers went 23 consecutive drives without punting at one point down the stretch.

The key matchup Sunday will be tight end George Kittle against a stingy Eagles D. Purdy has a 140.6 passer rating when targeting the TE this season, tops of any duo with at least 40 connections. Seemingly, whenever Purdy gets into trouble or needs a big play, he looks for Kittle. That combination will be tested Sunday against an Eagles defense that has allowed the lowest passer rating on targets to tight ends this season (72.2).

Vic Fangio's defense has played at a championship level this season and has been particularly menacing since acquiring Jaelan Phillips at the trade deadline. Since Week 10, the Eagles have allowed 15.6 points per game, the fewest in the NFL.

It's a D with little weakness. Phillips and Jalen Carter can disrupt the passer, Zack Baun patrols the middle and corners Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are smothering. Mitchell has allowed a 41.7 completion percentage in coverage in 2025, tied for first in the NFL. DeJean, meanwhile, allowed just a 48.8 completion percentage defending the slot, the lowest in the league with a minimum of 30 slot targets. Philly has generated at least one takeaway in nine straight games and allowed a single passing TD over the past four tilts.

If there is one area to quibble with Fangio's unit, it's that the defense has been run on at times this season, allowing 124.4 rush yards per game, 22nd in the NFL. Will a Niners run game that hasn't been very efficient this season, ranking 24th with 106.9 yards per contest, be able to exploit that tender spot in an otherwise impenetrable dragon?

3) Which running back will blast off?

Saturday will mark the fourth playoff matchup all time between the previous two AP Offensive Player of the Year winners: Saquon Barkley won in 2024, Christian McCaffrey in 2023.

McCaffrey has been the 49ers' workhorse, leading the NFL with 413 touches this season, 44 more than any other player (Jonathan Taylor, 369). Returning from last season's injury, McCaffrey generated 1,202 rushing yards on 311 totes. The concern for the Niners' rushing attack has been consistency. McCaffrey generated just 3.9 yards per carry, the lowest in his career since his rookie campaign (3.7). The splash runs have been few and far between, with CMC earning just 11 rushes of 15-plus yards and three over 20 yards.

The best all-purpose weapon in football is a matchup nightmare. His 924 receiving yards on 102 catches gave McCaffrey 2,126 scrimmage yards this season, second in the NFL (Bijan Robinson, 2,298). CMC generated 12 games with 100-plus scrimmage yards, tied for the most in the NFL (James Cook), and 10 games with 100-plus scrimmage yards and at least one touchdown (most in the NFL). Philly allowed 639 receiving yards to running backs, seventh-most in the NFL, so expect Brock Purdy to look for CMC often on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Barkley, coming off a 2,005-yard 2024 season, didn't earn a Pro Bowl nod as the Eagles offense was stuck in the mud. The dynamo generated 1,140 rushing yards on 280 carries (4.1 YPC) with seven touchdowns. The big difference this season is that the massive runs have been absent from the offense. In 2024, Barkley earned 17 rushes of 20-plus yards and a whopping seven of 40-plus. In 2025, he had just four rushes of 20-plus yards and three going 40 or more yards. Part of the lack of explosives has been play-calling, and another is blocking concerns, with linemen not getting to the second level as regularly as they were a year ago.

Like many backs who lead the league in carries, as Barkley did a year ago with 345, things started slowly. From Weeks 1-13, the RB averaged 61.7 rushing yards per game, 3.7 yards per carry on 16.5 totes per tilt. However, he's found a groove in recent weeks. Over his past four games, Barkley has averaged 100.0 yards on 20.5 carries per game for a 4.9 yards per carry average. With Lane Johnson and others along the Eagles' line hopefully healthier, we could see a return of 2024 Barkley in the 2025 playoffs.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/rvz5r2omqikwe8t5jsjw,N,,2026-01-09 17:01:34.460678

The NFC North rivals split the season series, and the tape really tells a story. So, let's take a deeper look at both teams, using the previous games to place our top bets.

Matt Bowen breaks it down and offers his take, and Liz Loza, Pamela Maldonado, Eric Moody, Ben Solak and Seth Walder share their best bets, analysis and DFS plays to help you get in on the action.

Note: Odds provided by DraftKings Sportsbookand subject to change.

When the Packers have the ball

Bowen: I expect the Packers to be methodical in their approach, using the running game and taking the throws that are available when Jordan Love sees zone coverage. However, when the Bears play their man schemes, the Packers can cash in. In the Week 14 game, Love completed 9 of 13 passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns versus man coverage.

Edge: Packers.

Best bet: Christian Watson can create numbers on out routes and quicks, but we want to see the big throws that get him loose on deep over routes and posts. Watson has 80 or more yards receiving in three of his last five games, with 89 yards (on just four catches) versus Chicago in Week 14. Take Watson over 54.5 yards receiving (-113).

When the Bears have the ball

Bowen: Bears coach Ben Johnson wants to run the ball and deliver body punches in the second half of football games. We've seen it. But that also sets up quarterback Caleb Williams on play-action throws out of multiple-tight-end sets, and this Green Bay pass rush has declined sinceMicah Parsons'knee injury.

Edge:Bears.

Best bet: Colston Loveland has emerged as a priority target for Williams, catching at least six passes in back-to-back games. Plus, given the zone-heavy tendencies of the Packers defense, Loveland can operate as an underneath outlet and work the seams. I'm going Loveland over 4.5 receptions (+105).

Staff picks, best bets and props

Bears +1.5 (-112)

Maldonado:Chicago controls pace with the run game, forces turnovers at the highest rate in the league and closes games late. Green Bay moves the ball but struggles to finish drives, especially under pressure. The Bears' fourth-quarter edge makes them the side to take.

Caleb Williams 34+ pass attempts (+142)

Moody: Williams has averaged 34.5 pass attempts per game over his last 10 contests and recorded at least 34 attempts in both meetings against the Packers earlier this season. With these teams familiar with one another, this matchup has the potential to turn into a high-scoring game, especially with Green Bay dealing with multiple defensive injuries. The Bears will look to exploit this.

Williams UNDER 31.5 pass attempts (-112)

Solak: The Bears have had to dig their way out of two multi-score holes against Green Bay this season, and, accordingly, those two games have demanded 35 and 34 pass attempts from Williams. If this game, with a spread of only 1.5 remains a closer contest that allows Chicago to play their preferred style of offense, Williams won't need to drop back nearly as much. And with his receiver room returning to full health, more completions will become big gains, leading to fewer attempts overall.

Williams OVER 21.5 rushing yards (-112)

Loza:Williams averages 4.5 carries (QB16) and nearly 23 rushing yards per contest (QB8). He ripped off 30 rushing yards when he last faced a Parsons-less Packers defense in Week 16 (he had only 15 rushing yards at Green Bay, with Parsons on the field, in Week 14). Green Bay's defense has allowed an average of 32 rushing yards per game since Parsons was injured in Week 15. Williams should find some scrambling room and flirt with at least 25 rushing yards Saturday.

Montez Sweat UNDER 0.25 sacks (-140)

Walder: Sweat's 4.8% pass rush win rate ranks 50th out of 52 qualifying edge rushers. That's probably underselling his ability a little bit because it might not capture some of his pocket-pushing ability, but still, there's a reason why the Bears have struggled with their pass rush all year. But it gets worse. Jordan Love has just a 4.3% sack rate this season, seventh-lowest among quarterbacks. And while I'm making this bet either way, if Zach Tom is active, this bet becomes even more attractive. Tom, who Sweat figures to align opposite most often, ranks sixth in pass block win rate among tackles. My model prices this under at -233.

Daily fantasy tips for DraftKings Captain Showdown

Loza's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): D'Andre Swift ($13,800). The Bears recorded the fifth-most rushes over the regular season. Ben Johnson figures to stick to that script versus a banged-up Packers defense. Despite Kyle Monangai's emergence, Swift has remained the Chicago's RB1, averaging 15.5 touches per game and 13 fantasy points per contest from Weeks 10-18.

Also in my lineup: Colston Loveland ($6,400). The rookie has emerged over the back half of the regular season, drawing at least five looks in every game since Week 12. He also leads the team in red zone opportunities (13). Chicago's receiving corps can be tricky to predict, but Loveland's robust number of high-value targets make him a solid ceiling pick.

Maldonado's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): Caleb Williams ($15,900) has rushing upside with scramble ability. Even when his throwing accuracy wavers early, volume and four-quarter aggression create ceiling outcomes. His legs matter more than efficiency.

Also in my lineup: DJ Moore ($8,400)is Williams' first read in big spots. When pressure hits, targets funnel his way. Moore's role spikes late in the game, giving him a reliable floor with shots at scores.

Moody's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points):Kyle Monangai ($4,200) is a nice value option and comes at a lower cost than Swift. Monangai has put together an impressive rookie season, and while his usage has been inconsistent, Monangai is an explosive runner. The Packers' defensive front has struggled late in the regular season, and Monangai could find success running behind a Bears offensive line that finished fifth in run-block win rate.

Also in my lineup:Luther Burden III ($6,600) closed the regular season on a strong note, averaging 5.4 targets per game over his last seven games. He also flashed significant upside, highlighted by a 30.8-point performance in Week 17 against the 49ers. Whether or not Rome Odunze plays, Burden profiles as an excellent DFS value at this price.'

Solak's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): Josh Jacobs ($14,400). Expect ownership to come in low on Jacobs, who has been quiet for the last month as he's dealt with nagging injury. But he's off the injury report this week for the first time in over a month, and the Packers will look to run the football and shorten the game against a Bears offense that has struggled to consistently put up points against them in the first half. Should be a heavy volume day for a player most of the field passes on.

Also in my lineup: Colston Loveland ($6,400). Despite leading the Bears in target share over the back half of the season, Loveland is priced below all three of the Bears' starting receivers in showdown. I think the return of Rome Odunze and emergence of Luther Burden III will lead to more distributed production among the wideouts, while Loveland's role as a reliable stick-mover with red zone utility will go untouched. He'll be heavily owned, but rightfully so.

Walder's recommendations

Captain (scores 1.5x fantasy points): Jordan Love ($15,600). I think this is going to be a high-scoring, back-and-forth battle where the quarterbacks are going to put up big numbers. The reason? Pass protection. Both of these team rank in the top six in pass block win rate, the Bears rank 31st in pass rush win rate and the Packers are even worse than that if we only look at their pass rushing snaps without Micah Parsons on the field. Love, and his stats, will be the beneficiary.",https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2026/0108/r1598211_1296x729_16-9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-09 16:01:21.427872

Linebacker Anfernee Jennings and offensive tackle Morgan Moses were full participants after being out. Veteran linebacker Robert Spillane was also a full participant for the first time since returning from his ankle injury. That bodes well for his chances of playing in Sunday's wild-card playoff game against the Los Angeles Chargers.

Perhaps the only concerns for the Patriots are center Garrett Bradbury and defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga. Bradbury has been out for the last two practices with an illness, while Tonga has been out for the last two games with a foot injury.

Speaking of concerns, when should the Chargers start to worry about Omarion Hampton? The rookie running back was out for a second straight day with an ankle injury. If he's forced to miss Sunday's game, it would be a huge loss for a Chargers team that is already playing behind a decimated offensive line.

Here is the full injury report for both teams on Thursday:
