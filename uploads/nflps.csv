Jones will miss at least the next four games, ruling him out until at least Week 17.

Andrus Peat, drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the first round in 2015, will start in Jones' place protecting Aaron Rodgers' blind side against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, coach Mike Tomlin said Friday. Swing tackle Calvin Anderson was also under consideration for the left tackle job. Peat has primarily taken reps at guard since joining the Steelers during training camp, but he made 12 starts at left tackle for the Saints in 2023. On Sunday, he will be protecting a quarterback who is almost 42 and dealing with a fractured left wrist.

""I'm always ready to play or start,"" Peat said Friday. ""I've been a starter most of my career, so I always try to prepare like that and keep myself in that mindset.""

The Steelers also announced the elevation of cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. from the practice squad for Sunday's game, putting the 2021 second-round pick in line to make his season debut. Samuel gives the Steelers depth at a position that has dealt with recent injuries to starters Joey Porter Jr. (hip) and Darius Slay (concussion).

Samuel, ranked by ESPN as the No. 14 free agent in the offseason, signed with the Steelers' practice squad Nov. 11 after his offseason spinal fusion surgery.

""I feel great,"" Samuel said shortly after arriving in Pittsburgh. ""It's the healthiest I've ever been, been dealing with it, and I got it fixed, so now I feel good.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1125%2Fr1580576_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 17:59:33.480474

The four-time Pro Bowl center, who was attempting to end his retirement and return to the Lions this week, has failed his physical and will not be rejoining Detroit, the team announced Saturday.

""Frank Ragnow reported to our facility yesterday and went through the normal process of meetings,"" the Lions said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, during the routine meeting with our medical team, Frank failed his physical. The medical exam revealed a Grade 3 hamstring strain that will keep him from participating for the remainder of the regular season. For that reason, Frank will not be rejoining the Lions. Frank has always been a team-first guy and is a true warrior. He will forever be a Lion.""

Lions head coach Dan Campbell expressed his disappointment to reporters Saturday and said that the club was aware of a hamstring injury but the severity of it wasn't so clear until the physical. Campbell added that a potential return for Ragnow in 2026 was never discussed.

Ragnow, 29, retired in early June after weighing his future following a seven-year career.

The Lions moved Graham Glasgow from guard to center upon Ragnow's retirement. Rookie Tate Ratledge fulfilled Glasgow's old spot but injuries across Detroit's entire offensive line have cause problems for the offense.

Ragnow's decision to end his retirement after less than a full season was a welcomed happening for a Lions (7-5) team struggling to stack wins in recent weeks. Detroit will now have to go forward the same way in which its season started: without Ragnow.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/mwrokenwe1bcpbihsayh,N,,2025-11-29 16:00:40.062817

Landry III playing through a knee injury could explain his recent dip in production.","The Patriots are preparing for their first Monday Night Football matchup since the 2022 season, and several players will carry injury designations into Monday night's game vs. the Giants.

On Saturday, the Patriots ruled out G Jared Wilson (ankle) and special-teams ace Brenden Schooler (ankle) while OLB Harold Landry III (knee) and DT Khyiris Tonga (chest) are officially questionable for Monday night. For the Giants, QB Jaxson Dart has cleared concussion protocol and will start for New York. However, the Giants ruled out OLB Kayvon Thibodeaux (shoulder).

Starting on offense, New England will start its third different offensive line combination of the season vs. the Giants after rookie LT Will Campbell (knee) and G Jared Wilson (ankle) sustained injuries in the Patriots win over the Bengals last week. Campbell was placed on injured reserve earlier this week, meaning he'll miss at least the next four games, while Wilson remains on the active roster with what's reportedly a high-ankle sprain for the third-round guard. It's unclear when the Patriots could get their rookie linemen back, so for now, at least, they'll need two new starters against a formidable Giants defensive front.

On Wednesday, head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed that OT Vederian Lowe will start for Campbell at left tackle. Lowe finished last week's game after Campbell exited, allowing two hurries on 16 pass-blocking snaps. The fourth-year pro also started 13 games at left tackle for the Patriots last season, so Lowe has NFL experience on the blindside. At left guard, the expectation is that top interior backup Ben Brown will step in for Wilson. Brown was also the next man up in Cincinnati when Wilson was injured on the third play from scrimmage.

Although they were a part of an offensive line that struggled last season, Brown and Lowe are entering a much different situation with the Patriots at 10-2. New England's coaching staff, led by offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and offensive line coach Doug Marrone, is held in high regard in terms of aiding the offensive line with the help of chips, extra protectors to double-team bigger threats, and moving the pocket for QB Drake Maye. It's also worth noting that Maye will have his full complement of weapons at his disposal. The O-Line might be banged up, but Maye and the skill players can hopefully up their games to help out the line.

From this perspective, we could see more max-protection schemes in which the Patriots send only two or three receivers into the pattern. The Giants enter the week as the last-ranked run defense in yards per carry (5.9) and EPA per rush (+0.19). In theory, if New England could find a run game and then script heavy protections off play-action to push the ball downfield, they could attack a weakness in the Giants defense and keep Maye protected with six or seven blockers accounting for New York's talented pass rush.

Still, the Patriots rookies are a huge reason why the offensive line has improved this season. The Patriots are 20th in pass-blocking win rate and 15th in run-blocking win rate compared to 31st and 32nd in ESPN's win rate metrics in 2024. The Patriots will need Brown and Lowe to step up for however long they'll need to start, while it'll also be interesting to see how McDaniels and the coaching staff scheme around having two backups on the left side.

Moving over to the Patriots defense, Landry III (knee) and Tonga (chest) are two key pieces on the defensive front whose status are uncertain for Monday night's game.

Landry III has been managing a knee injury over the last few weeks, as he'll carry a questionable designation for the second consecutive game. Landry III playing through a knee injury could explain his recent dip in production. In the first five games, the Pats captain logged 3.5 sacks and 22 total pressures, but the veteran edge rusher only has two sacks and 14 total pressures in the last six games, a split that also coincides with an injury scare in New Orleans (Week 6). To his credit, Landry III is toughing it out through his knee injury, but the late bye week might be coming at a good time for the 29-year-old following Monday night's game.

As for Tonga, the big nose tackle's absence loomed large in the win over the Bengals, where the Patriots allowed their first 100-yard rusher of the season (Cincy RB Chase Brown). This season, New England is allowing +0.02 rush expected points added when Tonga isn't on the field, compared to -0.10 EPA per rush when Tonga is on the field – a huge difference. Tonga also plays a role on offense as a short-yardage lead blocker, causing a significant ripple effect to the Pats run defense and goal-line offense, which went 0-for-2 in Cincinnati last week.

Along with their banged-up nose tackle, standout DT Milton Williams (ankle) is also on injured reserve. Williams will miss his second of at least four games on Monday night. Alongside star DT Christian Barmore, the Patriots leaned on defensive tackles Cory Durden (33 snaps), practice-squad elevation Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (20 snaps), and DT Eric Gregory (18 snaps) against the Bengals. One would expect a similar rotation vs. the Giants, with Tonga hopefully available as well (Tonga only played 12 snaps on defense vs. the Bengals).

Lastly, special teams captain Brenden Schooler will miss just the second game of his career on Monday night due to an ankle injury. Replacing the All-Pro's impact while covering kicks and punts won't be easy, while it also complicates the depth chart since Schooler is on five different special-teams units. It'll be worth monitoring how effective the Patriots are at covering kicks, especially punts, without their leading tackler and best gunner on special teams.

The next step for the Patriots will be practice squad elevations, which don't need to be made official until Monday afternoon rather than the day before the game. One would expect that Pharms will be elevated for the second consecutive week, while another spot could go to a special teams contributor to help fill the void left behind by Schooler. New England will then host the Giants on Monday Night Football at Gillette Stadium at 8:15 p.m. ET.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/jvsv97biv3zaqwhupeet,N,,2025-11-29 17:59:37.426476

That was interim head coach Mike Kafka’s assessment.

Lawrence missed the last five games of the 2024 season due to a dislocated elbow. His current injury involves the same elbow. He played just 36 snaps, his second-lowest total of the season, Sunday against the Detroit Lions.

Lawrence could be one of several starting defenders out of the lineup Monday when Charlie Bullen debuts as the team’s interim defensive coordinator.

Micah McFadden has not played since Week 1 when he suffered a foot injury that required surgery.

In a positive development, safety Tyler Nubin (neck) and cornerback/kickoff returner Deonte Banks were upgraded from limited to full participation.

Miami Dolphins vs New Orleans Saints (Sunday, 1 p.m., FOX)

While not the flashiest of contests, the Dolphins have won back-to-back games for the first time this season. On the other end are the Saints (2-9), a struggling squad led by rookie quarterback Tyler Shough.

The Dolphins (4-7) are fresh off their bye week, which they used to prioritize health and recovery. Tight end Darren Waller is set to make his return after landing on IR since Oct. 22. The veteran route runner suffered a pectoral injury after finding the end zone four times in three games early in the season.

Miami’s playbook will open if Waller is able to play Sunday. Whether he is available or not, Dolphins running back De’Von Achane will be set to take charge once again. The third-year ball carrier is leading the Dolphins’ offense both on the ground and through the air.

Achane is No. 4 in the league in rushing yards (900) and has nine touchdowns on the year. He accumulated 226 and 165 total yards across the previous two weeks, respectively.

New Orleans’ run defense stacks up to No. 21 in the league. It allowed Los Angeles Rams rusher Kyren Williams to post 114 yards on 25 carries three weeks ago.

The Saints watched as Kirk Cousins and the Atlanta Falcons dominated in New Orleans. While Shough managed 243 passing yards, the rest of the squad forgot to show up. The team’s lack of rushing attack proved detrimental in the loss. Running back Alvin Kamara exited the contest early due to a knee injury that could keep him sidelined for some time.

Despite the Dolphins allowing the fourth-most rush yards per game, watch for Miami to dominate the trenches early. Shough was sacked five times against the Falcons and led the team with just 22 yards on the ground.

Best Black Friday Deal: Achane will find the end zone at least once Sunday.

Riley’s pick: Dolphins 28, Saints 10

Dalton’s pick: Dolphins 27, Saints 17

Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs Arizona Cardinals (Sunday, 1 p.m., FOX)

The Bucs’ injury bug has caught wind of quarterback Baker Mayfield. One of the toughest gun slingers in the league went down on Sunday Night Football with a shoulder injury.

While it is not determined how much time he will miss, Mayfield’s ailment hurts the team in various aspects. Bucs fans will watch backup Teddy Bridgewater at the helm if Mayfield is unable to suit up on Sunday.

Although, Tampa Bay (6-5) inched closer to seeing some offensive weapons return. Running back Bucky Irving is set to play after missing seven weeks. Also, wide receiver Chris Godwin Jr. was welcomed back last week.

Both the Bucs and Cardinals (3-8) are in the midst of a losing streak. Each NFC squad has dropped its last three contests.

Cards quarterback Jacoby Brissett has taken the league by storm, even if he has not produced wins. The journeyman has averaged 314.5 yards since taking over for the injured Kyler Murray.

Brissett is set to face the No. 27 pass defense in the league on Sunday. The Bucs allowed Rams QB Matthew Stafford to throw for 273 yards and three touchdowns. Brissett has surpassed that yards total on four separate occasions this year.

The last time Tampa Bay and Arizona faced off was on Christmas in 2022. The Bucs pulled out the 19-16 win in overtime, sending the series record to 11-11.

Best Black Friday Deal: Brissett will throw for more than 275 yards for the fifth time this year.

Riley: Buccaneers 24, Cardinals 21

Dalton: Buccaneers 28, Cardinals 10

Jacksonville Jaguars at Tennessee Titans (Sunday, 1 p.m., CBS)

The Jags (7-4) may be the league’s largest wild cards. They pulled out an overtime victory last week in Arizona, dominated the Chargers the week prior and barely managed a win against the Raiders two games before that.

Quarterback Trevor Lawrence is in the midst of the team’s question marks. The former first overall draft selection tossed three touchdowns in the win — plus three interceptions.

The Tennessee native now has 14 scores with 11 picks and has been sacked 29 times. The brightest spot on the Jags’ offense has been running back Travis Etienne Jr.

Etienne, Lawrence’s teammate at Clemson, has 815 rushing yards and seven total scores this season. He found the end zone for the fourth time in three games in last week’s win.

The Titans (1-10) hold the league’s No. 25 run defense, so watch out for Etienne to produce another quality performance.

Tennessee sits among the bottom of the league across the board. With its one win coming against the Cardinals in Week 5, the Titans have floundered since.

Rookie quarterback Cam Ward posted one of his best games last week with 256 passing yards and a 66.7 completion rate. The 2025 first overall draft pick has been sacked a league-leading 45 times.

The Jags are No. 5 in quarterback hurries with 45. Jacksonville will find its third consecutive win if it can generate pressure on Ward.

Best Black Friday Deal: The Jaguars will bring Ward down upward of four times.

Several key quarterbacks and playmaking skill players are managing injuries ranging from AC joint sprains to high ankle sprains to concussions, and these situations can dramatically alter fantasy outcomes. Below, we break down the latest medical context, return-to-play expectations, and real fantasy-football implications based on biomechanics, tissue-healing timelines, and historical performance data, giving you the edge you need to win your matchup this week.

Quarterbacks

Baker Mayfield

Injury: Left AC joint sprain

Analysis: Baker is dealing with either a grade I or II left AC joint sprain. These grades are always treated conservatively and tell us the joint is stable enough to be played through. Given that this is Baker's non-throwing shoulder, his ability to deliver the ball down the field is not a concern. The only concern with this injury is if Baker takes just one bad hit, his injury could be aggravated and knock him out of the game. The re-injury possibility is a real risk, and while his production while on the field won't be affected, fantasy managers will want to see at least who else they could start in Baker's place this week. If there is no one good available, you can still roll the dice with Baker.

Daniel Jones

Injury: Left Fibula fracture

Analysis: Jones is playing through a fracture in his left fibula. The fibula is one of the two bones in the lower leg, and the good news is that the fibula only bears about 15-20% of body weight during heavy activity, which is why Jones can push through. His ability to play also indicates this is a small break, whereas Omarion Hampton has missed the last seven weeks with a fibula fracture. The single most important factor here that is allowing Jones to continue to play is that it is his left fibula, not his right. A right-handed passer drives off the right foot and ankle for throwing power. The lateral portion of the lower leg (where the fibula is located) is particularly stressed during throwing. If this were Jones' right leg, he would be in a tough position attempting to throw.

Practice videos did show Jones limping and looking slower during his three and five-step drops (when the left leg is predominantly pushing off), but reporters stated that overall, he looked good. Jones should retain value while playing through his injury, but rushing upside will be reduced, and there is absolutely risk for worsening the injury.",https://fantasyinjuryteam.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bucky-Irving-full-pic-2.webp,N,,2025-11-29 16:01:16.066978

Both starting tackles, Dion Dawkins and Spencer Brown, have been ruled out for Sunday’s showdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Bills’ injury situation has been a massive challenge all season, mostly on the defensive side of the ball, but now the offense is facing a major problem up front against a Pittsburgh defense that features two outstanding edge rushers in TJ Watt and Nate Herbig.

Dawkins suffered a concussion in the loss to Houston and has not been able to clear the NFL’s protocol, and Brown went down with a shoulder injury and it was pretty clear he had no chance of playing when that happened. The Dawkins situation is a little different because he finished the loss to the Texans, but the symptoms popped up the next day and he’s still experiencing issues.

Buffalo Bills injury report: Other players ruled out

Coach Sean McDermott also ruled out linebacker Terrel Bernard due to the dislocated elbow he suffered at Houston, and wide receiver Curtis Samuel is out with elbow and knee injuries. And then following practice, Samuel was placed on injured reserve, a move that could ultimately be the end of his vastly unimpressive and disappointing time with the Bills.

In place of Dawkins and Brown, Ryan Van Demark will certainly be one of the starters, probably at left tackle, but on the right side, it’s uncertain who will play. Rookie Chase Lundt is an option, but second-year man Tylan Grable could get the call.

Grable has missed the entire season due to a concussion, but the Bills opened his 21-day practice window this week, so he could be added to the 53-man roster if the coaching staff believes he’s ready to go.

On Wednesday, McDermott said of Grable, “He’s a young player that we have a lot of confidence in. He hasn’t played in a while - he went out, I believe, in preseason there, if not before. So we get that, we understand that. We’ll just take it one day at a time, and he’ll work back in and we’ll go from there.”

With Bernard out, Shaq Thompson will likely start next to Matt Milano, and with Samuel now done, the Bills have several ways they could go at receiver. The first occurred after the Samuel IR news as Gabe Davis was officially signed off the practice squad to the 53-man roster. What we can also expect is that Keon Coleman will play after he was a healthy scratch the last two games. Lastly, Brandin Cooks is almost assuredly going to play even though was added to the team Tuesday.

Both Coleman and Cooks may need to be up because there is a question regarding Joshua Palmer’s availability. His ankle injury that forced him to miss three games has flared up and he did not practice Thursday and was limited on Friday.

If Palmer can’t play, all the Bills have is Khalil Shakir, Tyrell Shavers, Davis, Coleman, and Cooks.

Bills players who have a chance of playing vs Steelers

As for tight end Dalton Kincaid, he has been limited all week in practice and he’ll be questionable at best for the game.

Cornerback Maxwell Hairston, who was in concussion protocol during the week, practiced in full Thursday and Friday and McDermott said he’s moving in the right direction, so he will likely be able to play.

NFL Week 13 lands right on Thanksgiving, and Roger Goodell actually did something right for once – a full slate, no byes, and wall-to-wall football from Thursday through the weekend.

That’s awesome for fans… and a landmine field for fantasy managers.

With all 32 teams playing, roster management becomes brutal. You need to know who’s trending in, who’s trending out, and where lingering injuries are quietly nuking your floor and ceiling in both IDP and offensive spots.

NFL Week 13 Injury Report – Episode Breakdown & Timestamps

00:00 – Thanksgiving Slate & Why Week 13 Is Different

Doc sets the scene: a full Thanksgiving week with all 32 teams active, no byes, and why roster management is more important than ever.

00:31 – IDP-First Format & How to Use This Show

Explanation of the IDP-heavy structure, why most injury content is offense-only, and how this series gives defensive diehards the edge.

02:28 – Patrick Surtain Pec Strain (Broncos)

Doc explains why Surtain’s return to limited practice after a mid-grade pec strain is a strong sign he’s nearing game action, and why skipping IR always hinted at a 3–6 week timeline.

05:06 – Arizona Cardinals Defensive Injury Cluster (Nolan, Browning, Sweat, Taylor-Demerson)

Walter Nolan (knee), Baron Browning (concussion), Josh Sweat (eye), and Daydrian Taylor-Demerson (ankle) all sit Wednesday, with Doc flagging Browning and Demerson as the bigger red flags after already missing last week.

07:48 – Will Johnson’s Back/Hip Return Window (Cardinals)

Rookie CB Will Johnson finally logs a limited practice after multiple weeks out; Doc sees this as a strong “trending in” sign but warns that no full practice by Friday could mean a ramp-up week instead of full snaps.

08:51 – Carolina Panthers: Christian Roseboom & JC Horn Concussion Watch

Roseboom (hip) misses another Wednesday after sitting last week, while Horn lands in the concussion protocol after a monster two-INT game; Doc walks through modern concussion timelines and why both are on the pessimistic side if they don’t practice by Thursday.

12:03 – Terrel Bernard Elbow Injury (Bills)

Bernard’s sling on the sideline and no practice after a mini-bye screams “doubtful” to Doc, who explains why this doesn’t look like a full dislocation but still profiles as a multi-week problem.

13:26 – Chicago Bears Secondary Returns vs. Linebacker Carnage

Kyler Gordon (calf) and Jaylon Johnson (groin) stack full practices and look ready to be activated off IR, while TJ Edwards (hamstring), Noah Sewell (elbow), and Tyrique Stevenson (hip) all pile up DNPs and sit firmly in the doubtful bucket.

15:39 – Trey Hendrickson Hip Mystery Lingers (Bengals)

Hendrickson is still out, hasn’t practiced, and Doc calls out the disconnect between early “minor” coach-speak and a now multi-week absence that never went to IR.

17:04 – Denzel Ward Migraines (Browns)

Ward misses with migraines, and Doc compares this to a recent IR stint for a similar issue, noting that severity can range from a short blip to something that behaves like a concussion in terms of availability.

18:12 – Kerby Joseph’s Lingering Absence (Lions)

Joseph is ruled out again with still no real on-field progress, and Doc questions why he never hit IR given the length of the absence.

18:48 – Terrion Arnold Concussion Timeline (Lions)

Arnold already missed one game but returns to practice and carries a questionable tag; Doc notes that when teams leave concussed players “questionable” on a short week, they usually expect them to be active.

19:46 – Packers Secondary & LB Question Marks (Walker, Hobbs, Nixon)

LB Quay Walker (stinger), CB Nate Hobbs, and CB Keisean Nixon are all banged up and questionable; Doc explains why neck/stinger issues are scary but the fact Walker’s already practicing is encouraging, and why all three are true 50/50 calls.

21:19 – Travon Walker Knee Concern (Jaguars)

Travon Walker still isn’t practicing after multiple weeks out with a vague “knee” designation, and Doc flags the lack of detail and lack of ramp-up work as worrying for Week 13 availability.

22:09 – Ahkello Witherspoon’s Clavicle Return (Rams)

Witherspoon logs a full practice after a fractured collarbone, and Doc explains why fractures are simple: once cleared for contact, you’re generally “all the way back.”

23:06 – Rams Secondary & Front Seven Nicks (Kinchens & Byron Young)

Safety Kamren Kinchens (shoulder) and OLB Byron Young (knee) both sit Wednesday; Doc isn’t panicking yet but says back-to-back DNPs would flip them from “monitor” to “real concern.”

23:45 – Giants Edge/Interior Issues: Kayvon Thibodeaux & Dexter Lawrence

Thibodeaux’s mysterious multi-week shoulder absence and Lawrence’s flare-up in the previously surgically repaired elbow have Doc leaning pessimistic, both for Week 13 and for Lawrence’s fantasy usefulness in general.

25:12 – Eagles Safety Room Shakeup: Andrew Mukuba, Reed Blankenship & Brandon Graham

Rookie Andrew Mukuba hits IR with an ankle fracture that’s likely season-ending; Reed Blankenship looks more like a thigh/knee contusion and trends toward playing, while Brandon Graham’s groin plus “off the couch” conditioning put him in more of a true questionable bucket.

26:56 – 49ers High Ankle Woes: Sam O. & Tatum Bethune

Sam Okuayinonu suffers a high ankle sprain, and Doc explains why even mild versions are 4–6 week issues; Tatum Bethune is already out multiple weeks with a similar injury and is projected to sit at least 2–3 more.

28:29 – Buccaneers Edge & Corner Update: Haason Reddick & Jamel Dean

Reddick and Dean both return to practice Wednesday; Doc likes Dean’s chances to play, but based on Todd Bowles’ history with Bucky Irving and Chris Godwin, he expects a more conservative ramp-up for Reddick after a multi-week absence.

29:26 – Transition to Offensive Rundown

Doc signs off the defensive diehards and pivots to a fast, offense-focused injury rundown for fantasy managers who play both sides of the ball.

29:47 – Marvin Harrison Jr. (Appendectomy) – Cardinals WR

Back at practice after two weeks off post-appendectomy, and trending strongly toward playing in Week 13.

30:04 – Drake London PCL Injury (Falcons)

Doc explains why PCL injuries are nasty and why London being tagged doubtful fits a multi-week expectation rather than a quick bounce-back.

30:18 – Joe Burrow Returns; Tee Higgins Out (Bengals)

Burrow is activated off IR with full practices and is locked in as a start, while Higgins is ruled out with a concussion on a short week.

30:47 – Josh Allen Elbow Update (Bills)

Despite taking eight sacks and getting beat up, Allen logs a full practice off the mini-bye and is cleared as full go.

31:00 – CJ Stroud Concussion Clearance (Texans)

Stroud finally returns as a full participant after a rare three-game concussion absence and is expected back under center.

31:16 – Brian Thomas Jr. High Ankle Sprain (Jaguars)

Thomas is limited in practice after two missed games; Doc notes that Week 3 off a high ankle is still dicey but the practice trend is promising.

31:36 – Omari(on) Hampton Ankle Fracture Return (Panthers)

Hampton was originally billed as a “high ankle sprain” but actually had an ankle fracture; he’s back practicing, with Doc expecting either a ramp-up week or a carefully managed workload.

32:04 – Alvin Kamara & Devin Neal Backfield Outlook (Saints)

Kamara is doubtful after an ugly roll-up, opening the door for Devin Neal to function as the RB1 with Kendre Miller already out for the year.

32:20 – Jackson Dart Concussion Protocol (Jets)

Dart is a full participant on Wednesday before a Monday game; Doc would be shocked if he doesn’t clear protocol in time to start.

32:37 – Bucky Irving Foot/Shoulder Recovery (Buccaneers)

Irving logs a full Wednesday session after a long foot/shoulder grind and is positioned to roll into a great matchup versus a beat-up Cardinals defense.

32:51 – Jayden Daniels Return Timeline (Commanders)

Daniels is back practicing but expected to sit Week 13; Doc expects Washington to be cautious and circle next week for his return in a lost season.

Offensive Injury Rundown: Quick Fantasy Impact

Here’s the condensed fantasy lens from Doc’s offensive segment:

Marvin Harrison Jr. (Cardinals WR, appendectomy)

Back at practice after a two-week absence.

👉 Fantasy: Treat him as in if he avoids setbacks — start as usual in all formats.

Drake London (Falcons WR, PCL)

Tagged doubtful and dealing with the same tricky ligament that wrecked Ricky Pearsall and Puka Nacua for stretches.

👉 Fantasy: Expect multiple weeks out. Plan alternatives for both Week 13 and potentially Week 14.

Joe Burrow (Bengals QB, IR return)

Full practices, activated, and historically shreds the Ravens.

👉 Fantasy: Locked-in QB1. Don’t get cute — start him.

Tee Higgins (Bengals WR, concussion)

Short week + concussion = already ruled out.

👉 Fantasy: Bench. Boost volume expectations for other Bengals pass-catchers.

Josh Allen (Bills QB, elbow)

Took a beating but full-go off the mini-bye.

👉 Fantasy: Auto-start; no meaningful downgrade.

CJ Stroud (Texans QB, concussion)

Unusually long, three-game absence but now a full participant.

👉 Fantasy: If active, treat as normal Stroud — locked into starting consideration.

Brian Thomas Jr. (Jaguars WR, high ankle)

Two weeks missed, back limited.

👉 Fantasy: Fringe WR3/flex if active, but understand re-aggravation and limited snap risk in his first game back.

Omari(on) Hampton (Panthers RB, ankle fracture)

True 2–3 month fracture, now back practicing.

👉 Fantasy: If activated, expect a ramp-up week with split usage before full workloads return.

Alvin Kamara (Saints RB, lower leg)

No practice and described as doubtful after an ugly roll-up.

👉 Fantasy: Treat as out. Devin Neal becomes a volume-driven RB2 with upside if the Saints don’t overcomplicate things.

Devin Neal (Saints RB)

Next man up with Kamara doubtful and Kendre Miller out for the season.

👉 Fantasy: Strong plug-and-play option in deeper leagues; viable DFS value play.

Jackson Dart (Jets QB, concussion)

Full participant ahead of a Monday game.

👉 Fantasy: All signs point to him starting; viable in superflex and 2QB formats.

Bucky Irving (Buccaneers RB, foot/shoulder)

Full Wednesday practice after an extended absence.

👉 Fantasy: If active, green light as an RB2/FLEX in a soft matchup vs an injured Cardinals defense.

Jayden Daniels (Commanders QB)

Back practicing but expected to sit one more.

👉 Fantasy: Bench for Week 13, but stash where possible — Doc expects him back next week with the franchise focused on long-term health.

Expert OVER/UNDER Betting & Fantasy Football Takeaway

Doc’s Week 13 board isn’t just noise; it changes how you should attack both fantasy and betting:

High ankle sprains linger

Guys like Sam Okuayinonu, Tatum Bethune, and Brian Thomas Jr. are dealing with high ankles — even when they’re active, explosion and lateral movement usually lag for weeks.

👉 Don’t chase “he’s back!” hype with overs or ceiling projections right away.

Concussions are still mostly multi-week

Baron Browning, JC Horn, Terrion Arnold, Tee Higgins, Jackson Dart, and CJ Stroud are all on different points of the concussion spectrum. The pattern: most guys still miss at least one week, and second-week returns require clean limited-to-full practice progression.

👉 If there’s any doubt, fade fragile overs and lean toward safer floor options.

Neck injuries & stingers are major red flags

Quay Walker’s “stinger” and prior neck issues get special attention from Doc. Neck + football is a bad combo.

👉 In IDP, don’t over-commit to guys returning from neck trouble until they prove they’re past it with full snaps.

Fractures are binary: out, then all the way in

Ahkello Witherspoon and Andrew Mukuba show both sides: once cleared, Witherspoon should function at or near normal. Mukuba, meanwhile, is effectively done for 2025 outside of a miracle Super Bowl timeline.

👉 When fracture guys return, you can usually trust the role. But don’t expect them to beat the calendar.

IR returns and ramp-up weeks matter for snap share

Between Kyler Gordon, Jaylon Johnson, Will Johnson, Haason Reddick, Omari(on) Hampton, and Bucky Irving, you’ve got a cluster of potential “active, but not fully featured” players.

👉 For fantasy and props, favor healthy full-practice players with clear roles over “returning” names with ambiguous snap counts.

IDP replacement snaps are gold

Chicago’s linebacker room, the Cardinals’ defense, the Giants’ front, the Lions’ secondary, and others are all thinned out.

👉 In IDP, you win Week 13 by chasing clean snaps and opportunity on these patched-together units instead of clinging to big names who are 50/50 at best.

Bottom line for Week 13:

Prioritize health, volume, and clarity over brand names with sketchy medicals.

With a full slate and no byes, you don’t need to force questionable tags into lineups just to field a team.

,,2025-11-29 13:34:00+00:00,www.buccaneers.com,Baker Mayfield On Track to Start Against Cardinals - Tampa Bay Buccaneers,Scott Smith,,,,,https://www.buccaneers.com/news/baker-mayfield-track-start-against-cardinals-week-13-2025,"The Tampa Bay Buccaneers may not have to make a change at quarterback after all.
And, as of the end of the final practice on Friday, Head Coach Todd Bowles was ready to say that Mayfield is on track to keep his starting streak alive on Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.
Mayfield was deemed a non-participant in a walk-through practice on Wednesday and was still limited on Thursday but showed clear improvement by the end of the week.
If Mayfield had been sidelined by his injury, Teddy Bridgewater would have made his first start as a Buccaneer.
Tampa Bay has lost three in a row but remains in first place in the NFC South and has not lost any faith in its ability to achieve its goals for 2025.","The Tampa Bay Buccaneers may not have to make a change at quarterback after all.

Baker Mayfield, who has started every game for the Buccaneers since the 2023 season opener, watched the second half of the team's loss in Los Angeles from the sideline with his left arm in a sling, generating significant concern that he would miss some time during the playoff stretch run. However, positive results from MRI exams indicated no structural damage in his left shoulder and he has steadily progressed during the Bucs' week of practice.

And, as of the end of the final practice on Friday, Head Coach Todd Bowles was ready to say that Mayfield is on track to keep his starting streak alive on Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.

""We have,"" said Bowles when asked if he had made a decision at quarterback. ""He looked good today so he's trending to play.""

Mayfield was deemed a non-participant in a walk-through practice on Wednesday and was still limited on Thursday but showed clear improvement by the end of the week.

""He had to get well,"" said Bowles. ""He was very limited on Wednesday, he did a little more yesterday and he moved around perfectly today, so he's fine.""

If Mayfield had been sidelined by his injury, Teddy Bridgewater would have made his first start as a Buccaneer. The Buccaneers also likely would have either promoted rookie quarterback Connor Bazelak to the active roster or elevated him from the practice squad for game day. The team could still make that latter move if it feels any uncertainty about Mayfield's status, but that decision doesn't have to be made until 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.

Though the Bucs have full confidence in Bridgewater, a 12th-year veteran who has a career 33-32 record as a starting quarterback in the NFL, there's little doubt that the presence of Mayfield, the team's emotional leader, would give them a boost on Sunday against the Cardinals. Tampa Bay has lost three in a row but remains in first place in the NFC South and has not lost any faith in its ability to achieve its goals for 2025.

""We've got plenty of confidence; we never lost that,"" said Bowles. ""It's just picking up on the little things from an execution standpoint. We all know we have to do our jobs better, and that's coaches and players, but it has nothing to do with confidence. Just execution.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/vumszcfvlr8jyf5u14dk,N,,2025-11-29 13:03:12.239123
,,2025-11-29 13:11:47+00:00,ESPN.com,Jaxson Dart (concussion) to start Giants' MNF game vs. Pats - ESPN,"Jordan Raanan, Kris Rhim, Josh Weinfuss, Stephen Holder, Alaina Getzenberg, Marcel Louis-Jacques, Nick Wagoner, ESPN Fantasy, Mike Clay, Todd Archer",,,,,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47130570/jaxson-dart-concussion-start-giants-mnf-game-vs-pats,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Jaxson Dart is unequivocally back as the starting quarterback for the New York Giants.
The Giants announced Dart officially cleared concussion protocol on Thursday.
But Dart slid twice and thought the hit that caused his concussion wasn't one he could've completely avoided.
Dart praised the Giants medical staff even though he returned to the contest for two more plays following the injury.
""And Coach [Daboll], who knows if I'm here without him.","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Jaxson Dart is unequivocally back as the starting quarterback for the New York Giants. And he will be taking all the first-team reps this week in preparation for the New England Patriots on ""Monday Night Football,"" interim coach Mike Kafka said on Friday.

The Giants announced Dart officially cleared concussion protocol on Thursday. He had missed the previous two games with Jameis Winston starting in his place.

""I'm ready. I've been waiting for it,"" Dart said after practice on Friday. ""Obviously these primetime games are the ones you have circled on your calendar. I'm excited to go out there, compete at a high level and do everything in my power to rally these guys to put our team in the best situation when the clock hits zero that we're going to come out with a win.""

New York (2-10) has dropped six straight games. Meanwhile, the Patriots (10-2) have won nine straight.

The Giants will be trying to snap a franchise-record 12-game road skid with their rookie quarterback back behind center.

""It's great to get him back in the mix,"" Kafka said. ""He's been prepping.""

Dart came close to returning last week. He felt he could play, but the doctors thought otherwise. The first-round pick didn't clear the concussion protocol.

Now, he returns knowing there must be more prudence about the hits he takes. Dart is taking almost 10 hits per game.

Even though Dart thought he did better in the game in which he sustained a concussion Nov. 9 in Chicago, it was still the fourth time in eight games dating back to the preseason that he needed to be evaluated for a concussion. That equals a lot of time being off the field.

""Moving forward, I have to be more available for this team,"" Dart said. ""This is obviously on the forefront of my mind moving forward.""

Dart took exception to the idea that his head was getting checked during all those concussion tests. He said that was not the case. Some of the previous tests were prompted by other potential warnings signs, such as him being out of breath or having a stinger, not direct hits to the head, he said.

The bottom line is that Dart still had to leave the game in all four circumstances. And the actual concussion cost him two games during his rookie season.

""I'm still getting used to this game. I'm getting used to this speed, this level,"" Dart said. ""In college, you can watch my tape, I very rarely slid. This is a different beast. For me, I have to obviously be more responsible when I'm in the open field. But I felt I was getting better at it each and every week.""

Dart didn't see any hits in the Chicago matchup that he should've avoided. He thought he was playing smart as former coach Brian Daboll and the Giants called six designed runs in that contest. But Dart slid twice and thought the hit that caused his concussion wasn't one he could've completely avoided.

Dart praised the Giants medical staff even though he returned to the contest for two more plays following the injury. They eventually pulled him between quarters.

""I wasn't in a good space to be out there,"" Dart said.

Dart will be playing his first game without Daboll, who was fired on Nov. 10. He started his first press conference since the injury with an opening statement about his former head coach.

Daboll and Dart were known to have a strong relationship, on and off the field.

""I have all the respect in the world for him. He's an incredible offensive mind. He's done an amazing job developing me up until this point, and you know, this business is a beast,"" Dart said. ""Give a shout to coach Shane [Bowen] as well. We just weren't able to get enough wins for them. But at the same time, got a lot of respect for them.

""And Coach [Daboll], who knows if I'm here without him. So I have all the respect for him and love for him.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0929%2Fr1552748_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 16:01:23.520549

,,2025-11-29 13:01:07+00:00,NBC News,An injured star QB could play soon. Does that mean it's worth it? - NBC News,Andrew Greif,,,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/nfl-commanders-bengals-injury-quarterback-rcna245939,"The game’s outcome had effectively been determined when star Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels trotted out for another possession with 12 minutes remaining on Nov. 2.
Less than a month later, the Commanders’ season now appears to be a lost cause.
We are 3-8.” Daniels isn’t wired that way, said Herm Edwards, the former NFL coach who also briefly coached Daniels in college at Arizona State.

Broncos (9-2) at Commanders (3-8): Denver QB Bo Nix has five game-winning drives this season, tied with Chicago’s Caleb Williams for most in the league.","The game’s outcome had effectively been determined when star Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels trotted out for another possession with 12 minutes remaining on Nov. 2.

Down 31 points to Seattle, Washington chose to keep Daniels, last season’s NFL offensive rookie of the year and the franchise’s cornerstone, in the game rather than sit him to avoid the risk of injury. Ten plays later, Daniels fell awkwardly on the elbow of his left, nonthrowing arm, dislocating it.

The drumbeat began as soon as Daniels started writhing on the turf. Sure, he was healthy. But why was he still in the game?

Less than a month later, the Commanders’ season now appears to be a lost cause. With their 3-8 record and less than a 1% chance of making the playoffs, according to one analysis, there’s a new question in Washington. Though Daniels could be healthy enough to return by early December, does that mean the team should let him take the field and again risk injury?

“You’re just got to try to do what’s best for the player,” Commanders coach Dan Quinn said this week. “We know what we’re looking to do and how we want to do it, but by no means are we careless about that. It’s important not just for Jayden, but important for our entire team.”

What is best, in Quinn’s view, is that Daniels continues to play, to benefit his long-term improvement. As Quinn said on Wednesday: “We would not put him out there if he’s not able to fully express who he is as a player.”

Daniels is one of the NFL’s most exciting young players, but not all Washington fans want to see him play again in these circumstances.

“We know what Jayden can do. We saw it last year and we’ve even seen it in games this year against the Chargers. He looked fantastic,” said Mark Manjardi, a lifelong fan of the franchise who was so dedicated he flew to Spain to watch the team face Miami in November, in a game Daniels missed.

“I just think the the worst-case scenario far, far, far outweighs the best-case scenario, which is, ‘Oh, he looks like his old self again,’ and we still have no chance of doing anything this year anyway. … Even if Jayden wants to play, which she obviously does, think long term. Think next year. This is a lost season. It sucks but it is what it is.”

The Commanders aren’t the only team who could, theoretically, place their franchise star in proverbial bubble wrap and tank the rest of the season with the aim of earning a better draft pick.

The practice is common late in NBA seasons by teams already far from playoff consideration. Though NBA teams do not explicitly say so, team executives, agents and players have long shared their belief that shelving a promising player for the remainder of a season often has more to do with improving a team’s odds of landing a high draft pick than it does with the severity of an injury.

NFL teams this season, however, seem to be deferring to players. Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a turf toe injury in Week 2 and missed the next nine weeks as his team cratered to a 3-8 record, with commentators making their case for why neither the Bengals, nor Burrow, were best-served by continuing to play him. Yet Burrow said returning on Thanksgiving would be meaningful to him.

“He’s a football player. He wants to play football,” Bengals coach Zac Taylor said earlier this week. “We want to win football games. That will lead into that decision.”

It’s safe to say the Bengals were glad they made the decision to start Burrow, who threw two touchdowns in Thursday’s 32-14 win against Baltimore.

Angst around the risk of Daniels hurting himself again has grown because his elbow dislocation was his third injury this season, after he previously missed three games for a sprained knee and tweaked hamstring.

Matthew Berry, a fantasy football expert for NBC Sports, posted on X, “begging my beloved Commanders. This is not our year. We should not risk further injury to our franchise QB in a lost year. He shouldn’t have been playing at the end of a blow-out loss and he shouldn’t play again this season. We are 3-8.”

Daniels isn’t wired that way, said Herm Edwards, the former NFL coach who also briefly coached Daniels in college at Arizona State.

“You’re going to have to tie him down for him not to play,” Edwards told a D.C. radio show recently. “You want a guy like that. If he would sit there and say, ‘Well, I’m done. We’re 3-8 now’ — that ain’t who he is.”

But, Edwards was pressed by a radio host: Should Daniels play when the playoff upside is so remote?

“The season is now, and he got to play now. Are you kidding me?” Edwards said. “That’s what they do. Football players play football. They don’t do anything else. That’s their job. He’s not going to say, ‘Hey man, you know’ — he don’t care. He wants to play, he wants to compete.”

Daniels confirmed that sentiment when telling reporters Tuesday, “If I’m healthy and ready to go, I want to be out there.”

Washington ranks in the league’s bottom half in sacks allowed. Its next two opponents, meanwhile — Denver and Minnesota — are known for harassing defenses to a degree that borders on maniacal. Denver, which faces Washington on Sunday, has 49 sacks, seven more than the league’s second-place team. The Vikings, who await on Dec. 7, blitz more often than anyone.

Still, Daniels could soon be suiting up again anyway. If, or when, that happens, some fans will be watching through their fingers.

What else we're watching for in Week 13

49ers (8-4) at Browns (3-8): Cleveland defensive end Myles Garrett is threatening to break the NFL’s single-season sack record of 22.5, with 18 sacks in just 11 games. Those 18 sacks are more than Carolina, San Francisco and Cincinnati have recorded as teams this season.

Jaguars (7-4) at Titans (1-10): Tennessee’s home losing streak currently sits at 10 games. Jacksonville is 5-1 against the Titans since 2022. If the No. 1 pick and Titans quarterback throws for multiple touchdowns Sunday, it would be the first instance of his career.

Texans (6-5) at Colts (8-3): The league’s No. 1 scoring offense (Colts, 31.0 points per game) faces the No. 2 scoring defense (Texans, 16.6 points per game). The Colts are 6-0 at home.

Saints (2-9) at Dolphins (4-7): Tua Tagovailoa’s 13 interceptions are one away from tying his career high. Miami’s last two opponents have been held to 13 points each.

Falcons (4-7) at Jets (2-9): New York is the first team in NFL history with one or fewer turnovers through 11 games in a season since turnovers were first tracked in 1933. Kirk Cousins is 8-8 as a Falcons starter since last season.

Cardinals (3-8) at Buccaneers (6-5): Tampa’s final six games are against teams that do not currently have a winning record. Cardinals tight end Trey McBride’s 301 career receptions are tied with Jimmy Graham for the most by a tight in their first four seasons in NFL history, per NBC Sports research.

Rams (9-2) at Panthers (6-6): The Rams own the best outright record in the NFC. Carolina has been outscored by 53 points in the aggregate, which is the worst mark by a .500-or-better team through 12 games since the 2019 Raiders, per NBC Sports research.

Vikings (4-7) at Seahawks (8-3): Seattle wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba has a league-leading 1,313 receiving yards, which is only 290 yards fewer than the entire Jets roster. Minnesota’s three-game losing streak is one shy of its longest under coach Kevin O’Connell.

Bills (7-4) at Steelers (6-5): Josh Allen is 4-1 in his career against the Steelers. Buffalo, however, has failed to score 20 or more points in all three of its road losses.

Raiders (2-9) at Chargers (7-4): Raiders coach Pete Carroll has never lost six straight games in his career, but his current team is riding a five-game losing streak.

Broncos (9-2) at Commanders (3-8): Denver QB Bo Nix has five game-winning drives this season, tied with Chicago’s Caleb Williams for most in the league. Denver has won eight straight games while Washington has lost six consecutive.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251125-jayden-daniels-commanders-mn-1515-3468ca.jpg",N,,2025-11-29 11:01:59.225043

Hampton hasn't played since Week 5, when he suffered a left ankle fracture that landed him on injured reserve. Coach Jim Harbaugh said Hampton is ""on track"" to return but didn't specify when he'd return. ""Gosh, he looked good,"" Harbaugh said.

Hampton, who returned to practice Tuesday, said he felt ""amazing"" being back on the field. He was hopeful he'd play Sunday, but was leaving it up to the team's medical staff.

""It hurt kind of. Sitting here can't help my team,"" Hampton said. ""So, it's going to feel good to help my team out a little bit more.""

With Hampton out another game, the Chargers will again lean on running back Kimani Vidal. The Chargers released Vidal, their sixth-round pick in 2024, before roster cuts to 53 players. He returned to the practice squad and was signed to the active roster after the injuries to Hampton and running back Najee Harris.

Vidal, who had only 43 carries for 155 yards last season, has emerged as a ""No. 1 running back,"" according to Harbaugh. Vidal has two games over 100 rushing yards, and since Week 6, he has totaled 399 rushing yards, which ranks 17th in the NFL.

The Chargers took Hampton with the 22nd pick in April, and were hopeful that he and veteran Harris could form the rushing offense that Harbaugh had envisioned when he was hired.

Hampton had a slow start to the season but quickly became one of the Chargers' most important players after Harris sustained a season-ending Achilles rupture in the first half against the Denver Broncos in Week 3. With Harris down, L.A. leaned heavily on Hampton, who broke out with a team-high 129 yards from scrimmage and his first NFL touchdown in a 23-20 win.

Hampton had been a consistent, bruising force on the ground and a safety valve in the passing game for Herbert, catching 17 passes from Weeks 3 to 5, tied for second most on the team with wide receiver Keenan Allen. Hampton was also third in the NFL in yards from scrimmage (364) over that span.

""I feel like I was getting a little comfortable,"" Hampton said. ""I feel like I haven't reached my full potential yet.""

Now, the Chargers will have to wait at least another week for Hampton's return.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1128%2Fr1582096_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 15:01:12.167936

The Seahawks are flying high in their first season quarterbacked by Sam Darnold, who signed a three-year, $100 million deal in free agency to replace Geno Smith.

Darnold inked that contract after reviving his career in Minnesota last season, during which he filled in for an injured J.J. McCarthy and led the Vikings back to the playoffs with a 14-3 record.

[Get more Vikings news: Minnesota team feed]

McCarthy, embattled in his second season in the league, hasn't cleared protocol yet after suffering a concussion in an embarrassing loss to the Green Bay Packers last week. So the Vikings are rolling with Max Brosmer under center. Minnesota plans to elevate John Wolford as Brosmer's backup Sunday, ESPN's Kevin Seifert reported Friday.

“Pleased with where he’s at,” Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell said of McCarthy Friday. “He’s progressing but just not able to clear the last few steps. Quite honestly, I have pretty strong feelings on just when guys do get a concussion and where they’re at in regards to the next week. Always want to leave it open to the doctors’ ultimate say and decision. And the protocol is in place for a reason.""

Brosmer, who played four seasons at the University of New Hampshire and one more at Minnesota to wrap up his college career, didn't hear his name called in this year's NFL Draft. The Vikings signed him as an undrafted free agent, and he raised eyebrows in the preseason, completing 35-of-58 passes for 364 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.

That three-outing run in August culminated in him operating the third-team Minnesota offense against the Tennessee Titans' starting defense. Brosmer thrived that day in Tennessee and clocked out 15 of 23 with 161 yards and a touchdown through the air.

After making the team, Brosmer sat behind McCarthy and Carson Wentz. He became Wentz's backup while McCarthy missed five games nursing a high ankle sprain. In relief of Wentz, Brosmer attempted passes in a blowout win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 3 and in a lopsided ""Thursday Night Football"" loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 8. He went a combined 5 of 8 with 42 passing yards.

But with Wentz out for the season with a shoulder injury, Brosmer moved into the No. 2 and now starting role, and the stakes are much higher.

""Max had a really good week of practice,"" O'Connell said Friday. ""His preparation started long before this week, with how he’s prepared being either a snap away or even throughout training camp and since he’s been here.

""I know the guys have a lot of confidence in him, and I’m very excited to see him play, based upon the work he’s put in and just how important I know this opportunity is to him. These guys are going to play great around him, and we’re going to go compete.""

Brosmer will be up against a Seahawks defense that's seventh in the NFL this season in fewest points per game allowed (19.7) and tied for second in fewest yards per play given up (4.6).

Still, he has an opportunity to spark a talented Vikings offense that's been stuck in neutral far too often this season.

""I made the comment that everyone’s an All-Pro when you’re not taking the reps,"" Brosmer said, when asked about preparing for his first start in the league, per The Minnesota Star Tribune's Ben Goessling.

Mikaela Shiffrin dominates the slalom, but in the fastest two of the four Alpine disciplines — downhill and super-G — Macuga has been the top American, surging into the spotlight in 2024-25. She posted her first World Cup victory in January, announcing herself as a major medal contender with the Olympics just a year away.

“I don’t even think the nerves have settled,” Macuga said after the race that day in St. Anton, Austria. “I can’t believe it. I’m just waiting for it to hit me, and I know it’s going to. It’s just so exciting. This is a dream.”

She went on to earn a bronze medal in the super-G at the world championships in February. She finished fourth in the World Cup downhill season standings and sixth in the super-G — the top American in each discipline, ahead of Lindsey Vonn and Breezy Johnson.

Vonn’s bid to return to the Olympics at age 41 has dominated the headlines, but Macuga was tracking to be the top U.S. medal hope at February’s Games in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/28190357/GettyImages-2198321433-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-29 05:59:04.082638

“It’s a big relief,” Kerr said after Friday’s practice.
“You always worry when Steph goes down that it’s something that’s going to keep him out for a while.
Doing OK.” No matter how long Curry remains out, Kerr wants his team to focus on taking better care of the ball.
“We just have to keep taking care of the ball, or start taking care of the ball,” Kerr said.","SAN FRANCISCO — Steve Kerr and the Golden State Warriors are feeling a sense of ‘relief’ that Stephen Curry’s quad injury isn’t worse.

“It’s a big relief,” Kerr said after Friday’s practice. “You always worry when Steph goes down that it’s something that’s going to keep him out for a while. So, the fact that we’re taking it by the week and doesn’t appear to be anything too serious is a great sign. It gives us relief for sure.”

Curry injured his right quad late in the fourth quarter of Wednesday’s loss to the Houston Rockets and an MRI late Wednesday confirmed a quad contusion and muscle strain.

The Warriors announced Thursday that Curry would be re-evaluated in a week. Curry was back at practice on Friday to watch film with his teammates as he starts a rehab process that could have been worse if the MRI revealed something more severe.

“He’s feeling fine,” Kerr said. “He didn’t obviously do anything in practice today, but he’s here getting treatment and watched film with the guys. Doing OK.”

No matter how long Curry remains out, Kerr wants his team to focus on taking better care of the ball. Kerr has repeated the same mantra in recent weeks, given how closely it ties into the Warriors winning and losing games.

“We just have to keep taking care of the ball, or start taking care of the ball,” Kerr said. “It’s the same formula. Obviously we’re missing one of the great players of all time so maybe there’s a few more play calls. We’ve got to be extra sharp in our execution with our cutting and our passing, but it’s pretty obvious, 9-1 when we take care of the ball better than our opponents, 1-9 when we don’t. I’m going to keep hammering that point home to you guys, to our team, because it’s the No. 1 determining factor whether we win or lose.”

In the short term, without Curry, even more responsibility will be placed on third-year guard Brandin Podziemski. Podziemski comes into Saturday’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans averaging 12.2 points and 4.6 rebounds a game.

“We’re relying heavily on Brandin,” Kerr said. “He’s one of our most important players, and, obviously, Steph leaves a huge void. All of our guards have to be ready to fill in the gap.”

Speaking of those guards, Kerr said that veteran guard De’Anthony Melton is getting closer to a return as he continues his rehab from a left ACL tear suffered last season. Kerr said Melton went through all of Friday’s practice and there’s a ‘chance’ he plays on the upcoming three-game road trip.

“He’s getting a lot closer,” Kerr said of Melton. “I think the scrimmage the other day against the Santa Cruz team really helped and a full participant in practice. He won’t play on the remainder of this homestand, but he’ll go on the trip, and there’s a chance he’ll play on the trip.”

As for Jonathan Kuminga, Kerr is hopeful he’ll be able to make his return to the floor Saturday against the Pelicans. Kuminga has missed the last seven games because of bilateral knee tendonitis.

“He’ll be listed questionable,” Kerr said of Kuminga. “So, the training staff and JK will make that determination, but he’s a couple straight days, maybe three straight days, so trending upward.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/28172058/GettyImages-2248783210-1.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-29 04:57:56.160756

Seattle’s injury report released Friday afternoon has two players ruled out and another questionable. Everybody else on the active roster is ready to go.

Three numbers that matter as Seahawks’ JSN chases NFL history

One of the players ruled out is a bit of a blow: third-string running back George Holani will miss the 1:05 p.m. game Sunday with a hamstring injury that took him out of action during last week’s win at Tennessee.

The Seahawks seemed to have a good idea going into the week that Holani would be unavailable, as they signed former Los Angeles Rams and Vikings running back Cam Akers to the active roster on Wednesday.

The other player ruled out is rookie defensive end Rylie Mills, which is no surprise. The fifth-round NFL Draft pick out of Notre Dame has been out all year while recovering from an ACL injury suffered while still with the Fighting Irish and was just designated to return to practice for the first time this week.

The one Seahawks player ruled questionable for Sunday is safety Ty Okada, who has an oblique injury. He did not practice Wednesday and was limited in practice Thursday.

The injury report signals that the Seahawks will get starting linebackers Ernest Jones IV (knee) and Tyrice Knight (concussion) back after they both missed the win over the Titans due to injury.

Other players expected to play Sunday who were listed with injuries on the practice report this week are outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu (ankle), defensive end Mike Morris (knee), running back Kenneth Walker III (glute), wide receiver Cody White (abdomen) and guard Grey Zabel (knee).

As expected, Minnesota has ruled out quarterback J.J. McCarthy out for Sunday with a concussion. Guard Donovan Jackson (ankle) has also been ruled out.

Max Brosmer will start at QB for the Vikings, coach Kevin O’Connell announced Friday. John Wolford will come up from Minnesota’s practice squad to serve as the backup.

Arteta mentioned the possibility of a behind-closed-doors match to help Jesus get up to speed earlier this month, and in his pre-Chelsea press conference, he said: “It did happen.
“With Leo, there’s another test today,” said Arteta, who was speaking ahead the league leaders’ trip to second-placed Chelsea on Sunday.
We have to wait a bit longer for the scan to be precise on the timings, but I’m quite confident,” Arteta said.
I don’t know (if he will return before the new year) we have to wait and see.","Mikel Arteta has said that Gabriel Jesus is “very close” to an Arsenal return, but is cautious about how soon the Brazil forward is reintegrated into first team matches.

The 28-year-old has been out for 11 months after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury against Manchester United in January, but has stepped up his recovery in recent weeks.

Arteta mentioned the possibility of a behind-closed-doors match to help Jesus get up to speed earlier this month, and in his pre-Chelsea press conference, he said: “It did happen. Gabi (Jesus) participated.

“Ethan (Nwaneri) as well because he wanted some minutes, which we had an opportunity with different players who needed a bit of exposure and competition. It was very positive.”

Asked whether Jesus would need more internal matches or if the upcoming festive period, when Arsenal play nine games before the end of 2025, offers a chance to throw him straight in, the Arsenal manager added: “We have to see. He’s been out 11 months and you need that progression to see how his body and that knee reacts, and what else he needs.

“With the players that are available as well, it has to make sense with the balance of the squad. The good thing is it’s very close at the moment.

“It’s what we see every single day and how he reacts to the changes he had in load. Then he needs to get into the chemistry of the team, understanding the things in match-time which is very different to anything he tried to do in training. It’s about making those gaps as short as possible.”

Before his injury last season, Jesus scored six goals in four games around the turn of the year. Since then, Arsenal’s squad has changed in various ways, with eight summer signings and already existing players such as Mikel Merino being used in different roles.

Jesus has typically knitted together attacks for Arsenal when fit and, asked whether he still sees those qualities in the forward, Arteta said: “It’s always been one of Gabi’s qualities, the capacity to relate, connect and make other players better. He still has that and now he has to find a way to do it with some very new players.”

Fellow forward Leandro Trossard was forced off in the first half with a calf injury in Arsenal’s midweek win over Bayern Munich.

“With Leo, there’s another test today,” said Arteta, who was speaking ahead the league leaders’ trip to second-placed Chelsea on Sunday. “We have to see how he’s feeling. It doesn’t look much. It is a potential chance (he will be back)”

Arsenal are yet to have the results of scans for Gabriel Magalhaes, Viktor Gyokeres and Kai Havertz, but the Arsenal manager was optimistic about their respective recoveries.

“He (Gabriel) is evolving really well. We have to wait a bit longer for the scan to be precise on the timings, but I’m quite confident,” Arteta said.

“Especially the way Gabi takes every injury and the way he’s going to push everybody that it’s not going to be that long. I don’t know (if he will return before the new year) we have to wait and see.

“They (Gyokeres and Havertz) are getting closer and closer. We are very positive with both of them.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/28091928/GettyImages-2248370900-scaled-e1764339612620.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-29 02:57:58.863739

According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, an MRI confirmed that St. Brown suffered a low ankle sprain while blocking on a run play against the visiting Green Bay Packers. He will not need to be placed on injured reserve and figures to be out for a week or two, as Lions head coach Dan Campbell said Thursday.

With his condition now basically week-to-week, St. Brown will will have time to recover with the Lions playing just once — Dec. 4 against the Dallas Cowboys — over the next 16 days.

The injury occurred on the team's second drive of the day in a 31-24 defeat against the Packers. After going three-and-out on their first drive, the Lions took the field with 6:32 left in the first quarter. On the first play of the second drive, the Lions tried to run Jahmyr Gibbs to the right side.

St. Brown was a blocker on the play and tried to stop Packers safety Xavier McKinney from making a play. As the two were engaged, a Lions offense lineman rolled into St. Brown's legs. After staying down on the field for a moment, St. Brown limped off the field and went straight to the locker room.

The Lions initially deemed him questionable to return. Shortly after halftime, however, St. Brown was ruled out of the contest. He registered one target, but no catches, during the game.

With St. Brown, the Lions had to find other reliable pass catchers. For the most part, Jameson Williams stepped up, hauling in seven passes for 144 yards and a touchdown. Despite his efforts, the Lions couldn't complete the comeback against the Packers, losing 31-24.

The loss dropped the Lions to 7-5 on the season. While the team is very much in the playoff hunt, the loss could prevent them from winning the division. The Packers hold the edge in the head-to-head matchup this season, going 2-0 against the Lions in 2025.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8XCkYCFGRPzohqLvC2cdlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/77913800-cc6e-11f0-bed4-14929d4bd4f4,N,,2025-11-29 09:57:42.831815

Maresca ruled out Chelsea’s chances of competing for the title 12 months ago when they had also climbed to second in the table.","Enzo Maresca has admitted everyone at Chelsea is excited at the prospect of Cole Palmer’s return after confirming he is ready to start against Arsenal on Sunday.

Palmer has not played for Chelsea since limping off against Manchester United in September, mainly due to a groin injury, but his comeback was also delayed by fracturing a toe in his left foot last week.

The England international has missed 13 games in all and head coach Maresca mentioned last Friday that he would not be ready to face Arsenal.

But today, however, he confirmed: “He’s available. Everyone is happy. The team-mates are happy. We are all happy and the most important thing is that Cole is happy because at the end, a football player, they want to play games and make sessions every day.

“What kind of contribution do I expect? A lot, a lot. He is probably our best player. We are happy that he is back. Now we need to give him time to be 100 per cent fit. He has done fantastic in the past and no doubt he is going to do very well for this club in the future.”

Estevao Willian has begun to star in Palmer’s absence with his fine goal in the 3-0 win against Barcelona making him just the third player to score in his first three Champions League games.

Asked about the prospect of opposition defenders worrying about the prospect of the duo soon being able to combine their talents together, Maresca replied: “They can play together. It depends on which team, it depends a little bit on the game plan, but for sure they are excited.

“The fans are excited to watch both together. We are also excited, thinking that at the end we need always a balance between the two phases.”

Chelsea go into the match against Arsenal with the chance to close the gap to the league leaders to three points with a victory. Maresca ruled out Chelsea’s chances of competing for the title 12 months ago when they had also climbed to second in the table. But while he insists it is too early to say they can challenge for the crown this time around, he does believe they are better equipped to do so than last year.

He added: “I think for sure it’s different compared to one year ago. It’s because we spent one more year together. We went through moments where we can learn from that moment. Then again, for me it’s very early. We are still at the end of November, December. So it’s very early and it’s important to be where we are now in March, April and then we’ll see.”

St. Brown has been one of the NFL's most prolific receivers this season through 12 and a half weeks. He ranks in the top five in the league in receiving yards, top three in targets and his nine receiving touchdowns are the second-most by any player.

The good news for the Lions is that St. Brown's injury was not severe. The latest reports on Friday, Nov. 28 indicated that the receiver may not miss much time.

Here's the latest St. Brown injury update:

How long is Amon-Ra St. Brown out?

NFL Media's Tom Pelissero reported on Nov. 28 that St. Brown sustained a low ankle sprain in the Lions' Week 13 loss to the Packers on Thanksgiving. He is considered week-to-week and should avoid hitting injured reserve. As a result, there is a good chance the Lions' lead receiver misses only a minimal amount of time, if any.

Pelissero also pointed out that the Lions' schedule in the coming weeks includes another Thursday game – hosting the Dallas Cowboys in Week 14 – meaning Detroit only plays in one game over the next two calendar weeks. If St. Brown does not aggravate his ankle in practice, he may only end up missing one game.

There will be more clarity on St. Brown's status as the week continues and the Lions begin to release their practice injury reports. If the wideout is a participant in practice early in the week, there's a chance he does not miss any game time.

Amon-Ra St. Brown stats

St. Brown was coming off a season-high 149-yard outing against the Giants in Week 12 before he left the Lions' Week 13 Thanksgiving game early. Here's how his stats look through 13 weeks:

Targets: 108

Receptions: 75

Receiving yards: 884

Yards/reception: 11.8

Touchdowns: 9

St. Brown's nine receiving touchdowns are the second-most of any player in 2025. His 75 receptions rank sixth and his 884 yards rank fifth in the league.

Williams figures to be the main option in the passing attack if St. Brown is sidelined. The rookie TeSlaa should also assume a larger role. Detroit is also without Kalif Raymond, who suffered an ankle injury that kept him out of the Thanksgiving game, and star tight end San LaPorta, who underwent back surgery and isn't expected back any time soon.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/28/USAT/87510792007-amonra-st-brown-lions-imagn.jpg?crop=2703,1521,x0,y307&width=2703&height=1521&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-28 18:59:40.898818

They are dealing with injuries stemming from the team's Week 12 loss to the Houston Texans. Brown suffered a shoulder injury in the game and tried to play through it, but he was unable to finish the game, sitting out the final drive.

Dawkins was evaluated for concussion during the game but cleared to return and finished the game. McDermott said he was made aware of the concussion symptoms the day after the game. Dawkins was then placed in the protocol, where he remains. This is the first game Dawkins will miss due to injury since Dec. 1, 2022.

Linebacker Terrel Bernard (elbow) and wide receiver Curtis Samuel (elbow/knee) have also been ruled out of the game, and Samuel's injury led to him being put on injured reserve on Friday. Wide receiver Gabe Davis was signed to the active roster in his place after Davis was elevated from the practice squad the past two weeks.

McDermott said injured reserve doesn't appear likely for Brown and/or Bernard.

Wide receiver Joshua Palmer (ankle) and tight end Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) are both questionable for the game. Palmer did not participate in Thursday's practice, with McDermott saying that he tweaked a previous injury this week but was limited on Friday. Kincaid has missed the past two games but said that Friday's limited practice ""felt good.""

The Bills will hope for some offensive assistance coming off Allen being sacked a career-high eight times against the Texans. The offense has scored less than 20 points in its three road losses this season. The line has led the way in the league's best rushing attack (147.2 per game).

Swing tackle Ryan Van Demark and offensive lineman Alec Anderson are among the top candidates to fill the tackles' spots. Van Demark started for Brown earlier this season. Lineman Tylan Grable, who had his practice window opened this week but remains on injured reserve, is another. Grable is questionable for the game.

""We're going through some of the different options,"" McDermott said. ""Have a lot of confidence in those guys. Some of the guys are younger, some are a little bit older ... What they lack in experience, they're gonna make up for in grit, toughness and those that are playing alongside of them will help them out as well best they can.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F1120%2Fr1255573_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 19:59:44.598254

The Broncos' star cornerback has not played since suffering an injury in the first half against the Cowboys in Week 8. Denver's defense held up admirably in Surtain's absence, allowing an average of 13.7 points per game while the Broncos earned a 3-0 record.

The Rams' secondary has been playing quite well but could be without an important piece here, while the defensive front could take a hit in the run defense department as well.

Carolina will be without its top cornerback, a significant issue against one of the best wide receiver duos in the NFL. The offensive line is also banged up, and the linebacker corps will still have a pair of absences despite the return of Trevin Wallace, who has no injury designation.

San Francisco will have a backup kicker here and will also be down yet another linebacker with Fred Warner already out.

Things are fairly clean for the Browns, though they could miss Wright as a rotational rusher. If Ford can't go, the backfield will be entirely split between rookies Quinshon Judkins and Dylan Sampson.

New Orleans will be without Kamara, which means rookie Devin Neal, who is off the injury report, will lead the backfield. Olave's potential absence would obviously be a significant burden for the offense to bear.

The Dolphins have been shorthanded in the defensive backfield all season. The offense could take a hit if Jackson is unable to play, but could get a lift if Waller is able to return from his injury.

The Cardinals are very banged up in the backfield and could be down to just Michael Carter and practice squad players if Knight can't give it a go. They also have several injuries up front on both sides of the ball. Harrison was limited all week in his attempt to return from appendicitis. Melton got back to a limited practice on Friday after not participating on Thursday.

Morrison is a big absence in the defensive backfield for Tampa. Irving is expected to return to the fold and be part of a hot-hand rotation along with Rachaad White and Sean Tucker, per coach Todd Bowles, who also said Mayfield is trending toward playing. Nelson and Reddick are important pieces of the defensive front.

Brian Thomas Jr. has no injury designation and is set to return after his absence. The Jags are missing a couple pieces along the offensive line, as well as one of their best pass rushers, which could help the Titans keep Cam Ward protected for a change.

Speaking of Ward, he will be without his starting center, but could get some help in the receiving corps if Ayomanor is ready to return and Okonkwo plays through his designation. Woods is questionable after missing the game last week.

The Texans are only two games behind the Colts (8-3) and one behind the Jaguars (7-4) in the AFC South.","HOUSTON -- Texans coach DeMeco Ryans announced Friday that quarterback C.J. Stroud has cleared the concussion protocol and will start Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts.

Ryans is happy his starting quarterback is back under center. He doesn't want Stroud pressing and just wants him playing within the offense.

""Who's playing for us,"" Ryans said, ""whatever the position is, just asking everybody to go out and do their job to the best of their ability on offense. Play as efficiently as possible.""

Stroud was close to playing last week but the Texans played on Thursday. He said if the Texans' Week 12 game against the Buffalo Bills was Sunday, he would have played.

""I'm just grateful to be back finally,"" Stroud said. ""I'm grateful for all the prayers. To the Broncos' defense, hearing them praying for me, I really appreciated that... [Being out] wasn't fun, I wanted to play really bad. I wanted to be back out there, but we put ourselves in a great position.""

Stroud suffered a concussion against Denver in Week 9 and has missed three games. The Texans lost only the Broncos game during Stroud's absence while going undefeated in backup quarterback Davis Mills' three starts, which included two game-winning drives against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans. Mills threw for 879 passing yards with five touchdowns and only one interception in his stint.

The Texans going 3-0 in Stroud's absence put them squarely in the AFC playoff race. Houston (6-5) is the No. 8 seed trailing the Bills (7-4), who they beat 23-19 in Week 12, for the final AFC wild-card spot. The Texans are only two games behind the Colts (8-3) and one behind the Jaguars (7-4) in the AFC South.

Last week's win over the Bills could be vital down the stretch as Houston has the head-to-head tiebreaker in the wild-card race over Buffalo, which trails the New England Patriots by 2.5 games in the AFC East.

The Texans still don't have much room for error as they have only a 38% chance to make the playoffs, per ESPN Analytics. Making the playoffs would take a historic feat to defy the odds.

Since the NFL expanded to a 14-team playoff format, 19 teams started 0-3 and only one made the playoffs. Ironically, the 2018 Texans were the only team to ever do it, and it was before the expansion to 14 teams.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0910%2Fr1543672_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 18:00:09.161668

Maybe the tide is finally turning for the Cincinnati defense.","By Jeff Zrebiec, Paul Dehner Jr. and Amos Morale III

Joe Burrow made his first start since Week 2 and led the Cincinnati Bengals to a 32-14 win against the Baltimore Ravens on Thanksgiving.

Burrow missed nine games with a toe injury but seemed ready to go from the opening series Thursday, passing for 261 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.

The only issue the Pro Bowler and the Bengals struggled with in the first half was finishing drives in the red zone. Cincinnati held a 12-7 lead at the half thanks to four Evan McPherson field goals, but were just 0-for-4 in the red zone.

That changed in the third quarter, when Burrow capped a 10-play 61-yard drive with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Tanner Hudson. He threw another touchdown pass to Andrei Iosivas later in the third that gave the Bengals a 26-14 lead.

Burrow and the Bengals offense were aided by a pilfering Cincy defense that forced five turnovers against the Ravens.

The Bengals (4-8) moved to 3-0 in games Burrow started this season, while the Ravens dropped to .500 at 6-6.

Right to work

There was no easing Joe Burrow back into action. He threw the second-most first-half passes of any game in his career (32) and the most by any quarterback this season. The work before halftime knocked the rust off, though, as he connected on impressive touchdown passes to Hudson and Iosivas, offering up big reactions with the competitive juices fully flowing in the second half. Burrow still often showed hesitation going off-script outside of the pocket, but was comfortable moving and hopping around while inside it. Timing routes were off, specifically inside the red zone, where the Bengals kicked three field goals, endured a goal-line stand and saw Burrow finish 2 of 12 for 18 yards and one touchdown. Still, the Bengals only punted twice all night and scored 17 points on their first three possessions after halftime to put the game away. When Burrow is playing, the energy and belief level rise for this club, and that proved true again in this game. — Paul Dehner Jr.

Defense shows up

While all the attention focused on Burrow’s return, it was instead the return of turnovers and an opportunistic Bengals defense that altered the dynamic of this game. The Bengals came into the game having forced just 10 turnovers all season, yet walked away with five against the Ravens.

This collection of young players, which has put together the worst first 11 games of any defense in history by DVOA, made hustle and splash plays that suggest real growth. Jordan Battle hustled after getting beaten to strip Isaiah Likely just before he crossed the goal line. Myles Murphy chased down Derrick Henry on a 43-yard reception, then blew up the pocket with a batted pass for a Demetrius Knight Jr. interception. Joseph Ossai broke free for two sacks, including a strip sack. This was the first time the Bengals allowed less than 26 points since the season opener. Hard to know how much of this correlated to Lamar Jackson’s struggles versus the Bengals’ improvement, but it has felt all year like a performance of this nature was impossible. Maybe the tide is finally turning for the Cincinnati defense. — Dehner

What this means for the Bengals

Is hope alive for Cincinnati? Easy on that thought. The Bengals are still two games back of the Ravens and need a Steelers loss Sunday against the Bears, but they aren’t dead. The AFC North tiebreaker would be a necessity, and they are 3-1 in the division this year with home games against the Ravens and Browns remaining. Again, the percentages are minuscule as they head to see Josh Allen and the Bills next week, but they still have a glimmer of hope. And they have Burrow. — Dehner

Lamar Jackson, Ravens offense look broken

The Ravens have been expressing confidence for weeks that they are going to fix their struggling offense, but Thursday has to be rock bottom for Jackson and this group. After scoring their first first-possession touchdown since Week 4, the Ravens went six consecutive drives (not including a late second-quarter kneeldown) without scoring any points against the league’s 32nd-ranked defense. Included in that stretch were two Jackson fumbles deep in his own territory and an Isaiah Likely fumble as he was about to go in for a touchdown. The Ravens were able to mount a few drives in the second half, but the damage was done. Their turnovers (three by Jackson) were one more than they had during their entire five-game winning streak. Jackson looks like a shell of himself. Beyond the turnovers on Thursday, he missed several open receivers. The Ravens aren’t running the ball consistently well, and their offensive line has struggled all year. Struggling in back-to-back games against the Jets and Bengals defenses doesn’t suggest a quick fix. — Jeff Zrebiec, Ravens beat writer

Ravens are on the brink again

Despite a five-game winning streak and their ascension into a first-place tie in the AFC North, the reality for these Ravens was that the 1-5 start left them with little margin for error, and they were always one loss away from being in trouble again. That the loss came Thursday to a divisional foe makes things even tougher. Obviously, it would really help the Ravens’ cause if the Steelers (6-5) lose Sunday to Buffalo. But regardless of that result, the Ravens probably are going to need to win their next two divisional games — home vs. Pittsburgh in Week 14 and at Cincinnati a week later — to remain in the playoff mix. They probably can’t afford another divisional loss over the next two weeks. — Zrebiec",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/27235426/GettyImages-2248811270.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-28 18:59:56.739954

Moving on to Jones' old team in New York, Jaxson Dart was cleared from concussion protocol on Thursday and will play Monday night against the New England Patriots.

Dart has missed the Giants’ past two games while in concussion protocol. He was injured in Week 10 against the Chicago Bears. Jameis Winston started in a pair of seven-point losses in Dart’s absence.

In Minnesota, J.J. McCarthy remains in concussion protocol and will miss Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks. Rookie Max Brosmer will start in his place. McCarthy reported concussion symptoms on the flight back following the team's 23-6 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 12.

McCarthy has already missed five games this season with an ankle injury. The concussion comes after a pretty disappointing showing from the Michigan product, who went 12-for-19 for only 87 yards in the loss to the Packers, throwing two interceptions. The second-year quarterback has not impressed much in his first real season, hitting only 54.1% of his passes with 10 picks and a 57.9 QBRating across six games.

Other notable Week 13 injuries:

The Patriots will be without rookie left tackle Will Campbell, who will miss the next four games after being placed on injured reserve. Campbell injured his knee during New England's Week 12 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. The team does not believe the injury is season-ending, which would be a sigh of relief for quarterback Drake Maye.

Baker Mayfield is trending towards playing Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals. After dealing with a low-grade sprained AC joint in his non-throwing shoulder all week, Mayfield took part in Friday's practice and head coach Todd Bowles said he looked good and looks ready to return after sustaining the injury during last week's loss to the Los Angeles Rams. ""He had to get well. He was very limited on Wednesday, he did a little more yesterday and he moved around perfectly today, so he's fine.""

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will start against the Buffalo Bills, head coach Mike Tomlin told reporters on Friday. Rodgers missed last week's game against the Bears after suffering a fractured wrist in his non-throwing arm against the Bengals in Week 11. Backup Mason Rudolph relieved him after the injury, closing out the dominant win by going 12-of-16 for 127 yards and a touchdown.

But Daniels' return this season remains likely -- possibly as early as Week 14 at Minnesota. And the good news for Washington is that receiver Terry McLaurin will play for only the second time since Week 3.

The Commanders (3-8) host Denver (9-2) Sunday. Washington has lost six consecutive games in part because of an offense missing key pieces -- McLaurin in particular.

The injury to Daniels' non-throwing arm has caused him to miss the past two games. He did practice this week, but Quinn always considered him ""unlikely"" to play. Daniels was listed as a limited participant in practice each day this week.

Quinn called the week a ""great first step"" for Daniels. He has yet to be cleared for contact. Daniels has started five games this season but has been hurt three times. He also dealt with a sprained left knee that cost him two games and a right hamstring injury that sidelined him for one.

Quinn also ruled out receiver Noah Brown, who remains on injured reserve with a groin injury that occurred in Week 2. Starting safety Will Harris could be activated for Sunday after missing the past nine games with a fractured fibula.

McLaurin returned for a Week 7 loss at Kansas City, catching three passes for 54 yards. But a diving grab caused him to reaggravate his right quad injury. But he said earlier this week that he feels better this time around, having gone through multiple weeks of drills and practice without feeling any issues.

""I don’t feel like this is long-, long-term, so that’s the good news,"" Campbell said. ""But that doesn’t mean it won’t be here for – it could be a week or two, maybe. If we’re lucky.""

St. Brown, who leads the Lions with 75 catches for 884 yards, injured his left ankle in the first quarter while blocking on a run play, when offensive linemen Kayode Awosika and Penei Sewell fell into the back of his leg.

St. Brown limped off the field with trainers after the play, went straight to the locker room and didn't return.

The Lions shifted offensive personnel in St. Brown's absence, using Jameson Williams as their No. 1 receiver and playing Issac TeSlaa and Tom Kennedy more in supporting roles.

Williams finished with seven catches for 144 yards and a touchdown, but the Lions missed St. Brown in other areas, such as blocking on run plays.

""When you lose a guy like Saint, it’s tough,"" Campbell said. ""There’s so many things that he brings to our offense. Everybody knows the production and the versatility he has, but also all the dirty work he does in the run game. All the little things, man. The nuances of where you line up to where you go, to who you block if it’s this look, to now if they go here you need to slide back to do that. I mean, he’s so fricking smart, man, and he’s tough. And so there’s a million jobs he does and he does them at a high level that it does, it hurts when you lose him.""

Complicating matters on offense, the Lions have already lost tight end Sam LaPorta to back surgery this year, and they played Thursday without No. 3 receiver Kalif Raymond because of an ankle injury and tight end Brock Wright because of a neck injury.

The Lions (7-5) host the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday, Dec. 4, in a battle between playoff bubble teams and then visit the NFC-leading Los Angeles Rams in Week 15.

They likely need at least a split in those games to make the playoffs.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/27/PDTF/87498454007-112725-lions-1-h-031.jpg?crop=3169,1784,x0,y164&width=3169&height=1784&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-28 17:00:20.192750

Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury in the Buccaneers' blowout loss to the Los Angeles Rams last Sunday night, spending the second half wearing a sling while watching from the sideline. There was legitimate concern he might miss time as the week began, but after receiving positive results from an MRI and taking a cautious approach to most of the practice week, it appears Mayfield has improved enough to inspire optimism.

Bowles' synopsis is great news for Bucs fans who feared their team's injury problems might finally sink their ship with Mayfield's uncertain outlook. As the heart of the team and the engine that drives it, Mayfield is undoubtedly the most important player on the Buccaneers' roster, and the prospect of taking the field with 33-year-old backup Teddy Bridgewater seemed daunting, if not doomed.

That’s the main reason as to why he is who he is but being able to understand when you need to put the cape on and when it’s okay to go ahead and slide.

Well, a yard with 12 minutes to go in the first quarter is a little bit different than a yard to go with 10 seconds to go in the game.

Mike White concludes his week as Matthew Stafford As a scout team quarterback, Mike White is asked to be many men to many people.
""I was a Rams fan back in the day, and so you kind of have to pick,"" Canales said.
Are you going to be a Raiders fan or a Rams fan?
I was a Rams fan at the time.","CHARLOTTE — The Panthers are playing the league's hottest quarterback, and a high-functioning passing game, and they're doing it with a secondary full of questions.

In addition to suspended safety Tre'von Moehrig, Panthers head coach Dave Canales said that cornerback Jaycee Horn is expected to miss this week's game after suffering a concussion against the 49ers.

That's created a lot of new looks at practice this week, but Canales remains confident.

""I trust these guys to get it done,"" he said. ""And they had a great week of preparation.""

At cornerback, they'll have Mike Jackson starting in his normal spot, and Chau Smith-Wade and Akayleb Evans available to play outside. Smith-Wade has mostly played nickel since arriving here last year, but bumped outside last week when Horn and Corey Thornton were injured. (Thornton went on IR this week with a broken fibula).

Canales said they'd rotate a number of looks there. They also brought cornerback Robert Rochell off the Cowboys practice squad, and he has familiarity with the defense from his time with the Rams and coaches Ejiro Evero and Jonathan Cooley.

At safety, Ransom is at least close to a like-for-like with Moehrig, and they also have Demani Richardson, along with veteran starter Nick Scott.

""I mean, opportunities,"" Canales said of the replacements. ""This is something that, you know, Lathan has really been working on for a while now and so if you had a chance to be out there with Nick Scott communicating with him, Demani's been really a part of what we're doing. He's into it. He's ready to rock as well.""

Another week, another offensive line rotation

For those keeping count at home, this will be the 10th offensive line rotation the Panthers have played with in 13 games this season. Canales told reporters on Friday that Jake Curhan was expected to start at right guard in place of the injured Chandler Zavala.

""Pretty much the list of guys that we thought, we were trying to get back out there to see if we can move them around, we weren't able to do that,"" Canales said, listing Zavala among that group.

Curhan has played in eight games for the Panthers this season. While he hasn't started one yet, he has contributed on 15.4 percent of the offensive snaps in those games, including two games in which he played a majority of the game in place of other injured guards: the Packers in Week 9 and the 49ers in Week 12.

""Generally, Jake is a really intelligent guy and understands our schemes, what we're trying to get done,"" said Canales on Friday. The coach and player spent two years together in Seattle when Curhan was signed there after college. He's got a lot of experience, so different fronts, different types of movement, he's used to those things. And then on top of that, he's massive.""

For reference, Curhan is listed at 6-6 and 316 pounds.

""He is a big man, and he's got great power in the run game and in the pass game. He sits tight and uses his hands, and that's what I've known about Jake for a long time now. Whether it was tackle or guard, just his ability to process the game and make the adjustments that are required during the middle of the game.

Mike White concludes his week as Matthew Stafford

As a scout team quarterback, Mike White is asked to be many men to many people. Each week, his task is to emulate that week's opponent to the best of his ability. That means not only playbook, but tendencies at the line, cadences, and even how a quarterback breaks the huddle.

This week, White—who has been in the league for eight years—was cast as 17-year vet Matthew Stafford.

""He did an excellent job and (defensive coordinator) Ejiro (Evero) was very complimentary of Mike and Andy Dalton for being able to try to replicate the speed of play,"" Canales said of the quarterback's response to Stafford's play style.

The Rams are famous for playing lightning fast, even before the ball is snapped. It was something the Panthers' defense had to prepare for this week, and White handled the speed well.

""How they break the huddle, how they get up to the line, the shifts and motions all have to be really crisp, and our guys did a great job all across the board for a couple of days,"" Canales bragged. ""Really appreciative of our scout team, making that come to life because we have to be ready for that pace.""

Dave Canales grew up a Rams fan

Panthers quarterback Bryce Young grew up in Southern California, and he remembers the Rams coming back to Los Angeles in 2016 when he was in high school.

Dave Canales, being a little older, remembers them leaving when he was 13 years old.

Canales said rather than letting his Rams fandom follow to St. Louis when the team left after the 1994 season (just in time for the Panthers to join them in the NFC West).

""I was a Rams fan back in the day, and so you kind of have to pick,"" Canales said. ""You're in LA. Are you going to be a Raiders fan or a Rams fan? I was a Rams fan at the time. That was Jim Everett, and that whole crew. So I remember them leaving and I remember just being so pissed.

""At the time, Dan Marino was my favorite player. So once the Rams left LA, I was like, all right, well I think I'm a Dolphins fan now because I've always followed Dan. And so there was a little back and forth. But to get the Rams back in LA meant a lot for the community and all the people that were still rocking their Rams stuff for my whole childhood.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/q5nsv0ivmyhu6kispbmx,N,,2025-11-28 17:00:41.717569

Head coach Mike Vrabel said Wednesday that he “can pretty much guarantee” Wilson will also not be back at left guard for Monday night in Foxborough. The No. 95 overall pick had been carted from the blue medical tent to the locker room on the first drive last weekend due to a high ankle sprain. Later on in what became a 26-20 win at Paycor Stadium, the starting line also briefly lost its veteran right tackle due to an illness. In the kicking game, meanwhile, captain Brenden Schooler went from questionable to out at halftime with an ankle injury of his own. The reigning Pro Bowler and first-team All-Pro has not missed a game since the finale of the 2022 season. He stands with a team-high 77.2 percent of the snaps on special teams this fall.

New England would have moved forward with four partial participants based on Wednesday’s work. Count Henry among them.

The Buccaneers are trying to get back on track after a three-game losing skid. To find out how to watch, listen and livestream the game, click here.

The top concern among nearly all NFL analysts regarding Sunday's game is the health of Baker Mayfield. That uncertain situation has led some to believe the Bucs are in danger of a fourth straight loss, though others contend that Teddy Bridgewater would do just fine n Mayfield's absence. One expert who picked the Bucs think they will lean on an improving run game and will combine that with more inspired defensive play than in recent weeks. Of course, that defensive performance of late is a sticking point for some analysts, one of whom pointed out that the Bucs have allowed the most touchdown passes and the third-worst passing EPA over the past three weeks. The return of Bucky Irving gives some experts more faith in the Bucs' Week 13 fate. And the Cardinals' long trip east plus an early kickoff time factored into the equation for at least one analyst.

""Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield suffered a shoulder sprain Sunday night that puts his status in doubt for this one. That means it could be Teddy Bridgewater. He is more than capable.

""I've just got to be consistent,"" Jackson said. ""Can't have turnovers in any game. Two fumbles and an interception. We got to be consistent. We're putting our defense on the field too much. Can't have that.""

Jackson hasn't thrown a touchdown pass or rushed for a score over this last three starts and has six turnovers during that stretch, the longest such streak in his career.

""I can't describe that level of frustration, I'm ticked off,"" Jackson said. ""I'm just mad because like I said, we can't have that. Turnovers is big part of winning and losing games. Turning the ball over and giving them extra possessions, this is the outcome.""

2025 NFL playoff picture: How Joe Burrow and Bengals could make the postseason after shocking win over Ravens

John Breech

Explosive plays haven't been there in recent weeks for the Ravens (6-6), who have relied on Derrick Henry to manage the heavy-lifting as the passing game works out the kinks. Henry has four touchdowns on the ground during the last three games, including the first score of Thursday's loss to the Bengals.

Jackson harped on his consistency issues and stiff-armed the notion that a litany of injuries has affected his play. He has missed time or been slowed by an array of ailments, including his hamstring, toe, knee and ankle.

""I feel like I missed throws ... I don't miss those,"" Jackson said after finishing 17 of 32 for 246 yards. ""I don't miss them in practice, I shouldn't miss them in games.""

Ravens coach John Harbaugh also insisted Jackson's healthy and he would not be in the lineup if that was not the case.

The Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6) now lead the division, but a loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday would push the Ravens back into first place thanks to the record vs. common opponents tiebreaker. Baltimore's currently 6-6 this season, which is 10th in the AFC behind the Kansas City Chiefs, who beat the Ravens head-to-head.

After a Thanksgiving loss to the Cowboys dropped them to 6-6, the Chiefs are sitting in a tough spot with their playoff chances dwindling.

Thursday’s 31-28 setback against the Cowboys has Chiefs ninth in the AFC standings, sitting 1.5 games overall and two games in the loss column back of the Bills, Jaguars, and Chargers, who are all 7-4.

Further hurting the Chiefs, who have made three straight Super Bowls, is that all three of the aforementioned teams beat them earlier this season.

“At the end of the day, you’ve just got to win every game now — and hope that’s enough,” quarterback Patrick Mahomes said after the loss with the reality beginning to seep through that the Chiefs may indeed miss the playoffs for the first time since the 2014 season.

The road to the playoffs seems even more daunting since injuries are all of a sudden starting to pile up for a Chiefs team that needs all hands on deck for the stretch run.

Rookie left tackle Josh Simmons, who was supposed to help stabilize an iffy offensive line, dislocated and fractured his wrist against the Cowboys and is likely heading to IR, per NFL Network.

Guard Trey Smith also missed the game with an ankle injury, while tackle Jawaan Taylor also exited with an arm injury.

The offensive line is now missing multiple starters, including both tackles, which will severely limit Mahomes’ ability to play superhero and shoulder the load for the Chiefs.

If the Chiefs want to take a shot at the playoffs, they will need to win out or come close, as the AFC is stacked with elite teams and 10 wins might not even be enough to get in.

Kansas City made the playoffs in all eight of Mahomes’ seasons as the starter entering the 2025 campaign.

“We’re going to play a lot of good football teams coming up,” Mahomes added. “If we’re going to make the playoffs, we’re going to have to win them all.”

The Chiefs follow this week’s tough loss with another incredibly challenging home game against the Texans, who feature the league’s top pass rush while Kansas City’s offensive line is at its weakest.

Houston, which visits the Colts this weekend, is the team directly in front of the Chiefs in the AFC standings and also on the outside looking in.

According to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero, St. Brown is believed to have suffered a low ankle sprain while blocking on a run play against the visiting Green Bay Packers. He will continue to be evaluated and not need to be placed on injured reserve.

St. Brown will likely be labeled as ""week-to-week"" and will have time to recover with the Lions playing just once — Dec. 4 against the Dallas Cowboys — over the next 16 days

The injury occurred on the team's second drive of the day in a 31-24 defeat against the Packers. After going three-and-out on their first drive, the Lions took the field with 6:32 left in the first quarter. On the first play of the second drive, the Lions tried to run Jahmyr Gibbs to the right side.

St. Brown was a blocker on the play and tried to stop Packers safety Xavier McKinney from making a play. As the two were engaged, a Lions offense lineman rolled into St. Brown's legs.

St. Brown remained down on the field for a bit. He eventually limped off the field and went straight to the locker room. The Lions initially deemed him questionable to return.

Shortly after halftime, however, St. Brown was ruled out of the contest. He registered one target, but no catches, during the game.

With St. Brown, the Lions had to find other reliable pass catchers. For the most part, Jameson Williams stepped up, hauling in seven passes for 144 yards and a touchdown. Despite his efforts, the Lions couldn't complete the comeback against the Packers, losing 31-24.

Following the loss, Lions head coach Dan Campbell said the team doesn't expect St. Brown's injury to keep him out for too long, but it could sideline the star for a week or two.

The loss dropped the Lions to 7-5 on the season. While the team is very much in the playoff hunt, the loss could prevent them from winning the division.

It's appearing that defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt may have played his last snap for the team this season after sustaining a significant ankle injury against the Detroit Lions. He was rolled up on during a third-and-goal play late in the fourth quarter where Micah Parsons sacked Jared Goff, remaining on his back for several moments while the Packers' medical staff worked on him.

The replay showed a gruesome left ankle injury for Wyatt, who was ultimately carted off the field. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Tom Silverstein, Wyatt suffered significant ligament damage in the ankle. He's going to undergo more tests and an MRI once the Packers return to Green Bay, but the outlook isn't encouraging.

""Yeah, it doesn't look good, guys,"" said head coach Matt LaFleur after the game. ""I'm sick for him. I'm sick for us. That's a critical loss for our football team and for our defense, obviously.""

A former first-round pick, Wyatt is fresh off having the fifth-year option in his rookie contract picked up by the Packers. He's under contract in 2026 and he'll have an opportunity to rebound from his injury before signing a long-term extension, assuming that's the route general manager Brian Gutekunst wants to take. Barring any other additions, which isn't exactly out of the question, Wyatt should continue to be a starter along the defensive line next year.

Right now, however, the Packers will have to figure out how to move forward with someone as impactful as Wyatt. The fourth-year defensive lineman has four sacks through 10 games, including two in last week's win over the Minnesota Vikings.

""I can't say enough great things about him in terms of just watching him mature, not only as a football player but as a person,"" LaFleur said. ""I've got a lot of love for Devonte Wyatt and the whole locker room room does, too. It's bittersweet in regards to, yeah, we're happy about the win, but at the same time, we're sick about what happened to him.""

Wyatt's injury comes on the heels of the Packers trading away nose tackle Kenny Clark to the Dallas Cowboys in August. Of course, that blockbuster deal netted them Parsons, who, on Thursday, became the first player in league history to eclipse 12 sacks in each of his first five seasons. If Clark was still in the stable, the Packers may find it somewhat easier to absorb the loss of Wyatt, but instead, they'll have to scramble for answers.

The interior of the Packers' defensive line currently consists of Colby Wooden, Karl Brooks, Warren Brinson and Nazir Stackhouse. Wooden is already their starting nose tackle, so he isn't going anywhere. Brooks, meanwhile, is likely to take over in place of Wyatt, but he missed Thursday's game with an ankle injury. He played through the injury last week against the Vikings, but with a short turnaround between games, he was estimated as a non-participant in practice all three days leading up to the meeting with the Lions.

Brinson, who played 31 defensive snaps against the Lions, could be looking at an expanded role. The sixth-round rookie has been a healthy scratch for most of the season, but he's played in six games and led the team with five pressures against the Vikings.

Other in-house options to fill the void left behind by Wyatt are James Ester and Dante Barnett. Ester has spent each of the last two seasons on the Packers' practice squad and Barnett joined the team last month through the league's International Player Pathway Program. He hasn't played a single snap in the NFL.",https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/793/450/13450793.jpg?width=1200&height=628&crop=1.91:1&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-28 12:01:58.600625

The Packers were leading 31-21 at the time of the injury.

Wyatt, in his fourth year with the Packers, stayed down after getting his ankle caught from under him on a play that ended with Micah Parsons sacking Lions quarterback Jared Goff. The sack forced the Lions to kick a field goal to get Detroit within 31-24 with 2:59 left in the game.

Before the injury, Wyatt had four tackles (three solo), including one for a loss and was part of a defensive effort that kept a Lions rushing attack mostly at bay in the team's 31-24 win.

Devonte Wyatt injury update

It's not confirmed but Wyatt's injury could be season ending.

“It doesn't look good, guys,” head coach Matt LaFleur said. “I'm sick for him. I'm sick for us. I mean, that's a critical loss for out football team, for our defense, obviously. And I can't say enough great things about him in terms of just watching him mature, not only as a football player, as a person.""

""I think you have to approach every week like you're going to start,"" said Anderson.
""D-Harm has been playing really good for us,"" said defensive tackle Cameron Heyward.","Before heading off for Thanksgiving dinner, Steelers players practiced at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex as they continued their preparation for Sunday's game against the Buffalo Bills.

Quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a full participant in practice on Thursday, the first time he has been a full participant since he suffered a broken bone in his left wrist against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 11 and went on to miss the team's Week 12 game against the Chicago Bears.

""I'm going to see how I feel after (Thursday), but I'm going to go (Thursday) and get casted up and then see how I respond,"" said Rodgers on Wednesday.

""I wasn't able to go last week. So, I'm hoping for a different outcome this week.

""I've had more days for the callus to form and more healing, especially Monday and Tuesday, just doing rehab. (Wednesday) I did a little bit more. (Thursday), I'll do a little bit more and see where I'm at come Friday.""

In addition to Rodgers, linebacker Alex Highsmith (pectoral), defensive tackle Cameron Heyward (ankle) and receiver DK Metcalf (ankle) were all full participants in practice.

Left tackle Broderick Jones left the Bears game in the fourth quarter with a neck. Jones has already been ruled out for this week's game.

It was Calvin Anderson who had to be ready at a moment's notice, stepping in for Jones and not missing a beat.

This week, Anderson knows he could be called upon again, but he is approaching the week the same as he always does.

""I think you have to approach every week like you're going to start,"" said Anderson. ""So, the good thing is I've been doing this for a long time now. And my approach doesn't change. And I'll be ready. If the team needs me, I'll be ready.""

Anderson, who is in his seventh season, signed with the Steelers during the 2024 season and appeared in four games, but finished the regular season on the Reserve/Injured List. He was activated and appeared in the Steelers Wild Card Game against the Baltimore Ravens. He was re-signed to a two-year contract in the offseason.

He is a player who understands his role, and in understanding it, knows he has to be ready.

""I've been in situations that are even more crazy than this,"" said Anderson. ""You have to approach game day, when you're a swing (lineman), being ready at any moment's notice. Just being able to turn it on. That's part of the preparation. And that way when the time comes, you can kick it off.""

The key for Anderson is balancing the physical side with the mental side of the game to be ready to go when called upon.

""I think it's a combination, but most of it is mental because on game day it's easy to just start getting into the flow of the game and check out,"" said Anderson. ""But you just have to be following the game and be ready to snap your body into playing, because at any moment the team will need you.

""And if the team needs you, you've got to perform so.""

Rookie defensive end Derrick Harmon has also been ruled out.

""D-Harm has been playing really good for us,"" said defensive tackle Cameron Heyward. ""Heavy hands. Just understanding. Even at a young age he understands the defense. Defensive line play. A lot of his counterparts.

""It's up to other guys to step up. Me and Keeanu (Benton) have to pick up our levels of play as well. When we have these opportunities where other guys are stepping in, it's usually by a group of guys, not just one guy.""

With Harmon out, expect to see a lot more of fifth-round pick Yahya Black. Black has also made a fast impression on the defense, picking things up quickly.

""I think Yahya is ready,"" said Heyward. ""Yahya is getting more comfortable in his alignment, playing with better extension. He's coming away with some big plays for us. That fumble (vs. Chicago). He just ripped it from the guy's arms. You need that from your young guys who are continuing to learn.

Anonymous: The answer to the whiparound question “what can stop the Ravens from winning the division?” is the Ravens.","Buoyed by the return of quarterback Joe Burrow, the Cincinnati Bengals have beaten the Baltimore Ravens 32-14 on Thanksgiving.

Playing for the first time since Week 2 after recovering from a toe injury, Burrow threw for 261 yards and two touchdowns.

His counterpart Lamar Jackson had a much tougher night, completing just over half of his pass attempts (17-for-32) and committing three of Baltimore’s five turnovers on the night.

Cincinnati snapped a four-game losing streak to improve to 4-8, while Baltimore saw its five-game winning streak end and fell to 6-6.

Despite the five-game winning streak and their ascension into a first-place tie in the AFC North, the reality for these Ravens was that the 1-5 start left them with little margin for error and they were always one loss away from being in trouble again. That the loss came Thursday to a divisional foe makes things even tougher. Obviously, it would really help the Ravens’ cause if the Steelers (6-5) lose Sunday to Buffalo. But regardless of that result, the Ravens probably are going to need to win their next two divisional games — home vs. Pittsburgh in Week 14 and at Cincinnati a week later — to remain in the playoff mix. They probably can’t afford another divisional loss over the next two weeks.

The Ravens have been expressing confidence for weeks that they are going to fix their struggling offense, but Thursday has to be rock bottom for Jackson and this group. After scoring their first first-possession touchdown since Week 4, the Ravens went six consecutive drives (not including a late second-quarter kneeldown) without scoring any points against the league’s 32nd-ranked defense. Included in that stretch were two Jackson fumbles deep in his own territory and an Isaiah Likely fumble as he was about to go in for a touchdown. The Ravens were able to mount a few drives in the second half, but the damage was done. Their turnovers (three by Jackson) were one more than they had during their entire five-game winning streak. Jackson looks like a shell of himself. Beyond the turnovers on Thursday, he missed a number of open receivers. The Ravens aren’t running the ball consistently well and their offensive line has struggled all year. Struggling in back-to-back games against the Jets and Bengals defenses doesn’t suggest a quick fix.

Is hope alive for Cincinnati? Easy on that thought. The Bengals are still two games back of the Ravens and need a Steelers loss Sunday against the Bears, but they aren’t dead. The AFC North tiebreaker would be a necessity, and they are 3-1 in the division this year with home games against the Ravens and Browns remaining. Again, the percentages are minuscule as they head to see Josh Allen and the Bills next week, but they still have a glimmer of hope. And they have Burrow.

While all the attention focused on Burrow’s return, it was instead the return of turnovers and an opportunistic Bengals defense that altered the dynamic of this game. The Bengals came into the game having forced just 10 turnovers all season, yet walked away with five against the Ravens.

This collection of young players, which has put together the worst first 11 games of any defense in history by DVOA, were making hustle and splash plays to suggest real tangible growth. Jordan Battle hustled after getting beaten to strip Isaiah Likely just before he crossed the goal line. Myles Murphy chased down Derrick Henry on a 43-yard reception, then blew up the pocket with a batted pass for a Demetrius Knight Jr. interception. Joseph Ossai broke free for two sacks, including a strip sack. This was the first time the Bengals allowed less than 26 points since the season opener. Hard to know how much of this correlated to Lamar Jackson’s struggles versus the Bengals’ improvement, but it has felt all year like a performance of this nature was impossible. Maybe the tide is finally turning for the Cincinnati defense.

There was no easing Joe Burrow back into action. He threw the second-most first-half passes of any game in his career (32) and the most by any quarterback this season. The work before halftime knocked the rust off, though, as he connected on impressive touchdown passes to Hudson and Iosivas, offering up big reactions with the competitive juices fully flowing in the second half. Burrow still often showed hesitation going off-script outside of the pocket, but was comfortable moving and hopping around while inside it. Timing routes were off, specifically inside the red zone, where the Bengals kicked three field goals, endured a goal-line stand and saw Burrow finish 2 of 12 for 18 yards and one touchdown. Still, the Bengals only punted twice all night and scored 17 points on their first three possessions after halftime to put the game away. When Burrow is playing, the energy and belief level rise for this club, and that proved true again in this game.

Bradley S.: Maybe one year we can see Burrow healthy for a full season and see what he can do in the playoffs. Such a shame it’s another waste of a season.

David H.: The entire AFC North should be declared ineligible for the playoffs. Signed, a Steeler fan.

Justin G.: Ravens have never had an answer for Chase. Dude absolutely burns them every single game.

Phil W.: Lack of pass rush hurts Baltimore again. We just need to realize we are not a very good team this year.

Justin G.: Ravens need to really do some soul searching in the offseason. That starts with re-examining Harbaugh and Lamar. Injured or not, Lamar isn’t even a top-15 QB right now, let alone an elite one.

It wasn't the case in first quarter as Amon-Ra St. Brown went down with an injury. The Lions' star receiver was able to walk off the field, but went into the locker room with 6:12 remaining.

St. Brown is one of the Lions' irreplaceable players, meaning his absence will certainly be felt on offense. The receiver was rolled up on during a running play for Jahmyr Gibbs.

Here's the latest on St. Brown.

Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update

St. Brown's injury doesn't look like a long-term issue, according to Lions head coach Dan Campbell.

The coach added that they would know more on Nov. 28, saying that their star receiver could miss a week or two if they're lucky.

St. Brown was ruled out for the remainder of the Lions' Thanksgiving game with an ankle injury after being initially listed as questionable to return.

The receiver walked to the locker room after multiple Lions players rolled up on him during the first quarter.

He appeared to be walking with a slight limp, but required no assistance from medical staff. St. Brown is the clear WR1 in Detroit's offense that is already without another key pass-catching option in Sam LaPorta.

It leaves Dan Campbell's team thin on potential targets, but they are better equipped to handle it than most, thanks to a top running back duo of Gibbs and Davis Montgomery.

And that takes us back to the Eagles' identity.","Star running back Saquon Barkley is on pace for less than 1,000 rushing yards and is currently dealing with a groin injury.

Injuries to key offensive linemen, including Lane Johnson and Cam Jurgens, have contributed to the team's difficulties in the running game.

Coach Nick Sirianni and quarterback Jalen Hurts emphasize that finding ways to win is more important than committing to a specific offensive identity.

PHILADELPHIA − It was simple for the Eagles in 2024. Get a lead. Give the ball to Saquon Barkley. Run out the clock.

That run-first identity took the Eagles to the Super Bowl.

But that hasn't been the case this season. The Eagles have taken leads, given the ball to Barkley, only to get stopped. Against the Cowboys on Nov. 23, the Eagles passed their way to a 21-0 lead early in the second quarter.

Then they tried involving Barkley and the running game. It didn't work. The Eagles didn't score another point while the Cowboys won 24-21. Barkey had just 22 yards on 10 carries.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

That has led to much hand-wringing about Barkley. One season after rushing for 2,005 yards, he's on pace for less than 1,000.

And now there's a new problem.

Barkley has been limited this week in practice with a groin injury, the second time this season he has shown up on the injury report with the injury.

Even if Barkley plays as expected against the Bears on Nov. 28, will the injury affect him? Will the Eagles have to adjust their game plan? Could Tank Bigsby, who's averaging 9.1 yards per carry this season in limited opportunities (18 carries for 164 yards) have a bigger role?

And, most importantly, what's wrong with Barkley?

Eagles coach Nick Sirianni says nothing is wrong.

""I see explosiveness. I see power. I see all the things that have made him a great football player in the NFL,"" Sirianni said. ""Sometimes it's not happening in the run game. But you see that explosiveness also in the pass game ... We just have to find ways to get him the ball, and get him in space, and that'll be our focus.""

There are many factors that go into the success of the running game. Sure, Barkley has a lot to do with it. But so does the offensive line.

And the Eagles are struggling here, too. Right tackle Lane Johnson is missing his second game with a foot injury. Center Cam Jurgens has missed two games and parts of two others with a knee injury then a concussion. Left guard Landon Dickerson has dealt with injuries throughout the season while coming off knee surgery in August.

""I think it’s on all of us,"" Jurgens said. ""We can definitely play better as an offense as a whole. I’m not going to put anything on (Barkley). We gotta do better and open up bigger holes for him ... I’m not going to focus on how many yards he has, or what our stats are, or whatever. I’m just worried about how I can be better, and there’s room for me to improve, for sure.""

It certainly doesn't help that teams are focused on stopping Barkley first, then forcing the Eagles to beat them with the passing game. The Cowboys, for example, stayed with a five-man defensive front, designed to stop the run, even as the Eagles took their 21-0 lead by passing the ball.

Of course, the Eagles have Jalen Hurts at quarterback and top receivers in A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, along with tight end Dallas Goedert to make teams pay for focusing on the run. Smith, by the way, hasn't practiced this week because of chest and shoulder injuries along with an illness. It's not known if he'll play against the Bears.

Clearly, many of the Eagles' problems will be solved if the running game can work.

""We're trying pretty much anything and everything we can to find ways to get (Barkley) going,"" offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo said. ""I know that the guys are excited for something new this week to see if we can get it going.""

And that takes us back to the Eagles' identity. As in, what is it? And does it matter?

Celebrate the Eagles' Super Bowl win with our new book

""It's important to go into a game, find a flow, have an identity,"" Hurts said. ""But from a bigger point of view, nothing takes precedence over finding ways to win. And so that’s the most important thing ... settling on an identity, commit to it, and then we fine-tune those things knowing that there’s going to be some ups, there’s going to be some downs.

""But we’re all confident in what we’re doing, and we’re all confident in the direction that we’re going in.""

Then Hurts was asked what should that identity be?

""The identity needs to be something everybody is in alignment with,"" Hurts said. ""So it’s not a matter of how it looks. I don’t care how it looks. I don’t care who does it. I’d just like for it to get done.

""I remember getting a question about the pass game taking a step (forward) after a loss. But it’s like, who cares? We didn’t win. So nothing takes precedent over finding ways to win. That’s what really matters.""","https://www.delawareonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/17/PWIL/87313893007-2247071307.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-28 08:04:18.208706

Released by the Giants last year before spending some time with the Minnesota Vikings, Jones signed this offseason with Indy and beat out Anthony Richardson for the starting job. He's run with it since, captaining the Colts to a terrific season so far.

Jones has thrown for 2,840 yards, 17 touchdowns (his most since his rookie season), seven interceptions and has completed a career-best 69.1% of his passes with a career-high 101.4 passer rating.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/b8qpbdc8wllyxzapqrqk,N,,2025-11-28 11:04:11.738583

Dart missed the past two games with a concussion suffered Nov. 9 against the Chicago Bears.
A source told ESPN that Dart was disappointed he was unable to play this past Sunday in Detroit.

""Well, we're still having the same conversations that we would have any given week,"" Winston said Wednesday.","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart cleared concussion protocol Thursday, setting the stage for him to return Monday night against the New England Patriots.

Dart missed the past two games with a concussion suffered Nov. 9 against the Chicago Bears. Jameis Winston started in his place.

Dart, a first-round pick earlier this year, has started seven games. He's thrown 10 touchdown passes and rushed for seven more.

The rookie returns after practicing in full for the first time Wednesday. He was a limited participant in practice last week.

A source told ESPN that Dart was disappointed he was unable to play this past Sunday in Detroit. He took reps early in the week as if he would be available, but ultimately wasn't cleared.

Dart, who has been checked for a concussion in four of his last eight games dating back to the preseason, was the first quarterback up at practice Wednesday. That seemed to indicate he was in line to return.

""Yeah, we had the same plan that we had last week,"" interim coach Mike Kafka said Wednesday. ""We'll kind of carry that into this week and then just really see what ends up happening throughout the process with Jaxson being in the protocol.""

They reviewed the good news on Thursday after Dart met with an independent neurologist. It's the final step of the protocol.

Dart's style of play has been a topic of conversation surrounding the Giants. The team didn't want to take away his aggressiveness.

Brian Daboll was fired the day after Dart suffered the concussion. Kafka has been the playcaller throughout the season.

Several teammates told ESPN in recent weeks they have been imploring Dart to slide more and get out of bounds, when possible, near the sideline. They know he can't keep taking the same type of hits.

Dart is taking close to 10 hits per game.

""The best ability is availability,"" Winston said recently.

The Giants (2-10) enter Monday night on a six-game skid. They are currently in the midst of a franchise-record 12-game losing streak on the road.

New York has a bye next week. The Giants were hopeful entering this week that Dart would be able to return for the prime-time contest.

""Well, we're still having the same conversations that we would have any given week,"" Winston said Wednesday. ""I think he's locked into that point. I mean, last week, man, he was determined to play. It's just the NFL has a strict protocol and that's what happened. I was grateful, but at the same time, I felt for him because I know how much work he puts in, and I know how he prepares, and I just told him I had his back. But we're not doing anything different. We're still having the same conversations. He's still putting in his work and hopefully this week he'll be able to bounce back and help lead us to a win.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1020%2Fr1563053_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 08:04:21.061562

St. Brown was ruled out after halftime, and according to coach Dan Campbell, he will miss some time.

Campbell said in his postgame press conference that, while St. Brown may have avoided a lengthy absence, team doctors expect the standout pass catcher to be sidelined for multiple weeks.

""I'll know more tomorrow,"" Campbell said. ""I don't feel like this is long-long-term. That's the good news, but it could be a week or two, maybe, if we're lucky.""

On the game's second drive, St. Brown was rolled up from behind while blocking on a run play. He remained on the turf for a few minutes while he was evaluated by trainers. Eventually, St. Brown got up and walked off the field, straight to the locker room. He was initially listed as questionable to return, only to be officially ruled out in the third quarter.

In 11 games this season, St. Brown has caught 75 passes for 884 yards and nine touchdowns. The Lions on Sunday were already playing without tight end Sam LaPorta, who was placed on injured reserve earlier this month with a back injury, and wide receiver Kalif Raymond, who was inactive with an ankle injury.

Dan Campbell will call upon Jameson Williams, Tom Kennedy, plus rookies Isaac TeSlaa and Dominic Lovett, to potentially step up in St. Brown's absence.

With St. Brown out of the lineup, the Lions have some work to do if they're going to climb the NFC North standings down the stretch. Now 7-5, Detroit sits third in the NFC North, looking up at the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears. Over the next two weeks, the Lions get crucial NFC clashes against the Dallas Cowboys and Los Angeles Rams.

Jones played in last Sunday's game at Kansas City, with the Colts giving up a 20-9 lead before losing in 23-20 in overtime. Jones completed just 3 of 8 pass attempts for 17 yards in the fourth quarter while the Colts went three-and-out on three consecutive possessions.

Dissenting View: ""He is not top 4 yet""
