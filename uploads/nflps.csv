Now their present and future are a nightmare.,Rohan Nadkarni,,,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/indianapolis-colts-nfl-daniel-jones-philip-rivers-rcna248054,"Ten weeks into the NFL season, the Indianapolis Colts were the surprise of the league.
In his lone year with Indianapolis, Rivers went 11-5, completing 68.0% of his passes for 4,169 yards, with 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.
Meanwhile, the injury to Jones puts Indianapolis in a tricky situation with regard to the team’s future at quarterback.
On top of all that, it’s possible an even more desperate team could outbid the Colts for Jones’ services.
What started as a season of surprise has turned into disbelief at how quickly the Colts have been given an uncertain future.","Ten weeks into the NFL season, the Indianapolis Colts were the surprise of the league.

After a 31-25 win over the Atlanta Falcons in Berlin on Nov. 9, the Colts were 8-2, tied for the most wins in the AFC, and had a legitimate chance to be the No. 1 seed in the conference headed into the playoffs.

But just one month later, Indianapolis is 8-5, loser of three straight and owner of a murky future after a risky trade and a catastrophic injury.

Things started going downhill with a losing streak that included two close defeats.

The Colts had a 20-9 fourth-quarter lead on the road against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 12, only to give up the final 14 points of the game and lose in overtime. The next week, Indianapolis was tied 13-13 with the Houston Texans in the fourth before losing 20-16.

The wheels came off Sunday in a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Not only was Indianapolis blown out 36-19, but quarterback Daniel Jones — an early-season MVP candidate and one of the feel-good stories of the year — also tore his right Achilles, ending his season.

“That’s our team leader, our team captain,” wide receiver Alec Pierce told reporters after the game. “It’s brutal.”

After the loss to the Jaguars, Indianapolis went from tied for first place in the AFC South to out of the playoff picture entirely, and it now faces issues on multiple fronts.

Having lost four of their last five games, the Colts are in danger of missing the playoffs entirely. Indianapolis has four games left, all against teams that would currently be in the playoffs. (The .692 winning percentage of the Colts’ remaining opponents is the highest in the NFL, per Tankathon.)

In addition to the injury to Jones, backup quarterback and rookie Riley Leonard is dealing with a knee injury, head coach Shane Steichen said Monday. Steichen added “the hope” is that Leonard can play Sunday, though there is no guarantee.

The only other healthy quarterback on the team is Brett Rypien, who is on the practice squad. Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2023 draft, has thrown only two passes in garbage time this season and is on injured reserve with an orbital fracture.

How severe is the situation? Indianapolis reportedly will work out 44-year-old Philip Rivers on Tuesday. Rivers last played in the NFL for the Colts in 2020 and announced his retirement in January 2021. He has since been coaching high school football in Alabama.

In his lone year with Indianapolis, Rivers went 11-5, completing 68.0% of his passes for 4,169 yards, with 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He also has experience with Steichen, who was an assistant coach with the then-San Diego Chargers from 2014 to 2019 while Rivers was on the team.

Meanwhile, the injury to Jones puts Indianapolis in a tricky situation with regard to the team’s future at quarterback.

Jones is on a one-year contract that pays him only $14 million. He was almost certainly in line for a massive raise before the injury, though he had cooled off after his hot start to the season.

Now, the Colts will have to make a decision on Jones without the valuable information that could have been gleaned from his play down the stretch and in the playoffs. Indianapolis will also have to figure out how much to pay a player coming off a significant injury and whether Jones will even be ready by the start of next season.

On top of all that, it’s possible an even more desperate team could outbid the Colts for Jones’ services.

Indianapolis certainly seemed committed to its current build around Jones, so much so that in November it traded first-round picks in 2026 and 2027 for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who missed the loss to Jacksonville with a calf injury. That means that even if the Colts wanted an option to move on from Jones in the near future, they won’t be able to draft a quarterback in the first round until 2028 unless they make another trade.

How to move forward will be a series of high-stakes decisions for Indianapolis. The best-case scenario, almost regardless of what happens the rest of this year, is for Jones to come back in time for next season and resemble the player he was for much of 2025.

The last time Rivers was in the NFL, he played under current Colts head coach Shane Steichen, who served as QBs coach for Indy from 2016-2019. Rivers has a longstanding relationship with Steichen, who was previously with the Chargers dating back to the 2011-12 season.

Over the course of his 17 seasons in the NFL, Rivers passed for 63,440 yards with 421 touchdowns to 209 interceptions while earning eight Pro Bowl nods.

Rivers is also the head coach of the St. Michael Catholic football program, coaching his son Gunner Rivers at quarterback -- who was recently on a visit to Raleigh -- along with NC State signee Noah Moss at running back. But with the high school season wrapped up after a long postseason run to the semifinals in Alabama, Rivers now has nothing but time on his hands to potentially play for the Colts.

The current starting quarterback for the Colts also happens to be a former ACC player in Riley Leonard -- who initially started his career with Duke -- and Rivers could help lead him the rest of the way. And with a chance to get the franchise back to the playoffs, this will be an interesting story to watch for

He will reportedly join the Colts for practices ahead of Sunday's game at Seattle.

Quarterback Daniel Jones tore his right Achilles in Sunday's defeat at Jacksonville and will have season-ending surgery.

Third-string Riley Leonard, the only quarterback listed on the Colts' depth chart, suffered a knee injury after replacing Jones.

Indianapolis were already without prior backup signal-caller, Anthony Richardson, who suffered an orbital fracture in October.

Rivers will work with Leonard, a rookie taken in the sixth round of this year's NFL Draft, but also learn the Colts schemes with an eye to possibly playing on Sunday, according to the reports.

Only four quarterbacks in NFL history have started a game at age 44 or older -- seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg.

The Colts (8-5) are one spot out of the AFC playoffs but will be tested in the final weeks of the campaign by Seattle (10-3), San Francisco (9-4), Jacksonville (9-4) and Houston (8-5).

Rivers, who has never played in a Super Bowl, spent 16 seasons with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers before playing his final year with the Colts in 2020.

Indy went 11-5 that season and reached the playoffs, a feat the Colts have not achieved since.

Rivers, who has been serving as a high school football coach, has not thrown an NFL pass since January 2021.

He signed a one-day contract with the Chargers last July so he could retire as a member of that team.

Rivers is a friend of Colts head coach Shane Steichen. They spent six seasons together when Steichen was an assistant coach for the Chargers.

I don't understand what's wrong with the protocol they took after the game to Figure it out.

We all saw it.

And this is the world that we now live in, where there are a million cameras watching every Single play in every football game.

That's why immediate review is so crucial.

Huge part of how NFL games are broadcast now, because they realized fans at home We were seeing something that the refs needed to be aware of.

At what point do we also acknowledge that fans at home saw T. Higgins repeatedly.

Grab his head.

We saw T. Higgins repeatedly point to it.

We saw a violent hit on the sidelines where his head bounced off the ground in the minute he Sat up, he grabbed his helmet.

Now, he stayed in the game; every time they, They checked him; they cleared him.

And I dont know what the protocol is.

Allowed him to get back in the game because to me, it seems fishy at best.

And for so many of us, Im the farthest thing from a conspiracy theorist, So many of us will look at it, though, and say, Well, why was he back in the game?

My question is, what's wrong with the protocol that we all saw him physically react Multiple times, hits to the head where his head bounced off the ground.

We all saw it.

We saw his hands; we saw him reach for his head.

What is wrong with the protocol we all saw This happened in real time, and nothing was caught Until after the game?

The most important thing here is T. Higgins Get healthy.

And once you've had multiple concussions, This short proximity, suddenly we're gonna wonder about your health moving forward.

Those are all fair questions to ask.

The most important thing we want is for T Higgins is getting healthy now.

But also on top of all that, The NFL needs to look in the mirror this offseason and figure out what's wrong Their protocol, that somebody so clearly bothered, was examined multiple times, An independent neurologist allowed him to come back in the game.

Again, I'm not screaming conspiracy theory.

Eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback Philip Rivers ended his retirement and signed with the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad today in a surprise move for the 44-year-old. Rivers last played an NFL game for the Colts on Jan. 9, 2021 in a wild-card loss to the Buffalo Bills.

The Colts started the season 8-2 before their Week 11 bye. They've dropped three games in a row since and lost starting quarterback Daniel Jones to a season-ending Achilles injury against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 14.

To add injury to injury, third-string quarterback Riley Leonard also suffered a knee injury during Week 14 when he entered the game for Jones.

It's unclear whether Rivers will get the start in Week 15 against the Tennessee Titans. He worked out for the team yesterday and ""threw the ball well"" on his 44th birthday. If Leonard isn't able to go, the Colts may rely on Rivers - who is in his first year as a Hall of Fame semifinalist.

With a start, he'd be the latest notable quarterback to un-retire and take the field once again. Here are three examples of that happening in the last 20 years:

NFL QBs to come out of retirement

Teddy Bridgewater

The former first-round pick spent the first four years of his career in Minnesota with the Vikings before bouncing around to New Orleans (2018-19), Carolina (2020), Denver (2021), Miami (2022) and Detroit (2023). After his lone season with the Lions, Bridgewater decided to hang up his cleats in December of that season.

He spent a calendar year away from the NFL and won a state championship with his alma mater, Miami Northwestern High School, before reuniting with the Lions late in the 2024 season. Detroit was hit hard by injuries all year and Bridgewater came on as veteran insurance at the most important position.

He's stuck around, though, and is currently the backup in Tampa Bay for Baker Mayfield.

Tom Brady

The future Pro Football Hall of Famer flirted briefly with retirement in February 2022 after a second season with the Buccaneers. It wasn't for a drop-off in performance; he'd set a career-high in passing yards with 5,316 and led the NFL in touchdowns with 43 in 2021.

His retirement was ultimately short-lived. Brady needed just 40 days to decide he wanted back in and returned to the Buccaneers for the 2022 NFL season. His return wasn't as triumphant as the previous two years; Tampa Bay went 8-9, giving him his lone losing season as a starter in the NFL. Brady retired again - this time for good - in February 2023 and transitioned immediately to the broadcast booth.

Brett Favre

NFL fans under the age of 27 may not remember the annual offseason drama that was Favre's retirement decision. The three-time MVP and Hall of Famer mulled retirement on a yearly basis in the late 2000s. His future was in doubt after the 2006 season but he ultimately returned to the Green Bay Packers for the 2007 season. On March 4, 2008, he retired for the first time.

Four months later, he wanted to return to the team but Green Bay did not grant him an unconditional release. The Packers eventually traded him to the New York Jets for a 2009 draft pick. Favre led he league in interceptions and went 9-7 as a starter.

He had a resurgent season in 2009 with the Minnesota Vikings. He nearly made the Super Bowl, falling in the NFC championship game to the eventual champion Saints on a late interception. Favre returned in 2010 and went 5-8 as a starter before officially filing his retirement papers in January 2011.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/USAT/87690934007-usatsi-15453184.jpg?crop=4262,2398,x0,y319&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 00:59:54.215764

The next few games could cause a ripple effect heading into the Browns 2026 offseason, as seen here in our recent 2026 NFL mock draft. The next three games will be a step up in difficulty for Sanders and the Cleveland offense, made more difficult by injuries that are setting up a look at the future.

On Tuesday, the Browns made six moves on their roster with at least two more to come:

Placed OL Ethan Pocic, RB Jerome Ford (shoulder) on injured reserve

Released DE Ochaun Mathis and LB Mark Robinson from the practice squad

Signed OL Darrian Dalcourt and DT Keith Cooper Jr. to the practice squad

As noted in the team’s press release, Dalcourt, a center, was undrafted in 2024 and played on three different practice squads, while Cooper was undrafted this year and spent time with the Detroit Lions.

Neither has seen an NFL snap.

But they're also in the midst of a four-game stretch against teams fighting for postseason position.

On Sunday, Dec. 14, the Packers travel to Denver to face the Broncos, owners of the best record in the AFC (11-2) after defeating the Las Vegas Raiders last week.

Like the Packers, the Broncos are battling for the top seed in their conference with the New England Patriots, who are also 11-2. Denver has won 10 straight games, its longest winning streak since it won the Super Bowl with Peyton Manning in 2012.

However, oddsmakers are apparently more impressed with the Packers. They opened as 2.5-point favorites on the road. Part of the reason might be that eight of the Broncos' 10 victories in their streak have come by one score or less and six have been by three points or less.

The Packers and Broncos have two of the better defenses in the NFL, with the Packers allowing 285 yards a game and 24 touchdowns and the Broncos allowing 296 yards a game and 20 touchdowns.

Packers injury update

Wide receiver Jayden Reed and linebacker Quay Walker returned to action against the Bears. Reed finished with four catches for 31 yards.

Wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks, who's battling an ankle injury, is day-to-day, according to coach Matt LaFleur.

Wicks should have a chance to test his ankle this week before the team decides whether he can play in Denver.

“We’ll see how he progresses,” LaFleur said, “but certainly we need him out there. He’s a guy who, you can see it early in the routes that he was running, there was one in particular – it might’ve been the first play of the game – where (Bears cornerback) Jaylon Johnson is pressed on him, and his ability to get a guy to move off the spot is pretty impressive.”

Who Will Win The AFC Championship? Top Contenders

Here are our top three AFC Championship contenders as the season reaches Week 15. AFC Championship winner payouts courtesy of PrizePicks Team Picks, where you can pick which team you think will win the AFC Championship and earn money if your picks are right!

#3: New England Patriots (11-2)

AFC Championship Winner Payout via PrizePicks Team Picks: 4.16x Yes | 1.2x No

The New England Patriots (11-2) are the AFC’s biggest surprise. They became the first team to reach 11 wins this season and lead the AFC East ahead of Buffalo, returning to the glory days — but will that success follow them in the playoffs?

Second-year QB Drake Maye has fueled the turnaround with an MVP-caliber season — throwing for 3,412 yards (second in NFL) and 23 TDs with a league-best 71.5% completion rate.

New England’s offense ranks top-10 in scoring (27.0 PPG) and total yards (362.6 YPG), while its defense allows just 18.5 PPG and 296.4 YPG.

Despite their regular-season dominance, playoff inexperience keeps the Patriots behind more seasoned contenders. Maye could erase those doubts in January, but for now, they remain a tier below the AFC’s elite.

{{nfl_offer_banner=""/style-system/ui-components-playbook""}}

#2: Denver Broncos (11-2)

AFC Championship Winner Payout via PrizePicks Team Picks: 4.34x Yes | 1.17x No

Head coach Sean Payton has engineered a stunning turnaround in Denver. The Broncos (11–2) have gone from a 5–12 team just two seasons ago to a legitimate Super Bowl contender.

Broncos QB Bo Nix has validated Payton’s faith, producing 2,954 passing yards and 19 TDs while mastering the system with rare poise. Denver is 9–2 in one-score games, a mark that speaks to its resilience.

Behind their second-year QB, the Broncos average 23.7 points and 342 yards per game, while the defense ranks among the NFL’s best, allowing just 18.1 PPG and 282.0 YPG. Broncos edge rushers Nik Bonitto and Jonathon Cooper have combined for 20 sacks, leading a defense that tops the league with 55 sacks.

With Payton’s postseason experience and a balanced roster, the Broncos are built like a team poised for a deep playoff run.

#1: Buffalo Bills (9-4)

AFC Championship Winner Payout via PrizePicks Team Picks: 4.16x Yes | 1.19x No

The Buffalo Bills (9-4) enter December as the AFC’s most dangerous team. Despite trailing New England in the East, they boast a 96% playoff probability and remain in position to take the AFC East crown and seize home-field advantage.

Bills QB Josh Allen is having one of his best seasons — posting 3,083 passing yards, 487 rushing yards, and 34 total TDs while completing 70.1% of his throws.

Buffalo’s offense is the conference’s most explosive, averaging 28.9 PPG and 383.7 YPG. The offensive line ranks top-two in both pass-block (73%) and run-block (74%) win rates, giving Allen the protection and balance needed to thrive.

Defensively, the Bills allow just 22.5 PPG and 307 YPG with steady takeaway production (1.3 per game). Under head coach Sean McDermott, Buffalo’s consistency and postseason experience make it the team to beat in the AFC.

Here are five things to know about the Packers' new defensive linemen: Both are former NFL draft picks.
Bohanna played his first two NFL seasons for former Packers coach Mike McCarthy in Dallas and was teammates with current Green Bay cornerback Carrington Valentine at Kentucky.
Riley played at four different colleges.
A native of New Bern, N.C., Riley played one season at North Carolina before transferring to Garden City (Kan.) Community College in 2019.","GREEN BAY – With Devonte Wyatt out with a season-ending ankle injury, the Packers have beefed up the defensive line with the addition of veterans Quinton Bohanna and Jordon Riley.

Bohanna (6-4, 327) has recorded 42 tackles (three for loss) in 39 career games (13 starts) over five NFL seasons spent in Dallas, Detroit, Tennessee and Seattle. The Packers claimed him off waivers from the Seahawks on Saturday.

Riley (6-5, 338) has racked up 20 tackles (four for loss) in 22 games (five starts) after spending his first 2½ seasons with the New York Giants. He joined Green Bay last week after the Packers signed him off the Giants' practice squad.

""Devonte was doing a heck of a job just playing with great fundamentals, great technique and he's one of our better run defenders,"" said Head Coach Matt LaFleur on Monday.

""So just to add a little bit more beef on our D-line, we thought that was an important part. Each week it's gonna be a competition in terms of who's gonna be the guys out there playing.""

Here are five things to know about the Packers' new defensive linemen:

Both are former NFL draft picks.

The Cowboys selected Bohanna in the sixth round (192nd overall) of the 2021 NFL Draft.

Most of Bohanna's NFL playing time came during his two years in Dallas, where he recorded 29 tackles in 27 games with 10 starts before being cut at the end of training camp in 2023.

The Giants took Riley in the seventh round (243) of the 2023 NFL Draft. The 27-year-old defensive lineman started five of the 12 games he played for New York last year.

Riley didn't make the Giants' 53-man roster this past summer but signed to the practice squad the day after final cuts.

Bohanna is known as a space-eating, run-stuffer.

A former team captain at Kentucky, ""Big Bo"" is a massive defensive tackle who played in the 350-pound range while racking up 45 tackles and two sacks over 45 collegiate games with 31 starts.

A former three-star recruit, Bohanna was a finalist for the Tennessee Class 6A Mr. Football award in 2016 after recording 91 tackles (24 for loss) as a senior at Cordova (Tenn.) High School.

The 26-year-old defensive lineman's prodigious size for a nose tackle shot Bohanna onto NFL radars in 2021. Leading up to the draft, NFL.com's Lance Zierlein lauded Bohanna as a ""two-gapping nose with good power"" with the ability to ""man the nose in even or odd fronts and plays with decent knock-back explosiveness coming off the ball.""

Riley works out with Colby Wooden during the offseason.

Along with Giants' All-Pro defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence, Riley and Wooden trained with defensive line performance coach Mark Hall in South Carolina the past two summers.

The Packers' defensive lineman had a smile on his face when he learned during a meeting last week the team added Riley, who played 14 snaps in Sunday's 28-21 win over Chicago.

""Jordon's a heavy-handed guy,"" Wooden said. ""He comes from the Giants, where they played a lot of shade, a lot of zero (technique). They've done a lot of different things. For him to come in, it's going to be an easy transition I feel like. He's a get-along guy. He goes along. He doesn't cause any (issues). For us, he's going to be great. He's going to fit right in with us.""

Riley understands his value on early downs and makes it his priority to stop the run. Like Wooden, Riley was equally excited to have a fresh start in Green Bay.

""I'm blessed bro. Excited. Just excited, man,"" said Riley last week. ""Watching TV at home, then getting a call from my agent telling me I got (signed). Man, never moved so fast in my life. Opportunity just to be around some winning culture, man. Something in the tradition here, bro, I was doing some research and just all the things that happened here.""

Bohanna has several ties to the Packers, as well.

Bohanna was draft classmates with current Packers pass rusher Micah Parsons, whom the Cowboys selected in the first round (12th overall) in 2021.

Bohanna played his first two NFL seasons for former Packers coach Mike McCarthy in Dallas and was teammates with current Green Bay cornerback Carrington Valentine at Kentucky.

Bohanna played for Arden Duren in both Seattle and Dallas. Now serving as the Seahawks' defensive coordinator, Duren is a longtime NFL assistant coach whom Head Coach Matt LaFleur holds in high esteem after the two worked together in Atlanta.

Bohanna's uncle, Brian Ingram, also was a former linebacker for the New England Patriots and San Diego Chargers in the 1980s.

Riley played at four different colleges.

A native of New Bern, N.C., Riley played one season at North Carolina before transferring to Garden City (Kan.) Community College in 2019.

Riley spent his junior year at Nebraska, recording seven tackles (one for loss) in 10 games, before finishing his college career at Oregon, where he was teammates with Bennett Williams, the older brother of Packers safety Evan Williams.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/eg8u5u7yhavd77jlscva,N,,2025-12-09 22:00:23.037586

The Colts reportedly signed Philip Rivers after both their starting and backup quarterbacks were injured on the weekend.

The 44-year-old Rivers retired four years ago and recently became a grandfather, while also coaching at a high school.

What's next?

Indianapolis's season is on the line with four games left in the regular season, before playoffs start January 11.

The Indianapolis Colts have bolstered their injury-depleted quarterback corps by bringing 44-year-old Philip Rivers out of retirement and signing him to the practice squad, a person with knowledge of the deal has told The Associated Press.

The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team had not yet made an official announcement.

The move came less than 24 hours after Colts coach Shane Steichen confirmed Indy's starter, Daniel Jones, would miss the rest of this season after tearing his right Achilles tendon, and backup Riley Leonard injured his right knee during the weekend's loss at Jacksonville.

Rivers — who has 10 children and recently became a grandfather — has not taken a snap since finishing his career with a playoff loss following the Colts 2020 season. That was the last time the Colts (8-5) made the post-season.

The eight-time Pro Bowler announced his retirement in January 2021 and has been coaching St Michael High School in Fairhope, Alabama, ever since.

But it is not clear how long it will take Rivers to learn Indy's playbook — or work his way into game shape — as the reeling Colts try to snap a three-game losing streak next weekend at Seattle (10-3).

""Things happen. Wacky stuff has happened in this league. Your depth gets tested, your resolve gets tested as you get thrown into some adversity as a unit, as a coaching staff, as a position group,"" offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said, declining to take specific questions about Rivers.

""We've been through some fire out there, but our coaching staff's excited to draw a plan up and teach it.""

Rivers rejoins a team desperately trying to rebound from its worst stretch of the season, four losses in five games. Indy has fallen out of the race for the AFC's top seed and is tied for second in the AFC South with Houston (8-5), one game behind division leader Jacksonville (9-4).

Rivers ranked among the NFL's career leaders in yards passing with 63,440, 421 touchdown passes, and 12 4,000-yard seasons when he retired.

NFL Network reported that the Colts could sign Rivers – who last played in the 2020 season – to the practice squad. Since his retirement he has coached high school football. This season he led St Michael Catholic Cardinals in his native Alabama to the Class 4A state semi-finals.

Daniel Jones, who was enjoying a resurgence in his first season with the Colts, suffered a season-ending torn achilles in Sunday’s 36-19 loss at Jacksonville. Backup Riley Leonard, who replaced Jones, is dealing with a knee injury, although the 2025 sixth-round draft pick is expected to make the start at Seattle on Sunday. Former first-round pick Anthony Richardson suffered a broken orbital bone in October and has not been medically cleared to return. Veteran Brett Rypien is on the Colts’ practice squad.

“Things happen, wacky stuff has happened in this league, your depth gets tested, your resolve gets tested as you get thrown into some adversity as a unit, as a coaching staff, as a position group,” Colts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said on Tuesday, declining to take specific questions about Rivers. “We’ve been through some fire out there, but our coaching staff’s excited to draw a plan up and teach it.”

The Colts looked set for the postseason when they topped the AFC South with an 8-2 record, but have since lost three games in a row and are just outside the final playoff place in the AFC.

The Colts’ remaining schedule is tough as they face four teams who look set for the postseason: the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars and Texans. However, ESPN reports that the team believe Rivers would give them a chance at making the postseason.

After playing 16 seasons with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, Rivers completed his career with the Colts in 2020. He threw for more than 4,000 yards for the 12th time in 13 seasons, tossing 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions as the Colts made the playoffs before narrowly losing to the Buffalo Bills in the wildcard round.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f05a9fbfa7d05e9d683ddc692674c7e71f3993ed/458_0_2280_1825/master/2280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b75fde1312e9543eae5fdef9b382c3db",N,,2025-12-09 22:00:26.217121

His wife, Julie Ertz — an American retired soccer star and two-time Women’s World Cup Champion — reshared his message to her Instagram Story.

Ertz was injured when he tried to reel in a pass from Marcus Mariota, Washington’s backup quarterback, and took a hit from Minnesota defensive back Jay Ward in the third quarter.

The 35-year-old, who’s in his 13th NFL season, was visibly emotional while being carted off with his leg in a brace.

Ertz played 34 snaps and had one catch on two targets for 11 yards before exiting the game in what would be Washington’s eighth straight loss.

Star Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels left Sunday’s game with a left elbow injury shortly before Ertz did.

Head coach Dan Quinn told reporters after the game that Daniels was held out for precautionary reasons and could have gone back in.

Daniels dislocated that same elbow in Week 9 and missed three games. He returned Sunday against the Vikings.

Ertz tallied 50 catches for 504 yards and four touchdowns in his second season with Washington.

The bad news for Dallas is that Cowboys killer Aaron Jones also looks to be healthy and ready for another go at his favorite childhood team.

As for Trevon Diggs, he is set to return to practice, which will help determine his availability. Here is what Dallas is doing.

CeeDee Lamb injury report

The news continues to be encouraging as star receiver CeeDee Lamb goes through concussion protocol following his injury sustained Thursday against Detroit.

“He’s doing good,” coach Brian Schottenheimer said, via the team website. “Talked to him over the weekend. He’s progressing nicely, and hopefully things work out like we expect.”

The extra days Dallas gets coming off a Thursday game will help. At this point he rates as questionable for the Minnesota game.

Tyler Guyton injury update

Dallas offensive tackle Tyler Guyton, their No. 1 pick last year, injured his ankle in the Week 12 win over Philadelphia and is close to returning.

Jerry Jones said Friday on his radio show that the he’s optimistic Guyton will play against Minnesota.

""My thoughts are that he'll be available,"" Jones said. ""That's Dr. Jones (talking), and I know how you need to take that information. But the bottom line is my opinion is he'll be there.""

Schottenheimer was less rosy when asked about Guyton and defensive end Jadeveon Clowney.

“We will find out a little bit more over the next two days, 48 hours,” Schottenheimer said of their availability for Sunday Night Football.

Trevon Diggs Dallas Cowboys

Dallas’ cornerback Trevon Diggs, who has missed much of this season after suffering a concussion in his home, is set to return to full practice this week and how that goes will determine his availability for Sunday night’s game with Minnesota.

”I know who I am, I know what I can do on the field. I’m going to put that out there, I’m going to show them,” Diggs told the team’s website recently.

Dallas Cowboys next game

The Cowboys face the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday Night Football. The 6:20 p.m. MT/7:20 p.m. kickoff will be televised on NBC.

Dallas running back Javonte Williams hit a milestone against Detroit, as he went over 1,000 yards for the first time in his five-year career. He now has 1,022 yards on 215 rushes with nine touchdowns. He also has 33 receptions this year for 128 yards and two touchdowns.

The previous best year of his career was his rookie year of 2021 when he had 903 rushing yards for the Denver Broncos.

Aaron Jones injury update

Minnesota Vikings tailback Aaron Jones, a UTEP alum, has dealt with some injuries this year, most recently with a hamstring, but is healthy now. He had 14 rushes for 76 yards in the Vikings 31-0 win over Minnesota.

Jake Ferguson kettle jump

The NFL finally got around to assessing fines for Dallas’ Thanksgiving Day win against Kansas City, and a big surprise is that tight end Jake Ferguson wasn’t given one. After an apparent touchdown that was later overturned on review, Ferguson did the now somewhat traditional leap into the Salvation Army kettle.

In a departure from this tradition, the NFL didn’t give him a fine. The big kettle is considered a prop and props are illegal to use in celebrations.

In other news from the game,

Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco was fined $46,371 for illegal helmet use on Cowboys CB DaRon Bland, while Cowboys DB Markquese Bell was fined $11,593 for a facemask.

Philip Rivers will sign a deal with the Colts to join their practice squad after having a workout with the team on Tuesday, ESPN reported. The reported news of Rivers' signing comes two days after Daniel Jones suffered an Achilles tear in the Colts' loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Rivers, who turned 44 on Monday, spent the final season of his 17-year NFL career with the Colts in 2020. He joined them after spending the first 16 years of his career with the Chargers.

Rivers helped the Colts reach the playoffs in his lone season with the team, and Indianapolis is seeking to make its first playoff appearance since that season. The Colts appeared primed to make the playoffs earlier this season behind Jones' surprise play, but they dropped to 8-5 with Sunday's loss and are currently out of the AFC playoff picture.

The Colts' quarterback injuries go beyond Jones. Backup Anthony Richardson is still sidelined due to an eye injury. Rookie Riley Leonard relieved Jones after he suffered the injury in the first quarter on Sunday, but he's dealing with a knee injury. The Colts also have veteran Brett Rypien on their practice squad.

Rivers will support Leonard in the quarterbacks' room for now, but could serve as an option to start sometime down the final stretch of the regular season, according to NFL Media.

Rivers had one of the NFL's most decorated careers at quarterback since the turn of the century. He was named a Pro Bowler eight times in his career, ranking fifth all-time in passing yards and touchdowns at the time of his retirement following the 2020 season.

Rivers was also named a semifinalist for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2026 in November.

Sundell was replaced by Olu Oluwatimi, whose own injury issues during training camp might have been a factor in Sundell winning the starting center job.

It should be noted that Sundell received snaps at right guard in training camp and preseason. Anthony Bradford has had his ups and downs throughout his season and career, but his pass blocking has been very sturdy in recent weeks.

If not right guard in lieu of Bradford, would Sundell replace Oluwatimi and become the starting center again? Macdonald wouldn’t give any definitive answer on plans for Sundell.

Meanwhile, it’s a different story for tight end Elijah Arroyo. He left Seattle’s 37-9 win over the Atlanta Falcons with a knee injury after he was targeted on Sam Darnold’s interception.

“Elijah’s got a knee,” Macdonald said. “Just working through it right now, but I’d say this week’s probably in jeopardy for him.”

Arroyo has appeared in every game this season but the second-round rookie has just two catches over the last five weeks. If Arroyo can’t go against the Indianapolis Colts, the Seahawks would likely depend on Brady Russell and Nick Kallerup as backups to A.J. Barner.

Josh Allen and Christian Benford draw praise from coaching staff

Buffalo's thrilling 39-34 win over Cincinnati included superstar performances from quarterback Josh Allen and CB Christian Benford.

In the second half, Allen completed 13 of 15 (87%) passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns. He added 79 rushing yards and a touchdown as well, helping the Bills comeback from two separate double-digit deficits, including down 28-18 with under eight minutes remaining.

""He's just got this 'it' factor that is hard to question and hard to defend. So it's just a special quality that not a lot of people have, not a lot of players, not a lot of performers have,"" head coach Sean McDermott said.

OC Joe Brady praised Allen and the entire offensive operation for bearing down and sticking together throughout the game.

""When you have Josh Allen at quarterback, as long as there's time on the clock, you're going to be able to score points. The game's not over,"" Brady said.

One week after rushing 51 times for a season-high 249 yards in Pittsburgh, the Bills were explosive in both facets of the game against another AFC North team. Buffalo netted six explosive gains of 15+ yards in the passing game and five in the run game.

""We want to be able to show that we can win different ways and different styles of games,"" Brady said. ""Finding ways to win football games is the most important thing right now, and showing that we can do it in different ways I think is equally as important.""

Cornerback Christian Benford recorded a takeaway and a defensive touchdown for the second consecutive games, turning the tide in favor of the Bills with his 63-yard interception return for a touchdown to give Buffalo a 32-28 lead with just over five minutes remaining.

Benford is the only player in the league this season with two INTs, two sacks and two defensive touchdowns.

""He's just a pro, and he wants to be really good. He works at it, that's just who 'CB' is,"" DC Bobby Babich shared. ""If you were to tell me (before the season) he's gonna have a couple defensive touchdowns, it wouldn't shock me.""

What to expect from Darnell Savage

The Bills claimed safety Darnell Savage off waivers prior to Week 14. McDermott confirmed the 28-year-old has reported to Buffalo and the 28-year-old joins the active roster this week.

""Had a conversation with him this morning. He's a guy that we've had our eye on,"" McDermott said.

At this time of year, any addition made to the roster is done so with the goal of helping the team win games. What Savage's role will be is still being fine-tuned.

""Learning is going to take some time. Maybe he plays some safety, maybe plays some nickel, maybe some special teams,"" McDermott said.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/ewkyjxzog644icfrkkff,N,,2025-12-09 18:00:48.921342

Philadelphia Eagles @ Los Angeles Chargers

Omarion Hampton returns for the Chargers: The Chargers' first-round rookie was activated off injured reserve after last playing in Week 5.

Hampton began the year as Los Angeles’ lead running back, playing 77.9% of offensive snaps over the first four weeks. He was an every-down back, taking at least 72% of snaps in all situations, including 100% of the goal-line and two-minute drill snaps. He suffered an ankle injury in Week 5, which led to his placement on injured reserve. He was limited in practice on Thursday but practiced in full on Friday and Saturday, leading to his activation on Monday.

Najee Harris began the year as the backup and Hassan Haskins as the third-string back. Harris is out for the season, and Haskins also missed most of the games Hampton missed with a hamstring injury. Haskins was similarly limited on Thursday, practiced in full on Friday and Saturday, and was activated as well.

They joined Kimani Vidal, who started the year on the practice squad but was activated once Harris landed on injured reserve. Vidal played 71.6% of snaps from Weeks 6–11, taking at least 62% of snaps in all situations. With three healthy running backs, Los Angeles waived Jaret Patterson to clear a roster spot.

The Chargers used Hampton and Vidal in a frequent rotation, with each back taking only a few snaps at a time before the other subbed in. Haskins wasn’t involved on offense. There was a general tendency to use Hampton in run situations and Vidal in pass situations, though the split wasn’t as defined as most backfields. As the game progressed, the team leaned more on Vidal, with the second-year back dominating snaps in the fourth quarter when Los Angeles started playing from behind. Vidal caught a 60-yard pass on the opening drive, while Hampton scored a touchdown on that same drive — plays that accounted for most of their fantasy production.

There is a chance the Chargers were easing Hampton back in, but Vidal played well enough during his time as the starter that this could simply remain a two-man backfield for the rest of the season. Los Angeles has a tough matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs next week, followed by a favorable one against the Dallas Cowboys, and then finishes with another difficult game against the Houston Texans. Both running backs could be considered flex plays next week, but expectations should be tempered, as neither is likely to match the fantasy production from their peak usage weeks.

The Chargers adjust their tight end rotation: Will Dissly served as the Chargers' backup tight end, marking his first game since Week 7.

Los Angeles started the season with Will Dissly and Tyler Conklin as its top two tight ends, with Oronde Gadsden and Tucker Fisk serving as healthy inactives for the first two games. Dissly suffered a knee injury, which led Gadsden to emerge as the Chargers’ receiving tight end, while Dissly regained his role as the run-blocking tight end, similar to last season. Dissly returned in Week 6 and was part of a temporary three-man rotation.

From Weeks 8–13, Gadsden played 72.0% of the offensive snaps, primarily in 11 and 12 personnel. Fisk played 40.9% of snaps in 12 and 21 personnel, and Conklin logged 9.8% as a backup to both players, while Dissly has been a healthy inactive.

Fisk suffered an ankle injury last week, which kept him out of practice. He was placed on injured reserve, opening the door for one of the Chargers’ veterans to handle the 12 and 21 personnel roles. Los Angeles chose Dissly. They made Conklin inactive, which freed up a roster spot for another position. In future weeks, it’s at least possible that Conklin will also be active as a backup.

Gadsden’s role was unaffected by the movement among the backup tight ends, with his situational snap rates differing only a few percentage points from his averages over the last two months. He was a top fantasy tight end in October, but he hasn’t been nearly as involved in the Chargers’ passing game over the past month. He had his worst receiving performance of the season with one catch for seven yards. None of their fantasy playoff matchups are favorable, so he likely shouldn’t be in fantasy lineups going forward. Dissly served as a direct replacement for Fisk, as expected.

Jahan Dotson plays a limited role: The Eagles’ third wide receiver has seen his playing time decrease in recent weeks, and he showed up on the injury report this past week.

Dotson has spent the last two seasons as the Eagles’ third wide receiver, playing in three-receiver sets and rarely seeing snaps in two-receiver sets unless there is an injury. He played 90.8% of the team’s 11-personnel snaps over the first 11 weeks and just 9.0% of its 12-personnel snaps, with 14 of his 19 snaps in 12 personnel coming in Week 8 when A.J. Brown was out. His week-to-week playing time has varied entirely based on game script and formation usage.

That trend shifted slightly over the past two weeks, as he played only 75% of the 11-personnel snaps. Undrafted rookie Darius Cooper has taken the remaining 25%, along with a few snaps when Brown or DeVonta Smith needed a break. Cooper entered the game with just two career receptions, while Dotson has made several big plays this season. It seems likely that Dotson has been dealing with an injury, and last week was the first time he appeared on the injury report.

Dotson was limited in practice on Thursday and Friday with a toe injury before practicing in full on Saturday. Cooper again rotated in whenever Dotson came off the field in 11 personnel, taking an even higher percentage of snaps from him than in recent weeks. Cooper caught a 19-yard pass in this game, while Dotson had a three-yard reception.

The split between Dotson and Cooper won’t matter for most fantasy leagues, but it could become much more significant if Brown or Smith suffers an injury in the coming weeks.

Miscellaneous Notes

Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert was limited all week with a left hand injury that required surgery and was questionable, but he was ultimately active.

Los Angeles wide receiver Quentin Johnston was limited in practice on Thursday with a shoulder injury.

The Chargers activated wide receiver Dalevon Campbell from the practice squad, only for him to be inactive. While it’s common to see this when a player is elevated on Saturday as injury insurance and the starter ends up being active, it’s rare for someone to be elevated and inactive on the same day. With the Los Angeles wide receiver room relatively healthy, the move was even more unusual.

Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts threw an interception, recovered a fumble and fumbled the recovery on the same play. He is the first player with two turnovers on one play since 1978, according to Elias Sports Bureau.

Saquon Barkley recorded seven rushing touchdowns of 50 or more yards over the regular and postseason last year. He accomplished this once over the first 13 weeks and scored his second touchdown of 50 or more yards in this game.

The Eagles waived wide receiver Xavier Gipson on Monday. Gipson was primarily a returner, with only nine snaps on offense for the Eagles. Last week, Philadelphia turned to Britain Covey and running back Will Shipley as their kick and punt returners, making Gipson expendable.

Table Notes

• Snaps include plays called back due to penalties, including offensive holding or defensive pass interference. The other three stats have these plays removed.

• Targets may differ from official NFL sources. The most likely discrepancy would be from a clear thrown-away pass, where the NFL may give the target to the nearest receiver, while this data will not.",https://media.pff.com/2025/12/Barkley-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2025-12-09 22:00:48.622985

Indianapolis signed the previously retired quarterback, who last appeared in a game five seasons ago, to its practice squad following Daniel Jones’ season-ending Achilles tear Sunday, according to reports.

Rivers could potentially start a game down the stretch for the Colts (8-5), per NFL Network, with backup Riley Leonard week to week with a knee injury.

Indianapolis is in a desperate spot to save its season following Jones’ injury and potentially turning to Rivers would be one of the wilder NFL storylines in years.

He last played on Jan. 3, 2021 with the Colts, and just celebrated his 44th birthday Monday. Rivers and his wife Tiffany share 10 children together — and their oldest child, Halle, recently gave birth to a son.

Rivers is even a first-time semifinalist or the 2026 Hall of Fame class, and he would lose his eligibility should he sign with the active roster, according to ESPN.

However, the father of 10 apparently still has the itch and participated in a workout Monday and apparently showed enough that the team inked him to the practice squad.

ESPN further noted that a source said Rivers threw the ball well.

He’s now in line to potentially start a game, although expecting him to start Sunday in Seattle against the 10-3 Seahawks would be daunting task.

Rivers reportedly has strong knowledge of the Colts’ offensive system under coach Shane Steichen, and the team hopes that could pay dividends in this playoff push.

That Rivers is even in this spot is due to a chaotic chain of events that has left the Colts vulnerable at the sport’s most important position.

Jones was enjoying a revival season before dealing with injuries recently, including a left fibula stress fracture, and then tearing his right Achilles this past week against the Jaguars.

Leonard replaced Jones and completed 18 of 29 passes with one interception, but he suffered strained knee ligament, per ESPN.

Former starter Anthony Richardson landed on injured reserve after suffering an orbital fracture before an October game.

Journeyman Brett Rypien is also on the team’s practice squad.

The Colts are also scrambling since a season that seemed like it could potentially result in a Super Bowl berth amid an 8-2 start now may end without a postseason berth.

Indianapolis sits on the outside of the AFC playoff picture after losing Sunday to the Jaguars, its third straight loss and fourth in five games, although they have the same record as the Texans.

A castoff by the New York Giants a season ago, Jones had thrust himself into the early MVP conversation amid the Colts’ 7-1 start.","The Indianapolis Colts’ worst fear has been realized. Starting quarterback Daniel Jones will miss the rest of the 2025 season with a torn right Achilles, Colts coach Shane Steichen announced Monday. Jones will undergo surgery this week. The veteran suffered the non-contact injury while throwing a pass near the end of the first quarter of Sunday’s 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

“Obviously, just really feel for him. Just an unfortunate situation,” Steichen said of Jones. “The work that he puts in, the effort on a day-to-day basis, the grind, a team captain for us — just very unfortunate. One of the toughest guys I’ve been around. So, just praying for a speedy recovery.”

Jones ended his season with 3,101 passing yards and 19 touchdowns against eight interceptions in 13 games. His 68.0 completion percentage is tied with Philip Rivers (2020) for the second highest in Colts history for a single season, trailing only Hall of Famer Peyton Manning’s 68.8 percent in 2009. Jones also totaled 45 carries for 164 yards and five touchdowns on the ground.

The loss of Jones deals a major blow to the Colts’ already dwindling playoff hopes. Following Sunday’s defeat, which was their third straight, the Colts’ odds to make the playoffs dropped to 30 percent, per The Athletic’s NFL Playoff Simulator, powered by Austin Mock’s NFL Projection Model. Their odds to win the AFC South for the first time since 2014 plummeted to 3 percent.

That’s Indy’s new reality without a proven backup to replace Jones. Anthony Richardson Sr., the 2023 No. 4 pick, began the season as the Colts’ QB2 and could have been a viable option, since he’s 8-7 as a starter. However, he is still on injured reserve due to an orbital fracture he suffered during a pregame warmup accident in Week 6.

Steichen said Monday that Richardson would not be activated off IR this week, thus ruling him out of Sunday’s game at the Seattle Seahawks. Last week, Steichen said Richardson was “doing some stuff in the weight room,” but he still hasn’t been cleared for on-field football activities.

“Obviously, anytime you’re dealing with an eye, you want to make sure he’s got full vision in that eye,” Steichen said last week. “He’s resting it right now, and once he’s cleared to go, I’ll let you guys know.”

With Jones set to join Richardson on IR, the Colts will put their season in the hands of sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard. That’s the first option anyway, according to Steichen, who said Monday that “the hope” is for Leonard to make his first NFL start Sunday. However, Steichen added that Leonard’s status is unclear since he suffered a right knee injury at Jacksonville.

If Leonard is unable to play, the Colts’ only other healthy QB is Brett Rypien, whom Indy signed in October after placing Richardson on IR. The 29-year-old NFL journeyman is 2-2 as a starter, and he last started for the Los Angeles Rams in 2023. He has thrown four TDs against nine picks in 11 games.

Asked if Rypien would start Sunday in place of an injured Leonard, Steichen was noticeably noncommittal, perhaps leaving the door open to sign another QB.

“Yeah, we’ll see how it goes,” Steichen said. “I mean, right now, that’ll be the guy that’s on our roster. So, like I said, we’re working through those situations right now.”

Despite Rypien’s edge in experience, the Colts still would like to play Leonard, who offers more versatility and upside as a dual-threat QB. Leonard was solid in his extended run Sunday, at least given the challenging circumstances. The 23-year-old rookie finished the game 18 of 29 passing for 145 yards with one interception. He also added a 6-yard rushing TD for his first NFL score. Before Sunday, the Notre Dame product had logged just six snaps and two pass attempts (zero completions).

“(With) more reps, obviously, the better it’s gonna be,” wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said. “Coming into this game, I could probably count on my hand how many first-team reps that Riley’s taken. So, just the fact he was able to fill in and play well shows the potential in him, and we’re just gonna try to support him every way we can.”

Still, asking a late-round rookie to save Indianapolis’ season is a tall order, especially considering the treacherous stretch that awaits. After facing the 10-3 Seahawks, the Colts play host to the San Francisco 49ers (9-4) on “Monday Night Football” in Week 16. Indianapolis will close its season with back-to-back AFC South matchups against the Jaguars (9-4) at home and the Houston Texans (8-5) on the road.

As Leonard tries to keep the Colts afloat, Jones’ season-ending injury has implications that stretch beyond 2025. After starting the year 7-1, the Colts went all in on this campaign, trading wide receiver AD Mitchell and their next two first-round picks to the New York Jets in exchange for two-time, first-team All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner. Indy general manager Chris Ballard and principal owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon never would have green-lighted that deal if they didn’t fully believe in Jones and expect him to return as the team’s starter next season — either on a new long-term contract or the franchise tag.

Now, nothing is certain. Jones is on a one-year, $14 million deal, and a ruptured Achilles this late in 2025 significantly jeopardizes his ability to play in 2026. The 28-year-old already has a long injury history, including the fractured left fibula he was playing through in recent weeks, a torn ACL in 2023 and neck injuries in 2021 and 2023. Jones’ durability issues could make the Colts, and other teams for that matter, hesitant to tie their immediate future to him.

This is a nightmare scenario for Jones, who had quickly revitalized his career in Indianapolis. A castoff by the New York Giants a season ago, Jones had thrust himself into the early MVP conversation amid the Colts’ 7-1 start. He began the season with 13 touchdown passes against three interceptions, plus four rushing touchdowns, in his first eight games. Jones tapered off over the last month, as did the whole team, but he still seemed to have positioned himself as the face of the franchise’s future. That future is no longer a formality.

The Colts have Richardson under contract in 2026, but after losing the starting job to Jones in training camp, he had to have considered his days in Indianapolis numbered. Could the Colts stand pat and give Richardson another chance to compete for the QB1 title next season? Or will they look for another stopgap veteran and hope he can be as successful as Jones was in this offense?

These are the questions the Colts will be asking in the coming months. The answers may be hard to find.

Ward’s third concussion

Just over two weeks ago, Colts cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. revealed that he contemplated retirement after suffering two concussions in six weeks.

Now, he has sustained a third concussion in 14 weeks.

Steichen said the veteran came to the team facility Monday with concussion symptoms and has been placed in the league’s protocol. Ward’s latest concussion is especially concerning, considering the scary and lingering effects of his previous one. The 29-year-old suffered his first concussion of the season in Week 1 and only missed one game with what he said felt like a migraine.

Yet, a freak accident during pregame warmups in Week 6, in which Ward and reserve tight end Drew Ogletree accidentally ran into each other, resulted in another, much more severe concussion for Ward. Neither player was wearing a helmet when they collided, and Ward was knocked out on the field.

The Colts ultimately placed Ward on injured reserve before his return in Week 12 against the Kansas City Chiefs, with whom he won the Super Bowl in 2020. Two days before that matchup, Ward detailed his second concussion and explained why it made him nearly walk away from football.

“I was throwing up, getting dizzy. I was getting dizzy for like a month,” Ward said. “That wasn’t normal, so that was like a real-deal traumatic injury for me.”

Steichen said it’s “always concerning when you have that many concussions” in a season. Whether Ward plays again this year remains unclear.

Indianapolis signed Ward, a 2023 second-team All-Pro with the San Francisco 49ers, to a three-year, $60 million deal in free agency. Over the last two years, though, he’s struggled to stay healthy while also publicly and candidly grieving the loss of his 23-month-old daughter, Amani Joy, who died in October 2024.

“Happy heavenly birthday AMANI,” Ward wrote in an Instagram post on Nov. 17, which would have been his daughter’s third birthday. “Haven’t been happy since you left us. God was wrong for this.”

In addition to Ward, Steichen said Monday that starting right tackle Braden Smith is also in concussion protocol and has a neck injury, and backup cornerback Chris Lammons has a foot injury.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/07164339/GettyImages-2250563352-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-09 19:00:37.193992

He was expected to be a strong trade candidate in the spring, but Jones’ injury likely changes that outlook.","In a devastating blow for the Indianapolis Colts, starting QB Daniel Jones tore his Achilles early in Sunday’s loss to the Jaguars, ending his season. Jones was already playing through a fractured fibula in his other leg, and though he wasn’t playing quite as well on it, he was gutting it out for his team.

His injury leaves the Colts at 8-5, currently outside looking in at an extremely competitive AFC playoff picture when just weeks ago they were 8-2 and vying for a first-round bye. Jones’ injury doesn’t just wreck this year, though. One torn Achilles turned what was a clear path forward for the Colts upside down. After trading two first-round picks for CB Sauce Gardner at the trade deadline with the intention of signing Jones to a long-term deal this offseason, Indianapolis finds itself at an unexpected and unwelcome crossroads. What will the Colts do?

What’s Next For Indy This Year?

With former first-round QB Anthony Richardson on IR, the Colts were forced to turn to sixth-round QB Riley Leonard against the Jags, to predictably poor results. Leonard would seem to be the one to finish out the season, except now he’s also dealing with a knee injury. Brett Rypien is on the team’s practice squad and is the only other quarterback on the roster. Even if Leonard was healthy, expect Indianapolis to add someone to their quarterback room in the short term.

The options for the Colts on the free agent market are extremely limited, as you might expect in December. Desmond Ridder spent some time with the Colts during minicamp early in the offseason, so he has a little experience with the team. Dorian Thompson-Robinson and Taylor Heinicke are some other options with relatively recent playing experience. The Colts are working out 44-year-old former QB Philip Rivers, which would be a different kind of Hail Mary to try and save the season. Rivers hasn’t played since 2020.

Alternatively, there are some intriguing options on other teams’ practice squads, including Trevor Siemian, Mike White, Kyle Trask, C.J. Beathard, Adrian Martinez, Sam Ehlinger and Will Grier. The most interesting name on that list is Ehlinger, a fifth-year pro out of Texas who spent the first four years of his career in Indianapolis. He started a couple of games for the Colts back in 2022 and was a valuable part of the organization during his time there, and the coaching staff is already familiar with him.

Players can be signed straight from other practice squads even after the trade deadline has passed, so if the Colts want to bring in Ehlinger (or another quarterback currently sitting on a practice squad) they can do so immediately. Players have to agree but the chance to play that the Colts are offering will be attractive.

As for Richardson, his return timeline is unknown, but it’s possible he could return for the last game or two of the season. At that point, it will likely be too late for Indy to salvage their playoff hopes (the Colts play the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars, and Texans to close the season), but there would still be a lot on the line for both him and the team as they look ahead to 2026.

What Is Jones’ Recovery Timeline?

The average Achilles rehab takes six to nine months post-surgery. However, this timeline can vary. The foot is placed in a cast for the first couple of weeks after surgery and then for a few weeks after that, rehab involves slowly placing more body weight upon the affected leg as it continues to heal. By six to eight weeks post-op, balance exercises begin, and four to six months into recovery is when basic jogging and light on-field work begin.

Full training ramps back up after that and it’s why recovery timelines can be so different player to player. Athletes put their Achilles tendons through far more stress than the average person, frequently putting enormous strain on them through sharp cuts and jumps. A player won’t be cleared to return to practice until they can go through all of their usual on-field activity with no restrictions. What that looks like for each player will vary, as will how their body is responding and the general healing pace.

Because the Achilles tendon is attached directly to the calf muscles, athletes often lose power and motion in that leg even after a full recovery. NBA star Kevin Durant said his calf muscle is now permanently shorter after tearing his right Achilles. High-level athletes often need more time than the standard “six to nine months” that you hear, especially to return to full strength and their prior performance level.

The good news for Jones is that as a quarterback, he can still be a positive asset even if his leg never returns to full strength. He won’t put his Achilles through the same intense stress that skill position players and especially linemen do. Still, mobility is a big part of Jones’ game, and we saw his performance dip over the last few games when he was hampered by the fractured fibula in his other leg. If he’s not able to move the way he used to, he’s likely a far less efficient quarterback.

Optimistically, Jones could be ready for the start of the 2026 season, but it’s extremely unlikely he’ll be ready to do any team work in training camp. He might not look like the quarterback the Colts have come to expect until 2027.

How Does Jones’ Injury Impact Contract Talks With The Colts?

If there’s a silver lining in this for the Colts, it’s that Jones’ injury should drastically reduce his market next offseason. It’s a devastating blow for a player who was heading toward a hefty mid-tier quarterback contract, but the potential bidding war between Indy and teams like Minnesota and Pittsburgh likely won’t materialize the way it was previously expected to.

The team most comfortable investing in Jones coming off that injury will be the Colts. They’ll have the most information on how his recovery and rehab is going, as well as his prospects for playing next season. If the Colts are hesitant to re-sign him, other teams may take that as an indication Jones may not play next year.

Before his injury, I think Jones was trending towards a contract similar to the ones Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold are on. Both were seen as quality starters who can win a lot of games but aren’t considered franchise-altering talents you need to lock down at all costs, and that’s a fair assessment of how Jones looked pre-injury. Those contracts sit around three years and $100 million, with about half that guaranteed.

Now, however, Jones could be looking at another one-year deal — if he plays at all. Right now, he’s on a one-year, $14 million contract, and I’d expect Indy to be able to re-sign him to a similar deal. Jones would then enter next season in essentially the same position he was in this year, but with a lot more trust from the Colts should his injury recovery go well.

Do The Colts Have Other Options?

Without a first-round pick until 2028, not many. Not that this is a strong quarterback class — Richardson would be a much better starting option next year than anyone Indianapolis could have drafted in the middle of the first round — but trading away that pick means the Colts have one less option than they would have otherwise.

Free agency is usually pretty bare when it comes to quarterbacks, but Indy did sign Jones in free agency after all. Marcus Mariota, Malik Willis and Kenny Pickett are some pending free agents who could be in play for the Colts if they target someone to come in and compete for the job under the assumption Jones isn’t ready to start the season. None of those names inspire much excitement, though.

The most realistic trade target might be 49ers QB Mac Jones. The former first-round pick of the Patriots has since spent time in Jacksonville and San Francisco with solid success. This season, in particular, he stepped in for an injured Brock Purdy and helped guide the 49ers to a 9-4 record, all while comfortably running HC Kyle Shanahan’s offense.

Quarterback redemption projects are in vogue right now. Everyone looking for the next Mayfield, Darnold, or Daniel Jones will be eyeing Mac Jones, and that may include the Colts. He’s under contract for one more year with the Niners, and they might collect a pretty prize for their backup quarterback.

Alternatively, Indy could swing bigger. Kyler Murray is on the outs in Arizona and has all but officially played his last snap for the Cardinals. The former No. 1 overall pick is dealing with a foot injury and is out for the rest of the season, and it’s basically an open secret that the Cardinals want to move on.

His contract is pretty hefty, but his talent is undeniable. Making a move for Murray — whether the Colts trade for him or wait out the Cardinals to sign him if (when?) he gets cut — would all but end Jones’ chances of re-signing in Indianapolis. But the upside with a move like this is high. It was only a few years ago that Murray was an MVP candidate leading the Cardinals to the playoffs.

Then there’s Richardson. The former No. 4 overall pick in 2023 has battled numerous injuries in his short NFL career, and he’s currently on IR with a broken orbital bone, suffered during pre-game warmups when a resistance belt broke and a piece of the machine hit him in the face. It was a freak accident, but it adds yet another extended injury absence to his ledger.

In the past, Richardson hasn’t been consistent enough down-to-down to run an effective offense. The big plays have always been there, but he’s barely above a 50-percent completion percentage for his career. That just doesn’t fly in the NFL, and it’s why the Colts pursued Jones in free agency to compete with him for the starting job.

Richardson put a lot of work into improving his mechanics this offseason and it seemed to pay off, as reports from Colts training camp indicated the battle between Jones and Richardson was extremely close. At the time, that didn’t mean much, but given how well Jones played, it’s at least possible Richardson took a meaningful leap this offseason. If so, it may change how the Colts approach next year.

Building off that, Richardson had a strong preseason in limited action, going 8/13 for 94 yards in two appearances, adding one rush attempt for nine yards. He was expected to be a strong trade candidate in the spring, but Jones’ injury likely changes that outlook.

It’s possible Richardson still gets traded, especially if Jones’ recovery is ahead of schedule and the Colts bring in a different backup they like. But given Jones won’t participate in training camp, I doubt Indianapolis would be comfortable giving up both their investment and insurance policy in Richardson for a fifth-round pick or equivalent.

What Will The Colts Do?

The Colts essentially have two main paths to choose from next year, and their decision will hinge on how Jones’ recovery is progressing. Nine months from now is the beginning of September, so it’s possible he’s ready to go at the start of next season, or at least close to it.

If Jones is tracking on that timeline, the Colts are probably fine with Richardson starting a couple of games until Jones is ready to go. They would re-sign Jones to a one-year deal and sign a veteran backup like Tyrod Taylor or Gardner Minshew, rolling into training camp with Richardson and the vet as the depth chart while Jones works his way back. If Richardson is lighting it up, they can continue to ride the hot hand and not rush Jones back into the lineup — otherwise, Jones plays as soon as he’s able.

In a sense, that would be pretty straightforward, and it’s the scenario the Colts will be hoping for. This season may turn into a lost season due to the injury, but as long as Jones can play most of next season, Indy can feel good about their plan moving forward.

If Jones won’t be able to play most of next season, that’s where it gets more complicated (and interesting). And Indy’s decision-making process will be determined by their evaluation of Richardson. If they like where Richardson’s development is at, they can bring in some competition (like Mac Jones) to push him and provide insurance while giving their top investment one last chance to prove he can be the long-term starter. Bringing in someone like Jones also ensures that they have a quality starter on the roster, and Jones could even win the job outright out of camp (and might be favored to), much like Daniel Jones was this past summer.

However, my guess is the Colts would pursue Murray. This team has a win-now mentality, as evidenced by their 7-1 start and aggressive move at the trade deadline. Steichen’s offense has a high floor and it’s one of the most efficient units in the league with competent quarterback play. This team, this staff and this organization wants to win now, and Murray would offer them the best chance to do that.

Will Murray run the offense as well as Jones did? That’s an unknown, but there’s one way to find out. The main flaw in Murray’s game is his documented struggles attacking the middle of the field, one of the primary ways Steichen’s offense functions. Still, he’s extremely talented, and Steichen is smart enough to tailor his offense to the quarterback running it.

While this season might already be over for the Colts, they actually do have a few options for next year. There’s a chance they’re right back in the mix in the AFC South in 2026.",https://i0.wp.com/nfltraderumors.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/USATSI_27766315_168383805_lowres-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1706&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-09 19:00:41.011806

The Eagles will be facing the Las Vegas Raiders this Sunday, and ESPN's Adam Schefter has revealed a major update on Johnson heading into the matchup.

""Eagles hoping to soon get back their All-Pro OT Lane Johnson from his Lisfranc sprain in his right foot, and they need him. This season, the Eagles are 0-3 without Johnson,"" Schefter wrote.

Schefter added that since Johnson's rookie campaign in 2023, Philadelphia has gone just 15-27 when he is out of the lineup. The former first-round pick is a six-time Pro Bowler and has earned a pair of First-Team All-Pro selections.

That being said, Philly's problems in 2025 run much deeper than Johnson's absence.

It seems pretty clear that there is a significant disconnect between quarterback Jalen Hurts and the rest of the offense this season, and the defense has also been wildly inconsistent.

The Eagles got off to a 4-0 start this year but have gone just 4-5 since, and even during Philadelphia's brief undefeated run to begin the campaign, you could tell that things just weren't quite right.

Adam Devine shared that injuries he sustained after getting hit by a cement truck when he was 11 years old are still affecting him to this day.

“It’s been a nightmare,” Devine said in a 2025 episode of the In Depth With Graham Bensinger podcast. “I have spasms all over. For a while, [the doctors] told me I was dying—literally, within this last year.”

He noted that pain comes and goes, adding, ""My body has all these things that are a little wonky and a little wrong with it.""

The Bachelor Nation alum shared that he went to the hospital “crawling on all fours” due to overwhelming back pain that was aggravated during an RV trip with a friend.

“Right now, knees to my toes, it’s, like, still tingly, which is crazy,” he said on a March 2025 episode of his Trading Secrets podcast. “And to put in perspective, I don’t know, man, like not to sound douchey, but like two, three weeks ago, maybe a month ago, I was squatting probably like 295 pounds. And right now, I can’t do a squat on my foot. I can’t do a one legged squat, I fall. It’s like I had a stroke or something.”

But with the help of a back specialist and some steroids, he added, “We’re on the mend.”

The Even Stevens alum shared in February 2025 that she was shot in the face while on a trip to shoot clay pigeons to celebrate husband Brendan Rooney's birthday.

""There was another party with us and they unsafely fired in the wrong direction and shot me in the face,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""@thebrendanrooney immediately sprung into action, assessed me, and rushed me to the hospital. I was hit in 5 places, one was less than an inch from hitting me directly in my right eye.""

The Kim Possible alum continued, ""Unfortunately a fragment got lodged behind my eye and it is too risky to remove surgically at this time. Doctors will continue to monitor me (I can see normally at the moment).""

The actress said she was grateful to be alive. ""I love my daughters, husband, family, and friends so much,"" she said. ""I saw my life flash before my eyes and I’m telling you, hug the people around you every chance you can. Life can change in an instant.""

While the internet isn't always a kind place, Amy Schumer is happy that, in this case, it helped her get answers.

""The internet really came for me after doing a bunch of press, and I was like, 'OK everybody, relax,'"" Amy recalled of her ""puffier"" face on a January 2025 episode of Call Her Daddy. ""But then doctors were chiming in in the comments and they were like, 'No no, we think something’s really up. Your face looks so crazy that we think something’s up. And I’m like, ‘Wait, I’m getting trolled by doctors?’""

After these doctors said they thought she had Cushing syndrome and that it may be caused by spiking coritsol levels or steroid injections, the Life & Beth creator thought, ""Wait, I have been getting steroid injections in my scars.""

""I had a breast reduction, a C-section, whatever, and so I was getting these steroid injections,"" Amy said. ""So it gave me this thing called Cushing syndrome, which I wouldn’t have known if the internet hadn’t come for me so hard.""

Toda, Amy is just relieved she's OK. As she shared in a February 2024 News Not Noise newsletter, ""Finding out I have the kind of Cushing that will just work itself out and I'm healthy was the greatest news imaginable.""

Hailey Bieber had the ""scariest moment"" of her life when she was having breakfast with husband Justin Bieber and started experiencing stroke-like symptoms in March 2022.

""Justin was like, 'Are you OK?'"" the Rhode skincare mogul shared a month later on YouTube, ""and I just didn't respond because I wasn't sure. And then he asked me again and when I went to respond, I couldn't speak. The right side of my face started drooping. I couldn't get a sentence out.""

While Hailey said the facial drooping stopped and her speech came back, she went to the hospital to make sure she was OK.

""They did some scans and they were able to see that I had suffered a small blood clot to my brain,"" the model added, ""which they labeled and categorized as something called a TIA [Transient Ischemic Attack].""

Later, Hailey went to the University of California, Los Angeles, where she found out she had a hole in her heart called a patent foramen ovale (PFO).

She explained the blood clot had traveled into her heart, ""escaped"" through the hole and went to her brain, leading to the TIA.

Hailey said she had a successful PFO closure procedure and was now feeling great.

The same year Hailey had her health scare, Justin experienced one of his own.

In June 2022, the ""Baby"" singer shared he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a condition that caused temporary paralysis to parts of his face and forced him to cancel the remainder of his Justice World Tour.

""It is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and has caused my face to have paralysis,"" Justin explained in an Instagram video at the time. ""As you can see, this eye is not blinking. I can't smile on this side of my face. This nostril will not move. So, there's full paralysis on this side of my face.""

In fact, he told his followers it had gotten ""progressively harder to eat."" But after a while, the paralysis went away.

""He's doing really well,"" Hailey said on a June 2022 episode of Good Morning America, later adding, ""He's feeling a lot better. Obviously, it was just a very scary and random situation to happen, but he's going to be totally OK and I'm just grateful that he's fine.""

While Jamie Foxx initially kept details of his April 2023 hospitalization private, he later opened up about what he went through.

One day in Atlanta, ""I was having such a bad headache, so I asked my boy, I said, ‘Listen, I need an aspirin,’” the Oscar winner said in his 2024 Netflix special What Had Happened Was... “Before I could get the Aspirin, I went out. I don’t remember 20 days.”

Jamie said he was initially taken to a doctor who gave him a cortisone shot and then sent him home. However, his concerned sister Deidra Dixon then drove him to a hospital, where they got an answer: He had a brain bleed that led to a stroke.

Twenty days after undergoing an operation, the Django Unchained woke up May 4 in a wheelchair and couldn’t walk. He then went to Chicago for rehabilitation and therapy.

""All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer,” he said, “because I needed every prayer.”

The reality star revealed that she ""died"" while running a mile during the first challenge of the NBC competition series.

“I don't remember a lot,” she explained on Fit for TV: The Reality of The Biggest Loser. “I remember hearing the helicopter. I just felt like I was floating. And then my grandpa was there. And then I saw darkness. But then I saw light. So I knew, I knew I died that day.”

“My organs were literally shutting down,” she continued. “I didn't realize that I had rhabdomyolysis. And rhabdomyolysis is your body's way of saying, ‘I'm going to shut down on you.’”

Emilia Clarke filmed battle scenes for Game of Thrones, but in 2019, she published an essay in The New Yorker titled ""A Battle for My Life.""

Having a bad headache at the gym, ""I reached the toilet, sank to my knees, and proceeded to be violently, voluminously ill,"" the actress wrote. ""Meanwhile, the pain—shooting, stabbing, constricting pain—was getting worse. At some level, I knew what was happening: my brain was damaged.""

She was taken to the hospital for a brain scan.

""The diagnosis was quick and ominous: a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a life-threatening type of stroke, caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain,"" the Emmy nominee added. ""I’d had an aneurysm, an arterial rupture.""

Emilia had immediate surgery to seal the aneurysm, calling the pain ""unbearable."" While she was recovering, she continued, she experienced aphasia and was ""muttering nonsense.""

A week later, ""the aphasia passed,"" Emilia added, and she left the hospital a month after being admitted.

At a 2013 brain scan, she learned a growth ""doubled in size"" and that she needed surgery again.

""When they woke me, I was screaming in pain,"" she wrote. ""The procedure had failed. I had a massive bleed and the doctors made it plain that my chances of surviving were precarious if they didn’t operate again. This time they needed to access my brain in the old-fashioned way—through my skull.""

Thankfully, Emilia shared, she's now ""at a hundred per cent.""

Snoop Dogg's daughter Cori Broadus is grateful for her family.

Because after she suffered a ""severe stroke"" in January 2024, her loved ones rushed to be by her side.

""I texted them that I just had a stroke and sent them a picture,"" she told E! News correspondent Will Marfuggi in December 2024. ""Everybody just came to my rescue.""

Because of other medical concerns, Cori ended up staying in the hospital longer than she initially expected.

""I could have went home after my stroke, but my lupus wasn't doing so well,"" the Snoop's Fatherhood: Cori and Wayne's Story star continued. ""My kidneys were failing. It was a lot going on.""

Today, Cori is on the mend.

""I'm doing great,"" she added. ""I just had a little bit of motor skills that I had to work back on. But other than that, I was fine.""

Shailene Woodley’s early 20s were not an easy time health-wise.

“It got to the point where I was losing my hearing. I couldn’t walk for longer than five minutes at a time without having to lay down for hours, and hours and sleep. Everything I ate hurt my stomach,” the actress said on a September 2024 episode of the SHE MD Podcast. “It was this conflation of issues and diagnoses and different doctors telling me different things.”

So Shailene—who chose to keep the exact condition private—set out to find answers.

“I come from a very holistic background and study herbalism,” she added. “So I was very keen on, ‘I’m going to work with real MDs, [and] I’m also going to work with independent kind of healers.’ Just trying to search for some sense of comfort in my own skin.”

It was a long journey—one that lasted for 10 years.

“Throughout that decade, a lot of other things came from feeling so much discomfort physically,” the Big Little Lies star noted, “which was, ‘My gosh, if everything I eat hurts my stomach, I’m now suddenly afraid of food.’ And then going into the kind of mental f--ckery that can happen with that of body dysmorphia and confusion about identity and feeling safe in my own capsule, in my own skin, what that meant, and what that should be.”

After tending to both her physical and mental health, Shailene is feeling much better.

“It was a journey that ultimately physically resolved itself, and I am very healthy,” she shared. “I’m so happy to be able to say that.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_1200,h_630,c_fill,g_faces,f_auto,q_auto,dpr_1.0/v1765297222/eol_images/Entire_Site/20251209/a8183de0-78ff-44bd-9601-2728db95ab69_1765297217.jpg",N,,2025-12-09 14:04:13.031209

With the division and a playoff spot on the line, the 8-5 Colts are bringing back the quarterback that started for them the last time Indianapolis made the postseason. Enter Phillip Rivers.

The Colts are signing the 44-year-old quarterback to their practice squad, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports. Rivers worked out for the team Tuesday, and the team felt comfortable enough to add him to the mix. Rivers became a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame just last month, but a potential induction will have to wait.

Rivers, who is now a grandfather, joins a new-look quarterback room headlined by Riley Leonard and Brett Rypien. Leonard is considered to be the new QB1 with Anthony Richardson still on injured reserve. However, the rookie is dealing with a knee injury, and it's unknown if he will start Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks.

There are four quarterbacks 44 or older to start an NFL game: Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg. Next Sunday, it will have been 1,800 days, or almost five years, since Rivers last took a snap in an NFL game, according to CBS Sports Research.

Oldest starting quarterbacks in NFL history

Rivers last played in 2020 for the Colts. He led Indy to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth, while throwing for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. The former No. 4 overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons with the San Diego-turned Los Angeles Chargers. An eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback, Rivers went 134-106 as a starter, and currently ranks seventh all-time in passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421).

How would this impact Rivers' Hall of Fame eligibility?

For the first time, Rivers is eligible for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was recently among the 26 modern-era candidates who made the cut as semifinalists. Drew Brees and fellow 2004 draftee Eli Manning are the other modern-era quarterbacks who are currently eligible for enshrinement next summer in Canton, Ohio.

The Hall of Fame requires a player to be retired for five seasons before he is eligible for induction. Under those rules, Rivers is no longer eligible for induction this year. If his plays this season, Rivers' Hall of Fame eligibility would reset, meaning he becomes ineligible for induction until 2031.

Rivers said on the ""Dan Patrick Show"" this offseason that he received interest from teams in 2021 and 2022. The New Orleans Saints even called Rivers and Drew Brees in 2021.

""The reason there was a little bit of a wait is there were a couple of November/Decembers there in 2021 and 2022 where I was staying ready,"" Rivers said. ""I threw on shoulder pads a few times and a helmet and was throwing in the yard and working just in case. And there were a few things that kind of got close. But then the last two years I pretty much knew I was done.""

However, it turns out that Rivers was not 100% done. He is back in the NFL for one last run.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/09/59b0e6db-b3a8-4bb0-a097-b689f0fcda2a/thumbnail/1200x675/833103937cbe9c079b833bdff53aeea8/pr.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 16:01:39.938011

The eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback, who turned 44 on Monday, is being brought in by the Colts for a workout on Tuesday and could be signed, according to multiple reports.

News of the workout comes 24 hours after Colts QB Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles tear during Indianapolis’ 36-19 loss to the Jaguars on Sunday, and after the team revealed rookie QB Riley Leonard is week-to-week with a knee injury of his own.

Rivers hadn’t played since 2020 and had only officially retired from the NFL in July.

NFL Network reported that the workout would help see if he would join the Colts’ practice squad, and ESPN’s Adam Schefter suggested there was still a question of whether Rivers even wants to play again.

“While the Colts need to work out Philip Rivers to see what type of shape he is in, the former quarterback who is now a grandfather also needs to figure out whether he’s willing to play, per source. For now he’s clearly intrigued enough to fly to Indianapolis,” Schefter reported on social media.

He had played one season with the Colts during his 17-year NFL career, spending the other 16 with the Chargers organization.

In his one season with the Colts in 2020, Rivers helped Indy reach the playoffs before getting eliminated in the Wild Card round by the Bills.

He also threw for 4,169 yards and 24 touchdowns in 2020, but that was five years ago and it’s unclear where his skills may still be.

Since then, he has been coaching high school football at St. Michael Catholic in Alabama.

Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles tear during the team's 36-19 Week 14 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. The 28-year-old was visibly upset after suffering the non-contact injury but will now focus on trying to ready himself for the start of the 2026 NFL season.

The Colts will be thin at quarterback with Jones out of action. Anthony Richardson, who started the season as the team's backup signal-caller, remains on IR after suffering a fractured orbital bone ahead of the team's Week 6 game against the Arizona Cardinals.

That leaves sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard as the team's starting quarterback and journeyman Brett Rypien as the lone other healthy quarterback in Indianapolis' organization.

That said, the Colts are highly likely to add another quarterback to the fold to provide depth behind Leonard and Rypien. The pickings on the free-agent market are slim, but Indianapolis – which, at 8-5, is still within striking distance of an AFC wild-card berth despite a three-game losing streak – could potentially get creative as it tries to keep its postseason chances alive.

Here's a look at some external quarterback options for the Colts to consider as they deal with a catastrophic quarterback injury.

Sam Ehlinger

Realistically, the Colts will probably have to sign a quarterback like Ehlinger to provide depth to their quarterback room rather than chase a dream option.

Ehlinger, 27, is currently on the Denver Broncos practice squad but spent the first four seasons of his career with the Colts. He was the team's third-string quarterback last season and would have familiarity with Steichen's scheme, making him an ideal backup choice for Indianapolis.

Ehlinger has made just three career starts, all of which came in 2022. He posted an 0-3 career record across those games and has completed 63.4% of his passes for 573 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions while adding 96 yards on 20 carries.

Taylor Heinicke

If the Colts want more starting experience than Ehlinger provides, Heinicke represents one of the best free-agent quarterbacks available. The 32-year-old has a 13-15-1 record across 29 career starts and has completed 62.5% of his career passes for 6,663 yards, 39 touchdowns and 28 interceptions.

Most importantly, Heinicke has experience comporting himself well as an emergency replacement at quarterback. In 2020, he famously was called upon to start a playoff game for Washington. He completed 59.1% of his passes for 306 yards, one touchdown and one interception while adding 46 yards and a score on the ground and gave the Commanders a fighting chance in a loss against the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Heinicke could be asked to play a similar role for Indianapolis.

Trevor Siemian

Like Heinicke, Siemian has a solid amount of starting experience. The 33-year-old has made 33 regular-season starts during his career while posting respectable numbers, including a 58.5% completion rate, 7,751 passing yards, 44 touchdowns and 32 interceptions.

Siemian is currently on the Titans practice squad, so the Colts would need to sign the Northwestern product to their 53-man roster to take him away from their divisional rival.

Ryan Tannehill

Tannehill might be an option in name only for the Colts. The 37-year-old admitted in a late-November interview with The Escapist he believes he is likely done playing in the NFL.

""I think that chapter is closed,"" Tannehill said of his future. ""I think last year, that was where I was at, if the right opportunity came up and was right for our family. Staying in shape and staying ready. I had plenty of calls, but nothing ever felt like the right opportunity that I was looking for. That was last NFL season. At this point, I think that ship has sailed for me.""

Tannehill may remain steadfast in his belief. However, if the Colts can convince him to give the NFL one last shot, he could be the type of stabilizing force that gives Indianapolis a chance to stay afloat and work its way into a wild-card berth.

Tannehill has a career record of 81-70 in 151 starts and has completed 64.3% of his passes for 34,881 yards, 216 touchdowns and 115 interceptions. His experience would provide a boost to Indianapolis' otherwise green quarterback room and he would be a good fit for Shane Steichen's offense.

So, at the very least, the Colts should give Tannehill a call and see if he's willing to end his pseudo-retirement.

Hendon Hooker

If the Colts are merely looking for upside at quarterback now, they could take a look at Hooker. The Tennessee product was released from the Carolina Panthers' practice squad in early November and still hasn't landed with another NFL team.

Hooker was a third-round pick by the Lions in the 2023 NFL Draft after he completed 69.6% of his passes for 3,135 yards, 27 touchdowns and two interceptions while rushing for 430 yards and five touchdowns during his senior season. The 27-year-old has yet to carve out success at the NFL level, but perhaps Steichen will see some upside in a quarterback who has previously been lauded for his accuracy and mobility.

Hooker has attempted just nine career NFL passes, completing six of them for 62 yards.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/08/USAT/87670419007-ryan-tannehill-titans-120825.jpg?crop=5728,3225,x0,y22&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-09 13:02:02.148111

Here’s what stood out from Week 14 across the NFL: End of an era in Kansas City?
The drive that could’ve saved the Chiefs’ season ended with an interception because Kelce couldn’t hold onto the ball.","In all likelihood, this season’s AFC playoff field is going to look nothing like it has in years. No Kansas City Chiefs. No Cincinnati Bengals. And quite possibly, no Baltimore Ravens.

The Chiefs’ run of nine straight AFC West titles? Finished. Their streak of seven straight conference championship games? All but over. That’s Kansas City’s new reality following Sunday night’s 20-10 loss to the Houston Texans. The Chiefs, winners of three straight AFC titles, will almost assuredly be watching the postseason from home for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era. Meanwhile, driven by the league’s nastiest defense, the Texans (8-5) are winners of five straight and currently in the AFC playoff field for the first time all year.

The Chiefs are not alone among expected AFC contenders. The Bengals are finished after allowing a 10-point second-half lead to slip away in the Buffalo snow. The game turned on back-to-back Joe Burrow interceptions in the fourth quarter, and Josh Allen accounted for two of his four touchdowns in the final 7:41 to push the Bills to a 39-34 comeback win. Buffalo is now 9-4, Cincinnati 4-9.

And after clawing their way back to the front of the AFC North race, the Ravens have dropped two straight division games and fallen out of the current playoff seedings.

The door has opened, it seems, and the conference’s new blood — the New England Patriots, Denver Broncos and Jacksonville Jaguars — look primed to make January interesting.

One team that appeared ready to join that group throughout the first half of the season might have seen its playoff window close in the cruelest of ways Sunday. In Jacksonville, the Indianapolis Colts lost more than a divisional showdown. They also lost their starting quarterback, Daniel Jones, to what they fear is a torn Achilles. The 36-19 defeat was Indy’s fourth in five games, and the Colts are now in third place in the AFC South with a brutal schedule the rest of the way and sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard as their quarterback.

The Jaguars, meanwhile, have won four straight and are sitting alone atop the AFC South at 9-4. With so much of the Coach of the Year chatter focused on Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson — deservedly so — the job Liam Coen has done in Jacksonville has been easy to overlook. It’s time to pay attention. He’s remade that franchise in a matter of months.

While Vrabel’s 11-2 Patriots were on a bye, the Broncos slid past them as the AFC’s top seed. Denver has won 10 straight after beating the Las Vegas Raiders 24-17 and owns a common opponent tiebreaker over New England.

In the NFC, the Los Angeles Rams moved back into the top spot after routing the Arizona Cardinals 45-17, while the No. 1 seed entering Sunday, the Chicago Bears, fell all the way to the No. 7 seed after a 28-21 loss to the Green Bay Packers. It was the Bears’ first loss since Halloween. The Packers, meanwhile, have rebounded nicely from that two-game skid in early November. Matt LaFleur’s team has won four straight and is back in front in the NFC North.

Both the Rams and Seahawks are 10-3, but L.A. owns the tiebreaker by virtue of a head-to-head meeting in Week 11. Seattle has been lights-out ever since. Over the past two games, the Seahawks’ defense has forced eight turnovers and allowed a combined nine points. This unit is downright scary and dominated again in an easy 37-9 win over the reeling Atlanta Falcons.

That 2-point loss to the Rams in Week 11 — the game in which Sam Darnold tossed four interceptions, almost half his season total — is the only defeat for Seattle dating to Oct. 5. Mike Macdonald, now the first coach in franchise history to win 10 or more games each of his first two seasons, has his team playing like a Super Bowl contender.

In rainy Tampa, the NFC South race tightened up. The New Orleans Saints stunned the Buccaneers 24-20, a result that had to have the Carolina Panthers smiling during their bye week. The Bucs and Panthers are both 7-6 with four games left and will meet in Weeks 16 and 18, likely with the division title on the line.

A week ago, Steelers fans were chanting “Fire Tomlin” during Pittsburgh’s listless loss to the Bills. On Sunday, Mike Tomlin’s team — and his 42-year-old quarterback — responded with their best offensive game of the year: Aaron Rodgers’ 284 passing yards were a season best, and the Steelers handed the Ravens a 27-22 loss. After all the noise in Pittsburgh all week, plenty of it centered on Tomlin’s status as his team again stumbled late in the season, what did Sunday’s result mean?

“It means maybe you guys will shut the hell up for a week,” Rodgers told reporters. The victory moves the Steelers to 7-6 and back atop the division with four to play. They’ll see the Ravens (6-7) again in Week 18.

In Cleveland, the Tennessee Titans won for just the second time all season, beating the Browns 31-29. Shedeur Sanders threw for three touchdowns and ran for another in the loss but wasn’t on the field for the Browns’ 2-point attempt that could have tied it late. More significant was the impact of Tennessee’s second win on the top of the draft board. Thanks to a strength-of-schedule tiebreaker, it’s now the New York Giants who own the No. 1 pick. If that holds, it would be the franchise’s first No. 1 selection since 1965.

In Minnesota, J.J. McCarthy put together the best game of his young career in a 31-0 blanking of the Washington Commanders. McCarthy threw for three touchdowns in the Vikings’ first win in over a month. The Commanders, meanwhile, got quarterback Jayden Daniels back, but he was a rusty 9-for-20 for 78 yards and an interception before leaving with an elbow injury (coach Dan Quinn said Daniels could have returned). A year after a stirring run to the NFC Championship Game, the Commanders are 3-10. Minnesota is 5-8.

In East Rutherford, N.J., the Miami Dolphins won their fourth straight by running all over the Jets, 34-10. “It’s BS,” Jets coach Aaron Glenn said of Miami’s 239 rushing yards. “Way too many.” While the Dolphins have rallied admirably under embattled coach Mike McDaniel in the second half of the season, winning five of their last six after a 1-6 start, Glenn’s Jets have clinched another January at home. The franchise’s 15-year playoff drought is the longest in North American major sports.

Here’s what stood out from Week 14 across the NFL:

End of an era in Kansas City?

Travis Kelce, the 36-year-old future Hall of Famer, stumbled off the field in a daze, saying nothing. Two plays. Two drops. The drive that could’ve saved the Chiefs’ season ended with an interception because Kelce couldn’t hold onto the ball.

That’s how it ended Sunday night at Arrowhead. This was a slugfest, an ugly defensive battle, a 10-0 Texans lead at halftime that was knotted up by the start of the fourth quarter. Then came a pair of pivotal calls from Andy Reid, who elected to go for it on fourth down on his half of the field twice in the final period. Both times, his offense failed to convert.

Then — trailing by seven with 3:44 left and his team’s playoff hopes possibly hanging in the balance — Mahomes had one final shot. The drive lasted two plays. Kelce dropped one, then another, the second of which turned into an interception for Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair. Houston tacked on a field goal to put the game out of reach.

Will the final days of Kelce’s career unfold over the coming month? He weighed retirement after last season, and as disappointing as this one has been, it’s not all that difficult to imagine him walking away.

Either way, the Chiefs will have to regroup for 2026 and find more answers on offense, with or without one of their longtime stalwarts. It wasn’t just Kelce on Sunday. The Chiefs dropped six Mahomes passes, the most in any game he’s ever played. On third and fourth downs, Kansas City finished 3-for-10.

The Chiefs built their dynasty by executing in key moments. All season long, they’ve found ways to screw them up.

The Texans, meanwhile, have only allowed two opponents this season to score more than 20 points, and none since early November. With the game on the line Sunday night — in the same stadium Houston’s season ended last January in the divisional round — DeMeco Ryans’ unit shut the door, over and over and over. Some of it was KC’s mistakes. Plenty more was the Texans’ pressure on Mahomes and sticky coverage in the back end. That’s what a championship defense looks like.

If Houston keeps this up, it could be a problem in the AFC playoffs. No one will want to see that defense.

LaFleur, Packers take Round 1

It was an odd jab, but one to file away. The day he was introduced as the Bears’ new coach in January, Ben Johnson lauded praise on his former boss in Detroit, Dan Campbell, as well as Minnesota’s Kevin O’Connell. Then he threw this in about the NFC North’s other head man: “I kind of enjoyed beating Matt LaFleur twice a year.”

Johnson was referring to his time with the Lions. His first test with his new team arrived Sunday. And by the end of this one, the Packers’ faithful at Lambeau Field were chanting a familiar refrain: “The Bears still suck.” The tally? LaFleur 1, Johnson 0. The handshake between the two head coaches was noticeably icy.

“We’ll see them again in two weeks,” LaFleur said later, downplaying any personal satisfaction after beating Johnson. “It’s Packers-Bears.”

The engine behind this one was a Packers offense that has come to life in recent weeks. Jordan Love threw three touchdowns, including two to Christian Watson, and running back Josh Jacobs scored the go-ahead TD in the fourth quarter.

Caleb Williams had a shot to tie it late, but he underthrew a fourth-and-1 pass from the Packers’ 14-yard line that was intercepted by Keisean Nixon. Since that ugly 7-point outing against the Eagles a month ago — which now feels like the low point of the Packers’ season — Green Bay has responded with games of 27, 23, 31 and 28 points. This offense is finding itself just in time for a playoff run.

The win moves the Packers to the top of the NFC North, a division they haven’t won since 2021. After stumbling to a 1-5 mark in division games last season, the Packers have started 4-0 this year. Meanwhile, the Bears’ five-game win streak is history, and they are now 1-12 in their last 13 against the Packers.

Are the Colts finished?

This was a worst-case scenario unfolding in real time, a playoff contender watching its postseason chances fade to black in one brutal sequence. There was no hit from the Jaguars’ defense, just Daniel Jones crumbling to the grass in Jacksonville after a first-half completion, grabbing his lower right leg in agony. A moment later, while the Colts’ training staff surrounded him, the quarterback unstrapped his helmet and twice slammed it on the field. It was about as much emotion as Jones has shown all season.

The 36-19 defeat, the Colts’ 12th straight road loss to the Jaguars, feels less consequential than what Jones’ injury will mean for the franchise moving forward. Simply put: This muddies everything. It has been a stunning turn of events for a team that had the best record in the league just five weeks ago.

Back in late October, Indianapolis was 7-1 and steamrolling opponents every week. Jonathan Taylor was running over and around every defense he saw. Jones was scripting a stunning second act. First-year coordinator Lou Anarumo was revitalizing the defense and Shane Steichen had worked his way into the Coach of the Year conversation. General manager Chris Ballard, emboldened by his team’s hot start, made an ambitious move at the trade deadline, sending two first-round picks to New York in exchange for cornerback Sauce Gardner.

The Colts were going for it. Now they are 8-5.

They’ve dropped four of their last five. And indications are that Jones tore the Achilles in his right leg, an injury that will jeopardize his availability for the start of the 2026 season. The QB was already playing through a left fibula injury, which played a significant role in the offense’s regression over the last few weeks. Now, a nightmare injury comes at one of the worst times. With a brutal stretch coming up — at Seattle, home against San Francisco and Jacksonville, at Houston — Indianapolis is staring at some long odds to make its first playoff trip since 2020.

Furthermore, Jones’ future in Indianapolis now becomes a different conversation. The trade for Gardner was a clear indication this team felt comfortable moving forward with Jones beyond this season; you don’t send away two first-round picks if you don’t believe you have your quarterback of the future already on the roster. Jones will be a free agent in the spring, and the Colts preferred locking him up before he hit the open market. How much does the injury change that? And how much pause does it give an organization that has cycled through six Week 1 starters dating to 2019?

Complicating matters is the uncertain status of Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 pick in 2023, who lost the starting job to Jones in August and has been on injured reserve for over a month after suffering an orbital fracture during a freak stretching incident in the locker room in October. Steichen has said recently that the team remains “hopeful” that Richardson can return this season, but he’s still regaining vision in his eye. It doesn’t sound like he’ll be ready anytime soon.

Richardson will be entering his fourth NFL season next year, and the Colts have publicly vowed not to trade him. If Richardson is able to return this season, it’ll be another opportunity for the young quarterback to overcome the rocky start to his career. And maybe his last opportunity in Indianapolis.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/08002751/GettyImages-2250563329-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-09 12:04:57.832167

For the Packers, it provided a cushion for their pockets in 2026 if Watson exploded — like he’s doing.
Even so, the Packers might have to revisit the negotiating table soon to secure Watson long term.","GREEN BAY, Wis. — Christian Watson couldn’t avoid thinking about what happened last time the Green Bay Packers hosted the Chicago Bears.

Eleven months ago, he crumbled around the 50-yard line without contact early in the second quarter of the regular-season finale, clutching his right knee in agony on the Lambeau Field grass as he covered his face with his left hand.

On Sunday, Watson’s reactions were quite the opposite against the Bears. He was Griddy-ing, Lambeau Leap-ing and high-fiving fans and teammates alike with a mile-wide smile. From torn ACL to explosive piece on a Super Bowl contender, Watson continues proving why, even after such a significant injury, this may be the best version of him we’ve seen.

In the Packers’ 28-21 win that catapulted them atop the NFC North at 9-3-1, Watson caught four passes for 89 yards and two touchdowns. He’s found the end zone five times in the last four games. The Packers may not have a true No. 1 receiver, but Watson looks like the closest thing to it down the home stretch.

“It means a lot to me, for sure,” Watson said postgame. “Honestly, I tried not to think about it that much, but as the game was kind of getting going, it was definitely creeping in my mind a little bit. I’m just so thankful and blessed to be able to do what I do, and I’m glad that today panned out how it did.”

Watson first played in a game this season exactly nine months and three weeks after tearing his ACL on Jan. 5. He’s a physical marvel, not only for that, but also in how he makes defenses look foolish on the field. His Moss-ing of New York Giants cornerback Korie Black for the game-winning touchdown in Week 11, his 51-yard haul over Detroit Lions cornerback Amik Robertson into the end zone on Thanksgiving and his 41-yard slant-and-score while breezing past Bears safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on Sunday are just some recent examples.

On the last play, quarterback Jordan Love called an audible at the line of scrimmage after identifying that the Bears were in man coverage. Watson cooked Gardner-Johnson on a slant from in between the hashes and numbers on the right side of the offensive formation. He caught the ball at the 34-yard line with a step or two on Gardner-Johnson and the Bears in a single-high-safety defense. The rest was history.

According to Next Gen Stats, Watson clocked at 21.6 miles per hour as he glided into the end zone to give the Packers a two-score lead midway through the third quarter. That was the 15th-fastest maximum speed of any player this season and sixth-fastest of any wide receiver, according to NGS. Head coach Matt LaFleur said he’d love to run more of those plays for Watson, but it’s hard when teams are playing cloud or quarters coverages. Watson burning his man was the second time Sunday he devoured one-on-one coverage with speed for a touchdown, the first coming against potential All-Pro safety Kevin Byard for a 23-yard score in the second quarter as the Bears sent seven at Love and Watson ran a post route from in between the hashes and numbers on the left side.

“That man’s different,” wide receiver/cornerback Bo Melton said. “Everybody know that in this locker room. He’s the gazelle, man. That man 6-4 and runs a 4.1. It’s hard to cover the man. Just to see him out there and just to see him happy and playing and him being healthy and all that, I thank God for that because he works so hard. That’s a hard worker, and at the end of the day, he’s blessed with the abilities, but he works hard for it. I love to see when he shines. Love to see when anyone shines in this locker room, but love to see Christian, for sure.”

Since returning against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 8, Watson has 452 receiving yards, which rank tied for 11th in the NFL over those seven weeks. His 18.1 yards per catch during that stretch rank fourth. His five touchdown catches rank tied for fourth. His expected points added per target rank fourth, according to TruMedia.

In other words, a guy fresh off ACL rehab has been one of the NFL’s best wide receivers over the past two months.

“We’ve all watched him during rehab and things like that throughout the offseason and training camp to be able to get back,” Love said. “I think he’s just playing at a really high level right now. We talked in the locker room after. This game meant a lot to him for that reason. For him to be able to come out healthy and obviously have two big-time touchdown catches and make some other big-time plays, I think since he’s been back, he’s just been making play after play and been playing at a really high level.”

An even higher level than before he tore his ACL?

“Definitely,” Love said. “I definitely think so.”

Before Watson even returned to practice in early October, the Packers inked him to a one-year extension the month prior. According to Over The Cap, the deal was worth $11 million with a shade over $6 million guaranteed. For Watson, it provided financial stability and peace of mind coming off a major injury in a contract year. For the Packers, it provided a cushion for their pockets in 2026 if Watson exploded — like he’s doing.

Now Watson won’t hit the open market, where he’d surely command a higher price tag for the 2026 season than he’s currently making. Even so, the Packers might have to revisit the negotiating table soon to secure Watson long term. If the past two months are any indication of what’s to come post-injury, the Packers need him in Green Bay for both now and the foreseeable future.

“He’s a dynamic player, and we’ve got to continue to find ways to get him the ball,” LaFleur said. “What happened a year ago versus the Chicago Bears and how he’s responded and how he’s worked to get himself into a spot now where you go out and you see what he can do, I’ve got a lot of love and a lot of respect for Christian Watson.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/08182011/GettyImages-2250607403-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-09 12:05:00.912742

Coming off a pretty humbling loss, even by 2-11 team standards, the Giants had an interesting bye week.","Let's face it: Not everyone loves the holiday season.

Consider the 2025 Chiefs, who saw their realistic playoff dreams fade away on a cold night at Arrowhead, the place that used to fuel other teams' nightmares.

What about the Colts? They watched their starting quarterback go down for the season in a loss to their division rivals, putting them at serious risk of becoming just the third team since 1990 to start a campaign at 7-1 and miss the playoffs.

Then there are the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles, who dropped their third straight -- with the offense committing major sins in each -- in a Monday OT heartbreaker, casting more doubt on their chances to repeat.

Of course, the holiday spirit was strong for our top three teams from last week (who remain as such this week), with all winning convincingly and building momentum for the postseason. The Packers and Bills aren't too far behind them, and they celebrated rousing victories on Sunday. And no team did more to diminish the winter blues than the Steelers, who suddenly find themselves back in the AFC North driver's seat after crashing one week prior.

Make no mistake: This playoff field is going to be utterly fascinating -- and likely quite different from what we've seen in recent years.

A week after their first loss since early October, the Rams racked up season highs in points (45) and yards from scrimmage (530) in a road beatdown of the Cardinals. Arizona played tough early but collapsed under the onslaught of Los Angeles' persistent and balanced attack. Right now, the Kyren Williams-Blake Corum backfield combo looks like a real winner. The Rams nearly ran for as many yards (249) as they threw for (281) on Sunday, and their only negative plays on offense came on a few annoying penalties. Other than that, they were dominant, rewarding my faith in them -- keeping them in the No. 1 spot -- after the Week 13 defeat at Carolina. Tough games lie ahead against the Lions and Seahawks, the latter of which likely will decide the NFC West and could seal the top seed for the Rams.

The Seahawks were surprisingly sluggish in the first half, but they cranked it up after the break, with Rashid Shaheed giving them a huge nudge via his 100-yard kickoff return. What makes these 'Hawks dangerous is that they have firepower in all three phases of the game. The special teams feature big legs and TD potential in the return games. Sam Darnold and the offense certainly can turn up the heat, as they did in the second half at Atlanta. But the defense might be the most incendiary unit on the team, holding the Falcons to three field goals and forcing three turnovers. Granted, Seattle hasn't faced the most fearsome group of quarterbacks (and will avoid Daniel Jones in this Sunday's game against Indianapolis), but Mike Macdonald's defense is close to full health and firing on all cylinders.

By sweeping the Raiders, the Broncos secured a key tiebreaker with the Patriots, earning a common-opponents edge between the two teams if they finish with the same record. That gives them pole position for the AFC's No. 1 seed, even if this thing could -- and probably will -- go down to the wire. Bo Nix led a very efficient offensive attack, with Denver scoring its first opening-drive touchdown since Week 2 and not letting up. There wasn't anything mind-blowing about Sunday's performance, but it was what was expected from a strong Denver team against a weak Las Vegas club, with the Raiders' late TD and field goal making this contest look a lot closer than it actually was. The Broncos' final four games are a real test, and don't expect any mercy when they visit Kansas City in a few weeks, even if the Chiefs are officially eliminated from postseason play by then.

Ten straight wins, followed by a bye and a shot to end the Bills' division run this Sunday in Foxborough. The Patriots are flying high in what could be a post-Chiefs playoff field, with a chance to earn a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the postseason. Beating Buffalo won't be easy, especially with Josh Allen heating up and undoubtedly champing at the bit for a second crack at that Patriots defense, which will be without Milton Williams. New England also will be shorthanded on the offensive line for a bit, and the run game has had its limitations. But Drake Maye and his receivers, with some brilliant guidance from Josh McDaniels, have made it work quite well to this point. The Pats aren't a perfect team, but they're pretty darned compelling, and they'll give anyone they face from here on out a great battle. That's guaranteed.

Jordan Love has stepped up in a major way over the past couple games, with four touchdown passes against Detroit and three more vs. Chicago, rallying on Sunday after a bad early interception. The big-play threat is back in the Packers' offense, even if it was surprising how much man coverage the Bears threw their way. Still, Christian Watson had two long touchdowns, Bo Melton added one of his own, and Jayden Reed reprised his old role (with three big first-down conversions) in his long-awaited return from injury. It also helps when Josh Jacobs is grinding out late yards, fueling the game-winning drive with some big plays. The defense looked gassed by game's end, but a third-down stuff and fourth-down pick were just what Green Bay needed. This is a tough team with Super Bowl potential, even if the Pack nearly coughed up a double-digit lead to the Bears.

Down 10 points late, with the snow really piling up, Josh Allen and an opportunistic Bills defense dominated the final eight minutes with an incredible flourish against the scrappy Bengals, keeping Buffalo's faint divisional hopes alive. The Bills will need to beat the well-rested Patriots on Sunday in Foxborough -- and do more than that -- to even harbor those thoughts, but it's possible. Yet, I think this team remains dangerous as a wild card, if that's the way it goes. With the Bengals, Ravens and Chiefs all falling off, and even the upstart Colts falling on hard times, you simply cannot count out an Allen-led group in the playoffs. I'm not ignoring Buffalo's defensive limitations, nor am I looking away from James Cook's rising fumble total. But with Allen, the Bills nearly always have a chance.

This was a humbling loss, not a demoralizing one, even if the Packers have seized temporary control of the division. The Lions aren't going away, either, and to demonstrate just how tenuous everything is at this time of year, the Bears fell from the top seed in the NFC last week to the last team in the playoff field. All for a team that was a few plays away from potentially stealing the game up in Green Bay. The rematch in two weekends remains huge and could shift the division back in the Bears' direction, but their hopes of a first-round bye might be gone now, and the wind's at Green Bay's back. Caleb Williams had his moments but couldn't finish, and the defense just gave up too many big plays, with not enough pressure and crossed wires in the secondary.

The league's most beat-up team rode into the Week 14 bye on a high, winning three straight, and you could make a strong case that having their week off earlier in the season might have helped more from a health standpoint. They're not going to get back any significant players from injury, and Kyle Juszczyk's status remains up in the air. That said, it's probably a great thing that San Francisco's stars -- especially workhorse Christian McCaffrey -- had a break. Winning out could actually give the Niners a shot at the No. 1 seed, and three of the final four are at home, with the lone road game (at Indianapolis) looking different following Daniel Jones' injury. Don't count San Francisco out, even with all the injuries.

If you were to ask me to identify Jacksonville's superpower, I'd probably stumble my way through an answer before mentioning the run defense. But once Daniel Jones was knocked out of Sunday's game, the Jaguars flexed their muscles and put the Colts away to wrest temporary control of the division. The Texans are coming, but these Jaguars are making things work in Liam Coen's first season. He might be running third in the Coach of the Year race behind Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson, but Coen's offense looked nice early against Indy before slowing down after halftime. All in all, though, this team is playing good football at the right time. Jacksonville has allowed just 13 points per game over the past four, and it's looking like the Jags could face undrafted rookie Brady Cook at QB when the Jets come to town this Sunday.

With their backs against the wall, the Lions willed their way to victory over the Cowboys and kept alive their streak of 15 straight wins following a loss. That's the kind of mental toughness Dan Campbell has instilled in his team, but that resilience is going to be put to the test with Brian Branch suffering a season-ending Achilles injury. The star safety is as much the heartbeat of Detroit's defense as Aidan Hutchinson is -- losing Branch at an already-thin position could be a massive blow to Kelvin Sheppard's unit. Adding to the degree of difficulty: three road games in the final four, with zero gimmes remaining. The Lions' only contest against a team that's not currently in the playoff field comes in a short week at Minnesota on Christmas Day. With Jahmyr Gibbs on their side, anything is possible. But no doubt, the Lions still have a ton of work to do and several obstacles in their way.

C.J. Stroud completed three passes in the second half -- three! -- but the Texans produced just enough offense to finish what the defense started. DeMeco Ryans' elite D has thrown some beauties this season, but Sunday night's effort was probably its most important performance of the season, with Houston intercepting Patrick Mahomes three times (even if the last one was a gift off the hands of Travis Kelce). Andy Reid rolled the dice twice on fourth downs, and in some ways, that was a nod to just how good the Texans are defensively. Reid felt he had to play that riskily in order to get any spark offensively. Houston also managed an injury to Nick Chubb, with Dare Ogunbowale spelling Woody Marks to score his first rushing TD since 2022 (on only his fourth carry of the season). The Texans keep finding ways to win games, and they could run their streak to seven straight, with the Cardinals and Raiders on tap in Houston.

Justin Herbert was sacked seven times and hit a whole lot more, struggling to find open receivers and protect the broken left hand he had surgery on a week before Monday’s game. But it was Herbert’s running that gave the offense the tiny boost it needed, and though the Chargers failed to score a touchdown after their opening drive, they held on for dear life for a dramatic overtime win. The defense rose up time and time again, picking off Jalen Hurts four times, including the game-sealer just outside the end zone in overtime. Cameron Dicker remains the league's most underrated kicker, making five field goals, with three coming in the final eight minutes of regulation and overtime. Just a gutsy, ugly, chaotic victory for Jim Harbaugh’s team, with style points absolutely unnecessary. The Bolts keep scraping by.

Jalen Hurts overcame a nightmarish first half to rally the Eagles and put them in position to beat the Chargers in overtime ... but then threw his fourth interception of the game on a pass forced into coverage. Hurts’ third INT clanged off A.J. Brown’s hands, but the other three -- plus his fumble after his own pick -- were on the quarterback. In the first half, the Eagles had a touchdown erased by a holding penalty, missed a field goal and generally looked listless offensively outside of Saquon Barkley. It was Barkley’s terrific, fourth-quarter TD run that put Philadelphia ahead for the first time, but the Eagles couldn’t contain Justin Herbert as a runner. Still, it’s hard to blame a defense that held the Chargers to 3.9 yards per play and didn't allow a touchdown after Los Angeles' opening drive. The Eagles consistently got good starting field position from the return teams but had eight empty drives and went 0-for-2 in the red zone. After a third straight loss, this will be another long week in Philly. If the Eagles can't get right in Sunday's home game against the lowly Raiders, the reigning champs are in serious trouble.

What a difference a week made. Mike Tomlin's future in Pittsburgh was in question, it felt like it could be it for Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers were cooked ... until they went out and beat the Ravens in Baltimore. Rodgers came out like a man on a mission. He didn’t complete a pass of 20-plus air yards in the entire month of November, but he hit on three of them against the Ravens. Granted, the offense ran out of steam in the fourth quarter, and the defense started cracking, allowing Baltimore to score on four straight drives. But the Steelers were terrific in the red zone, holding the Ravens to two field goals and turning them over on downs in that area of the field, with Alex Highsmith ’s sack deep in Pittsburgh territory ending it. The Steelers now have stolen the momentum back in the AFC North. Can they hang on to give Tomlin an eighth division title (and first since 2020)?

No way to sugarcoat it: Sunday went about as poorly as the Colts possibly could have imagined. Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles injury, Indianapolis lost in Jacksonville (again), and now the Colts are a game back in the division race. We've elevated the concern level to DEFCON 1, with Indy falling to a 32 percent chance to make the playoffs. Even if the Colts can get back DeForest Buckner and Sauce Gardner on defense, the offense is adrift without Jones, and now backup QB Riley Leonard is dealing with a leg injury of his own. Jones' Achilles tear could significantly impact the team's future plans for him, with the quarterback now set to hit free agency while rehabbing a major health setback. Just an awful turn of events that has thrown the franchise into a state of desperation. At the beginning of November, Indianapolis owned the best record in the NFL at 7-1. On Tuesday, the Colts signed 44-year-old Philip Rivers, who hasn't taken an NFL snap since January of 2021.

The Ravens’ playoff chances aren’t dead, but they absolutely coughed up a great chance by losing two straight at home to division rivals. After Baltimore was blown out by Cincinnati, it felt that the Ravens understood the assignment against a battered Steelers team, yet they fell behind by two touchdowns early and ultimately couldn’t make up enough ground. John Harbaugh's team probably needs to win out (vs. the Bengals, Patriots, Packers and Steelers) in order to get in, and that just doesn’t look likely after another disjointed, uneven performance. Watching Jaylen Warren go untouched for a long catch-and-run TD was a painful sight after all the progress the Ravens had made defensively, and Lamar Jackson -- as it’s been much of the season -- just couldn’t find a consistent rhythm.

Less than three minutes into Sunday’s game in Tampa, the Buccaneers found themselves in a hole they’d spend much of the game trying to dig themselves out of. They turned the ball over on downs a whopping five times, with Tampa Bay scoring only three points after the Saints gave the ball up in three possessions via a missed kick, an interception and their own fourth-down failure. Twice, the Bucs took the lead, only to see the Saints take it back both times. There would be no third-time charm. The Bucs remain the statistical favorites to win the NFC South, but they’ve made it harder on themselves and given the dangerous Panthers even more hope and opportunity to steal the division. Tampa Bay just hasn't looked right for a month or more.

The league's most curiously competitive team (along with the Jaguars), the Panthers floated into their Week 14 bye following the dramatic home victory over the Rams that gave them a real path to the postseason. Tampa Bay's crushing loss to New Orleans just made it a little smoother, too. Of course, the way this Carolina season has gone -- ping-ponging between wins and losses since Week 7, and having some interesting results along the way -- we're not taking anything for granted. The Saints are no gimme this Sunday; they beat the Panthers, 17-7, a month ago. But the division should be decided in Carolina's showdowns with Tampa Bay in Weeks 16 and 18. Can Bryce Young deliver? He, like the team, has been alternately hot and cold, but Young has a chance to fully secure his future in Carolina with a big finish.

The Cowboys' playoff chances are on life support after the loss at Detroit, a game in which the defense reverted to old form and the offensive line couldn't protect Dak Prescott consistently enough. CeeDee Lamb also was knocked out with a concussion, and George Pickens couldn't pick up the slack -- even if Ryan Flournoy did, in an eye-opening performance for the second-year pro. It will be interesting to see how much Flournoy is featured down the stretch and whether Pickens plays well enough to convince the Cowboys to make him a strong contract offer in the offseason. The 'Boys will still have plenty to play for down the stretch, even with the postseason dreams essentially cooked.

Kansas City isn't mathematically eliminated from the playoffs -- yet -- but Sunday felt like a funeral at Arrowhead, with the 20-10 loss to Houston officially ending the Chiefs' streak of division titles at nine. Patrick Mahomes didn't have anything close to a vintage game against a terrific Texans defense, but he also didn't drop two catchable passes with a chance to tie or win the game in the fourth quarter. First came Rashee Rice's brutal flub on fourth down, giving the ball back to the Texans. Then, after a great defensive stand, Travis Kelce's bobble ended up as a game-killing Texans interception. There couldn't have been a more cruel, painful knife twist than that ending -- a surefire sign that this offense is broken, even if we've known it for a while. We've done various pre-eulogies, maybe even retracting a few along the way, but this feels like it. A shocking end to an incredible run.

The Dolphins have won four straight games, and they’ve all come with Tua Tagovailoa failing to reach the 200-yard passing mark. They’ve undergone an identity shift in those four games, holding all four opponents to 17 points or fewer and leaning heavily on the run game. We’ll see if that can continue after De'Von Achane left the game with a rib injury (apparently, it's not too severe), although Jaylen Wright had a career game and Ollie Gordon II also chipped in with his own score. With its own playoff hopes dwindling, Miami continues its quest to play the role of spoiler down the stretch (three of its four remaining opponents harbor playoff hopes). But Mike McDaniel deserves credit for getting these Fins back on track. The fourth-year head coach appears to have cooled his seat considerably, even as the postseason remains the longest of long shots.

Granted, it happened against a Washington defense that has made all kinds of opposing quarterbacks sparkle this season, but while many weren't looking, J.J. McCarthy had his most efficient and encouraging performance of the season on Sunday. Derailed by injuries and ineffectiveness to this point in his career, McCarthy put together a good showing on which to build. He moved around efficiently, didn't throw the ball into harm's way and generally made quicker, smarter decisions. And though Justin Jefferson was quiet again, McCarthy leaned heavily on his tight ends. That and a lights-out game defensively appeared to stun the home crowd after four straight losses. Other than the dip in draft position that resulted from this win, McCarthy playing a good game can only be viewed as a positive development.

We had fully bought into the Bengals' absurd and improbable playoff dream, but it almost certainly required holding on for victory Sunday against the Bills. Up 10 with eight minutes left, Joe Burrow was picked twice (on two of the shorter, stranger INTs you'll see on back-to-back passes), and Cincinnati allowed two quick TD drives to completely flip the game. The Bengals made their own bed with a disastrous string of games while Burrow was hurt, so blaming him after Sunday's two rather unlucky plays feels like a giant stretch. For most of the game, he matched Josh Allen blow for blow. Eventually, the Bengals must figure out how to avoid an early-season meltdown, lest they might perpetually find themselves in ""There's always next year"" mode.

Sunday's depressing defeat guaranteed that the Falcons will finish with a losing record, but honestly, that has felt clinched for a few weeks now. They're also 2-4 in Atlanta, with a home date left against the Rams. There just aren't many things to get excited about now, especially with DROY candidate Jalon Walker leaving the game with a quad injury. Bijan Robinson lost a fumble in the red zone, Kirk Cousins was picked twice and the special teams melted down for a second straight game, with a blocked field goal and a 100-yard TD allowed on a kickoff return, giving Seattle the momentum it needed to get going. Rookie James Pearce Jr. stepped up and played well, which is great, but then you remember where Atlanta's traded first-rounder is likely to land -- in the top 10 -- and it's depressing all over again.

Tyler Shough hasn't been amazing, but he's played well enough for the Saints to consider him as the possible starter in 2026. Even with an interception and limited passing success in Sunday's win over Tampa, Shough dealt well with heavy pressure and made big plays with his legs on his first two career rushing TDs. The rookie has looked pretty composed in leading two Saints victories in his five starts, and the Saints might have a chance to finish with five or six total Ws. It might be foolish at this moment to simply hand Shough the starting job next year. But this feels a little different than, say, when Desmond Ridder -- another former Day 2 pick -- finished his rookie season with a solid four-game opportunity for the 2022 Falcons, winning a few games down the stretch and needing only to beat out Taylor Heinicke for the starting job in Atlanta the next season.

That’s now three contests, each roughly a month apart, where Jayden Daniels has left a game he started with injury. It’s fair to wonder if we’ll see him again in 2025, because why would we? Entering the season, he was viewed as the crown jewel of an ascending franchise that went 12-5 and reached the NFC Championship Game, and now the Commanders are suddenly in the mix for the No. 1 overall pick. Eight straight losses will have that kind of effect on a team. Throw in Zach Ertz 's torn ACL, and the suffering only has gotten worse. Dan Quinn was a Coach of the Year candidate last season, but he has had no solutions for the Commanders’ issues, which suddenly run deep and wide. This is going to be a fascinating offseason for this wayward team.

With Arizona's fifth straight loss (and 10th in 11 games) and the news that Kyler Murray won't return this season, it feels like we could be headed for another organizational shift of some note in the offseason. It's not clear who will survive and who'll be deemed expendable, but changes figure to come after a lost season. For the glass-half-full folks, yes, there have been more close losses than embarrassments this season, but we half-empty people also can't help but notice how three of the past five defeats have come via blowout, with 41 or more points allowed in each. This after the defense was provided a lot of resources last offseason. In a stacked NFC West, the Cardinals just can't compete as they're currently constructed.

Brady Cook was thrown into a tough spot in his NFL debut after Tyrod Taylor left with a groin injury, asked to pull the Jets out of a 21-0 hole without many weapons or good protection. The Jets' special teams did their part, but the other two units came up way short in the loss to Miami. Cook certainly missed a few throws against the Dolphins, including a pair of red-zone picks, but his receivers didn't do him many favors, either. Taylor isn't the Jets' future. Justin Fields probably isn't, either. And Cook has a long way to go just to prove he deserves a roster spot next summer. So, the Jets almost certainly will focus their energies on solving the long-running QB concern this team has been dealing with for, well, decades. The Jets are currently slotted to pick fifth in the 2026 NFL Draft, and there's no guarantee they can get the right one there, although it helps that a few teams above them might already have their quarterbacks rostered. Not to mention, New York has a second first-rounder to play with, thanks to the Sauce Gardner trade.

Shedeur Sanders is still only completing 52.4 percent of his passes, and his stressed-out prayer throw into traffic -- which was predictably intercepted -- is the kind of play he'll need to work out of his system as he grows into NFL quarterbacking. But Sanders has provided more high notes than lows to this point, adding a clever rushing touchdown, with two of his three TD passes being absolute beauties. He hasn't done enough to be anointed anything after this season, but it's very tough to say he hasn't earned this shot to start for the rest of the year -- and Sanders had nothing to do with the second disastrous two-point try that prevented the Browns from tying the game late. The defense's failure to hem in the Titans' run game was one of the stranger developments of the season. Then again, losing in disappointing fashion is old hat for these Browns.

Coming off a pretty humbling loss, even by 2-11 team standards, the Giants had an interesting bye week. GM Joe Schoen took some bullets during a pretty stressful press conference -- hat tip to him for taking it like a man and accepting blame. It seems for now that Schoen will return in 2026, although no final decisions have been made. On Sunday, two of the Giants' QBs did the pre-game circuit, hamming for the cameras -- and no, Jaxson Dart was not one of them. He's had a really promising rookie season and is probably the biggest feather Schoen has in his cap, even with other high-end talents on injured reserve. How the Giants play out the string against, presumably, four non-playoff teams will tell us a lot about how the subsequent offseason could look.

Someone will have to explain to me how a Titans rushing offense that ranked 32nd entering Week 14 racked up 184 yards -- tied for the most the Browns have allowed in a game this season -- against a unit that is barely allowing 100 yards on the ground per game even after Sunday. Whatever the case, the Titans put forth their best all-around effort of the season, functionally good in all three phases. Yes, Cam Ward had a pick and averaged only 4.2 yards per pass attempt; he also threw two impressive TD passes and avoided the huge mistakes. Cleveland gifted the Titans two short-field touchdowns, but Tennessee's defense showed up when it needed to most, and it was a gutsy outing for a team that has been through the ringer. Mike McCoy certainly had to enjoy that one after losing his first six games as interim coach by a combined 80 points.

I preemptively moved Las Vegas into the cellar a couple weeks ago, even though Tennessee had a worse record, and it was one of my smarter calls of the season. Not to dance on the Raiders' grave or anything, but even after a moderately respectable showing against Denver, they still looked eons away from truly competing on Sunday. Hey, at least Vegas didn't turn the ball over once for the first time since Week 3. But the run game remains anemic, putting a lot of pressure on the Raiders to figure out how to unlock Ashton Jeanty going forward. The Raiders somehow ran for 240 yards against the Bears in Week 4 but have just 232 rush yards combined in the past five games. That's ... something.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/xycz9vnyiyev3w1w7pie,N,,2025-12-09 14:04:17.748312

Despite taking some big hits and smacking his head on the ground during the game, Higgins made it through the team's fourth-quarter loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.

But a day later, Higgins is once again in the concussion protocol, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Higgins was involved in at least two plays where he appeared to slam his head on the ground while being taken down. The first came fairly early in the contest, as Higgins jumped to try and make a one-handed catch on a sideline ball. Higgins was able to tip the ball, but couldn't come up with the catch. As he fell to the ground, Higgins' head snapped back and whipped off the grass.

He entered the blue medical tent on the sideline following the hit, but was able to return to the game.

Later, however, Higgins once again smacked his head on the ground while being tackled after a catch. This time around, Higgins sat up and immediately put his hands to his head, a sign he was in pain.

Despite both hits, Higgins was allowed to keep playing. After the game, Higgins was asked about remaining in the game after both hits. He responded by saying he's ""a soldier"" who can take hits.

While Higgins didn't appear to be dealing with any side effects from the hits during that interview, that changed later in the day. Higgins later reported concussion-like symptoms, leading to the wideout once again being placed in the league's concussion protocol.

Higgins finished Week 14 with six catches for 92 yards and two touchdowns in the 39-34 loss to the Bills.

Given the proximity of both brain injuries, Higgins is likely to miss time, if not the rest of the season due to the injury. With their loss in Week 14, the Bengals now sit at 4-9. Cincinnati hasn't been eliminated from playoff contention just yet, but the team would need a lot to go right down the stretch to secure a playoff spot. With little to play for, the Bengals may opt to let Higgins rest up so he can be fully healthy entering next season.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dsMALdwO_AtPFT1LOMCvLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/7e171e90-d472-11f0-bb5f-500f16b60824,N,,2025-12-09 17:03:07.046666

Mike Tomlin, J.J. McCarthy and Shedeur Sanders were among the figures who bounced back in a big way in NFL Week 14.

Week 14 in the NFL necessitated an acceptance of some challenging conditions.

The December weather forced several teams to adapt, with snow or rain altering game plans in several different matchups. But several other tilts also tested franchises in a different fashion, as some key injuries – none more notable than Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones going down with what was later confirmed to be a torn Achilles – and surprising dynamics significantly shifted any emerging sense of order in the playoff picture.

Here are the biggest winners and losers from Sunday's Week 14 action:

NFL Week 14 winners

Mike Tomlin

Following a week where so many were eager to speculate about his future, the stoic Pittsburgh Steelers coach once again let his team do the talking with a narrative-countering 27-22 win over the Baltimore Ravens. There were plenty of familiar elements for Pittsburgh, including the pass rush delivering in a key spot when Alex Highsmith sacked Lamar Jackson as time expired. But the Steelers also broke through by actually putting together a downfield passing attack, as Aaron Rodgers looked his best in years while completing three passes of more than 20 air yards, according to Next Gen Stats. Some perspective is needed given that the offense went cold down the stretch with four three-and-outs in the fourth quarter, and Pittsburgh was outgained 420-318. But the Steelers still delivered a pointed message, which Rodgers said might mean ""maybe you guys (the media) will shut the hell up for a week."" And if his team's statement wasn't enough, Tomlin seemed to drive it home by blowing a kiss to the CBS camera right after the conclusion of the game.

Green Bay Packers

Matt LaFleur said there was no personal satisfaction in beating Ben Johnson after the Chicago Bears' first-year coach said at his introductory news conference in January that he had enjoyed defeating the Packers coach twice a year while with the Detroit Lions. Still, LaFleur's maneuver in the postgame handshake resembled Micah Parsons dispatching an overmatched offensive lineman with a swim move. The Packers put the overachieving Bears in their place with a 28-21 win that handed back the NFC North lead and affirmed Green Bay's supremacy in the cutthroat division. An offense that was with its top five receivers for the first time all season showed off its potential, with Christian Watson hauling in two touchdowns from Jordan Love. But where the two teams are most divergent are in their defenses. While Chicago's group is adept at generating turnovers, Green Bay truly throws opponents off their rhythm, which the unit again managed to do against Caleb Williams. The Bears will have a chance for a response at home in two weeks, but it might be another year before Johnson and Co. can truly measure up.

Buffalo Bills' late flurries

This is not a reference to the snow that covered the field throughout the close call against the Cincinnati Bengals. Rather, it was the rapid accumulation of fourth-quarter points – 21 in under five minutes – that changed the forecast for Buffalo in a 39-34 win. Games in these conditions can produce some outlier outcomes, so it's wise not to try to make too much of the outcome. But the Bills pounced on two uncharacteristic interceptions thrown by Joe Burrow in an otherwise outstanding performance by the quarterback, and Josh Allen again carried the offense in the unit's time of need. There's no telling what version of Buffalo will show up on a drive-by-drive basis, but this is likely the most dangerous of the AFC wild-card contenders.

Shedeur Sanders

It's unlikely that the cellar-dweller tilt between the Cleveland Browns and Tennessee Titans will have many more ramifications beyond shaping the top of the 2026 NFL Draft order. But despite his day coming to a confounding end when he was sidelined for the Browns' game-deciding botched two-point conversion, Sanders made meaningful strides in his third start. There were still several setbacks, including a costly third-quarter interception. And his proclivity for holding onto the ball remains untenable, with his 3.57-second average time to throw representing the second-highest mark for any quarterback this season, according to Next Gen Stats. But for whatever pressure he invites and exacerbates, Sanders also gives the offense and its small collection of promising pieces the chance to grow. With Cleveland squandering the brilliance of Myles Garrett and the defensive end's pursuit of NFL history, the Browns can at least see this season out while putting up the sort of fight they couldn't muster in the fall.

Tyler Shough

When the New Orleans Saints handed their offense to Shough for the rest of the season after a 1-7 start, they at least gave their fans a reason to stay invested in a campaign of stalled growth. The second-round rookie quarterback is rewarding the organization with enough sparks to start a conversation about whether he can hold down the role for at least another year. Shough reeled off two impressive touchdown runs – the first coming on a 34-yard designed run, the latter an even more impressive 13-yard scramble – to power a 24-20 upset of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Neither play was the sort of outcome the Saints should expect the 6-5, 219-pounder to be able to replicate, but both were vital on a rain-soaked day in which New Orleans was again without running back Alvin Kamara. Consistency is still difficult to come by, but if Shough continues along this trajectory, he will be hard to shunt aside for a first-round rookie passer.

J.J. McCarthy

One isolated performance against an undermanned Washington Commanders defense won't single-handedly shift the season-long narrative surrounding the struggling quarterback, but McCarthy and the Minnesota Vikings need to cling to any signs of progress given how infrequently they've popped up. The second-year signal-caller finally exhibited some composure in a 31-0 rout, throwing for a season-high three touchdowns and averaging just 2.56 seconds to throw, his quickest mark of the year, according to Next Gen Stats. Not plagued by the protection problems that have become more pervasive as the season has dragged on, Minnesota was able to incorporate its tight ends more into the passing attack rather than forcing them to block or chip. The result had all three of McCarthy's scoring strikes going to players at the position - two to Josh Oliver and another to T.J. Hockenson - on a day when the rushing attack led the way with 162 yards on 34 carries. The Vikings can't expect things to remain this easy for the young passer, but the next two games against the Cowboys and Giants will provide opportunities to rebuild some confidence and establish a path forward before the degree of difficulty ramps up considerably in the final two weeks with tilts against the Lions and Packers.

NFL Week 14 losers

Kansas City Chiefs

If the Chiefs end up missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 - three years before Patrick Mahomes was drafted and just the second season under Andy Reid's watch - Sunday night's 20-10 loss to the Houston Texans will serve as a fitting encapsulation of all the ways in which this year's team came up short.

The Texans' top-ranked defense doesn't depend on deception or inordinate blitzing. It's all the more galling, then, for opponents to be subdued by a group that simply comes out and denies almost everything, overwhelming offensive lines with its front four while its secondary locks down things on the back end.

In as close as a Week 14 game can be to a must-win affair, Kansas City wasn't outfoxed. It was simply overmatched.

The Chiefs once again left Mahomes to try to sling them to victory despite entering the game without three starting offensive linemen and later losing another. Yet time and again, the quarterback's supporting cast failed to rise to the moment. The most devastating drop came late in the fourth quarter, when Travis Kelce bobbled a pass that would then be intercepted by Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair, extinguishing any shot at a late rally.

Despite his best efforts, Mahomes finished with the worst completion rate (42.4%) and passer rating (19.8) of his career, while his three interceptions also tied a personal low.

Any optimism surrounding Kansas City this season has largely stemmed from the notion that it was only a matter of time before this core flipped a switch and reached its previous heights. But the end of the Chiefs' nine-year reign atop the AFC West – cemented Sunday with the loss – indicates that this new and undesirable era has really arrived.

There's still a path to the postseason, but things are stacking up extremely unfavorably for Kansas City, which can't count on tiebreakers against the Texans, Bills and Jaguars, who all are ahead of them in the AFC pecking order. Whenever the season ends, it might be time for the franchise's most serious overhaul since the Super Bowl 55 beatdown by the Buccaneers.

A run game that lacks any kind of explosiveness should be completely reconfigured so as to recalibrate an attack that too often pushed everything on Mahomes' plate. The largely dormant pass rush ranks among the most pressing problems, with the group unable to get home against C.J. Stroud even when it was able to generate pressure. And the longstanding issues in the receiving corps seem as pervasive as ever.

Daniel Jones and the Indianapolis Colts

""It's not looking good,"" Colts coach Shane Steichen said of Jones' Achilles injury that knocked the quarterback out of Sunday's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. And while Steichen was speaking strictly about his starting signal-caller's medical outlook, his words are also applicable to the football prognosis for both Jones and the Colts, both in the short and long term.

With Steichen confirming Monday that Jones suffered a torn Achilles that will end the signl-caller's season, Indianapolis has a crisis on its hands for the last four weeks of the regular season. Having lost four of their last five games, the Colts now face the prospect of trying to seize a wild-card berth – the AFC South crown all but out of reach – with a sixth-round rookie quarterback in Riley Leonard at the helm. And the schedule brings a final slate of games likely to render Indianapolis the underdog in each contest.

The Colts offense was already coming down from its early-season peak after the unit led the league in scoring en route to a 7-1 mark. But reproducing that efficiency seems even more outlandish with defenses now able to load up even more against Jonathan Taylor in an effort to force Leonard to be a consistent downfield thrower.

The upcoming offseason, however, is where things truly get complicated for Jones and the Colts. The quarterback figured to score a massive payday once his deal expired after this season, with Indianapolis having a strong incentive to bring him back. A torn Achilles, however, would likely leave Jones uncertain for at least the start of next season in even the most optimistic of recovery timelines.

Would Indianapolis still be willing to pay a sizable sum – or use the franchise tag – given the uncertainty? There aren't many good alternatives for the Colts after they dealt away their first-round draft picks for the next two years in a clear commitment to building around this offense and Jones. But Indianapolis was forging ahead at a time when it looked as though it could capitalize on a wide-open AFC field. Now, if the Colts fall in all of their remaining contests, they'll end up at 8-9 – the exact same mark they held last year before late owner Jim Irsay gave Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard a one-year reprieve. And if defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo lands a head-coaching gig elsewhere, Indianapolis will almost be back at square one as it commits to recreating magic that dissipated long ago.

Baltimore Ravens

Did everyone panic about the wrong AFC North team? The Ravens' Thanksgiving stumble was largely overlooked once the Steelers seized the spotlight with their struggles days later, but Baltimore has raised serious concerns as it fell behind Pittsburgh in the divisional pecking order. Yes, Isaiah Likely's overturned touchdown loomed large in a close game that featured close calls that didn't go the Ravens' way. But there's no need to indulge in conspiracy theories or hypotheticals when the offense simply started slow and went just 2-for-6 in the red zone, settling for three field goals and coming up short on a turnover on downs on the others. Meanwhile, the defense regressed to its decrepit earlier form, with a particularly debilitating coverage breakdown coming on an easy Jaylen Warren screen for a touchdown, among other miscues. Baltimore still might have a chance to reclaim the division so long as Pittsburgh doesn't wrap things up before the Week 18 rematch. At this rate, however, the Ravens simply don't look suited for the postseason.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The Buccaneers should be thankful that there's no NFL Playoff Selection Committee. Any such entity would probably try to omit this group from the postseason, regardless of their finish within the division. With Sunday's setback against New Orleans, Tampa Bay has now lost five of its last seven games and dropped into a tie atop the NFC South with the Carolina Panthers at 7-6. Any sloppiness can't merely be chalked up to the soggy conditions, as Baker Mayfield again was out of sorts. The Bucs had a distinct scheduling advantage in the final five weeks, but the loss essentially rendered that moot given the looming matchups with Carolina in Weeks 16 and 18. A fifth consecutive division crown is hardly a given.

Washington Commanders

Being eliminated from playoff contention wasn't a massive letdown in and of itself, as Washington was already starting down a lost season long before Sunday. But the fashion in which the Commanders suffered their shutout loss since 2019 was a sobering reminder of how far the organization has tumbled in a short time. In a meeting of NFC powers from last season that had both come undone in 2025, it was the Commanders who were unable to find any sort of toehold as they dropped their eighth consecutive game. Jayden Daniels' return from a dislocated elbow figured to invigorate the offense, but Washington had no answers for Brian Flores' defense, which surrendered just 206 total yards. Daniels exited the game in the third quarter after aggravating his elbow injury, though coach Dan Quinn said the second-year quarterback could have returned.

With starter Daniel Jones out for the season because of a torn right Achilles and backup Riley Leonard dealing with a knee injury, the Colts could, shockingly, turn to retired NFL great Philip Rivers as an emergency solution.

Indianapolis brought in Rivers, who last played in the NFL in 2020 with the Colts, for a workout Monday night, a source told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler on Tuesday. Rivers threw the ball well, the source told Fowler, but the Colts haven't yet decided to sign him, and Rivers has yet to determine whether he would play, a source said.

Rivers is currently a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2026. Per the Hall of Fame, if Rivers signs to the Colts' practice squad that would have no effect on his eligibility. However, if he signs to the Colts' active roster his eligibility clock would reset, whether or not he takes a snap in a game, and he wouldn't be eligible again until 2031.

Though it's unclear if Rivers, who turned 44 on Monday, is in football shape after his long layoff, he would have intimate knowledge of the Colts' offensive scheme, and his working relationship with coach Shane Steichen would be seamless. They worked closely during Steichen's days as the Los Angeles Chargers' offensive coordinator before Rivers' one season with the Colts.

The Colts believe Rivers' familiarity could give them a realistic chance to stay competitive.

He was impressive in his final season with the Colts in 2020. Indianapolis finished 11-5 with Rivers under center, making the playoffs as an AFC wild card. The Colts lost to the Buffalo Bills in a first-round game and, several weeks later, Rivers retired. No Colts team since that 2020 squad has averaged more than the 253.3 passing yards produced by Rivers.

Indianapolis won four of its last five games that season to clinch a playoff spot. And Rivers delivered throughout the season, completing 68% of his pass attempts and throwing 24 touchdown passes.

The Colts' possible signing of Rivers indicates the desperation of their desperate. Jones had been enjoying a career year in his first season in Indianapolis, but he had struggled amid a left fibula stress fracture in recent games. On Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Jones tore his right Achilles in a noncontact injury.

Leonard finished the game and was expected to fill in the rest of the season. But Steichen said Leonard, a sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame, reported an unspecified knee issue to the team's medical staff Monday morning. A source later told ESPN's Schefter that Leonard had a strained knee ligament and was considered week-to-week. The Colts said it was unclear whether Leonard would be available for Sunday's road game against the Seattle Seahawks.

With former first-round pick Anthony Richardson Sr. also on injured reserve, the Colts have only journeyman quarterback Brett Rypien on their practice squad.

The Colts (8-5) are sitting just outside the AFC playoff field, losing a tiebreaker for the final spot with the Houston Texans. Indianapolis has four games remaining in the regular season, against the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars and Texans.

Rivers has not played in the NFL since the 2020 season with the Colts.

He has a close relationship with Colts head coach Shane Steichen from their time with the Chargers.

Faced with a dire situation at quarterback, the Indianapolis Colts aare reportedly thinking about turning to Uncle Phil.

Indianapolis brought in Philip Rivers for a workout, a league source confirmed to IndyStar on Monday night, in the wake of a season-ending injury to starting quarterback Daniel Jones and a knee injury to backup Riley Leonard, the rookie who took over for Jones on Sunday in Jacksonville.

When Leonard showed up at the team facility on Monday, the sixth-round pick was dealing with an injury to his right knee, an injury the Colts were still evaluating when head coach Shane Steichen held his typical media availability on Monday.

If Leonard isn’t able to play on Sunday, Indianapolis has only one healthy quarterback in the building. Veteran quarterback Brett Rypien has been a part of the practice squad since Anthony Richardson suffered a broken orbital bone.

Steichen indicated the Colts were already exploring players to add.

“We'll see how it goes,” Steichen said about the possibility of Rypien starting in place of an injured Leonard. “I mean, right now, that'll be the guy that's on our roster. So, like I said, we're working through those situations right now.”

Enter Rivers, the legend who celebrated his 44th birthday on Monday and hasn’t played since leading the Colts to the playoffs in 2020. He signed a one-day contract in July to retire with the Chargers.

Rivers has spent the past five seasons as the head coach of St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Ala.; the Cardinals lost a state semifinal to Jackson on Thanksgiving weekend, freeing Rivers to pursue the possibility of helping out a couple of old friends.

His relationship with the Colts is obvious. Rivers is the last Indianapolis quarterback to lead the Colts to the playoffs, throwing for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 2020.

The legend left an indelible mark on the franchise. Five years later, everybody from players to general manager Chris Ballard who were in Indianapolis with Rivers still reference the legendary quarterback, affectionately calling him “Uncle Phil.”

But his relationship with Steichen runs even deeper.

Steichen spent seven of his first eight seasons as a member of the Chargers organization. From the start, he hit it off with Rivers, another football junkie who had a habit of staying up late during organized team activities in the offseason, talking football with each other deep into the night, even though Steichen was a defensive assistant at first.

“I just kind of naturally gravitated toward where Shane was,” Rivers told IndyStar in 2023. “For me, it was fun because I was talking to another quarterback mind, and for him, I think it was fun, because he was stuck with the defensive guys.”

When Steichen returned to the Chargers after a one-year stint with Cleveland, he was back on the offensive side of the ball, serving first as the team’s wide receivers coach and then four seasons as the quarterbacks coach to Rivers, going toe-to-toe with the legend in the quarterback competitions Rivers held at the end of each practice.

“I got a special kick out of it, because at the time, I would throw last, because we always went youngest to oldest,” Rivers said. “I’d be like, ‘Shane, I’m after you, get in there.’”

The two men have stayed close in the years since Rivers retired. Steichen frequently references conversations with Rivers, two head coaches talking ball together, the way they did for so many years in California.

A reunion now is unconventional. Only four quarterbacks have started in the NFL at age 44 or older: Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg.

But Rivers knows Steichen’s offense inside and out, speaks the head coach’s language and kept the flame of a potential return alive as long as possible.

Rivers has been mentioned as a potential late-season replacement for a couple of teams since retirement, most notably the San Francisco 49ers. Kyle Shanahan told reporters that Rivers was San Francisco’s Super Bowl contingency plan in 2023 during a rash of playoff injuries that decimated the 49ers quarterbacks.

If Leonard isn’t able to play against Seattle, the Colts have precious few options to start. The trade deadline has long passed, limiting their options to pick up a player like former backup and current Bengal Joe Flacco. Indianapolis could try to poach a practice-squad player like Sam Ehlinger from Denver, but Ehlinger has reportedly turned down other 53-man spots to stay with the Broncos, and teams can raise the salaries of practice-squad players to keep them around.

With few options available, Indianapolis is going to see what Rivers still has left in his right arm.

The Colts already know Rivers is a fit everywhere else.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/presto/2020/11/13/PIND/01ab1692-b35d-45a5-84a1-8f98eac568a9-47_coltstitans_RS.JPG?crop=2399,1350,x0,y0&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-09 11:08:32.144537

Walking it back

The NFL has admitted that its officials got an important call wrong during the Steelers’ 27-22 win over the Baltimore Ravens.

That’s according to Baltimore head coach John Harbaugh. He told the media Monday that the Ravens got a phone call from the league telling the club that the referees were incorrect when they penalized defensive tackle Travis Jones for unnecessary roughness on Steelers long snapper Christian Kuntz during a field goal rush in the first half.

“It was the wrong call. It should not have been called,” Harbaugh said via the team’s website, adding that the league permitted him to disclose that information.

During the broadcast, and again on WDVE on Monday, CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore had a similar assessment.

That said, Harbaugh found no such satisfaction while seeking clarification on the two plays that involved possession of a catch — an overturned touchdown by tight end Isaiah Likely, and an overturned interception of a batted pass thrown by Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers.

“It’s about as clear as mud right now,” Harbaugh said of the catch rule.

“It’s very hard to understand how they get overturned. But they did. And that’s where it stands.”

The Ravens are now 6-7, a game behind Pittsburgh for first place in the AFC North with one head-to-head contest remaining in Week 18.

Trending to play

One challenge facing the Steelers on Monday night in their next game against Miami will be containing Dolphins star running back De’Von Achane. He has 1,126 rushing yards, third-most in the NFL.

The 24-year-old Texas A&M product had 92 yards and a touchdown versus the New York Jets on Sunday.

However, Achane suffered a rib injury during the game and was limited to just seven carries. Jaylen Wright soaked up most of the rushing duties and went off for 107 yards and a touchdown on 24 attempts.

On Monday, head coach Mike McDaniel said that Achane had imaging done after the game. No fracture was detected, and the running back is “highly motivated” to play in Pittsburgh.

Miami’s rushing offense is No. 8 in the NFL at 126.5 yards per game. The Steelers have allowed 249 yards and 217 yards in back-to-back games on the ground against Buffalo and Baltimore.

Keep ’em coming

The Penguins are continuing their tough streak of opponents when the Anaheim Ducks fly into PPG Paints Arena on Tuesday night.

They lead the Pacific Division with 37 points. This game is on the heels of the Penguins beating Tampa Bay, 4-3, on Thursday. The Lightning were atop the Atlantic Division at the time and are currently in second place.

Then Dan Muse’s club went to Dallas and lost in a shootout 3-2. The Stars have 45 points, second most in the NHL. Only Central Division rival Colorado (48) has more.

The Ducks have won three of their past four games, including a 7-1 win over Chicago on Sunday. However, the one loss in that bunch of games was a 7-0 defeat against Utah.

Anaheim averages 3.59 goals per game. Only Colorado (3.97) averages more. However, the Ducks allow 3.28 goals per game. They rank 23rd in goal prevention.

The Penguins are in the top Eastern Conference wild card spot with 34 points in 27 games. They’ve gathered points in three straight contests and six of their last seven.

This is the first of five straight home games for the Pens. Montreal, San Jose, Utah and Edmonton all come to town between Tuesday night and Dec. 16.

All or nothing

Speaking of the Penguins, there are some very specific Tristan Jarry trade rumors floating around.

There have long been rumblings that the Edmonton Oilers may want to acquire the Pittsburgh goalie. But according to Elliotte Friedman on his “32 Thoughts” podcast, Penguins general manager Kyle Dubas won’t deal Jarry unless the Oilers absorb his entire cap hit of $5.375 million over the next three years.

“The Penguins have made it very clear that if they were going to do this, there was going to be no retention,” Friedman said. “That’s going to be very hard for them to do. The Oilers are capped tight. Right now, they’ve got a lot of injuries, and guys just in and out. They’re barely carrying extra players. Their roster is stuck. So they really couldn’t do a lot of stuff, even if they wanted to.”

The Oilers have 31 points. Currently, that’s good for a Western Conference wild card spot. But their goals-against-per-game average of 3.45 is 28th in the NHL.

Jarry is 9-2-1 this season with a 2.54 GAA and a save percentage of .913.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/12/9113437_web1_AP25320647847814.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 11:08:37.061290

“Without the protection of a helmet, young football players are disincentivized to lead with their head while performing tackling drills in practice.
Furthermore, recent research shows that the excessive padding that is commonplace in the NFL today may not reduce injury in the first place.
Why do NFL players wear so much padding?
Many NFL players have begun to opt out of wearing knee pads for this reason.","When evaluating injury risk in the National Football League (NFL), one might imagine that the solution to avoid greater injury lies in introducing rules that punish aggressive actions, ensuring ethical ways of playing and the use of proper equipment or protection. While all of those are true, one important way to reduce injury is not immediately evident: the reduction of padding, such as helmets, shoulder, or leg pads.

Although that concept might in fact seem somewhat backwards, the reduction of protective equipment would actually make gameplay safer, making players focus on safer techniques of tackling and, in fact, reducing injury rates, as the padding itself can and does contribute to riskier behavior from the players.

Associate Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Union College, Chad Orzel, acknowledges that although the idea might seem counterintuitive, the argument is rooted in logic.

“The armor worn by American football players gives them a false sense of invincibility, leading them to fling their bodies around in ways that make serious injuries more likely,” Orzel wrote in a Forbes article.

Football is a high-contact sport that puts players at risk for serious injuries and many developments have been made to the NFL since its inception in 1920. Football helmets were not mandated in the league until 1943, with the prior standard being leather helmets. As more discoveries are made about safety in the sport, changes must be implemented to preserve and protect those who partake in this great American pastime.

Padding in this way gives players a false sense of invincibility and, in that way, makes them more injury-prone. More padding lowers the pain factor for more risky hits.

Some high school programs opt not to use helmets in practice to teach their players better technique.

“Without the protection of a helmet, young football players are disincentivized to lead with their head while performing tackling drills in practice. Thus, they’re instead forced to use proper technique — wrapping up with their arms and leading with their shoulders — when going up against a tackling sled or performing a similar tackling drill,” Education Week contributing writer Bryan Toporek wrote in an article.

Some argue that there is a mental shift when helmets are on as well, claiming that players view the helmet as “armament” and therefore see these protections as weapons rather than “armor” or protection.

Furthermore, recent research shows that the excessive padding that is commonplace in the NFL today may not reduce injury in the first place. A study conducted by Stanford University found that, in observing football practices, the helmet in fact failed to show a significant reduction in the impact from blows.

Why do NFL players wear so much padding? A change may be necessary

The question then remains: if the helmet does not significantly reduce injury and can instead inversely increase the likelihood of injury by encouraging unsafe practices, is the padding worth it?

Padding also reduces mobility and agility, which can not only affect gameplay but also safety in terms of reaction. Many NFL players have begun to opt out of wearing knee pads for this reason. Ironically, the more gear that one assumes, the more danger they may find themselves in.

Alternatives to ensuring safety in football may be in practice, not in padding. A study conducted at the University of New Hampshire found that practicing without a helmet, as the high school team did in the earlier example, may reduce injuries on the field.

Without helmets, players would learn to tackle as rugby players do, “with proper form that spares their heads from concussions and lowers the risk of debilitating long-term health problems like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which plagues many former NFL players,” a GQ Sports article says.

A study conducted by Cornell University also posits a change to the design of the helmets that does not prioritize greater padding but smarter materials, such as liquid shock absorption helmets, to reduce impact.

Football is inherently a dangerous and aggressive sport. As such, all should be done to protect this pastime and its players.","https://www.fsunews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/08/PFSU/87665379007-football-padding-graphic.png?crop=2303,1296,x0,y288&width=2303&height=1296&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-09 13:02:13.581236

The Colts never confirmed reports Jones played with a broken fibula.","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis Colts are considering going old school with their top two quarterbacks injured.

Just hours after coach Shane Steichen confirmed Monday that Daniel Jones would miss the rest of this season with a torn right Achilles tendon and that backup Riley Leonard injured his right knee in Sunday’s loss at Jacksonville, a person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press that 44-year-old Philip Rivers is heading to Indy for a tryout Tuesday. The person requested anonymity because an official announcement had not been made.

Rivers has not taken a snap since 2020 when he played his final NFL season with the Colts. He led Indy to the playoffs that season and they’ve returned to the postseason since. Rivers announced his retirement in January 2021 and has spent the past five seasons coaching St. Michael High School in Fairhope, Alabama.

Strangely, Leonard also played high school football in Fairhope.

While it’s unclear how much time Rivers would need to learn the playbook or get in game shape, he did work with Steichen when they were both with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers. He also worked with Indiana Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti when they were both at North Carolina State.

It’s a desperate move for a team that doesn’t have many options after losing three straight games and four of their last five, their playoff hopes rapidly fading away.

Jones was injured in the first half of Sunday’s 36-19 loss in rainy Jacksonville. He crumpled to the ground, reaching toward his calf despite not being hit on the play. Jones then slammed his helmet into the ground before limping off the field and into the locker room. He returned to the sideline in the second half with a walking boot protecting his lower right leg.

Following the game, Steichen acknowledged the initial diagnosis was not good and that it could be season-ending. Less than 24 hours later, Steichen gave updates about both injuries.

“He’ll have surgery within the week,” Steichen said, referring to Jones. “Obviously, just really feel for him, just an unfortunate situation. The work he puts in, the grind, a team captain for us. One of the toughest guys I’ve ever been around. Just praying for a speedy recovery for him.”

It’s a major blow for Jones, who resuscitated his career with an incredibly strong first eight games in his first season with Indy. Jones played so well, his name entered MVP discussion as his price tag in free agency continued to climb.

Losing Jones may prove more problematic for the Colts (8-5), who visit Seattle (10-3) next weekend before closing out the season with home games against San Francisco (9-4) and Jacksonville (9-4) and a visit to Houston (8-5).

Then came the surprise news — Leonard arrived at the team complex Monday with his own injury. He replaced Jones on Sunday, going 18 of 29 for 145 yards and one interception in his most extensive action since Notre Dame lost last year’s national championship game. Steichen couldn’t say yet if Leonard would play at Seattle, but the Colts have limited options in the building.

“He came in with a knee (injury) this morning so we’re working through that right now. That’s what I’ve got right now,” Steichen said before addressing Leonard’s playing status. “Hopefully, that’s the hope. We’ll see how it goes.”

If Leonard can’t play, veteran Brett Rypien could be next in line even though he was signed to the practice squad in mid-October but is not yet on the active roster.

Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall draft pick in 2023, lost the quarterback competition to Jones in training camp and has not practiced since going on injured reserve with a fractured orbital bone in mid-October.

“He’s not ready yet,” Steichen said when asked about Richardson’s potential return.

As for Jones, he was having a career year.

He went 8-5, going 261 of 348 for 3,101 yards, 19 TDs and eight interceptions while rushing for 164 yards and five more scores.

Jones established a new career high in completion percentage, 68.0%, and fell two wins, 105 yards and five TD passes short of posting new career bests in those categories, too. He also made 13 starts, his most since starting 16 games while leading the New York Giants to the 2022 playoffs.

But he played hurt again this year. Jones used an extra pad on his injured lower left leg in his last three starts. The Colts never confirmed reports Jones played with a broken fibula.

Steichen couldn’t say whether the injured fibula had any impact on Jones’ Achilles tendon.

“I don’t know that,” Steichen said. “I think it’s just a very, very unfortunate situation.”

Rivers was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection who finished ranks the NFL’s career leaders in yards passing with 63,440, 421 touchdown passes and 12 4,000-yard seasons. He made it to the semifinal stage in his first year of eligibility for the Pro Football Hall of Fame last month.

After losing starting quarterback Daniel Jones to an Achilles injury during Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Indy brought Philip Rivers in for a workout on Monday night and ""threw the ball well,"" according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. The parties are now evaluating subsequent steps, the Colts' battered quarterback room − beyond Jones even − serving as a backdrop of the club's current state of desperation.

Rivers, who turned 44 on Monday, hasn't played since 2020 − which seemed like the last of his 17 seasons in the league and the only one he spent in Indianapolis after 16 years with the San Diego and Los Angeles Chargers. That 2020 campaign, widely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, also marks the last time the Colts reached the postseason.

Rivers, who became eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year and is currently a semifinalist, was voted to eight Pro Bowls. His 63,440 career passing yards rank seventh in league history, and his 421 touchdown passes are sixth all-time. He led the Chargers to four AFC West titles and two other playoff appearances, guiding them as far as the AFC title game in 2007, but never to a Super Bowl. Including the postseason, Rivers won 139 of his 252 professional starts, including an 11-6 mark in Indianapolis.

Originally selected fourth overall out of North Carolina State by the New York Giants in the 2004 draft, Rivers' rights were traded almost immediately to the Chargers in a draft day deal for Eli Manning, whom the Bolts chose No. 1 overall. Manning had no intention of going to San Diego, but the Chargers got Rivers and a package of picks, including a 2005 first-rounder − which would be used on Pro Bowl pass rusher Shawne Merriman − for their trouble. Rivers owns most of the franchise's significant passing records.

Colts coach Shane Steichen spent nine years as an assistant with the Bolts, including seven on the offensive side of the ball, where he served as Rivers' interim offensive coordinator in 2019.

Rookie Riley Leonard finished the loss at Jacksonville but is now nursing a knee injury. The team is hoping he'll be able to go for Week 15's game at Seattle against the Seahawks, whose 10-3 record is tied for the best in the NFC. Former Colts QB1 Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve with an orbital bone fracture. After a surprising 7-1 start to its season, thanks in large part to revitalized Jones, Indianapolis has lost four of five and fell out of the AFC's projected playoff field Sunday.

Since retiring after the 2020 season, Rivers has coached football at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama. He is the father of 10 children and has a grandchild as well.

In Sunday's game, Seahawks right guard, Anthony Bradford was Seattle's highest graded offensive lineman by Pro Football Focus.
He's doing all of those steps that it takes to end up putting good football out on the field.""
I thought Klint (Kubiak) called a great game in the second half and really set up some great plays.
But I think Sam's playing really good football for us.","1. Injury updates and Jalen Sundell's return.

The Seahawks saw rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo exit Sunday's game early due to a knee injury. Nose tackle Brandon Pili was also briefly sidelined by a knee injury but was able to return, and Macdonald said after the game that Pili was OK.

As for Arroyo, Macdonald said they're still working through the specifics of the injury, but that it is unlikely he will play this week.

""Elijah's got a knee,"" Macdonald said. ""Just working through it right now, but I'd say this week's probably in jeopardy for him.""

Macdonald also said that center Jalen Sundell should return to practice this week after missing the last four games on injured reserve due to a knee injury.

""Yeah, Jalen should be back this week, yeah,"" Macdonald said.

Macdonald has praised the play of Olu Oluwatimi in Sundell's absence, and Sundell competed at right guard in camp before settling in at center while Oluwatimi was sidelined by an injury, give the Seahawks some options with how they want to configure their line when he is back.

Asked what the plan was for Sundell when he's back, Macdonald only offered, ""We'll see.""

Macdonald was also asked about Emmanwori, who briefly left the game with an apparent hand injury that was checked out on the sideline, and who quickly returned.

""I haven't heard anything since he went back in the game, so I'm assuming that he's OK,"" Macdonald said. ""I haven't heard anything on that front.""

2. Rashid Shaheed makes the Seahawks more dangerous.

Playing in his fifth game with the Seahawks since arriving in a midseason trade, Rashid Shaheed had his breakout moment, returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown to jumpstart a big second half. Shaheed also had his best game on offense, catching four passes for 67 yards.

Getting Shaheed going and having a player with his speed to play off of Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the rest of Seattle's pass catchers should be a big help to Seattle's offense moving forward.

""That's obviously a huge part of the reason why we decided to trade for him,"" Macdonald said. ""He's another great piece to our offense. We've got a lot of great weapons, including Jax, obviously, our tight end room, our runners, the rest of our wideouts are really talented as well. To me it's like, as a football team, what's our competitive advantage? It's the synergy of the group. It's the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, it's 12 as One, however you want to say it. If you can play together and you can play off of one another all the time and accentuate your teammates' strengths and build your teammates up and help your teammates have success, that's a powerful thing. So if Sheed's going in there and he's blocking in the run game and he's carrying it in some of the receiver run game, and then he's also running the whole route tree and making plays in the pass game, that's just going to make us that more dangerous, which is really cool.""

As for Shaheed's kick return, Macdonald said the play was a great team effort combing good blocking with Shaheed's return skills.

""There were a lot of great blocks,"" Macdonald said. ""Brady (Russell) made a great block—Brady played a phenomenal game on special teams, made a great play on punt. Paddy O (Patrick O'Connell) made a great block on that play. There were a lot of great blocks—I can't single out everybody—then he made a great run as well. It was definitely a team effort. It was a really great play everybody involved.""

3. Assistant coaches had a big hand in Seattle's third-down success.

Seattle's defense has been good on third down all season, but it was particularly dominant on Sunday. The Falcons converted on just one of 13 third-down attempts—their first—and all three takeaways came on third down, with DeMarcus Lawrence forcing a fumble on a third-and-1 run, and with Emmanwori and Devon Witherspoon both intercepting third-down passes.

""I've got to give (defensive passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach) Karl Scott a lot of credit,"" Macdonald said. ""He always has great ideas every week, he does a lot of the third-down game planning for us, and he was convicted about some of the calls we had this past game, and it was great to see those things come to life. And the guys did a great job executing it. Nick's interceptions, that's a defense we don't play that often, and the guys executed it phenomenally well. It was really Karl's idea, and it was great to make it come to life. And then on the short-yardage play, that's (outside linebackers coach) Chris Partridge's area, he does a great job game planning for that, he always has a great plan every week. It gives the guys a lot of confidence, and then at the end of the day, guys have to go make plays and attack the football. We had a funny little TV copy debate on who actually got the ball out, whether it was J-Reed or D-Law on the forced fumble. It turns out DeMarcus beat him by a hair there, so, sorry J-Reed. Next time buddy.""

4. Anthony Bradford had a good game against the Falcons.

In Sunday's game, Seahawks right guard, Anthony Bradford was Seattle's highest graded offensive lineman by Pro Football Focus.

""AB graded out as our highest offensive lineman yesterday,"" Macdonald said. ""He's playing hard, he's got a great punch.""

According to Next Gen Stats, through 34 pass block snaps, Bradford didn't allow a sack and allowed just one quarterback pressure.

""I think his overall confidence is probably at a high point in his career at this point,"" Macdonald added. ""He's practicing really well, he practices hard. He's doing all of those steps that it takes to end up putting good football out on the field.""

While Macdonald said there is room for Bradford to improve in some parts of his game, he said there's, ""a lot"" Bradford is doing well.

""I know there's some plays that minuses or plays that aren't up to par, but there's a lot of great plays as well, and I thought he had a good game yesterday.""

5. When Sam Darnold is clicking, the Seahawks are ""playing really efficient football.""

After what was a quiet first half for Sam Darnold vs. the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, the second half of the game was a different story. In the first half alone, Darnold completed nine passes for 67 yards and was intercepted once. In the second half, he went 11 for 15 threw for 182 yards and three touchdowns.

""I just thought we got a little bit more in rhythm on offense and it was more successful on first down,"" Macdonald said. ""Had a couple actually get back on track, good plays, explosives. I think it's really that simple, you know. And it's a credit to Sam and our coaches of just, sticking to it, we're going to work through our game plan and make some adjustments and not get frazzled or discouraged or frustrated and just keep hammering away, and then eventually, we'll find some things that start to click. I thought Klint (Kubiak) called a great game in the second half and really set up some great plays. And I thought Sam played really well, especially late in the down. It's really accurate, but it really made some plays there when initially nothing was there, especially on that his last touchdown pass was a phenomenal play.""

Outside of Darnold's one interception, and taking two sacks, he played an otherwise clean game, but Macdonald knows the turnovers are one part of his game he needs to improve on.

Macdonald said, ""If you just look at how many times we turned the ball over, I think we'd all say it's too many. But I think Sam's playing really good football for us. There's a couple plays a game where, we got to protect the ball a bit better. But when Sam's clicking and he has been for the majority of the season, we're playing really efficient football and he's leading the charge for us. So keep plugging away, keep attacking it. Keep slinging the ball and we'll just, again, like every other position, there's always things that correct from a week-to-week basis. Find new things to screw up, we'll keep growing from it together and let's go rock and roll.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/lwqkbyxdk3i11hvnvswh,N,,2025-12-09 11:08:58.404416

The Magic announced that an MRI conducted Monday revealed that the left leg injury Franz Wagner suffered Sunday at Madison Square Garden is a high-ankle sprain — and not an injury to knee ligaments or tendons.

High-ankle sprains can take weeks or months to heal, and the Magic are not publicly putting a timeline on Wagner’s expected recovery, in accordance with team policies related to player injuries. But team officials are thankful that Wagner, a 24-year-old wing/forward who was a potential All-Star candidate, won’t be sidelined for the remainder of the season.

Wagner is one of the key two-way players in the Eastern Conference, if not the league, averaging 22.7 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game and playing active defense for one of the NBA’s best teams on that end of the court.

When Wagner landed awkwardly on his left leg following a lob attempt on Sunday afternoon, it looked worrisome enough that, at first, it would have been easy to conclude his season could be over. That would have essentially derailed Orlando’s hopes for a top-four finish in the East and raised the likelihood of a first-round playoff exit.

But X-rays taken at Madison Square Garden ruled out any fractures, a team official told The Athletic. A preliminary examination by a medical doctor on site left Magic officials hopeful that Wagner had not sustained a serious injury. Monday’s MRI revealed the high-ankle sprain.

The Magic have not revealed the severity of the high-ankle sprain, but the possibility has been raised that similar high-ankle sprains have taken two to four weeks to heal. But Orlando now has reasons for optimism. Former All-Star forward Paolo Banchero returned recently from a 10-game absence because of a groin strain. Guard Jalen Suggs has started to knock off the rust from his knee surgery late last season. Third-year guard Anthony Black has made strides. And shooting guard Desmond Bane, the team’s key offseason addition, started to look more comfortable on offense in the games before Banchero’s return. Moe Wagner, the Magic’s former sixth man who is recovering from an ACL tear from a year ago, continues to make progress in his recovery.

The Magic are in fifth place in the East at 14-10. Franz Wagner’s absence likely will hurt, perhaps enough to derail the Magic’s hopes of hosting a first-round playoff series. But the team appears to be better positioned to withstand a lengthy absence than it was a year ago, when Banchero and both Wagners missed extended stretches due to injuries.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/08151844/USATSI_27557171-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-09 11:09:13.533352

You're upset and you're hurt for your teammate, but you still understand that you have to go back out there and play.

You have to keep doing your job.

In those instances, you become more aware of your own responsibilities as well.

You have to stay precise on what you do because the backup quarterback is coming in, and you have to be ready and able to help him and support him in the best way possible so he can function well and execute the offense.

With a backup quarterback out there, you want to make it as easy as possible for him and you want to be exact in regard to what's been coached for him specifically. You need to be in the right spot at the right time and just be on the same page as the quarterback.

You have to be on your assignments, on your alignments and execution of the plays because you don't want him to have to think about anything other than his own assignment. You want to take as much off his plate as possible.

We saw that when the Colts supported Riley Leonard on Sunday when he came in after Daniel Jones sustained his season-ending Achilles injury. And we'll continue to see that kind of effort over the next four weeks, as Leonard or whoever else comes in at quarterback (Leonard is now dealing with a right knee injury, Shane Steichen said on Monday) prepares to play.

Simply put, you have to adjust what you do to what the quarterback does. He's going to have a lot on his plate; you're going to try to make it easier for him however you can. It's going to take extra practice time and extra meeting time to figure out what he likes, and how he operates. The plays that you run with one quarterback might be slightly different than the plays you run with another quarterback, because every quarterback has certain plays he excels at and certain plays he likes more than others.

You have to spend extra time with him to make sure you're on the same page, and making those adjustments and processing them isn't that hard. The difficulty comes in doing it quickly, like the Colts will have to do this week before their next game against the Seattle Seahawks.

It's being able to execute the plays and get the timing down with only a week to prepare – and only a few practices in that week – that's difficult.

And I understand that some of the fans' thoughts around the Colts' quarterback situation and the outlook for the next four weeks is that this team is probably not going to make the playoffs, based off Jones' injury and the way the team has played over the last few weeks.

As a player, though, you can't feel that way. As a player, you have to understand that you still have an opportunity to go out there and play your best every single week, and at the end of the day you hope you're on the winning side. You still have to go out there and support your teammates, play for your teammates and give it your all, because there is still a chance to reach your goals that you set at the beginning of the season.

There are still four games left in the season. Of course, the Colts need to concentrate on one game at a time, but they understand they still have a responsibility to do their best.

They understand that they owe it to the organization, their teammates and themselves to continue to go out there and play their best and take advantage of the opportunity they still have.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/bbbkfzedcnqpev6tasin,N,,2025-12-09 11:09:26.129600

The Colts aren't going to make the playoffs, Frank.

They're not, uh, and it's just that you use the term heartbreaking.

And that's what it is, not just for Daniel Jones but for the Colts as well.

To start, 7 and 1, and right now I, I don't, Look, maybe, Maybe Riley Leonard is Brock Purdy.

Uh, we don't know; we'll see, but I doubt it.

I hope he is too; it'd be awesome, but I doubt it.

Like, I, I, I assume the Colts lose out, and That just stinks.

Like it just stinks for how good they were, legitimately good.

Like that.

Nobody should be celebrating this, And there are so many ramifications here, Andrew, like, it's not just, Hey, the Colts are going to miss playoffs, then whatever.

The slate is kind of clean in 2026.

Daniel Jones is a free agent.

What do the Colts do?

Achilles injuries usually take a year to heal completely right.

Well, thats you know, he did this week 14.

Like, do you franchise him just thinking that, Well, youre gonna be there week 14?

Do you come up with a long-term deal?

For him, with some protections involved?

Because part of the reason they traded for Sauce Gardner said, we don't need those first round picks anymore.

We've got a quarterback.

We're good.

We're all in; we're fine.

Another ramification: those draft picks get better for the Jets.

Like, it's just part of the math, too.

Ramifications like the Forty-Niners face soon at the Colts in a couple of weeks.

That was, that looked like a losable game for the 49ers and other teams in the NFC wild card Race was probably like, OK, the Forty-Niners lose that game.

Nope, not anymore, probably, like, it changes the NFC playoff race.

It changes things for a team like the Jaguars, who won their game yesterday.

And they might have won anyway, who knows?

They won yesterday.

Against the Colts, they take over first place.

The path for the Texans is now clear.

What about, like, there is a reasonable, not crazy; I don't think it's going to happen, But a reasonable storyline where we're sitting here in a few weeks.

And I'm saying, remember the Daniel Jones injury?

Yeah, that knocked the Colts out, allowing the Chiefs to get the seventh seed.

Like something just like that.

There are so many butterfly effects.

So many butterfly effects involved with Daniel Jones's injury.

This absolutely alters the whole NFL season.

It really does.

And that's weird to say about a Colts team, that's not even going to make the playoffs.

“Tee Higgins was evaluated twice in game and cleared to return,” the league and the union said. “After the game, in discussion with club medical personnel as part of a postgame evaluation, he notified the team he was experiencing symptoms and was immediately placed in the concussion protocol.”

It’s standard practice for players who are checked for concussions during games to be checked again after the game ends. And, yes, concussions sometimes don’t emerge immediately.

After the game, Higgins told reporters he had no concerns about continuing to play. The protocol is nevertheless in place to protect players from their natural inclination to keep playing.

Per a source with knowledge of the situation, there will be no investigation regarding the handling of Higgins, because there is no reason to believe the protocol may have been violated.

Now 8-5 and without their starting quarterback, it's no longer a given the Colts make the postseason. Jones' replacement, the rookie Riley Leonard, isn't 100% healthy either.

According to ESPN, Leonard is dealing with a strained knee ligament that has him ""week to week."" The Colts are uncertain if he will be able to start on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks.

With Anthony Richardson still on injured reserve after fracturing his orbital bone, and Leonard nursing a banged-up knee, the only other quarterback the Colts have is Brett Rypien, who is on the practice squad. It's a reason why the Colts are bringing in 44-year-old Philip Rivers for a workout. Rivers was the last quarterback to lead the Colts to the playoffs, as he went 11-5 in his one season with Indy back in 2020.

As for Leonard, he completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards and one interception in his first extensive NFL action on Sunday, and also rushed for a touchdown. The sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame led the Fighting Irish to the College Football Playoff National Championship game last year, where they fell to the Ohio State Buckeyes.

NFL news is nonstop, and we're breaking it all down week by week this season.

Here's the latest on what's happening around the league entering Week 15:

Colts to work out Rivers with Jones, Leonard injured

On top of Daniel Jones tearing his Achilles, bringing an end to his season, the Indianapolis Colts are now also dealing with an injury to backup quarterback Riley Leonard, as coach Shane Steichen explained that he suffered a knee injury on Sunday.

In the wake of the two injuries, the Colts will look outside the organization for reinforcements, with the club set to bring in retired QB Philip Rivers for a Tuesday workout, per multiple reports. The 17-year veteran played his final NFL season with Indy in 2020, and the 44-year-old could soon find himself coming out of retirement and serving as the team's Week 15 starter if all goes well.

The 23-year-old Leonard was drafted in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft by Indianapolis, and has appeared in two games this season. While the first time was in October and saw him make just two pass attempts, on Sunday against the Jaguars, he was 18-for-29 for 145 yards with no touchdowns and an interception while filling in for Jones.

Sunday was Leonard's most extensive action since Notre Dame lost last year's national championship game. Steichen couldn’t say yet if Leonard would play at Seattle, but the Colts have limited options in the building.

""He came in with a knee (injury) this morning so we’re working through that right now. That's what I've got right now,"" Steichen said before addressing Leonard's playing status. ""Hopefully, that’s the hope. We'll see how it goes.""

If Leonard can't play, veteran Brett Rypien could be next in line even though he was signed to the practice squad in mid-October but is not yet on the active roster. Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall draft pick in 2023, lost the quarterback competition to Jones in training camp and has not practiced since going on injured reserve with a fractured orbital bone in mid-October.

Indianapolis is 8-5 after losing three games in a row, and in second place in the AFC South.

Commanders' Ertz tears ACL

Commanders head coach Dan Quinn announced on Monday that tight end Zach Ertz will miss the rest of the season, per the Athletic. Ertz seemed to have torn his ACL on Sunday against the Vikings, and an MRI on Monday confirmed the injury.

Ertz, who was upended during an incomplete pass over the middle late in the third quarter thrown by backup Marcus Mariota after Jayden Daniels was sidelined by an aggravation of his elbow injury, left the Washington locker room on crutches.

Ertz was unable to put any weight on his leg as he was helped off the field and visibly upset as he reached the sideline, before being transported inside on a cart. The 13-year veteran, a second-round draft pick by Philadelphia who won a Super Bowl with the Eagles after the 2017 season, has 50 catches for 504 yards in 2025.

In his second season with the Commanders, Ertz has the second-most receptions by a tight end (825) in the NFL since his debut in 2013, trailing only Travis Kelce (1,063 entering Sunday). He recently passed Shannon Sharpe to move into fifth place all time in tight end receptions, behind Tony Gonzalez, Jason Witten, Kelce and Antonio Gates.

Browns name Sanders starting QB for rest of season

The Browns have named rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders their starter for the rest of the season, following Sunday's strong performance in a loss against the Titans. While Cleveland was defeated 31-29, Sanders threw for a career-high 364 yards.

Through his three starts, Sanders has shown improvement. He had a breakout game on Sunday, with three touchdowns and a rushing score. He joins Cincinnati’s Joe Burrow as the only rookie quarterbacks with at least 350 passing yards, three touchdown passes and one rushing score in a game.

Stefanski is also convinced that Sanders can learn from his mistakes, such as the ill-fated interception in the third quarter where he scrambled and threw a deep pass to the middle of the field where it was picked off by Tennessee's Xavier Woods. The interception would later lead to the Titans scoring the go-ahead touchdown.

""I think he has constantly and consistently gotten better in each one of these games and how he’s approached his game,"" Stefanski said. 'He’s been working very hard, so I feel good about where his development is heading. He knows there are always going to be plays that he can be better and those types of things, but he’s very intentional about getting better each and every game he’s out there.""

Bucs welcome back two-time Super Bowl champion pass rusher

A familiar face has returned to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following the team's signing of defensive lineman Jason Pierre-Paul to the practice squad, per NFL Network. The Bucs signed Pierre-Paul, 36, after a workout, setting him up for a chance to help his former team's pass rush and playoff push with four games left in the regular season.

A 2010 first-round pick by the New York Giants, Pierre-Paul previously played for Tampa from 2018 to 2021, and was a member of the club's Super Bowl LV-winning defense in 2021. JPP has 94.5 sacks, 632 tackles and 21 forced fumbles in 180 career games, with his last action coming in 2023 when he played one game for the New Orleans Saints and two for the Miami Dolphins.

Higgins missed the Bengals' Week 13 victory against the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion, but returned on Sunday.

During the matchup in Buffalo, Higgins hit his head hard on the turf twice. He was evaluated for a head injury in both instances but returned to the game. On Monday, Bengals coach Zac Taylor revealed that Higgins was back in the protocol after reporting symptoms Sunday night and Monday morning.

""I'm just told if he's available or not,"" Taylor said. ""So I think what happened yesterday was -- obviously there's some (hits) that looked bad. Tee felt good throughout it, is what I've gained throughout the game and postgame obviously. He did this morning and last night have symptoms again. So we will put him back in the protocol.""

The joint statement won't do anything to quell concerns regarding the NFL's concussion protocol. It was clear that a player coming off a concussion took two massive shots to the head, showed discomfort/pain, and was allowed to return to action.

Higgins was a major part of the Bengals' offense on Sunday despite the big hits, as he caught six passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns. He told reporters afterward that he didn't consider sitting out after hitting his head multiple times.

""I'm a team-first guy,"" Higgins said. ""My team needed me, you know I feel like they did, so I went out there and played and tried to dog this out with my team.""

Will Justin Herbert Play in Week 14 vs. Eagles?

As of Monday morning, Herbert is expected to suit up and take the field against the Eagles on Monday Night Football.

Injury analysts have speculated that due to the surgery, Herbert will experience some offensive limitations. The sixth-year QB will undoubtedly want to protect the hand and get the ball out as quickly as possible, as well as put a heavier emphasis on the run game.

Justin Herbert Fantasy Outlook, Projections for Week 14

After suffering the injury last week, Herbert took every snap in shotgun formation for the rest of the game. This limits his offensive effectiveness, as head coach Jim Harbaugh noted that going away from their under-center plan could remove a handful of plays from the offensive playbook.

Herbert threw for his second-lowest number of the 2025 NFL season in the win against the Raiders, totaling only 151 passing yards. After suffering the injury, he only attempted 1 pass deeper than 20 yards, focusing on the short passing game, as well as a heavy dose of RB Kimani Vidal.

The Eagles are coming off a Week 13 loss to the Chicago Bears, where they allowed over 250 rushing yards. With 2025 first-round rookie Omarion Hampton set to return from a multi-month ankle injury, the Chargers could lean on him and Vidal against the Eagles to try and take the ball out of Herbert’s hands to attempt to limit any further injury.

Right tackle Braden Smith suffered a concussion at Jacksonville and also sustained a neck injury.","INDIANAPOLIS — It’s been a cute trivia question.

Who is the Indianapolis Colts’ emergency quarterback?

That would be Tyler Warren.

The rookie tight end was Mr. Everything at Penn State, including an infrequent quarterback. Warren completed 3-of-6 passes for 35 yards and one touchdown, and did some damage as a situational runner with 224 yards and six TDs on 32 attempts.

After one wretched, rainy Sunday afternoon in Jacksonville, it’s no longer a cute trivia question.

Colts coach Shane Steichen might not be in emergency mode with his quarterbacks room, but he’s darned close.

Monday, Steichen confirmed Daniel Jones tore his right Achilles in the first quarter of the 36-19 loss at Jacksonville. Surgery is scheduled “within the week.’’ Jones’ first season — arguably the best of his seven-year career — is over.

But then Steichen dropped another potential bombshell when going over a consequential day-after injury report. Rookie Riley Leonard, who replaced Jones, reported to the Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center Monday morning and complained about his right knee.

“We’re working through that right now,’’ Steichen said.

Leonard has a strained ligament in his right knee, according to ESPN and is considered week-to-week.

Do you expect Leonard to be ready for Sunday’s visit to 10-3 Seattle?

“Hopefully,’’ Steichen said. “That’s the hope.

“We’ll see how it goes.’’

Leonard made the best of a bad situation against the Jaguars. He completed 18-of-29 passes for 145 yards with one interception that came when the officials ruled a simultaneous possession involving Michael Pittman Jr. and cornerback Greg Newsome wasn’t simultaneous after all.

“I thought he did some really good things,’’ Steichen said.

But Leonard’s knee injury shouldn’t be casually dismissed. Maybe it’s something he can play through. Maybe it’ll require a few weeks of rehab.

It’s entirely possible instead of giving their sixth-round draft pick his first career start, the Colts turn to Brett Rypien. The veteran journeyman was signed to the practice squad Oct. 15, which was three days after Anthony Richardson Sr. fractured an orbital bone in a freak accident prior to the week 6 game with the Arizona Cardinals.

“I mean, (Rypien) would be the guy that’s on our roster,’’ Steichen said. “We’re working through those situations right now.’’

No offense to Warren, but the Colts want to go to Seattle with at least two legitimate quarterbacks. Regardless of Leonard’s prognosis, general manager Chris Ballard will undoubtedly sign another QB Monday or Tuesday.

Before opting for Rypien, the Colts worked out Jeff Driskel, Jaren Hall, Tanner Mordecai and Kyle Trask.

NFL Network reported the Colts will put 44-year-old Philip Rivers through a workout Tuesday. Rivers last played in 2020 when he led Indy to an 11-5 record and its last playoff berth.

Rypien, 29, has appeared in 11 games with four starts while spending time with Denver, the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals. He’s 2-2 as a starter, but his last pass in a regular-season game was delivered in his last start: week 9 of 2023 with the Rams against Green Bay.

Jones will be placed on the injured reserve list. Richardson remains on IR and hasn’t been cleared for football-related activities.

“It’s an eye. It’s very delicate,’’ Steichen said of Richardson.

Richardson won’t be on the practice field this week, and it’s possible he won’t be cleared in time for one of the last few games.

Are you keeping up?

Regardless of how the quarterback mix shakes out this week, the starter faces a daunting task.

After their NFL-best 7-1 start, the Colts have lost three straight and four of their last five. At 8-5, they’re the AFC’s No. 8 seed, which is one spot out of the postseason with four games remaining.

Seattle is the next hurdle, and the Seahawks are 10-3 and ride a defense that ranks No. 2 in fewest points allowed (17.4), No. 6 in total yards (288.2) and No. 4 in sacks (41).

“Helluva football team,’’ Steichen said.

Wait, there’s more

Jones’ season-ending Achilles and Leonard’s right knee were the attention-grabbers during Steichen’s Monday Zoom with the media.

But there were a few other injuries that carry significant ramifications.

Right tackle Braden Smith suffered a concussion at Jacksonville and also sustained a neck injury. He’s in the NFL’s concussion protocol. If Smith isn’t cleared, rookie Jalen Travis makes his first career start at Seattle.

And perhaps more disturbing, cornerback Charvarius Ward came to the facility Monday morning after experiencing concussion symptoms. He, too, is in the NFL’s concussion protocol.

It’s Ward’s third concussion this season.

“It’s always concerning when you have that many concussions,’’ Steichen said.

Ward sustained head trauma in the season-opener against Miami and missed two games. Then, he suffered a concussion on a freak on-field collision while working out for the Oct. 12 meeting with Arizona at Lucas Oil Stadium.

Ward was placed on IR, missed four games and admitted he contemplated retirement.

“Yeah, I was knocked out,’’ he said after returning for the week 12 trip to Kansas City. “I had never been knocked out. Never had a black eye and I had a black eye and everything. That was crazy.

“I was kind of doubting if I was going to play football again. It was that scary because I was thinking about my life outside of football, too.’’

Ward was one of Ballard’s major offseason acquisitions with a three-year free-agent contract worth a maximum of $60 million. The concussions have limited him to seven starts, 25 tackles, seven passes defended and one fumble recovery.

In another medical note, cornerback Chris Lammons exited the Jacksonville game with a foot injury.

Keeping track

The Colts face an uphill journey if they’re to earn their first playoff berth since 2020, and the injuries steepen the hill.

“We really can’t dwell on (injuries),’’ defensive end Kwity Paye said. “We have second and third-string and backups for a reason. Those guys have to be ready to step in once their number’s called and just hold the position as best they can and make some plays.’’

Along with players injured at Jacksonville, the Colts still are without defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck), cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) and defensive end Tyquan Lewis (ankle).",https://fox59.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/12/AP25341756818018.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-09 06:02:31.735873

As a member of the Eagles, Ertz earned Pro Bowl honors in three consecutive seasons from 2017-19.
Ertz had a late-career resurgence with the Commanders last season as he caught 66 passes for 654 yards and seven touchdowns.","Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the team announced. Ertz exited the game in the third quarter after taking an ugly hit to the leg from Vikings defensive back Jay Ward.

On the play, Ertz leapt as he tried to reel in a high throw from quarterback Marcus Mariota. As Ertz was in the air, Ward undercut him with a hit directly to his knee. The blow bent Ertz' knee backward and flipped him in midair. Trainers quickly rushed onto the field to attend to Ertz, and he had to be carted off the field.

In his Monday press conference, Commanders coach Dan Quinn said Ertz has been an ""ideal teammate"" since joining the team in 2024. He also said Ertz helped build a culture of hard work and attention to detail.

""The habits, that what stuck out to me more than anything,"" Quinn said of Ertz. ""Just doing the extra and not getting bored with the details whether it was hitting the Jugs, footwork or the technique part of it. ... Those are the type of elite habits when you're putting a program together that's like, 'That's what it looks like, and I want to point that out whenever I can.' It's been significant for us.""

The 35-year-old Ertz was the Commanders' second-leading receiver on the season with 50 catches for 504 yards and four touchdowns. With Ertz on a one-year contract, his NFL future is now in question.

A second-round pick by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2013, Ertz established himself as one of the most productive tight ends of his era. In 13 seasons, split between the Eagles, Commanders and Arizona Cardinals, Ertz totaled 825 receptions for 8,527 yards and 57 touchdowns.

As a member of the Eagles, Ertz earned Pro Bowl honors in three consecutive seasons from 2017-19. He was also a hero in Philadelphia's Super Bowl LII win over the New England Patriots with seven catches, 67 receiving yards and what proved to be the game-winning touchdown reception.

In 2020, injuries and the emergence of Dallas Goedert reduced Ertz's role within the Eagles' offense. Just six games into the 2021 season, the Eagles traded Ertz to the Arizona Cardinals, where he played for three seasons before signing with the Commanders in 2024.

With starter Daniel Jones out for the rest of the season due to a torn right Achilles, and backup Riley Leonard nursing a right knee injury that clouds his status for Sunday’s game at the Seattle Seahawks, the Colts called a literal grandpa — Philip Rivers — to potentially save their season.

The Colts are flying Rivers to Indianapolis for a workout Tuesday, with the possibility of signing the eight-time Pro Bowler, league sources confirmed to The Athletic Monday. Rivers, who is 44 and became a grandfather in recent years, has not played in the NFL since 2020, when he spent the last season of his career with the Colts.

However, with the Colts sitting at 8-5 and in the thick of another AFC playoff race, they’ve piqued Rivers’ interest enough for him to contemplate potentially coming out of retirement.

“Yeah, (general manager Chris Ballard) and his staff are working through that right now,” Colts coach Shane Steichen said Monday when asked about potentially signing another QB. “So, probably you guys will have an update, obviously Wednesday, when I talk to you guys (again), but we’re working through all that.”

If Rivers were to join the Colts’ active roster, it would present a unique scenario regarding his potential induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Rivers is one of 26 modern-era players who are semifinalists for the 2026 class. Yet, the moment he joins an active roster, his eligibility clock to possibly be enshrined would reset, and he would have to wait an additional five years.

Rivers spent the first 16 years of his career with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, where he overlapped with Steichen, who is also the Colts’ play-caller. Steichen was a Chargers defensive assistant from 2011-2012, their offensive quality control coach from 2014-2015, quarterbacks coach from 2016-2019 and their interim offensive coordinator in 2019, spending eight years with Rivers. The two remain close friends.

“He and I saw the game a lot alike,” Rivers said on the Colts team podcast in May. “And so, even now when I talk to Shane, it’s like we can paint a picture over a phone conversation about a play, and I know we’re seeing the exact same thing. But Shane has a unique ability to able to get that communicated to the quarterbacks.”

With Jones headed to injured reserve, the Colts have three other QBs on their roster: rookie sixth-round pick Leonard, 2023 No. 4 pick Anthony Richardson Sr. and NFL journeyman Brett Rypien. Richardson, who is 8-7 as a starter, would have been a viable option to replace Jones, but he suffered an orbital fracture during a pregame warmup accident in Week 6 and remains on injured reserve.

In Richardson’s absence, Leonard took over as the Colts’ QB2 and showed promise in extended playing time Sunday after Jones exited in the first quarter. The rookie finished 18 of 29 passing for 145 yards and one interception. He also had a 6-yard rushing TD in Indy’s 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Steichen said Monday that “the hope” is Leonard will make his first NFL start Sunday, but his availability is in question after sustaining a right knee injury against the Jaguars.

Rypien is the only healthy QB on the Colts’ roster. Indianapolis signed the 29-year-old after Richardson was placed on IR in October. Rypien is 2-2 as a starter and last started for the Los Angeles Rams in 2023. He’s thrown four touchdowns against nine picks in 11 games.

Rivers obviously boasts a much more accomplished resume than any current Colts QB. The 2004 No. 4 pick is 134-106 as a starter, including when he led the Colts to an 11-5 finish in 2020, which was the last year they made the playoffs. Rivers threw for 4,169 yards and 24 TDs against 11 interceptions that season with several current Colts starters like wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. — who caught his first TD pass from Rivers — left guard Quenton Nelson and running back Jonathan Taylor, among others. The 17-year pro is still respected in the locker room.

Serendipitously, Rivers was drafted less than two years after 23-year-old Leonard was born and has a close relationship with the rookie. Leonard is a Fairhope, Ala., native, and his parents live “five minutes” from Rivers, according to the Chargers’ all-time leader in passing yards and TDs. The two have trained together several times in recent years.

“The biggest thing that I learned is how intentional (Rivers) is about every little thing,” Leonard said after being drafted in April. “Like if we’re doing the warmup and we’re taking five-step drops, those five-step drops have to be pristine in order for them to be good enough for him. … The littlest details to him are the most important in the world.”

Those lessons may resume soon if Rivers and the Colts turn his workout into a new deal.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/08191358/GettyImages-1291092787.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-08 21:59:22.404724

On Monday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Morris will be out the rest of the season with a knee injury.

Morris is not Kansas City's regular starting left tackle. A third-year pro selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft, he was making his first start of the season Sunday night.

Regular starter and rookie first-round draft pick Josh Simmons was placed on injured reserve last week with a wrist injury that required surgery.

Leonard quarterbacked the final three quarters of the Colts' 36-19 loss to the Jaguars on Sunday at EverBank Stadium, completing 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards with an interception and a rushing touchdown.

With Jones out for the season, the Colts have Leonard on their 53-man roster and Brett Rypien on their practice squad (tight end Tyler Warren is the Colts' emergency quarterback). The 29-year-old Rypien was signed to the Colts' practice squad in October after quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr. was placed on injured reserve following a freak accident during pregame warmups prior to Week 6.

Steichen said Monday Richardson will not be activated from injured reserve this week.

In Sunday's loss to the Jaguars, quarterback Daniel Jones exited the game with an Achilles injury.
""They're enormous,"" Schefter said of the implications of Jones' injury.
""First of all, Daniel Jones is out for the year.
With Jones sidelined, the Colts now turn to Riley Leonard at quarterback.","ESPN's Adam Schefter provided a very honest assessment of where things now stand for the Indianapolis Colts.

In Sunday's loss to the Jaguars, quarterback Daniel Jones exited the game with an Achilles injury. He is now out for the season.

Jones, who signed a one-year deal with the Colts this past offseason, is set to be a free agent in 2026.

""They're enormous,"" Schefter said of the implications of Jones' injury. ""First of all, Daniel Jones is out for the year. He is scheduled to be a free agent after this year. His contract is up.

""So now, I would think Indianapolis is absolutely going to want him back and he would want to be back, but is Indianapolis going to give him the multi-year contract that it would have before,"" said Schefter. ""That's something that they're going to have to discuss.""

With Jones sidelined, the Colts now turn to Riley Leonard at quarterback. At 8-5 on the season, Indianapolis is currently on the outside looking in at the AFC playoff picture, and they finish the season with one of the most difficult schedules in all of football.

""The playoff implications of the Colts, with all due respect to Riley Leonard, who now takes over as the starting quarterback, they're not going to make the playoffs now with Riley Leonard. So the AFC playoff picture just got shaken up.""

On the verge of potentially missing the playoffs once again, the Colts are also set to enter an offseason with no first-round draft pick in 2026 -- or 2027 -- either.

""The Colts also traded two first-round draft picks to the Jets for Sauce Gardner because they thought Daniel Jones gave them a window to win, in which he is now out for 9 to 10 months,"" Schefter said.

""It's a brutal injury for the quarterback. It's a brutal injury for the franchise. It changes their season, and it's really unfortunate for everybody involved.""

The Colts face a lot more questions than answers at this time.","https://coltswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/08/SCLT/87669799007-usatsi-27767859.jpg?crop=3234,1819,x0,y52&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-08 21:59:33.819296

Coach Shane Steichen said Leonard, a sixth-round pick from Notre Dame, reported an unspecified knee issue to the team's medical staff Monday morning. The team, Steichen said, is ""working through that right now.""

Asked whether Leonard was expected to play on Sunday, when the Colts visit the Seattle Seahawks, Steichen said, ""That's the hope. We'll see how it goes.""

Steichen offered no details on the nature of Leonard's injury or its severity. Leonard did not indicate he had sustained an injury during his time on the field Sunday. He finished the game after entering on the final play of the first quarter, completing 18 of 29 pass attempts for 145 yards and one interception.

Leonard has served as the Colts' primary backup since former starter Anthony Richardson Sr. landed on injured reserve in October following a freak pregame incident involving stretching bands that left with him with a facial fracture. Richardson has not yet been cleared to return, but the Colts have not closed the door on that idea.

The Colts are widely expected to make at least one quarterback transaction this week, if not more, depending on Leonard's status. Leonard is the only healthy quarterback on the active roster. Indianapolis does have journeyman Brett Rypien on its practice squad, and a promotion to the active roster could be in line for him.

Meanwhile, Steichen confirmed Jones' right torn Achilles, saying he was scheduled for surgery later this week.

""Just very unfortunate,"" Steichen said. ""One of the toughest guys I've ever been around."" Jones is scheduled to hit free agency in March when his one-year contract expires. The Colts had already been plotting a plan to retain him, but the injury and its long recovery timeline could have a major impact on those plans.

Also of note, Steichen said, is that cornerback Charvarius Ward was placed in concussion protocol Monday after experiencing symptoms.

If Ward is actually diagnosed with a concussion, it would be his third of the season and would raise concerns given the severity of his last head injury. Ward was injured in an accidental collision with tight end Drew Ogletree in October during warmups before a game against the Arizona Cardinals. The impact of the hit, which blindsided Ward, caused him to lose consciousness, Ward said in a recent interview.

He added that his symptoms lingered for weeks, leaving Ward to contemplate whether he would continue playing football.

""I was getting dizzy for damn near a month,"" Ward said. He later said, ""I was kind of doubting if I was going to play football again. It was that scary.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1208%2Fr1586832_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:03:15.742727

Jones’ injury could lead to a whole undoing in Indianapolis despite their hot start.","It seemed all for Daniel Jones’ taking this NFL season.

After being cut by the Giants and a brief stint with the Vikings’ practice squad, the quarterback found his home in Indianapolis and led one of the hottest NFL teams to a big 7-1 start to the year.

It all came crashing down on Sunday when Jones collapsed on the field with a season-ending non-contact Achilles injury during the first half of the Colts’ 36-19 loss to the Jaguars.

Jones’ reaction — slamming his helmet on the ground in frustration as trainers loomed over him — said it all, about how much was at stake for the team and for his future. The timing couldn’t be worse.

“Anytime you lose a guy that puts in so much work and so much effort and is always there for his team and showing up with a fibula injury and goes out there and friggin’ plays, just so much respect for him,’’ coach Shane Steichen said after Sunday’s game. “Just so much respect.’’

Jones, who signed a one-year deal with the Colts, has been in talks to receive his second huge payday in a contract extension. Through eight games, he led one of the league’s best offenses, averaging six more points than any other team while putting out 6.5 yards per play.

The No. 6 overall pick in 2019 was seemingly the Colts’ answer to their ongoing quarterback question; however, now there are more questions than answers.

Jones is set to become a free agent following this season and can expect to be recovering from his injury for around a year. The Colts could take the risky path and sign Jones to a reduced deal, but they also could move on to try to find another solution.

It’s clear that Jones’ influence within the team is something that will be difficult to replace.

“That’s our team leader,” receiver Alec Pierce said. “That’s our team captain right there. Everything runs through him. That was brutal.”

The Colts could also continue down a downward spiral and finish with another lost season.

Before Jones’ injury, the Colts (8-5) lost three straight games, and after their AFC South first-place showdown on Sunday, the Jaguars (9-4) sit atop the division as Indianapolis inches closer to the wild-card standings.

Now, they have to put their faith in rookie Riley Leonard — also dealing with a knee injury, Steichen revealed Monday — under center as backup Anthony Richardson remains on injured reserve with an orbital fracture.

Without Jones, the spotlight will continue to grow on Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard, who were both already in question after a 8-9 season in 2024. Late owner Jim Irsay, who died in May at 65, vowed to give the duo a last chance this season.

You'll not only want to monitor the injury report here but also the standings and what coaches are saying about player usage going into matchups.

Below we'll recap some injuries from Week 14 and lookahead to the Week 15 report.

Daniel Jones, QB, Colts (Achilles): Jones entered Week 14 with a fractured fibula he was going to play through the rest of the season. Things got worse when he was helped off on Sunday vs. the Jaguars with an Achilles injury. Per multiple reports, an MRI on Monday confirmed that Jones sustained a season-ending tear of the Achilles tendon. Riley Leonard came in relief of Jones and finished the loss to Jacksonville with 145 yards and one INT.

This will have a major impact on the Colts' offense outside of Jonathan Taylor. The top back might get a slight knock if the passing game falls apart. But JT should still get heavy volume to keep his floor but defenses could key in on him, making the yards tougher to get and the touchdowns scarce. Indy also has a tough schedule in the fantasy playoffs: at Seattle, vs. San Francisco, vs. Jacksonville.

Jayden Daniels, QB, Commanders (elbow): Daniels was taken out of Week 14 against the Vikings after a big hit on a play in which he was picked off. After the game, head coach Dan Quinn told reporters Daniels could have returned but he was held out as a precaution with Washington down big. The Commanders have nothing to play for so it's confusing why they don't shut Daniels down for the season. Anyway, we'll have to monitor the practice reports this week. If it isn't Daniels, it's back to Marcus Mariota in Week 15 vs. the Giants.

CeeDee Lamb, WR, Cowboys (concussion): Lamb is doing well after sustaining a concussion on TNF vs. the Lions in Week 14. He'll likely head to protocol but has had additional time to recover after playing on Thursday. If Lamb can't get right before Sunday Night Football against Minnesota, George Pickens, Jake Ferguson and Ryan Flournoy will all benefit. Ferguson was getting elite TE1 looks while Lamb was out from Weeks 3-6. In that same span, Pickens had five touchdowns. Flournoy posted a 9-115-1 line against Detroit following Lamb's exit.

DK Metcalf, WR, Steelers (stomach): Metcalf stayed overnight at a Baltimore hospital after experiencing stomach pains following the team's win over the Ravens on Sunday. Reports are calling the move precautionary, so it doesn't appear as if Metcalf suffered anything serious. Still, we'll keep an eye on his practice status for this week. Pittsburgh faces Miami on MNF in Week 15.

Tee Higgins, WR, Bengals (concussion): Higgins returned in Week 14 from a concussion he sustained back in Week 12. He was able to put up a huge stat line vs. the Bills on Sunday with six catches for 92 yards and two scores, one a highlight reel one-handed grab. Higgins had to exit Sunday's game to get checked for a concussion, but was cleared and able to return. Now, head coach Zac Taylor told reporters Monday that Higgins is back in protocol to start Week 15. It could be tough for him to clear in time for the Bengals' matchup vs. the Ravens on Sunday afternoon.

De'Von Achane, RB, Dolphins (rib): Achane left in the second quarter vs. the Jets in Week 14 and didn't return due to a rib injury. Miami held out its top back mostly while holding a huge lead over the New York Jets. After the game, Mike McDaniel said Achane avoided a break and was available to return. Still, monitor Achane's status this week at practice and add Jaylen Wright if you're an Achane manager.

Coen's club finishes the season with games against the 3-10 Jets, 11-2 Broncos, 8-5 Colts and 2-11 Titans.","The Jacksonville Jaguars, under new coach Liam Coen, have earned attention after walloping the Indianapolis Colts for their fourth consecutive victory to retain their one-game lead in the AFC South.

Despite the impressive performance, Coen isn't expecting any flowers.

""I don't know if we'll ever really get [respect],"" he said following the 36-19 win, via ESPN. ""That's the beauty of it. It ain't coming. You know that. It's not. And that's the beauty of it. And that's totally fine.""

Daniel Jones' Achilles injury likely takes some shine off the Jags' thumping. However, it's worth noting that Jacksonville made life difficult on the starting QB before the injury, including a Devin Lloyd interception on Jones' first pass of the game. Given the Jags' history of dominating Indy at home -- 11 consecutive in Duval over the division rival -- it's not a stretch to suggest Coen's club was winning regardless. Still, Riley Leonard taking over made things a little more comfortable for the home squad.

The Jags offense came out firing, scoring 28 first-half points, the team's most since Week 15, 2017 (31 versus Houston). Trevor Lawrence tossed some pinpoint darts, going 17 of 30 for 244 yards and two touchdowns, and he didn't turn the ball over. Brian Thomas Jr. finally entered the chat after being banged up for weeks, snagging a trio of deep shots to add needed field-stretching play to an offense that lacked them for much of the season.

""We all feel like we're a really good team and probably don't get the credit we deserve,"" Lawrence said. ""Everybody talks about every other team -- and even in our own division, it's all these other teams that are going to go win the division and do all these things and nobody really cares about the Jags, which is fine.

""It's kind of just how it is and we'll use it as a chip on our shoulder and keep playing. It doesn't really matter.""

The Jaguars forced three turnovers, Josh Hines-Allen earned a sack for a safety, and they held Indy to 285 total yards.

""League-wise, I think to them, we're still the Jags,"" Hines-Allen said. ""They're just waiting for us to slip up. But for us, if we continue to trust our process, trust our grind, and we're going to continue to keep peaking and all the people that are going to say that we're not a good team, we'll see them in the Super Bowl.""

Over their four-game win streak, the Jags have blown out the Chargers (35-6), squeaked by the Cardinals (27-24) on the road, blasted the Titans (25-3) and nuked the Colts.

""At the end of the day, I feel like no one likes us except for us,"" running back Travis Etienne said. ""It just goes along with being in this organization and the way this organization has been for some time now. We're not going to get their respect. We kind of don't even care.""

Keep stacking wins, and Jacksonville will be able to prove itself in the postseason. Next Gen Stats gives the 9-4 Jaguars a 98% chance of making the playoffs, with a 61% shot at winning the division.

Dallas Cowboys score The Dallas Cowboys lost to the Detroit Lions 44-30 on Thursday Night Football.","The Dallas Cowboys still have playoff hopes, but barely after a 44-30 loss to Detroit on Dec. 4 that left them 6-6-1 pushed their season to the brink. Would a four-game sweep to get to 10-6-1 give them a chance? Maybe, but not likely.

That will be easier with CeeDee Lamb in the lineup, but he's in concussion protocol. He does seem to be getting better, though.

His running mate, George Pickens, took some heat for a perceived lack of effort in last week's game and he's responded to that. Here's what Dallas is doing.

CeeDee Lamb injury

After suffering a concussion in the third quarter of Dallas' loss to Detroit, CeeDee Lamb appears to be trending in the right direction, though he's still in concussion protocol.

On Dec. 5, Lamb took to Instagram and posted: ""Blessed is an understatement. Love ya'll.""

Coach Brian Schottenheimer added that Lamb ""had a good day"" on Friday.

George Pickens

Lamb's counterpart, receiver George Pickens, who is having a superb season, had a poor day Thursday against the Lions. He caught five of the nine passes targeted to him for 37 yards, his lowest output of the season.

Thursday Night Football analyst Richard Sherman, the former Seattle Seahawks star, said Pickens ""looked uninterested"" and ""disengaged"" and appeared to ""half-ass it"".

Pickens said that had to do with the defense he played against.

""Definitely for myself, personally, I just can't disappear,"" Pickens told reporters at his locker. ""But schematically, as a reporter or whatever his job holds — and he played ball — he's got to kind of understand the type of defense they're playing as well.""

Dak Prescott

After a two-interception night against Detroit, Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott admitted the team's playoff chances are dim, but that they were going to fight.

""I think guys are pissed off right now,"" Prescott told the team's official website. ""I don't think this is any deflated moment like, 'Oh, hands are up, we're done.' No, no, absolutely not. I think you're going to get a team that's pissed, especially as we talk about a team that's kind of changed since the bye week.""

Prescott went 31 for 47 passing for 376 yards and a touchdown. With the two interceptions, Dallas is now -8 on turnovers for the year.

""You can't win a game losing that, not in the NFL, and not against a team like that, being minus three in the turnover battle, simple as that,"" Prescott said. ""We've got to stop that. I know I've had an interception the last three games or so, then obviously two tonight, who cares whose fault it is?""

Are the Dallas Cowboys out of the playoffs?

Not mathematically, but their odds are slim. For starters, Dallas has to win out to get to 10-6-1. If the Cowboys do, that would mean they win seven of their last eight games, and that’s likely not enough. Basically, Dallas needs several teams in front of them to collapse.

The Cowboys are 6-6-1, and the non-division-leading teams in front of them are the 10-3 Los Angeles Rams/Seattle Seahawks (one of those, or the 49ers, will win the division), the 9-4 Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers, the 8-5 Detroit Lions and the 7-6 Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (one of them will win the division).

So they will need to pass one of those 9-4 teams, which implies either the Bears or 49ers would have to close 1-3 and the Lions would have to close 2-2.

So Dallas fans shouldn’t be planning for the playoffs.

Dallas Cowboys next game

The Cowboys host the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday Night Football. The 6:20 p.m. MT/7:20 p.m. CT kickoff will be televised on NBC.

The “old Chiefs” would have trusted the defense to get a stop, and for Patrick Mahomes to get another chance.

The even bigger difference between then and now, however, is that the old Chiefs would have never gone in search of “one weird trick” to begin with. It would not have been necessary. Kansas City’s problems have had a way of resolving themself since Mahomes took over as starter.

Now, they are looking too big for any one man, even Mahomes. Although 15 was hardly sterling against the Texans’ elite pass rush, he was not the issue behind his makeshift offensive line. A skill corps that dropped touchdowns, fourth downs, and desperation drive extenders? That was the issue, which is really an issue since that had previously been less of a problem this year than last. If Rashee Rice and company are going to collapse for the stretch run, “where to go from here” gets even murkier.

The destination could still end up the playoffs. The Chiefs could win out, the Colts are in irreversible collapse, and things set up poorly for the Chargers. Mahomes’ next Houdini act is never far away. But Harry’s ghost should never need to be summoned this early in the season. The Chiefs rode this era for all it is worth. Its time for new ideas in 2026, perhaps in the form of a completely reconstructed skill corps, or maybe even a play-caller outside the Reid coaching tree.

Five Week 14 Storylines

Daniel Jones finds himself back where he started. For some players there are only bitter pills. The Dimesman seemed to be outrunning his fate earlier this season. Maybe every quarterback eventually gets their “Tannehill moment,” or perhaps “Darnold moment.” Not Jones. Already playing through a broken leg, Jones now has a torn achilles’ tendon to join his torn ACL and manifold other injuries in a very lengthy history. The timing is never good in these situations, but it could scarcely be worse for Jones. Getting close to the wrong side of 30, he’s also on the wrong side of employment, heading to free agency this spring. That this all happened after his play had already begun to go downhill will have many perhaps admiring the player, but letting someone else take the rehabilitation plunge. Next thing you know, you’re the next next Tannehill, waiting for the perfect opportunity that never comes.

Daniel Jones’ injury shatters the Colts’ supporting cast. If the fallout for Jones himself is more long term, it could not be more immediate for the Colts or fantasy managers. A skill corps that had too many mouths to feed was already in the process of consolidating. Now it will merely be trying to avoid collapse. Anthony Richardson (eye) appears nowhere close to being ready, and even if he were, he’s long been a fantasy death sentence for the players around him. Rookie Riley Leonard is the next man up, and about the best thing you can say for his passing is that it clears Richardson’s historically low bar. Leonard was not allowed to throw in last year’s national championship game for Notre Dame. What do we think a team with Jonathan Taylor is going to do as it clings to its playoff hopes? Michael Pittman is now more WR4 than WR3, and Alec Pierce’s progress has been stopped in its tracks.

De’Von Achane bangs up ribs with Dolphins in must-win mode. Achane was high up on the list of players fantasy managers could not afford to get hurt in the final week of the regular season. If there’s any good news, it’s that the same is true for the Dolphins. They will move heaven and earth to have Achane out there for Sunday’s must-win game against the Steelers. The flak jacket is almost certainly being fitted now. If it’s not, we at least finally got clarity on the situation behind Achane. Jaylen Wright has escaped the doghouse and jumped Ollie Gordon II on the depth chart. Although Gordon will be worth a desperation waivers add if Achane can’t go, Wright has made it clear he should be the priority.

Michael Wilson keeps going Jerry Rice mode for fantasy managers. It’s pretty simple — if Marvin Harrison Jr. isn’t in the lineup, Michael Wilson becomes an All-Pro. That includes for narrow losses to the Jaguars, or big losses to division foes San Francisco and Los Angeles. The losing here does seem to be key. The Cardinals are always playing from behind, lack a running game, and have a quarterback who actually pulls the trigger on throws, no matter how intense the pressure is. It’s leading to old fashioned stat-padding the likes of which we haven’t really seen since Eli Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and Philip Rivers roamed the football earth. Don’t be fooled — that’s a skill. But one that actually translates when the Cardinals have a new coach and quarterback next season? Wilson still has a long way to go to prove he’s arrived.

Zach Ertz’s watch ends with torn ACL. Ertz is the kind of player who holds fantasy football together. Somehow never retired. Always out there catching passes despite the fact he’s really slowed down in recent years. Or really, recent decades. Ertz’s heyday was pre-COVID. He’s been stacking catches for love of the PPR scam game for a long time now. It’s difficult to see that continuing following the dirty low hit that ended his season in Minnesota. The game needs players like Ertz. Free catches just sitting there on the waiver wire. His loss means one fewer PPR cash machine in a game getting harder and harder for the aged.

Five More 14 Storylines

Shedeur Sanders keeps giving ‘em something to talk about. Say what you will about the young man: He knows entertainment. It was another Sunday where some of Sanders’ biggest plays were made by his pass catchers after the catch, but only some of them. It was Sanders who hit Jerry Jeudy in stride on an intermediate crosser for a 60-yard score. It was Sanders who made the Titans pay for dropping seven back into coverage late, picking them apart and nearly tying the game. These, of course, are low bars to clear, but many thought even that wouldn’t be possible for the fifth-rounder. I certainly thought it would be impossible for Sanders to take “only” six sacks through three starts. Hitting big plays more than expected and avoiding negative ones much more than expected, Sanders has earned the right to start the final four games of the season. Where it goes from there is anybody’s guess.

Steelers change up the recipe vs. reeling Ravens. “Send in the olds.” That was Aaron Rodgers’ message before the game, with the Steelers deactivating the likes of Roman Wilson and giving game–day caps to Adam Thielen and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Pointless to some — including the box score — but apparently quite meaningful to Rodgers. AR finally abandoned the short-passing ways that have defined his recent struggles and actually tried to direct the ball down the field every now and again. The result was not only a critical divisional victory over the Ravens, but his second highest YPA (8.4) of the season. He also remembered DK Metcalf existed right in time for the fantasy playoffs. Although that could easily end up a trap for WR3 desperados — we can finally play Metcalf again! — the reality is, you probably already were. Now you at least know spiked weeks remain possible. That will include against the Dolphins’ soft defense this week.

Jets’ offensive situation somehow gets more embarrassing. I hated to be this guy, but I was constantly reminding people not to get too excited about Adonai Mitchell and John Metchie’s recent production because of one long-term trend: Tyrod Taylor’s proclivity to get hurt. Taylor is the league’s best backup who simply can’t stay on the field. Sunday that manifested after only six snaps. Somehow, a groin injury knocked a quarterback out of a game. That brought UDFA Brady Cook into it, and though my fellow Mizzou alum performed slightly better than my rock bottom expectations, it was only just. If Cook is somehow forced to start Week 15, the passing volume will remain but be of the lowest possible quality. If it’s Justin Fields, no passes will be thrown. If it’s Taylor? Hold your breath until he gets hurt again.

Tyler Shough hints at possible 2026 viability. Shough has continued to surprise this season. First it was passing volume. Sunday it was his legs. Shough’s 34-yard rushing score on a read-option keeper was impressive enough. But it was his 13-yard touchdown as he evaded a sack and took a big hit at the goal line on a “true scramble” that really caught our attention. We know Shough is old. He might also actually be wise. That, of course, was why the Saints drafted him in the first place. We didn’t really see the vision. We probably still don’t. But with this franchise in the most slow motion of resets, Shough is probably doing enough to get a 2026 looksee. In theory we would like to make fun of them, but in reality, Shough is doing enough to keep the players we care about viable in fantasy.

Geno Smith keeps searching for rock bottom. “Viable in fantasy” is not what comes to mind when you watch Geno Smith’s Raiders. He should have been benched long ago. Perhaps the couple two three injuries he suffered Sunday might finally finish the job. Kenny Pickett is not going to make the Raiders good, or probably even watchable. But maybe, just maybe, he won’t get sacked every time he drops back. Maybe, just maybe he can easily direct 8-10 targets Brock Bowers’ way. Rooting to see Pickett’s insertion under center seems like a classic “final thing you see before you die,” but I would rather watch anything but this.

Questions

1. Did Michael Wilson really have to go that hard, and why is the answer yes?

2. Do the Bengals ever feel shame?

3. Has anything ever thrown a bigger wrench into the 12-seed race than Tony Pollard’s career day against the Browns?

Stats of the Week

24.3 percent of third-year pro Michael Wilson’s career production has come in the three games Marvin Harrison Jr. has missed over the past month.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s 4.01 yards per route run would be by far the highest of the “Pro Football Focus era.” No one else has even approached 4.0.

Rich Hribar on what ails the Ravens: “The Ravens have converted 49 percent (25 of 51) of third and short situations (needing 3 or fewer yards) this season (29th). The league average is 59.1 percent. The previous two seasons, they were a league-best 70.3 percent in those spots.”

And Rich on just how broken the Bucs’ offense has become: “The Buccaneers are averaging 4.4 yards per play over their past seven games, 31st in the league. Ahead of only the Raiders (4.0) over that span.”

With 8:44 left to play on a snow-covered field, the Bills were down 28-18 and looking dead, but in the next 4:30, they erupted to score three touchdowns and then held on for a remarkable and hugely important 39-34 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.

The rally started when Allen took off on a 40-yard touchdown run, the longest rushing TD by a Bills quarterback in team history. Then four plays after the kickoff, Joe Burrow tried to throw a quick pass to Ja’Marr Chase but Christian Benford leaped up and made a great interception, then raced 63 yards to the end zone to put the Bills up 32-28.

And on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Jordan Phillips tipped a pass and the ball fell into the arms of AJ Epenesa for an interception at the Bengals 29, and that set up Allen’s three-yard TD pass to Jackson Hawes on a fourth down to give the Bills a 39-28 lead.

Cincinnati did not go away as Burrow hit Tee Higgins with a 25-yard TD pass, but Burrow then fumbled on the two-point attempt, leaving the score at 39-34. But Allen put it away when he somehow was able to scramble to convert a third-and-15 with 1:54 to go and with the Bengals out of timeouts, that was it.

The Bills are now 9-4 and they head to New England next week with a chance to inch closer in the race for the AFC East, but just as important, they gained a key conference victory which greatly helps their wild-card case.

Final score: Buffalo Bills 39, Cincinnati Bengals 34

The Bills needed one first down to seal the victory with 1:54 left. Don't convert the third-and-15 and the Bengals get the ball back with a chance to win it. Josh Allen scrambled for 18 yards and Highmark Stadium went wild.

Allen was excellent, completing 22 of 28 passes for 251 yards and three touchdowns and running for 78 yards and a touchdown on nine carries.

The Bills tight ends — Dawson Knox, Dalton Kincaid and Jackson Hawes — combined for 11 receptions for 139 yards and two touchdowns.

Joe Burrow went 25 of 36 for 284 yards and four touchdowns but threw interceptions on two straight passes in the fourth quarter, including a 67-yard pick-6 by cornerback Christian Benford.

Buffalo improves to 9-4 and Cincinnati falls to 4-9.

Bengals score vs. Bills: Tee Higgins makes one-handed touchdown catch | Bills 39, Bengals 35

Cincinnati scored in 50 seconds to keep its comeback hopes alive. Joe Burrow opened with a 37-yard completion to Mike Gesicki. Three plays later, Burrow threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Tee Higgins, who made a one-handed catch in the end zone while being covered by cornerback Tre'Davious White. Cincinnati attempted a 2-point conversion but Burrow lost the ball.

Bills score vs. Bengals: Josh Allen throws fourth-down touchdown as Buffalo scores 21 unanswered points | Bills 39, Bengals 28

The Bills have 21 points in the fourth quarter. Buffalo started from the Cincinnati 29-yard line after Joe Burrow's second interception in as many pass attempts. Following a holding penalty against offensive tackle Ryan Van Demark, Dawson Knox took a short pass 31 yards to set up first-and-goal from the 8. James Cook had runs of 4 yards and 1 yard. On third down, Josh Allen's pass for Knox was initially ruled a touchdown before being reversed to incomplete. Buffalo went for it on fourth-and-goal from the 3. Allen pump faked them fired to a wide open Jackson Hawes in the end zone for a 3-yard touchdown.

Joe Burrow throws interception on second straight pass

Joe Burrow entered the game with zero interceptions in 2025. He has thrown two on consecutive pass attempts. Coming out after a 67-yard pick-6 by Christian Benford, Burrow's pass was tipped by defensive tackle Jordan Phillips and intercepted by defensive end A.J. Epenesa at the Bengals' 29-yard line. What a nightmare for the Bengals, who held a 28-25 lead with the ball and now trail 32-28 and the Bills have the ball deep in Cincinnati territory with 5:11 left.

Bills score vs. Bengals: Christian Benford picks off Joe Burrow for 67-yard touchdown | Bills 32, Bengals 28

Christian Benford scored a defensive touchdown for the second straight week. Joe Burrow saw Benford coming off the edge and tried to push a short pass to Ja'Marr Chase. Benford leaped in the air, intercepted the pass and returned it 67 yards for a touchdown. It's Buffalo's first lead of the game.

Bills score vs. Bengals: Josh Allen runs for 40-yard touchdown | Bengals 28, Bills 25

Josh Allen dashed through the snow for a 40-yard touchdown run. Buffalo only needed four plays to score with Allen opening with a 16-yard pass to Tyrell Shavers and 12-yard completion to Dalton Kincaid.

Bengals score vs. Bills: Joe Burrow lofts touchdown to Mike Gesicki | Bengals 28, Bills 18

Cincinnati went 12 plays and 80 yards, with Joe Burrow throwing a 12-yard touchdown pass to Mike Gesicki to cap the drive. Joe Burrow completed 7 of 8 passes for 57 yards on the drive.

James Cook loses fumble in end zone for touchback

It appeared the Bills took the lead on an electrifying 24-yard touchdown run by James Cook. But offensive tackle Ryan Van Demark was flagged for offensive holding to bring the play back. Things nearly went from bad to worse. Cincinnati challenged the play, which ended when Cook dove for the pylon and across the goal-line plane. The replay showed that Cook had the ball knocked out before he crossed the goal line and since the ball tumbled out of play, it was reversed and ruled a fumble. But officials determined the ball went out of bounds at the 1-yard line and not into the end zone so it was not ruled a fumble a turnover and touchback. After everything was sorted out, the offensive holding penalty stood and Buffalo faced first-and-16 at the Bengals' 30. The Bills recorded a first down on an illegal use of hands penalty on defensive tackle B.J. Hill and Keon Coleman made a catch for 8 yards to set up first-and-goal from the Bengals' 2. On first down, Cook took a handoff and tried reaching the ball over the goal-line again but fumbled. Linebacker Oren Burks recovered in the end zone for a touchback.

Bengals punt

Cincinnati went three-and-out on its first possession of the third quarter. Chase Brown ran for 3 yards, Tee Higgins dropped a deep pass from Joe Burrow and Burrow threw incomplete for Ja'Marr Chase on third down. Ryan Rehkow punted 56 yards and Khalil Shakir returned it 11 yards to the Bills' 10-yard line.

Bills score vs. Bengals: Josh Allen hits Dalton Kincaid for touchdown | Bengals 21, Bills 18

Buffalo received the ball to start the second half. Josh Allen was sacked by defensive tackle by B.J. Hill for an 8-yard loss on the first play. But cornerback DJ Turner II was flagged for a pass interference penalty on Brandin Cooks on the next snap for a new set of downs. On third-and-5, Allen scrambled for 16 yards into Bengals' territory. Allen converted another third down with a 27-yard completion to James Cook to set up first-and-goal from the Bengals' 9-yard line. Allen capped the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Dalton Kincaid for the tight end's return after missing three games due to a hamstring injury.

Halftime score: Cincinnati Bengals 21, Buffalo Bills 11

The first five drives of the game totaled four touchdowns and one field goal. Cincinnati has excelled on third down (7-for-8) while Buffalo had success on fourth down (2 -for-3).

Josh Allen has completed 9 of 13 passes for 96 yards and a touchdown and James Cook has 48 rushing yards on seven carries.

Joe Burrow is 13 of 18 for 130 yards and two touchdowns. Cincinnati has only 39 rushing yards on 13 attempts.

Bengals have game's first punt

Cincinnati couldn't extend its lead before halftime. The Bengals took over after a turnover on downs with 1:11 left in the second quarter. Cam Lewis was flagged for defensive holding and Burrow completed to Tanner Hudson for 12 yards. But Burrow threw incomplete for Tee Higgins, cornerback Christian Benford sacked Burrow on a blindside blitz for a 9-yard loss, and Burrow threw deep incomplete for Higgins on third-and-17. Ryan Rehkow punted 22 yards to the Bills' 25.

Buffalo turns ball over on downs

It was the first possession for either team without points. James Cook opened with an 18-yard run for a first down. Four plays later, the Bills faced fourth-and-3 from the Bengals' 43. Cincinnati brought pressure and Josh Allen's pass was knocked down near the line of scrimmage.

Bengals score vs. Bills: Joe Burrow throws touchdown after challenge | Bengals 21, Bills 11

Three possessions, three touchdowns for the Bengals, and the Bills haven’t been a competitive for one second of this game on defense. It’s almost comical how easy it has been for Joe Burrow to carve up Buffalo’s helpless defense. On this 69-yard drive, which ended with Burrow’s 10-yard pass to Chase Brown, the Bengals converted two more third downs, making them 7-for-7 so far, and Taron Johnson committed a 33-yard pass interference penalty that set the Bengals up at the Buffalo 10.

Bills score vs. Bengals: Josh Allen tosses TD to Khalil Shakir on fourth down | Bengals 14, Bills 11

At least for now, the Bills stayed alive in a game where the defense looks like it won’t get a stop all day. Josh Allen, on a fourth-and-4 play, had to buy a whole lot of time before he finally found Khalil Shakir with an 11-yard touchdown pass. And when Joseph Ossai roughed Allen after the play, the Bills’ decided to enforce the penalty on the conversion and went for a two-pointer, and it paid off when Allen hit Dawson Knox for the score.

Bengals score vs. Bills: Joe Burrow throws TD to Tee Higgins | Bengals 14, Bills 3

The Bengals’ offense has been unstoppable. Tee Higgins made a great catch for a 21-yard touchdown against rookie Max Hairston to cap an easy six-play, 55-yard drive. It began at the 45 because the Bills’ kickoff coverage team was terrible, and then the Bengals converted yet another third down, this one third-and-11 on a pass to Mike Gesicki. The Bills’ defense is putrid, and it has no answers.

Bills score vs. Bengals: Matt Prater makes field goal | Bengals 7, Bills 3

The Bills’ first drive started tremendously as Josh Allen’s first pass of the day went to a wide open Dawson Knox who rumbled 32 yards, but it ended brutally when Allen was sacked on a third-and-2 play from the 5 on what looked like a designed run. There was an offensive line breakdown that allowed the Bengals to swam Allen. The Bills had gotten into position for Matt Prater’s 26-yard field goal when Ty Johnson broke a 23-yard run on a fourth-and-1 play.

Bengals score vs. Bills: Chase Brown scores touchdown on opening drive | Bengals 7, Bills 0

The Bengals won the coin toss and went against common tendency and decided to receive rather than defer. Why did they do that? Because they know they can probably score all day against the Bills defense.

Joe Burrow executed a 14-play, 67-yard drive that ended with Chase Brown’s five-yard TD run. They chewed the first 8:16 of the game off the clock thanks to going 4-for-4 on third-down conversions. It’s a pathetic start for Buffalo’s defense.

Snow expected to continue falling through kickoff

Light to moderate lake effect snow continues to fall in the Buffalo area. The snow will taper off as the game continues, with a max of about of 4 inches in some spots.

Dalton Kincaid returns, Spencer Brown out

The Bills got some good news as tight end Dalton Kincaid was able to work out without an issue and he will return to action after missing the previous three games with a hamstring injury.

Kincaid was limited throughout the week at practice, and he also was wearing a knee brace on Thursday, but he’s going to give it a go and that could be critical because the Bengals have been the worst defense in the league in defending tight ends.

Kincaid’s return, though, is where the good news ended when the inactive list came out. Offensive tackle Spencer Brown, who sat out last week with a shoulder injury, is down again, and wide receiver Joshua Palmer will join him on the sidelines.

Brown suffered a shoulder injury in Houston and then missed the Pittsburgh game, and even though he practiced on a limited basis during the week, it always felt like a longshot that he would play.

On Friday, Sean McDermott listed Palmer’s status for the game as doubtful and as expected, he has gone from doubtful to out so he’ll be sidelined for the fifth time in what has become a terribly disappointing debut season for him.

McDermott had already ruled out edge rusher Joey Bosa and linebacker Terrel Bernard, and they were joined on the inactive list by offensive lineman Chase Lundt, defensive tackle Phidarian Mathis and newly-acquired defensive back Darnell Savage.

Sal’s prediction: Bills 27, Bengals 23

Homefield advantage is the main reason why I’m going with the Bills. If this game were in Cincinnati, I’d be going the other way because while they’re just 4-8, the Bengals are a completely different animal with Burrow and they’re going to have a great chance to win the rest of their games, starting with Buffalo, which could earn them the AFC North title.

The key for the Bills will be to control the game script with their running attack and keep Burrow and company off the field. However, their defense is starting to find its way and if that continues, that will be vital, too. After a brutal 10-quarter stretch encompassing Miami, Tampa Bay and the first half in Houston, the Buffalo defense has been outstanding in the six quarters since and that needs to continue against this explosive Cincinnati offense.

Morgan Fox has been in this spot before

On Saturday the Bills elevated defensive lineman Morgan Fox and linebacker Baylon Spector from the practice squad, so Fox will be making his debut against the Bengals.

He was signed to the practice squad in early November as a depth option given all the injuries the Bills have sustained on their defensive line, and sure enough, another one has cropped up as Joey Bosa will miss the game with a hamstring injury.

Fox and Bosa were teammates the previous three seasons with the Chargers, and there were several games during that time when Fox was counted on to fill in for an injured Bosa. Throughout his eight-year NFL career, one that has seen him start 34 of the 120 games he has played, Fox has been a versatile piece up front as he can play both outside and inside.

In some ways, he’s similar to Michael Hoecht who is on the injured reserve after playing only 1 ½ games for the Bills this season. Fox has 27.5 career sacks including 15.5 in the last three years with the Chargers, so there is a hope that Fox can capably fill in for Bosa who has been Buffalo’s best edge rusher this season.

* Scintillating game.
* As for Porter, and Brandin Echols, and James Pierre, great cornerback play yesterday.
Good argument, but not a certain rebuilding pillar in my opinion.
One scintillating game at a time.","From the notebook of a sportswriter who thought yesterday was the perfect day to go bombs away:

* No disrespect intended. Just an historical note.

* I realize I called Alex Highsmith the hero, but in retrospect, and after the excitement over the last play died down, it was Aaron Rodgers.

* Yes, it was excitement. That I have excitement in December over a football game, the week of an awful family funeral is, to me, what sports is all about.

* I realize yinz all want excitement in January, and I guess that would only come with a couple painful years of Will Howard at quarterback, so ... the Steelers can draft another and better quarterback?

* I'm not sure how all this rebuilding is supposed to work. I'm learning a lot less from Rodgers than Howard is right now, but I still enjoy having Rodgers around, smartass comments and all.

* At least they're not the passive-aggressive sniping comments that I had gotten used to the last two decades. But trust that that was just me.

* Scintillating game. That's what JB called it in dialing up Bill Cowher's comments for CBS Sports. Yes, it was scintillating, whether Isaiah likely got robbed or not.

* Jesse James got robbed too, but the rule was followed then. It was followed now.

* Stupid, stupid rules, yes, but Joey Porter Jr. didn't quit, and that's what matters today as the Ravens dig into a more difficult schedule than the one facing the Steelers.

* Hey, neither team may win again until they face each other on the last day. But that promises to be a scintillating finale, too, as we then ride off into 2026 and contemplate another QB-less draft.

* Just to digress, Dante Moore is my QB. I've only watched him play once. That was enough for me because I'm not paid to wreck an analysis by getting too far into my own head. And I'm not trading a truckload of picks for him, either. The Steelers need to fix holes elsewhere if they want to go 9-8 next season.

* Would a new coach be good enough to go 9-8? Or do we want a bad coach to go 3-14 so that we can then find a good coach?

* Again, unclear how this works.

* My old boss, the great Vic Ketchman, defended Chuck Noll during public outrage against the legendary coach, while his media buddies called Vic an apologist and water carrier and every other nasty thing a ""friend"" can call you (and I've heard more graphic and disgusting acts used as metaphors). But Vic once told me that the worst thing to cover is an 8-8 team. I knew what he meant then. I'm living what he meant now.

* Rodgers set the tone during the week. Rodgers set the tone during the game. The Ravens defended the Steelers the same way the Bills did -- man coverage outside, clog the middle with the rest of the bodies. This time Rodgers hit his outside deep balls.

* I saw Marquez Valdes-Scantling take a slant in practice and tear through the middle of the first-team defense as my eyes popped at the big man with such speed, and even quickness as he turned it up. The next day he was involved in packages, and of course was elevated into the game Sunday. I have to say, they gave Roman Wilson more patience than I would have. Again, I'm just not the Rob the Rebuilder that the other smarter media guys are.

* In the same sentence that Rodgers said Jonnu Smith ran the wrong way last week, Rodgers also said that he threw an awful ball and played an awful game and needs to be better. The Rebuilders ripped Rodgers as a narcissist, while leaving out the second half of his comment.

* I know. It's December and I should leave all of that on a blank phone screen. But I'm getting better at it.

* I think I'll be perfect by the time I hit 90. Can't wait.

* As for Porter, and Brandin Echols, and James Pierre, great cornerback play yesterday. And Asante Samuel Jr. waiting in the wings and the heavy-hitting Jalen Ramsey still learning his FS position and SS DeShon Elliott out with injury gives me great satisfaction that the secondary does not need help this offseason.

* And that's a load off the budget.

* Pay Nick Herbig in the offseason. Pay him a lot. Pay him more than any backup pass-rusher in the league. Just watching Rodgers with all that time against a non-existent Ravens pass rush makes me say that with confidence. The Steelers can only hope to keep all three, and still without a QB to overpay, that's feasible.

* I know. The Rebuilders will focus on the defensive budget and rip Art Rooney II for using all of his cap space again in not caring about the product.

* So, rush and coverage, check. Now, is Derrick Harmon really that valuable to the run defense? He's very good, but I still need to see more. Maybe it's scheme. Maybe it's poor talent judgment. Maybe it's the inside linebackers. But the Ravens rushed for 217 and they trailed by 11 at halftime, 11 late in the third quarter. Would they have topped 300 if they had a lead? If Lamar Jackson wasn't gimping? If Derrick Henry wasn't old?

* The Steelers couldn't get their run game going, of course. But I do like what I'm seeing from Kaleb Johnson, particularly his confidence in practice, and that includes kick returns. Much more explosiveness, decisiveness.

* Although I would still play Jaylen Warren, and, yes, in spite of my fussiness with Kenneth Gainwell he has exceptional games every now and then and yesterday Gainwell picked a great time for another one.

* Would Rob the Rebuilder play Johnson even though he's not better right now? Probably. But that's just not me. I'm more of ballwasher I guess.

* Isn't that what the old coots in the forum say?

* Still unsure of where the rebuilding should've happened, or happen. The one good argument, again, is drafting -- and then I guess playing -- Jaxson Dart instead of 21-year-old run-stopper Harmon. Good argument, but not a certain rebuilding pillar in my opinion.

* The Steelers played with palpable urgency yesterday. It was noticeable from the start. I thought Cam Heyward was the first to bring it to my attention. But if Rodgers doesn't connect on the deep ball, that urgency fades.

* I loved how Mike Tomlin walked off the field talking about the Dolphins on Monday night. I also loved how he was too emotionally tapped to appear overly satisfied with beating the Ravens. Usually a sign that the team is tapped emotionally, too, but already pointing to the Dolphins and having an extra day to decompress has me feeling that another scintillating game is upcoming.

* The Ravens have the more difficult schedule. The Bengals could sweep them next week. And it's much easier to root for the Bengals now since they blew a lead Sunday against the Bills.

* Would it be the Bills in the playoffs? Aren't the Steelers tired of losing to them? Is this 1993 all over again? I think from an emotional standpoint, yes.

* But I'm getting ahead of myself. One scintillating game at a time.",https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/629/479/13479629.jpg?width=1200&height=628&crop=1.91:1&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-08 17:03:46.945651

Jets quarterback Tyrod Taylor left Sunday’s game with the Dolphins after six plays thanks to a groin injury.

That put Brady Cook, an undrafted rookie out of Missouri, into his first game.

Cook looked like what you would expect from him making his first start after receiving no first-team reps this season.

He was 14-of-30 for 163 yards with two interceptions and was sacked six times in the 34-10 loss.

“It was definitely a challenge, but a great challenge,” Cook said. “One that comes with the job of being the backup quarterback. I felt ready to play today, and obviously I didn’t do enough to get a win.”

This was the third time Cook was active this season.

He also served as the backup against the Buccaneers and Bengals but did not play in those games.

Cook moved into the backup role this week after Justin Fields was sidelined due to a balky knee.

Cook, who has been on the practice squad all season, looked nervous at first.

His passes had a lot of zip on them and looked hard to handle.

He also did not get much help from his receivers, who dropped five passes.

It seemed like he settled down as the game went along and offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand called some short passes to help ease him in.

“Coming in at half, talking it over, just taking a deep breath, and then coming back out there, I definitely did [settle down],” Cook said. “I think you definitely saw flashes there in the fourth quarter of us moving the ball. So, we need more of it.”

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NFL STANDINGS AND JETS STATS

It is unclear how serious the injuries are to Taylor and Fields.

Cook may need to start next week against the Jaguars if the other quarterbacks can’t go.

Despite the loss, he impressed teammates with his poise.

“Supreme confidence,” running back Breece Hall said. “He takes every rep in practice like a pro. Once I heard how he came in the huddle and commanded the huddle, I was like, ‘Alright, he isn’t nervous. He’ll be alright.’ We could have been better for him tonight, so I wouldn’t put that one on him. He probably thinks he could have been better. He’s going to beat himself up, but as an offense, I think we could have easily made a few more plays for him and Tyrod as well.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-4dj7uexua-1765166853925.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1765148911&w=1200,N,,2025-12-08 15:03:34.126494

Justin Herbert is battling a fractured finger on his non-throwing hand and Omarion Hampton has been out since Week 5 with an ankle injury. The Chargers might get the best of both worlds as those two stars aim to play on ""Monday Night Football"" against the Philadelphia Eagles.

At the very least, Herbert should give Chargers fans plenty of optimism. He underwent surgery on the finger, but didn't miss any practice time ahead of Week 14.

With L.A. in the heat of a playoff race, the Chargers are hoping to continue navigating all the injuries they've dealt with in 2025.

Now they get to take on a struggling Eagles team in the hopes they can keep pace with the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos.

Here's the latest on Herbert.

Justin Herbert injury update

Herbert is listed as questionable for Week 14's matchup on ""Monday Night Football"" against the Eagles.

There has been plenty of optimism surrounding Herbert's status, however. It was reported by The Athletic's Dianna Russini that the quarterback is expected to play. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman said, via ESPN's Kris Rhim, on Dec. 4 that the team was optimistic that Herbert would attempt to play.

The 27-year-old fractured a finger in Week 13 on his non-throwing hand – an injury that required surgery. Herbert played through the injury in Week 13 and did have an extra day of rest ahead of Week 14.

Herbert practiced on a limited basis all week long, putting him in position to suit up.

From his early days as the New York Giants’ franchise quarterback to his current role with the Indianapolis Colts, Jones has faced a career riddled with challenges.

The worst part, many of which were beyond his control.

During his time in New York, Jones struggled behind an offensive line that often left him exposed to relentless pressure.

The lack of protection not only hindered his development but also contributed to a series of physical tolls early in his career.

After a non contact injury (torn ACL) ended his time in New York, he finds himself yet again suffering from another non contact injury (torn achilles) during his most recent performance for the Colts in Jacksonville on December 7th, 2025.

Following the injury Jones showed hightened frustration on the field.

Jones only signed a 1 year deal with the colts at the beginning of the 2025 season and this now puts more question marks around his future with the team.

Daniel Jones suffered an Achilles injury in the first quarter of the Colts' loss to the Jaguars. The injury was of the non-contact variety, as Jones crumpled to the ground while trying to evade pressure on a third-down throw.

Jones remained down after the play and was visibly upset while being tended to by the Colts medical staff on the field. The 28-year-old was able to slowly hobble off the field under his own power but eventually headed to the locker room before being ruled out for the remainder of the contest.

And it seems like the Colts quarterback will be sidelined much longer than that given the serious nature of his injury.

How long is Jones out? Here's what to know about the severity of his Achilles injury and when he may return to the field.

How long is Daniel Jones out?

Jones will miss the remainder of the 2025 NFL season after suffering a torn Achilles, according to multiple reports. The 28-year-old quarterback is set to have surgery to repair the injury.

Colts coach Shane Steichen didn't have additional specifics about Jones' injury during a postgame news conference. However, he acknowledged ""it's not looking good"" and that the ailment ""could be season-ending.""

The bigger question for Jones will be about his availability for the start of the 2026 NFL season.

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports Jones will face a 9-to-12-month recovery from the injury. The shorter end of that timeline would give the Duke product a chance to return in early September ahead of the 2026 season; a longer recovery would potentially sideline him for most of the campaign.

That will make Jones' rehab one to watch as he heads towards free agency following a breakout season during which he posted an 8-5 record as a starter and completed 68% of his passes for 3,101 yards, 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions.

Who is the Colts backup quarterback?

Riley Leonard will be the next man up at quarterback for the Colts. The sixth-round rookie replaced Jones in Sunday's game against the Jaguars following his injury and completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards and an interception while adding five yards and a score on the ground.

Steichen came out of the loss impressed with what Leonard had achieved after playing just six career NFL snaps entering the Week 14 game.

""I thought Riley stepped in and did some good things in a tough situation,"" Steichen told reporters. ""He battled like crazy.""

Leonard was a sixth-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft after helping lead Notre Dame to an appearance in the national championship game. The 6-4, 213-pound quarterback played one season for Notre Dame after transferring from Duke, completing 66.7% of his passes for 2,861 yards, 21 touchdowns and eight interceptions while adding 906 yards and 17 scores on the ground.

Leonard began the season as the Colts' third-string quarterback but was elevated into the No. 2 spot after Anthony Richardson suffered a fractured orbital bone during pregame warmups against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 6.

It isn't clear whether Richardson will return from that injury during the 2025 NFL season, so Leonard could be entrusted with the starting job over the season's final month.

Leonard and Rypien are currently the only healthy quarterbacks in the Colts organization. Rypien joined the team in October after spending time with the Minnesota Vikings and Cincinnati Bengals earlier in the season. The 29-year-old has a 2-2 career record as a starter but has completed just 58.3% of his career passes for 950 yards, four touchdowns and nine interceptions.

The Indianapolis Colts suffered a huge blow when quarterback Daniel Jones went down with an Achilles injury during their 36-19 loss to Jacksonville. Backup Riley Leonard was forced to finish the game as the only available quarterback, as Anthony Richardson remains out on injured reserve with an orbital fracture. Indy has lost three in a row, and the Jaguars are now in first place in the AFC South, with Jones’ injury the latest hit to the team’s hopes of a Super Bowl run.

Washington was also hit big time with the injury bug, losing Jayden Daniels once again to an elbow injury after he'd just returned in Week 14 from a dislocated elbow suffered in Week 9. Daniels has dealt with injuries all season, which have limited him to just seven games this season.

Commanders tight end Zach Ertz, 35, also left the game after suffering a leg injury on a low hit while jumping for a pass, feared to have torn an ACL, which would put an end to his season. Ertz was averaging 41.1 receiving yards per game heading into Week 14 — his highest average since his last Pro Bowl campaign in 2019 with the Philadelphia Eagles.

Miami is barely hanging on at 6-7 after demolishing the Jets 34-10. The Dolphins got some bad news in the win as running back De'Von Achane left the game after injuring his ribs. Achane rushed for 92 yards on seven carries and scored a touchdown before leaving the game. Head coach Mike McDaniel shared that Achane could have returned in an emergency, reiterating his potential availability for Week 15, saying, “I promise you, he’ll be in there if he’s ready,” McDaniel said, via ESPN’s Marcel Louis-Jacques.

The Dolphins are still alive in the wild-card race, but cannot lose another game.

The Philadelphia Eagles descend onto Southern California with pent-up surliness, a streak unbecoming of the defending Super Bowl champions. According to The Athletic’s NFL playoff simulator, Nick Sirianni’s squad has a 95 percent chance of winning the NFC East. But the team has winced through back-to-back losses. Fans are booing and locker room regulars are brooding. Even after February’s revelation, Philly needs a psychic reset.

Along the home sideline, the Los Angeles Chargers have won four of their last five games. Yes, that one mishap was a 35-6 humiliation ritual. But L.A. has to like its standing overall, given the devastating injuries to its two cornerstone blockers. Even if Jim Harbaugh and his Chargers get boxed into a wild-card spot, they’ll still have a shot at their first playoff W in seven years.

The teams

Philadelphia (8-4)

Good: Philadelphia started the week ranked No. 2 in fourth-down conversions allowed and No. 4 in red zone stinginess. No matter the dysfunction building from the other side, Vic Fangio’s defense keeps the Eagles within range of salvation. That group hasn’t allowed more than 24 points since Week 6. It suppressed the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions to consecutive single-digit scores last month. Nakobe Dean came on strong in November with three sacks across four starts. Fellow rising linebacker Jalyx Hunt has a playmaker’s instinct, as seen on Black Friday:

Bad: A.J. Brown arrives Monday with a touchdown catch and 100+ receiving yards in back-to-back games. That sounds like a good thing, but those numbers feel particularly hollow as the Eagles force his deep looks. While the team was stacking early fall wins, Brown was complaining about target shares and his limited route tree. The recent stat bumps coming in such deflating losses only underscores the curdling vibes. Jalen Hurts might not have a viable alternative for the game script, though. Philadelphia’s ultra-efficient ground attack was swept away with the Super Bowl confetti. One day, Saquon Barkley’s 2025 production dip will be studied through textbooks.

Space-shrinking DT Jalen Carter is on ice as he recovers from a shoulder procedure. All-world OT Lane Johnson hasn’t played since incurring a foot sprain in Week 11 and will be out again Monday night.

Los Angeles (8-4)

Good: The hosts have been a fantastic third-down team this year. After a dozen games, the Chargers were No. 2 in moving the chains and No. 4 in forcing a stop. Pocket crasher Tuli Tuipulotu is an unheralded star of 2025. He’s up to 10 sacks on the season, even though he went without one in L.A.’s first three outings. The gap discipline is impressive, and the pressure is a swarm:

Los Angeles’ pass defense began Week 14 ranked ninth in expected points added (EPA). While its secondary shortens the field and squeezes out drives, the wideout duo of Quentin Johnston and Ladd McConkey can break impatient opponents with one jolt on the other side of the ball.

Bad: When Justin Herbert is hurting, the offense becomes extremely limited. The franchise QB suffered a fracture in his non-throwing hand last game. According to TruMedia, the team ran all of its plays in either shotgun or pistol formation once Herbert returned from the injury. The Chargers were nursing a sizable lead, but even the worst version of these Eagles is so much better than the sputtering Las Vegas Raiders. And even before Herbert’s hand became a problem, the offense ranked 23rd in red zone rate, with just 21 touchdowns in 41 trips.

Herbert underwent surgery on his left hand last Monday and was officially listed as questionable on the Chargers’ weekend injury report. However, he was optimistic that he’d be in the lineup against the Eagles. “That’s the plan, is to prepare as if I’m going to play,” Herbert said Wednesday, according to The Athletic’s Daniel Popper.

The regular broadcast and the “Monsters Funday Football” one

We’ll hear from the usual “Monday Night Football” crew. Joe Buck and Troy Aikman are on the call from Inglewood. Lisa Salters and Laura Rutledge are the sideline reporters. The standard telecast will come in over the air on ABC and via cable on ESPN. There’s no “ManningCast” this time around, perhaps because Eli Manning is averse to Eagles and Chargers in equal measure.

Or … perhaps because the “Monsters, Inc.” universe is seeping into the simulcast. Through its omnipresent parent company, ESPN is providing viewers with “Monsters Funday Football,” the third annual version of this altcast. The first crossover featured “Toy Story” in 2023, followed by “The Simpsons” in 2024.

The field, live from Monstropolis, will be animated in the Disney-Pixar style, and the characters voiced by Billy Crystal and John Goodman are coming out of retirement as their characters suit up for the Eagles and Chargers, respectively (Bob Peterson’s Roz will handle sideline duties). Is Mike Wazowski a Broad Street pole climber? Does Sulley have bashful Chargers energy? Will we hear “Henry J. Waternoose, THE Monsters University“? All guesses go.

In the booth, there will be cartoon versions of play-by-play announcer Drew Carter and analyst Dan Orlovsky calling the game. Chris Berman, also in toon form, will make a special appearance, as well. The animated MFF is on ESPN2, Disney Channel and the various ESPN-Disney streaming platforms.

After enjoying one of the more surprising rises to playoff contention in 2025, a dark cloud now looms over the organization's present and future following Daniel Jones' Achilles injury during Sunday's Week 14 contest against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

With his season over, so may be Indy's, and the doom-and-gloom that this injury brings could cast an even larger shadow over the franchise than it merely derailing the 2025 campaign.

But let's start there: What does Daniel Jones' injury mean for this season? To be frank, they're done. They are looking at rookie Riley Leonard -- who took over for Jones on Sunday -- as the starter from here on out. Either that or maybe Anthony Richardson (orbital fracture) is activated off of injured reserve. Regardless of who is under center, the ceiling is dramatically lower without Jones.

Looking at the standings, they are 8-5, and the loss to the Jaguars all but takes them out of contention for winning the AFC South. Jacksonville is 9-4 and momentarily holds the head-to-head tiebreaker. Even if the Colts find a way to break that tiebreaker by defeating them in their final matchup in Week 17, the next tiebreaker -- record within your division -- doesn't project to help Indianapolis out.

2025 NFL playoff picture: Broncos, Rams leap up as No. 1 seeds; which wild card teams are in trouble?

Tyler Sullivan

The Jaguars are 3-1 against the AFC South after Sunday's win, and the Colts fell to 2-2. On top of their matchup in Week 17, each has one other divisional matchup down the stretch. The Jaguars will host the Tennessee Titans in Week 18, while the Colts will visit the Houston Texans in Week 18. That creates a much easier path for Jacksonville to bolster its division record, further giving it an inside lane over Indy.

And we're not even mentioning the Colts needing to keep pace against a difficult schedule to make a tiebreaker a discussion. Over the next two weeks, they take on the Seattle Seahawks (road) and then the San Francisco 49ers (home). It wouldn't be surprising to see them as underdogs in both contests.

That illustrates just how dire things are for Indy, not just in a race with the Jaguars in the AFC South, but to simply make the playoffs at this point. The Colts' chances of making the postseason have decreased dramatically. After the Texans took down the Chiefs on Sunday night, the Colts have dropped to No. 8 in the AFC, marking a massive fall from grace. After Week 8, Indianapolis had a 98.2% chance of making the playoffs. Fast-forward to the end of Week 14, and it holds just a 44.5% of making it.

OK, now let's look big picture, which is just as, if not more grim: What do the Colts look like in 2026 and beyond?

This injury has the potential to set the Colts back years. Remember, Indianapolis shelled out two first-round picks (2026 and 2027) for cornerback Sauce Gardner at the trade deadline earlier this year. On top of that, being a blockbuster move to bolster Indy's secondary, it was also a stamp of approval around Jones as their franchise quarterback for 2025 and beyond. It effectively took them out of finding a quarterback at the NFL Draft for the next two years because, in their eyes, they already had their guy. In retrospect, that trade has now cut Indy off from finding either Jones' outright replacement or a stopgap option until he returns to action.

And then there's this question: What do the Colts do with Daniel Jones?

After all, the veteran quarterback is set to be an unrestricted free agent. Before this injury, he was earmarked for a massive extension that would've tied him to the organization for years to come. Now, it doesn't appear like such a deal will be reached. One of the more logical roads the Colts could go down is utilizing the franchise tag on Jones, ensuring he's under contract through next season. While that locks Jones up for 2026, he might not be ready to go at the jump.

An Achilles tear is roughly a nine-month recovery. If all goes according to plan, that would be a rough return date somewhere in early September. That's precisely around the time the 2026 regular season kicks off, so it's a razor-thin margin to even begin thinking about Jones playing at the start of the year. As we've seen in the past, Achilles injuries are an uphill climb, and players are not exactly the same as they were pre-injury right out of the gate, so the Colts will need to have contingency plans at quarterback.

If they do decide to keep Jones as their starter whenever he returns to full strength, they have in-house options like Richardson (on a rookie deal through 2026) and Leonard. They could lean on one of those signal-callers to hold down the fort until Jones gets back on the field or look at an outside option. Regardless of who they tap to be the starter in that scenario, the ceiling is dramatically lower than what it was with a healthy Jones.

The Colts have now gone from a possible No. 1 seed in the AFC just a few weeks ago to now at risk of being out of the playoff picture entirely, and a rather bleak future with Jones' injury likely bleeding into 2026.

Game balls

Week 14 stats: 25 carries, 161 yards rushing, 2 TDs

Pollard was a one-man wrecking crew during Tennessee's upset win over the Browns. Both of his rushing touchdowns were from beyond 30 yards, including a 65-yard scamper in the first quarter. Pollard is just the seventh player in Titans history with 150-plus rushing yards and two-plus rushing touchdowns in a game.

Week 14 stats: 22 of 28, 251 yards passing, 3 TDs; 9 carries, 78 yards, 1 TD

The defending NFL MVP looked the part during Sunday's critical win over the Cincinnati Bengals. He tallied four total touchdowns, helping spearhead a 21-point fourth quarter to help mount the double-digit comeback. This was Allen's 11th career game with at least three passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown, which extends his NFL record. He also became the first player all-time with three seasons of at least 20 passing touchdowns and 10 rushing touchdowns.

Week 14 stats: 1 tackle, 1 sack, 1 INT, 1 TD

While Allen may be the headliner coming out of Sunday's win over the Bengals, Benford was right there, too. The corner gave Buffalo the lead midway through the fourth quarter after picking off Joe Burrow and returning it 63 yards for a touchdown. Benford became the first player in Bills history with a defensive touchdown in two straight games.

Week 14 stats: 24 carries, 107 yards, TD

De'Vone Achane left the game in the second quarter with a rib injury, thrusting Wright into taking on the lion's share of the carries out of Miami's backfield. The 2024 fourth-round pick answered the bell during the Dolphins 34-10 win over the Jets, and scored his first career touchdown in the process.

Week 14 stats: 7 catches, 92 yards receiving, 2 TDs

JSN continues to be prolific and was again a key cog in Seattle, dropping 37 points in a blowout win over the Falcons. This was his third career game with two receiving touchdowns, and second over his last three games. Smith-Njigba has also tallied at least 90 receiving yards in 11 of his 13 games played this season. His 109.8 receiving yards per game average has him on pace for 1,867 receiving yards for the year, which would be the fourth-most all-time.

Week 14 stats: 7 catches, 148 yards receiving

Pittsburgh was finally able to find some openings on deep throws during Sunday's win over the Ravens, and Metcalf was at the center of it. His 148 yards receiving were a season high and better than his previous five games combined (144 yards). Three of Metcalf's seven catches were of 20-plus air yards, including a 52-yard gain on the first play of the day by the Steelers offense.

Week 14 stats: 20 carries, 86 yards rushing, 1 TD; 2 catches, 6 yards receiving

Jacobs' numbers may not jump off the page, but he was grinding out key yardage for the Packers as they fended off the Bears. Specifically, Jacobs was clutch in a gotta-have-it moment during Green Bay's final offensive possession. Faced with a third-and-1 at the Chicago 26-yard line, Jacobs somehow barrelled through multiple defenders looking to tackle him behind the line of scrimmage and gained 21 yards. That set up Green Bay inside the 10-yard line, and the veteran back eventually punched in what would be the game-winning score.

Week 14 stats: 7 catches, 167 yards receiving, 2 TDs

Nacua continues to rival for the title of being considered the best receiver in the NFL, and he was flashing that talent throughout the Rams' blowout win over the Cardinals. This was the first game in Nacua's career in which he recorded multiple receiving touchdowns, and his six scores on the season match a career high. This was also the sixth time that Nacua has recorded 150-plus receiving yards in a game over his first three seasons, which is tied for second behind Justin Jefferson for the most all-time.

Notable Week 14 gaffes

Chiefs botch fourth-down play at own 31-yard line

After a nine-yard scramble by Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs were looking at a fourth-and-1 situation from their own 31-yard line. Andy Reid kept his offense on the field, and it felt like maybe they'd try to get the Texans to jump with a hard count. However, they did go for it, Mahomes was instantly pressured, and his throw to Rashee Rice was incomplete. That turned the ball over on downs and, just six plays later, the Texans punched it into the end zone to take a 17-10 lead, breaking the tie and sending Houston on a road to victory.

Kansas City's defense had forced five-straight punts to begin the second half, and had the Texans on their heels. It would've made more sense to simply get that unit back on the field by punting the ball and playing for field position. Instead, the gamble to go for it deep in their own territory blew up in their face, and likely cost them their season as they now drop to 6-7 and well out of the playoff picture.

Joe Burrow, Bengals collapse in fourth quarter

Cincinnati may have just fumbled its way out of the playoffs. Coming into Week 14, the Bengals were pegged as a dark horse to crash the playoff party in the AFC thanks to the return of Joe Burrow. The club was able to defeat the Ravens in Baltimore last week, and then had the Buffalo Bills on the ropes on the road, leading 28-18 in the fourth quarter. However, the team proceeded to collapse down the stretch with multiple turnovers that now have them at 4-9 on the year and their season on life support.

After Buffalo cut into the lead with a touchdown to make it a 28-25 Cincinnati lead, Burrow committed back-to-back interceptions. The first was hauled in by corner Christian Benford, who returned it 63 yards for a touchdown, giving Buffalo the lead.

On the very next possession, and very next throw, Burrow had his throw hit at the line of scrimmage and was hauled in by A.J. Epenesa. That sparked a Bills touchdown drive to effectively help ice the game.

Baker Mayfield, Emeka Egbuka miss a TD at worst possible time

The Buccaneers were on the wrong side of maybe the biggest upset of Week 14, falling to the New Orleans Saints at home. Tampa Bay struggled to string drives together, converting just three of its 14 third-down opportunities and was 2 of 7 on fourth down in the losing effort. Despite that, they had an opportunity to tie the game midway through the fourth quarter, but Baker Mayfield and Emeka Egbuka were unable to connect. The throw was a bit out in front of Egbuka, but the rookie receiver also let it bounce out of his hands.

The Bucs went on to settle for a field goal on that drive and were unable to threaten again.

Lamar Jackson throws INT to his cousin

Steelers corner James Pierre will now have some bragging rights at the next family reunion. Facing off against his cousin, Lamar Jackson, on Sunday, he hauled in a one-handed interception in the second quarter.

While the family dynamic of this turnover is an interesting quirk, it also highlights how Jackson has looked off in recent weeks. On top of the turnover, Jackson completed just 54.2% of his passes in the loss and displayed some poor clock management down the stretch, which now has the Ravens outside of the playoffs entirely.

Brutal beat in Broncos-Raiders

We may have witnessed the worst beat of the 2025 regular season in Week 14. The spread in Broncos-Raiders closed at Broncos -8.5, and the total closed at 40.5. With just over a minute left in regulation, Denver held possession at the Las Vegas 28-yard line already with a 10-point lead. Instead of kicking the field goal to add to their lead, however, Sean Payton kept his offense on the field on a fourth-and-4, and running back R.J. Harvey was stopped for no gain. That turned the ball over on downs with just under a minute to go in the game.

From there, the Raiders proceeded to march down the field, and Kenny Pickett completed a 26-yard pass to Tyler Lockett to get Las Vegas to the Denver 33-yard line. After the play, safety Brandon Jones was called for a delay of game penalty that stopped the clock. After the stoppage, the Raiders opted for a 46-yard field goal, and the ball went through the uprights just as time expired. That meaningless field game swung not only the spread, but also hit the Over as well.

So, if you know a Broncos -8.5 bettor or someone who had the Under in this game, give them a hug.

— The injury-riddled Kansas City Chiefs lost left tackle Wanya Morris to a left knee injury on the first play against the Houston Texans on Sunday night, leaving their makeshift offensive line with three backups and rookie Esa Pole protecting Patrick Mahomes' blind side.
Earlier this week, they put first-round draft pick and starting left tackle Josh Simmons went on injured reserve following surgery to repair a fractured and dislocated wrist.
So when Morris went down, the Chiefs had to count on Pole — their de factor fourth-string offensive tackle.
He also had a stint with the Jets before returning to Kansas City in late October.","KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The injury-riddled Kansas City Chiefs lost left tackle Wanya Morris to a left knee injury on the first play against the Houston Texans on Sunday night, leaving their makeshift offensive line with three backups and rookie Esa Pole protecting Patrick Mahomes' blind side.

Not exactly an ideal situation against Danielle Hunter, Will Anderson Jr. and one of the best pass rushes in the NFL.

The patchwork bunch managed to turn in a respectable effort against Houston, but the Chiefs offence nevertheless struggled to get anything going against the league's top-ranked defence. Patrick Mahomes threw three interceptions, the Chiefs were stopped twice on fourth down in the fourth quarter, and Houston walked away with a 20-10 victory inside Arrowhead Stadium.

“I was proud of the guys for the effort they put in,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “These guys take responsibility for things. You know, you keep going. But we put everything into these games, every game, so when you lose, you should be upset. And that's why you try to enjoy the wins when you have an opportunity. There is a lot of time and effort that goes into it.”

The Chiefs also lost former All-Pro cornerback Trent McDuffie to a knee injury in the first quarter, when he jumped high to try to knock a pass away from Nico Collins. Not only did McDuffie get hurt, the big wide receiver hauled in the 46-yard reception.

But it was on offence where the injuries really hurt the Chiefs.

Earlier this week, they put first-round draft pick and starting left tackle Josh Simmons went on injured reserve following surgery to repair a fractured and dislocated wrist. Then, right tackle Jawaan Taylor was ruled out with a triceps injury and standout right guard Trey Smith with an ankle injury, making it three starters out even before kickoff.

The Chiefs opted to put primary backup Jaylon Moore at right tackle and Morris on the left side, with Mike Caliendo getting the start in Smith's place. So when Morris went down, the Chiefs had to count on Pole — their de factor fourth-string offensive tackle.

Pole played two seasons at a California junior college and two at Washington State. He went undrafted in April and signed with the Chiefs the following month. He also had a stint with the Jets before returning to Kansas City in late October.

“I mean, you just got next man up,” said Mahomes, who finished with just 160 yards passing and the three picks. “Obviously not where you want to be, but Esa played his tail off, for a guy that had to get activated and be on the roster and go against one of the best pass rushes in the league. He gave me time to throw the ball downfield in some big situations.”

The Chiefs just didn't connect on enough of them. Or make enough plays when they mattered the most.

“We've been close all season. At the end of the day, you have to go out there and make it happen,” Mahomes said. “We've got the talent. We got the heart. But we have to go out there and execute. And until we prove it, we're going to come out with losses.”",https://www.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chiefs.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 13:05:05.777601

During a crucial Week 14 game, Ertz went down after a hard hit to his lower right leg while attempting a mid-air catch. The stadium atmosphere shifted instantly as the veteran tight end grabbed his knee and signaled to the sideline for medical help.

What happened to zach ertz injury?

Players from both teams took a knee as he was evaluated, highlighting how serious the injury appeared from the first look. The moment spread rapidly across social media, with fans, analysts, and former teammates expressing shock and concern.

Early Medical Indications and What Experts Expect

Initial examinations suggest a possible major ligament injury, something that often requires months of recovery and extensive rehabilitation. While an official confirmation is pending, sports injury analysts believe the mechanism of the fall resembles ACL or MCL damage, injuries that are common in high-impact football collisions.

Search trends show fans asking:

“Is Zach Ertz out for the season?”

“What is Zach Ertz’s recovery timeline?”

“Will this injury end his career?”

Given Ertz’s age and long NFL career, any severe knee injury raises questions about whether he will attempt a comeback or consider long-term health first.

Impact on His Team and Season Strategy

The injury comes at a pivotal point in the season, and losing an experienced tight end like Ertz deeply affects the team’s offensive structure. Coaches now face the challenge of adjusting the playbook, redistributing passing responsibilities, and relying on younger tight ends who may not offer the same veteran stability.

Ertz’s presence has always extended beyond the field. His leadership, locker-room influence, and ability to mentor younger players make him a critical part of the franchise’s culture. With him sidelined, the team enters an uncertain stretch, both competitively and emotionally.

A Career Marked by Toughness Meets a Major Test

Zach Ertz has built a reputation as one of the toughest and most reliable tight ends in recent NFL history. From game-winning catches to playoff performances and a championship legacy, his career reflects resilience and discipline.

But at this stage, any severe injury becomes more difficult to bounce back from. Fans are already debating whether this moment marks a turning point — either a temporary setback or the beginning of an extended recovery road that may reshape the final chapter of his NFL journey.

Fan Reaction and Social Media Buzz

As soon as news of the injury surfaced, phrases like “Zach Ertz injury update,” “Will Zach Ertz return this season,” “Zach Ertz MRI results,” and “career-ending injury fears” began trending online. Social media posts poured in from across the country, with supporters wishing him strength and praising his contributions to the sport.

Many fans expressed frustration over the nature of the hit, questioning whether more protective rules should be enforced for airborne receivers. Analysts echoed similar thoughts, noting that tight ends often face high-risk contact while making contested catches.

What Happens Next?

Zach Ertz is expected to undergo a detailed medical evaluation, including imaging tests, to determine the full extent of the damage. The outcome will decide whether he enters short-term rehabilitation, season-ending injury reserve, or a long-term recovery protocol that influences his career decisions.

The next major update fans are awaiting includes:

Official diagnosis

Estimated recovery timeline

Team’s roster adjustments

Ertz’s personal statement

Until then, speculation continues, but one thing is clear — this injury marks a major moment not just for Ertz, but for the team and for NFL fans tracking every development.

Battling for an NFC West crown and coming off a loss, the Rams (10-3) controlled most of Sunday at State Farm Stadium, a day that was difficult for the injury-ravaged Cardinals (3-10). Difficult enough that details weren't needed.

""They just beat us,"" quarterback Jacoby Brissett said. ""No making excuses.""

""They were better than us in every facet,"" coach Jonathan Gannon said. ""It's very humbling. It's not OK. It's not acceptable.""

That initial touchdown drive to open the game was impressive but ""we've got to find ways to sustain it,"" Brissett acknowledged. Wilson was excellent – 11 more receptions – but the game got sideways after 10-10.

The Rams totaled 530 yards, with Matthew Stafford throwing for three touchdowns and the running game gaining 249. Wide receiver Puka Nacua was unstoppable, with two touchdowns and 167 yards on his seven catches, many of them in tight coverage.

""You take it personal,"" defensive lineman Dante Stills said.

Gannon said the explosives and the lack of forcing the Rams into third downs – the Rams rarely were forced into third downs in the first half – were the problem. He said he needed to watch the video, but didn't doubt that it would come down to fundamental play.

""I think everybody's head is in the right place, but I mean, it's over and over and over, so it's only so much we can do,"" outside linebacker Josh Sweat said. ""I guess we're still just trying to get better. That's all we ever say. No one's pointing fingers. It's just let's go back to work.""

For the first time this season, the Cardinals' entire inactives list was filled with injured players, and then left tackle Paris Johnson Jr. left the game in the second half with a knee injury. Starting left guard Evan Brown was out for personal reasons, so Jon Gaines II filled in.

Injuries are part of it, however.

Pierce got up slowly after making an apparent touchdown catch, only to have the catch overturned. Trainers examined Pierce on the bench first, then in the team’s injury tent.

The television broadcast initially reported Pierce was being evaluated for a concussion, but Pierce was available for interviews after the game; NFL players are not allowed to speak to the media while in concussion protocol.

“You can ask the trainers,” Pierce said. “Not going to talk about injuries.”

Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen did not have an update on Pierce after the game.

Asked a follow-up question about how he felt, Pierce kept it short and sweet.

“Feel good,” Pierce said.

Pierce is having an excellent season in the final year of his rookie deal. He had five catches for 80 yards on Sunday, bringing his season totals to 38 catches and a team-leading 769 yards while teaming well with quarterback Daniel Jones, who suffered an Achilles injury on Sunday that the Colts fear will knock him out the rest of the season.

“I really still haven’t processed it yet,” Pierce said. “I still need to go talk to him and stuff. Feel terrible for him. You never want to see that happen. He already was putting so much on the line for us, dealing with other injuries.”","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PIND/87658465007-usatsi-27765421.jpg?crop=1425,802,x0,y534&width=1425&height=802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-08 05:00:06.623067

But things were already slipping away even before Jones' injury.","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Daniel Jones limped off the field and into the tunnel leading to the locker room of dejected Indianapolis Colts. He was rain-soaked, disheveled and had just sustained a right torn Achilles a couple hours prior. The expression he wore after Sunday's 36-16 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars was the perfect illustration of his team's bleak predicament.

The Colts (8-5), already in the midst of a precipitous slide after starting the season with the NFL's best record at 7-1, now face a long list of complicated questions in the wake of Jones' serious injury. A torn Achilles, which is what a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter Jones suffered, can take as long as a year to fully recover from, raising thorny issues related to the future of the position in Indianapolis. And given the unraveling of the Colts' season, what might a disappointing finish mean for the team's leadership, its veteran players and everyone involved?

With Jones headed for season-ending surgery and months of rehab, here are the critical questions brought about by Jones' devastating injury.

What happens in the immediate term?

For now, rookie backup Riley Leonard takes the reins, and that puts the Colts in a tough spot. Leonard was drafted in the sixth round out of Notre Dame with the team viewing him as a developmental quarterback. He was the third-string option until a scary pregame accident involving quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr., who sustained an orbital fracture to his face after a mishap involving stretching bands in October. Richardson remains on injured reserve.

Leonard has been the No. 2 quarterback ever since. And while he has worked diligently and has made significant strides -- just last week Leonard spent a late evening at Jones' house doing extra game prep -- one of the primary strengths of the Colts' offense was Jones' ability to process situations quickly and accurately and make sound decisions. Leonard will be hard-pressed to duplicate that given his inexperience.

Against the Jags, Leonard completed 18 of 29 attempts for 145 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. Leonard also rushed for a score. But 16 of Leonard's attempts were five yards or fewer down the field, according to ESPN Research.

Leonard did show the game wasn't too big for him, and he'll need to demonstrate that again if he makes his first start next Sunday at the Seattle Seahawks. In the immediate aftermath of the game, Leonard was already getting significant support from his teammates.

""Having guys like [All-pro guard] Quenton Nelson come up to me and say he believes in me,"" Leonard said, ""Everybody on the sideline was so supportive. That's always good for a rookie quarterback.""

What's next at quarterback for Indy?

The Colts had been having internal discussions about a contract extension for Jones long before they became the hottest offense in the NFL. Through eight games, the Colts were averaging six more points than any other team and were producing 6.5 yards per play, on pace for one of the highest marks in franchise history.

Jones was the key to unlocking all of it, with his efficiency, accurate passing and execution of coach Shane Steichen's smart schemes. Jones seemed like an answer to the Colts' yearslong uncertainty at quarterback. But now, everything about his future is in question.

He is scheduled to become a free agent in the spring, when his one-year contract expires. But he will be far from a return to the field at that point, and his status for next season is, at best, in question.

Do the Colts take a chance and sign him to a reduced contract? Do they look elsewhere? Can they even count on him for 2026?

Those answers are a long way off, but the impression Jones has made on the Colts was clear in the reaction to his injury.

""That's our team leader,"" receiver Alec Pierce said. ""That's our team captain right there. Everything runs through him. That was brutal.""

Worth noting is that Richardson remains under contract for 2026. His future has been in question since he lost a preseason position battle with Jones. But Sunday's developments could change things for him. Richardson showed improvement through training camp and is still just 23 years old.

What if the season unravels?

In many ways, it is already unraveling. The Colts started Sunday in a tie for first place in the AFC South, but Jacksonville (9-4) now sits alone atop the division. The Colts dropped to the periphery of the wild-card standings after the loss.

So, after a remarkable start that had Indianapolis with the best record in the NFL, how will a collapse down the stretch reflect on the men in charge of the team?

The futures of general manager Chris Ballard and Steichen were in question after last season's 8-9 finish. But the late owner Jim Irsay, who passed away in May, agreed to give the pair one more shot in 2025.

Losing a starting quarterback in Week 14 with the playoffs still within reach certainly complicates the evaluation process. But things were already slipping away even before Jones' injury. Nothing that's happened in recent weeks reflects well on the team's brass, and it will be a difficult assessment if the Colts can't finish strong in its remaining games against the Seahawks, Jaguars, San Francisco 49ers and Houston Texans. The combined record of those teams is 39-14.

What is the impact of ownership changes?

The subplot to all of this is that all the difficult decisions ahead of the Colts will be made by different decision-makers.

Irsay's oldest daughter, Carlie Irsay-Gordon, and her sisters, Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson, are now primary owners. How they will process what's happened isn't certain. Jim Irsay was often prone to emotional and abrupt decisions, but his daughters are seen as much more pragmatic.

However they choose to proceed, the Colts are not in an optimum situation. Jones' injury is compounded by the absence of their first-round picks in 2026 and 2027, which the team recently traded to the New York Jets for cornerback Sauce Gardner in an effort to make a deep playoff run this season.

The Colts also will have to navigate the futures of core players. Pierce and defensive end Kwity Paye are entering free agency, receiver Michael Pittman Jr.'s salary-cap figure jumps to $29 million and running back Jonathan Taylor is due an extension (2026 is the final season of his contract).

A single injury has led to a multitude of questions for which there are no immediate answers.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1208%2Fr1586561_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 02:58:56.809449

The precise nature of the injury wasn't initially clear, but Morris clutched his left knee after falling on a run play. He remained down on the field in obvious pain as his teammates watched on in concern. He eventually limped off the field with the aid of two athletic trainers, unable to put weight on his left leg.

He didn't return to the game, and the Chiefs fell 20-10 in a costly loss.

“Wanya Morris hurt his leg, lower leg. We’ll just have to see in the next day or so how he is,"" Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said after the game.

Morris is not Kansas City's regular starting left tackle. A third-year pro selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft, he was making his first start of the season Sunday night.

Regular starter and rookie first-round draft pick Josh Simmons was placed on injured reserve last week with a wrist injury that required surgery. He'll be sidelined at a minimum of four of Kansas City's final five regular-season games, Sunday's included. The Chiefs also took the field without veteran right tackle Jawaan Taylor (triceps/knee) and Pro Bowl right guard Trey Smith (ankle), who were both inactive for Sunday's game.

Rookie Esa Pole, who had previously never played an NFL snap and wasn't listed on Kansas City's online depth chart prior to Sunday's game, took Morris' place at left tackle protecting Patrick Mahomes' blind side.

Pole initially joined the Chiefs as an undrafted free agent this offseason, then joined the New York Jets when he didn't make Kansas City's 53-man roster. The Jets released Pole in October, and the Chiefs re-signed him when Simmons went on injured reserve.

Earlier this week, they put first-round draft pick and starting left tackle Josh Simmons went on injured reserve following surgery to repair a fractured and dislocated wrist.

(AP) — The injury-riddled Kansas City Chiefs lost left tackle Wanya Morris to a left knee injury on the first play against the Houston Texans on Sunday night, leaving their makeshift offensive line with three backups and rookie Esa Pole protecting Patrick Mahomes’ blind side.

Not exactly an ideal situation against Danielle Hunter, Will Anderson Jr. and one of the best pass rushes in the NFL.

The patchwork bunch managed to turn in a respectable effort against Houston, but the Chiefs offense nevertheless struggled to get anything going against the league’s top-ranked defense. Patrick Mahomes threw three interceptions, the Chiefs were stopped twice on fourth down in the fourth quarter, and Houston walked away with a 20-10 victory inside Arrowhead Stadium.

“I was proud of the guys for the effort they put in,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “These guys take responsibility for things. You know, you keep going. But we put everything into these games, every game, so when you lose, you should be upset. And that’s why you try to enjoy the wins when you have an opportunity. There is a lot of time and effort that goes into it.”

The Chiefs also lost former All-Pro cornerback Trent McDuffie to a knee injury in the first quarter, when he jumped high to try to knock a pass away from Nico Collins. Not only did McDuffie get hurt, the big wide receiver hauled in the 46-yard reception.

But it was on offense where the injuries really hurt the Chiefs.

Earlier this week, they put first-round draft pick and starting left tackle Josh Simmons went on injured reserve following surgery to repair a fractured and dislocated wrist. Then, right tackle Jawaan Taylor was ruled out with a triceps injury and standout right guard Trey Smith with an ankle injury, making it three starters out even before kickoff.

The Chiefs opted to put primary backup Jaylon Moore at right tackle and Morris on the left side, with Mike Caliendo getting the start in Smith’s place. So when Morris went down, the Chiefs had to count on Pole — their de factor fourth-string offensive tackle.

Pole played two seasons at a California junior college and two at Washington State. He went undrafted in April and signed with the Chiefs the following month. He also had a stint with the Jets before returning to Kansas City in late October.

“I mean, you just got next man up,” said Mahomes, who finished with just 160 yards passing and the three picks. “Obviously not where you want to be, but Esa played his tail off, for a guy that had to get activated and be on the roster and go against one of the best pass rushes in the league. He gave me time to throw the ball downfield in some big situations.”

The Chiefs just didn’t connect on enough of them. Or make enough plays when they mattered the most.

“We’ve been close all season. At the end of the day, you have to go out there and make it happen,” Mahomes said. “We’ve got the talent. We got the heart. But we have to go out there and execute. And until we prove it, we’re going to come out with losses.”

Indianapolis has lost four of the last five and now sit at 8-5 after losing 36-19 to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The same ailment led cornerback Trent McDuffie to leave in the first quarter, and he too was later ruled out.

Morris, starting in place of the injured Josh Simmons, suffered the injury when he appeared to be rolled up on by center Creed Humphrey while run blocking.

Within minutes of having to be assisted off the field, Morris was put onto the back of a cart and taken to the locker room. He was downgraded to out before the end of the first quarter and was replaced by undrafted rookie Esa Pole, who made his NFL debut after being elevated to the active roster this past week.

Simmons, the team's first-round pick this year, was placed on injured reserve last week and will miss at least four games. He had surgery last week to repair a dislocated and fractured left wrist, which he suffered in the team's Thanksgiving Day loss to the Dallas Cowboys.

The Washington Commanders tight end suffered a knee injury against the Minnesota Vikings Dec. 7 and did not return.

Commanders quarterback Marcus Mariota – in for the injured starter Jayden Daniels – threw high to Ertz in the third quarter. Vikings safety Jay Ward came in low and plowed into Ertz’s vulnerable right leg.

After the hit, Ertz immediately signaled to the Washington sideline for assistance and, unable to put any weight on the leg, he was carried off the field.

Mariota consoled Ertz while the latter was on the cart, and the broadcast cameras showed a distressed Daniels – who, despite the 10-year age gap, has developed a strong kinship with the veteran presence that was key to turning around the losing ways during Dan Quinn’s first season in 2024.

Ertz played in all of the Commanders’ games last season and had seven touchdowns. In 2025, he was up to 50 catches and four touchdowns.

Ertz has said he would play the rest of his career with Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, and his connection with Daniels was another motivating factor to return for a 13th NFL season this year.

Reminds me of when Zack Martin was talking in an interview where apparently Jerry Jones was pissed with the line injuries that he forced them all to wear braces

Played football, but never good enough to the level where the team supplies the whole OL with legit knee braces lol. But I believe the main reason they wear them is because the likelihood of getting rolled up from any direction (mostly from behind or the sides) is so high battling in the trenches

During an address last week at Forbes’ annual Healthcare Summit, NFL Chief Medical Officer Allen Sills noted that all 32 of the league’s teams report to the same EHR.

“It’s things on our game day — medical reports from all of our 30 medical providers that are at every NFL game.
In his eyes, this comprehensive dataset allows the NFL to study injury mechanisms more rigorously than any other sports league.","Healthcare providers have struggled with data interoperability since the advent of the EHR decades ago, failing to fully connect patient information across systems. They may have an unlikely model to look to for improvement: the National Football League.

During an address last week at Forbes’ annual Healthcare Summit, NFL Chief Medical Officer Allen Sills noted that all 32 of the league’s teams report to the same EHR. Having all this player data in one place helps the league not only treat injuries more effectively but also prevent them, he said.

“If we think about all the injuries that happen in an athletic competition, yes, some of them are maybe bad luck. Players accidentally collide, they accidentally hit the ground. But there is a proportion of them — and we might disagree about the proportion — that I would call preventable. They’re preventable if we understand the drivers — if we understand the who, what, why and the circumstances of those injuries,” Sills explained.

The NFL shares its players’ health data with a third party epidemiology data science company, which delivers insights that help the league better understand the drivers of injury, he stated.

It doesn’t just share EHR data, he pointed out.

“It’s things on our game day — medical reports from all of our 30 medical providers that are at every NFL game. It’s equipment tracking. We tag all the helmets, cleats and shoulder pads that players wear. Every player wears a GPS tracking device so we know how fast, how far, where they’re moving, what the spatial relationships are on the field. We have surface data, we have environmental data, we have participation, and we have video,” Sills declared.

In his eyes, this comprehensive dataset allows the NFL to study injury mechanisms more rigorously than any other sports league.

In this day and age, injury-prevention efforts are quite multifaceted, he added. They typically require input from various experts, including nutritionists, behavioral health specialists, sport scientists, strength and conditioning coaches, performance staff and equipment managers.

For instance, equipment staff has been essential in developing concussion prevention programs through helmet testing and engineering, Sills said. The NFL has reconstructed more than 1,500 concussions using video and engineering models, mapping over 150 variables for each event. This has led to testing systems that rank helmet models based on injury risk.

The league has also rolled out education campaigns to shift players toward safer helmet choices — and now 98% of players wear only the high-safety models, Sills noted.

American football has long been criticized as a dangerous and injury-prone sport, but he believes it is well within the NFL’s ability to make the game both safer and more engaging. Sills thinks that data interoperability will continue to play a major role in this as the league continues to innovate its rules, equipment and protocols.

Jones, who went from being cut during the 2024 season by the lowly New York Giants to a fantastic reclamation story with the Indianapolis Colts, took a seat after suffering an Achilles injury. His reaction was telling. He knew all of the implications immediately. The Colts probably did too.

Indianapolis wasn't very competitive in Sunday's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars after Jones' injury, and that's not surprising. The Colts, now 8-5, fell behind the 9-4 Jaguars for the AFC South lead. Losing ground in the division is just the start of their problems. Colts head coach Steve Steichen wouldn't confirm Jones' injury is season-ending but said ""it doesn't look good,"" via Stephen Holder of ESPN. On Sunday evening, ESPN reported that Jones' injury was season-ending, and he will undergo surgery.

The injury is devastating on many levels. The Colts started the season 7-1, then lost three of four but were still in decent shape to at least make the playoffs. That isn't the case anymore. The Colts already lost Anthony Richardson to a weird orbital bone fracture in a pregame mishap, and they're down to sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard, who didn't have an NFL completion before Sunday.

It's a massive injury for Jones' career, the 2026 free-agency market and the short-term plans of the Colts. Jones is on a one-year deal. He had positioned himself to sign another big extension, or at least get the franchise tag for a huge payday. He played through a fracture in his fibula with the Colts leading the division, which was commendable due to the risk involved. An Achilles injury can take up to a full year to return from; Jones injuring it late in the season doesn't help the uncertainty with his free agency.

There was little doubt that Jones was going to be back with Indianapolis, whether on a long-term deal or the franchise tag. That's a reason the Colts traded two first-round draft picks to the New York Jets for cornerback Sauce Gardner. They felt they had an answer at quarterback and didn't need to worry about potentially drafting one. That all changed on one play Sunday.

The Jets also are affected by Jones' injury, considering that next year's first-round pick from Indianapolis is likely to become much more valuable.

Other teams are affected, too. The AFC South race changes dramatically and looks like a two-team race between the Jaguars and Texans the rest of the way. Unless Leonard is a rare rookie success story, the Colts are unlikely to even make the playoffs. That would open up a wild-card spot, perhaps for someone on the bubble like the Chiefs. It would be a story for the ages if Jones' injury set off a chain reaction that allowed the Chiefs to get in the playoffs when they normally wouldn't have.

Jones' status for the the 2026 season will be a big question heading into the offseason, and will affect his future for next season and beyond. There are other questions, like whether head coach Shane Steichen might be in trouble if the Colts go from 7-1 to out of the playoffs, though it would seem like he'd get the benefit of the doubt after losing his quarterback.

Jones had been writing a tremendous story through the first half of the season. He had been ridiculed as a bust and given up on by the Giants. Then he took advantage of a chance to win the Colts' starting quarterback job and through the first half of the season was on a remarkable run. One of the NFL's best stories turned into one of the more awful ones with one misstep.

Here are the rest of the winners and losers from Week 14 of the NFL season:

WINNERS

Green Bay Packers: The Packers still have Super Bowl dreams, but the path becomes a lot harder if they don’t win the NFC North.

The Packers took a big step toward that division championship on Sunday with a 28-21 win over the Chicago Bears. The Bears got aggressive on a fourth-and-1 play call inside the Packers’ 20-yard line in the final minute, faking a handoff and rolling quarterback Caleb Williams to his left. Packers corner Keisean Nixon had played it perfectly and picked off Williams’ pass to the end zone to seal the win.

The Packers played well against a game Bears team. Jordan Love threw for three touchdowns. Josh Jacobs ran for 86 yards and a touchdown. The Packers kept Williams to less than 200 yards passing. There’s a rematch in Chicago in a couple of weeks, and the Packers’ win Sunday gives them a chance to perhaps put away the Bears in the division race when the teams meet again.

Puka Nacua: It’s rare to see a receiver leave a cornerback in the dust off the line of scrimmage and then also Moss him for a touchdown on the same play. But Nacua is a unique player.

Advertisement

The highlight of a monster day from Nacua in the Los Angeles Rams’ 45-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals came in the third quarter. Nacua had a great move to burn the cornerback covering him, but Matthew Stafford underthrew him. No problem, as Nacua adjusted and caught it over the corner for a 31-yard touchdown.

Nacua finished with seven catches for 167 yards and two touchdowns. Nacua has had a fantastic season and the Rams bounced back quickly from a loss last week to the Panthers. The Seahawks won too, continuing to build momentum for a titanic Week 16 matchups between the two NFC West powers.

Mike Tomlin and Aaron Rodgers: A week after Pittsburgh Steelers fans were chanting for Tomlin to be fired and Rodgers found himself dealing with blood trickling down his nose after he was blasted on a hit from behind, both of them found redemption.

Advertisement

Rodgers had a throwback game and Tomlin got a win closer to extending his streak of never have a record under .500 with a huge 27-22 win at the Baltimore Ravens. Baltimore had its chances.

The Ravens had a touchdown to Isaiah Likely overturned because it was knocked out of his hands in the end zone before he completed the catch, and a last-minute drive ran out of time with the Ravens in Steelers territory. Lamar Jackson was sacked as he tried to get off a Hail Mary pass and time expired. The Ravens' miserable season continues, and now they're a game behind the Steelers in the AFC North standings.

Sunday might be remembered as Rodgers' best game in Pittsburgh. He had his first rushing touchdown since 2021 — complete with dusting off the old championship belt celebration — becoming the third 42-year-old player in NFL history to score a rushing touchdown (Tom Brady and Doug Flutie are the others). Rodgers also had some fantastic throws, and finished with 284 passing yards and a passing touchdown.

The win, coupled with the Bengals' loss, gets the Steelers much closer to a division championship. That might quiet the critics, at least temporarily.

Advertisement

Seahawks' claim as NFL's best team: Not that the Atlanta Falcons are much of an obstacle these days, but Seattle made sure it was never in danger of losing Sunday.

The Seahawks got an easy 37-9 win over the Falcons, who have to be questioning if head coach Raheem Morris will return for another season. Jaxon Smith-Njigba bounced back from a rare quiet day with two touchdowns. Seattle's defense was fantastic. The special teams got involved too, with Rashid Shaheed returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.

In this season without a dominant team, the Seahawks are as good of a pick as any as the best in the NFL. At very least, they kept the pressure on the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC West crown and likely top seed in the conference.

Christian Benford and Bills' defense: Buffalo was in trouble in the fourth quarter. The Bills fell behind early to the Cincinnati Bengals and it looked for most of the game like they'd take a bad loss at home.

Cornerback Christian Benford made a play that might have saved their season. On a cornerback blitz, Benford made a spectacular interception of a Joe Burrow pass. Benford returned it 63 yards for a touchdown, part of a flurry of 21 points in 4:30 for the Bills that helped them save a 39-34 win over the Bengals.

After Benford's big play, the Bills got another interception and turned that into a touchdown pass from Josh Allen to Jackson Hawes on a fourth down. It was part of Allen's big day with three passing touchdowns and another rushing.

The Bills are still unlikely to win the AFC East, but a wild-card spot might have been in jeopardy with a loss to the Bengals. The Bills' defense — and Allen — made sure they didn't take that damaging loss Sunday.

LOSERS

Geno Smith: Finally, Smith broke.

Playing behind the worst offensive line in the NFL has to take a toll on Smith. He had been sacked 46 times in 12 games before Sunday and hit way more often than that. It’s impressive he has stayed in the lineup with the amount of punishment he has taken.

Smith was sacked another three times Sunday against the Denver Broncos before he left the game at the end of the third quarter. Earlier in the game he had hurt his right hand but stayed in the contest. It didn’t matter that he missed the fourth quarter; the Broncos cruised to a 24-17 win in a game that was never that close (and a horrible beat for those who had Broncos as 7.5-point favorites). Denver improved to 11-2, tied for the top record in the AFC.

Advertisement

The Raiders are having a miserable season and Smith hasn’t been able to do much to save it. Las Vegas made the questionable decision to trade for the 35-year-old Smith in the offseason, even though they were not close to contending. They don’t have a good enough infrastructure around Smith to help him. Raiders fans are turning on Smith as the terrible season drags on. Smith has taken a beating, literally and metaphorically.

Shedeur Sanders haters: It's not a good week to be in the anti-Sanders crowd.

The Tennessee Titans are a bad football team, but that doesn't take away from what Sanders did Sunday. Sanders had 364 yards, three touchdowns passing and another one rushing. His final passing touchdown came with 1:03 to go, but an ill-conceived 2-point conversion failed and the Titans held on for their second win of the season, 31-29.

It's hard to blame Sanders for the loss. He was very good, including the final drive when the Browns needed a touchdown to have a shot at the tie.

Sanders had a big fall in the NFL Draft, and he has been the most talked-about fifth-round rookie pick ever. He draws extreme opinions, pro and con, and each of his starts is dissected unlike any other quarterback who started the preseason fourth on the team's depth chart. Sanders has looked good through his three starts and was fantastic Sunday. It's hard to argue with the results.

Advertisement

Tampa Bay Buccaneers: The Buccaneers had a clear path to perhaps win out, and easily win the NFC South. It's not so clear anymore.

The Buccaneers made things harder on themselves by falling 24-20 to the New Orleans Saints at home. They're now tied with the Carolina Panthers at 7-6 for first place in the NFC South. The Saints were 2-10 coming into Sunday's game. It was a miserable loss for Tampa Bay.

The problem Sunday was Tampa's offense. Baker Mayfield had his second straight quiet day since suffering a left shoulder injury, throwing for only 122 yards. The Saints did a good job limiting the Bucs' big plays, and when the Bucs needed a touchdown late in the game to take the lead, they went four-and-out. On fourth down Cade Otton was shopped just short of the first down on a catch and that was it for Tampa Bay's chances.

Advertisement

The Buccaneers still have two games left against the Panthers, and those should determine the division champion. If Tampa Bay comes up a game short of the playoffs, the Bucs will know which game cost them.

Jayden Daniels: Daniels had one of the greatest rookie seasons in NFL history. It was arguably the best for a rookie quarterback ever.

His second season has been a nightmare. He has sustained multiple injuries, including a dislocated left elbow that seemed like it might knock him out for the rest of the season. Daniels was able to return, but maybe the Washington Commanders should have let him sit.

Nothing good is happening for Daniels this season, and he hurt his elbow again in a 31-0 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, who had a nice bounceback from J.J. McCarthy with three touchdown passes. Daniels was replaced by Marcus Mariota. Daniels wasn't that effective before the injury, completing just 9 of 20 passes for 78 yards and an interception. Washington didn't have a point on the board when he was knocked out of the game. Injuries have been a big part of Daniels' season, but he hasn't been nearly as effective when he has been on the field.

Advertisement

It's a lost season for Daniels. The best hope for Washington is that he gets to the offseason without anything else bad happening to him.

The Jets' QB room: It has been a bad year to be a Jets quarterback.

Justin Fields was ineffective and benched, and he was inactive Sunday due to a knee injury. He wasn't available when Tyrod Taylor suffered a groin injury and left the game. Taylor's final line was 1-of-4 passing for 6 yards and an interception, which was a passer rating of 8.7.

With Fields out, Brady Cook came in for his first NFL action. He had 163 yards, two interceptions and no touchdown passes. Any Jets fan who sat through an ugly 34-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins should ask for a refund.

It has been an ugly season overall for the Jets. They have to be hoping for it all to end soon, and then figure out the quarterback position in the offseason.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LXiZF4inVrGTgNIdsnWweA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/fd560620-d3b5-11f0-91b7-c96d15be7946,N,,2025-12-07 22:58:27.453632

""It doesn't look good,"" Steichen said via ESPN.

Jones, 28, suffered the injury on a non-contact play while dropping back to pass late in the first quarter, appearing to lose his footing while throwing the football. The veteran quarterback fell to the wet turf and was seen growing his right lower leg, showing visible frustration by slamming his helmet multiple times before being helped to his feet and walked off the field.

Jones was already dealing with a fibula fracture -- believed to be a hairline fracture -- that he played through during the last two games, which limited his mobility in consecutive losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans. The former first-round pick was replaced by rookie Riley Leonard, who played meaningful snaps for the first time in his NFL career, with former No. 4 overall pick Anthony Richardson Sr. on injury reserve due to a facial injury.

Jones was in the middle of a career renaissance during his lone season with the Colts, having led Indianapolis to an 8-5 record in 13 starts while throwing for 3,101 yards, 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions on 261 of 384 passing.","https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/693602c804f6e6b4e5c15f52?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)",N,,2025-12-07 19:02:46.166906

The loss on the field, with quarterback Daniel Jones sustaining an Achilles injury feared to be season-ending, could be much worse.

""It hurts. It's a dagger,"" Colts cornerback Kenny Moore said at his locker after a 36-19 defeat.

""That was definitely a gut punch,"" said running back Jonathan Taylor, whose team has lost four of five after a 7-1 start. ""We've got to catch ourselves. You've got to find some way, somehow, to catch yourself. You're going into a free-fall, whatever it takes, individually and collectively, to put your foot down ... to say we're not going to continue to let this snowball.""

Only one NFL team in the past 25 years has opened 7-1 and missed the playoffs, but there's a real danger of that if Jones is lost as expected and the Colts need to rally around rookie Riley Leonard, the team's No. 3 quarterback. Leonard, who had thrown two NFL passes before Sunday, had 145 passing yards and a rushing touchdown in his first real NFL action.

""The biggest thing today for me was to walk off to the sidelines and have guys like [Colts guard] Quenton Nelson come up to me and say he believes in me,"" said Leonard, a sixth-round pick from Notre Dame. ""Everybody on the sideline was just very supportive. ... I still say they believe in me, so I take that and run with it.""

Two months into the season, Jones was the surprise star in the Colts' unexpected success, with 13 touchdowns against two interceptions in their 7-1 start. Indianapolis had survived the struggles of Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in 2023, pivoting to Jones on a one-year, $14 million contract. At the trade deadline, they went all-in, sending their next two first-round picks to the Jets for corner Sauce Gardner, who missed Sunday's game with a calf injury.

Richardson is on injured reserve with an eye injury and there's no timetable for his return, so instead of Jones, the Colts must try to collect themselves and rally around a rookie quarterback. Their final four opponents — the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars and Texans — represent a daunting stretch. All four teams have records as good as or better than the Colts', and all are vying for playoff positioning.

So what does coach Shane Steichen tell his players about bouncing back and having to play well in the final four games?

""Dang right we do,"" Steichen said on the podium after the loss. ""We've got to get this one cleaned up, and it's all about the next one. Shoot, we've got everything we want in front of us, you know? We've got to get this thing cleaned up and get ready for Seattle. We've got a big one on the road. That's the message right there.""

The Colts' problems had started long before Jones went down Sunday. Their lone win in the past four games was an overtime escape against the Falcons in Berlin, with one-score losses to the Steelers, Chiefs and Texans. They didn't start well against Jacksonville, giving up touchdowns on back-to-back drives for a 14-7 deficit before Jones went down with a non-contact injury. The Colts' defense gave up two more touchdowns by halftime, trailing 28-10 on the way to giving up a season-high 36 points.

""We've got to rally and be a brotherhood,"" Moore said. ""We've got to execute the things that we're talking about.""

Steichen was an NFL Coach of the Year candidate in the first half of the season, and now he's tasked with avoiding a nearly unprecedented collapse. Since the year 2000, the only team to start 7-1 and miss the playoffs was the 2012 Bears, who still managed to finish 10-6 and lose out on a tiebreaker. The Colts would need two wins to match that total, and there aren't any easy wins left on the schedule.

The Colts had a 68% chance of making the playoffs according to The Athletic's playoff simulator before Sunday's game, and the loss drops them to an even 50%, though it doesn't feel as easy as a coin flip. Two of those final four games are rematches of their last two divisional losses to the Texans and Jaguars. A 2-2 finish would likely get them in the playoffs, but to do that with a rookie quarterback and a team that's lost three straight and four out of five won't be easy.

""As you go through a season, you're going to go through some storms and some adversity,"" Steichen said. ""You've got to overcome those, and that's part of being a professional athlete and a coach, staying steady through that process, to keep believing and fighting like crazy. So that's what we're going to do. We're going to fight like crazy and believe, and we know that we've got a big one coming up on the road.""

Wherever you looked, it seemed as if playoff jockeying was on the line, and now the NFL landscape is remarkably different from what it was entering Sunday.

Most notably, the AFC South has been turned on its head with the Jacksonville Jaguars maintaining their standing atop the division with a win over the Indianapolis Colts. Meanwhile, Indy has far greater concerns than the result of Sunday's matchup, as Daniel Jones suffered an Achilles injury.

Outside of that matchup, Buffalo handled the Bengals in a key AFC contest, while the Steelers took back control of the AFC North with a win over Baltimore. There were also a number of upsets, namely the Titans notching their second win of the year on the road in Cleveland and the Saints heading into Tampa and defeating the Bucs.

It was your standard mayhem that unfolded in the NFL on Sunday, and of course, there will be plenty of takeaways from the slate. But which are concrete and which are baseless? Below, we'll determine just that by examining some of the top storylines from Week 14 and figure out which we need to take seriously and which we can cast aside as overreactions.

Colts season is over after Daniel Jones' Achilles injury

Overreactions or reality: Reality

The Colts are in a bad way. They are now 8-5 on the season, falling further behind the Jaguars in the division after a 36-19 loss in Jacksonville.

Beyond losing ground in the AFC South, Indy now may need to go the rest of the season without Daniel Jones. The veteran quarterback suffered an Achilles injury during the contest, and it doesn't look promising as he was in noticeable pain following the non-contact injury. If he's done for the year, the injury could bring the Colts down with it.

Indianapolis had rookie Riley Leonard as the backup quarterback on Sunday, and it'd be a tall task to ask him to win out down the stretch against teams like the Seahawks (Week 15), 49ers (Week 16), Jaguars (Week 17), and Texans (Week 18). The Colts are now at legitimate risk of falling out of the playoffs entirely. Even if they squeak in, they won't make much noise.

J.J. McCarthy reestablished himself as Vikings franchise QB

Overreactions or reality: Overreaction

McCarthy was lights out in Sunday's 31-0 win over the Commanders. The second-year quarterback completed 16 of his 23 throws for 163 yards and three touchdowns.

Naturally, some will look at this as McCarthy planting his flag against anyone who feared he may not be Minnesota's franchise quarterback. While it was an encouraging step for McCarthy, we're not ready to go so far as to say he's fully reestablished himself as the Vikings' cornerstone under center.

Washington's defense is among the worst in the NFL, so McCarthy wasn't facing the toughest resistance when he dropped back to pass. If he starts to stack outings like this together over the final four games, it'll calm the nerves of many around the franchise.

Bengals' fourth-quarter collapse dashes playoff hopes

Overreactions or reality: Reality

After falling to the Bills on Sunday, Cincinnati is 4-9 on the season and very much on the outside looking in at the playoffs.

This defeat was a heartbreaker for the Bengals, who held a 28-18 lead in the fourth quarter. However, back-to-back interceptions by Joe Burrow (including a pick-six) gave Buffalo the lead and paved the way to a win.

This loss now puts the Bengals three games behind the Steelers for first place in the AFC North, and they are even further behind in the wild-card race. Losing to Buffalo also gives the Bills the head-to-head tiebreaker, so while Cincinnati is not officially eliminated from the playoffs at this moment, they may as well be.

Saints should build around Tyler Shough going forward

Overreactions or reality: Overreaction

Tyler Shough led the Saints to one of the biggest upsets of the season after New Orleans went into Raymond James Stadium and took down the Buccaneers, 24-20.

The rookie quarterback completed 13 of his 20 passes for 144 yards and an interception, but did the bulk of his damage on the ground. Shough rushed seven times for 55 yards and two touchdowns in the win.

This is yet another strong showing from Shough, who is trying to play well enough that the Saints decide to build around him going forward instead of dipping their toes back into the NFL Draft this spring.

While Shough is doing his best to change that, I don't think we're there yet. The Saints should continue to evaluate their young quarterback over this final stretch, but also leave the door open to take a quarterback in the first round of the 2026 NFL Draft if one falls to them.

Ravens are going to miss the playoffs

Overreactions or reality: Reality

Baltimore was unable to hold serve at home against the Steelers, falling to its division rival 27-22. The loss now puts Pittsburgh back atop the AFC North and drops the Ravens out of the playoff picture entirely.

While these two teams still have one more matchup in Week 18, Baltimore is at real risk of missing the postseason despite their previous surge back into the conversation. The club has now lost two in a row and has a daunting final four games: at Bengals (Week 15), vs. Patriots (Week 16), at Packers (Week 17), and at Steelers (Week 18).",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/07/dbb76903-c92b-40f6-a16e-47e863c6e4a0/thumbnail/1200x675/a49bf35c2a5632b13e18fbc44032de2b/daniel-jones-imagn.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 19:02:50.296020

He proved it even more on Sunday, during the Colts' game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, making the conscious effort to rejoin his teammates on the sidelines after leaving the game with an Achilles injury.

Jones sustained the injury late in the first quarter of the 36-19 loss, falling to the ground after throwing a pass and clutching his right lower leg (his left leg has the injured fibula). He tried to get up and walk to the sideline, but sat down grimacing as trainers rushed out.

""Daniel's the toughest guy that I've ever been around by far in my life,"" rookie quarterback Riley Leonard, who replaced Jones behind center, said after the game. ""He's the most competitive person that I've ever met. So it's no surprise that he came back out there and cheered us on, and I remember going over to the sidelines and he was the first one to put the raincoat on me, first one to ask me what I see on that play and help me out and what to expect in certain situations. So it's just exactly who he is, whether he's playing or not. He's very consistent, win or loss, so I really respect that about him.""

""Any time he can be out there — again, that's just him being a great teammate,"" Steichen said. ""He has a huge injury. Some guys will sit in the locker room, he wants to be out there with his guys, and he went out there and showed support for Riley and the rest of the guys.

""I mean, the guy is as top notch as it gets. One of the best I've ever been around in a quarterback room — just his mentality, the way he goes about his business, the way he works, the way he treats people. Just phenomenal. Phenomenal.""

""He's our brother,"" offensive tackle Bernhard Raimann said. ""He's giving it all for us, and we do the same for him. That's the kind of brotherhood you want and need in the locker room. And obviously we're praying for his quick recovery. But yeah, I would do anything for the guy. He's our quarterback. But Riley stepped in too, and he's a great guy too. He's been learning, he's been studying and we'll do whatever needs to be done to focus on the next games and win the next games.""

""Just gotta find a way to keep fighting even though our leader went down,"" tight end Mo Alie-Cox said. ""Things happen in football, definitely feel bad for Daniel, things like that. But as an offense, we gotta let something like that not affect us during the stretch of the game, obviously next man up mentality.""

Leonard earned praise from Steichen, Raimann and Michael Pittman Jr. – to name just a few – for his effort on Sunday, despite the loss. The rookie has worked closely and consistently with Jones throughout the season, breaking down film and learning everything he can from the veteran quarterback, and it's clear his teammates recognize the effort he's put in.

Leonard finished the game 18-of-29 for 145 yards and an interception, and scrambled for his first NFL touchdown at the end of the game. It was the rookie's first meaningful minutes in the NFL; he briefly appeared in the final minutes of the Colts' Week 8 blowout over the Tennessee Titans. But the Notre Dame grad didn't look flustered or unsure of himself at any point, despite playing through pouring rain and having some of his best throws called back due to penalties.

""You see that he has talent, and the way he works, I think him and Dan are going to put in a lot of extra hours,"" Pittman said. ""I think that's the great thing about Daniel, is that his season isn't over because he's hurt, and I think he's going to do everything he can to help him out.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/j357wco9yygixrv82uyy,N,,2025-12-07 19:59:33.535560

Jones has been playing with a fractured fibula in his left leg. This injury appears to be to his other leg. The Colts announced shortly after he left the game that the injury was to his Achilles tendon.

Rookie backup Riley Leonard took over for Jones at quarterback. A sixth-round draft pick out of Notre Dame, Leonard had thrown two NFL passes prior to entering Sunday's game. He finished 18-for-29 passing for 145 yards and an interception in Indianapolis' 36-19 defeat in Jacksonville.

The injury is a potentially devastating blow to the Colts' season. Jones, a seventh-season NFL veteran, is having his best campaign as a pro in his first year with the Colts after joining them in the offseason following five-plus seasons as the starter for the New York Giants.

The former first-round pick had completed 67.9% of his passes for 253.4 yards per game with 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 12 starts for the Colts prior to Sunday's game. The Colts fell to 8-5 as the Jaguars (9-4) secured the top spot in the AFC South.

""Definitely a challenge, but a great challenge, one that comes with the job of being the backup quarterback,"" Cook said after the Dolphins' 34-10 victory at MetLife Stadium on a gray and chilly Sunday.
For the remainder of the first half, the Jets' defense tightened, holding Miami (6-7) to a field goal.
""Forcing the ball in the end zone, trying to make plays at the end of the half,"" Cook said.
I'm going to be ready to play, ready to win the Jets a football game.","Brady Cook confronted a daunting challenge when he entered Sunday's game against Miami late in the first quarter, with the field already tilted against the home team and the Jets trailing by 21-0.

The undrafted free agent (UDFA) out of Missouri, where he was a three-year starter against top competition in the SEC, entered the game at the 2:19 mark after Miami scored 3 TDs. Starter Tyrod Taylor was forced to leave the game with a groin injury after two offensive series.

""Definitely a challenge, but a great challenge, one that comes with the job of being the backup quarterback,"" Cook said after the Dolphins' 34-10 victory at MetLife Stadium on a gray and chilly Sunday. ""I felt ready to play today, and obviously didn't do enough to get a win.""

Cook was elevated to the active roster from the practice squad when Justin Fields, Taylor's backup the last two games, was ruled out with a knee injury. With few reps in practice and facing his baptism of fire in the NFL, Cook acknowledged some early jitters, a fumbled snap and putting a bit too much mustard on passes while also dealing with a couple of dropped passes.

""I think it was on my part, maybe just a lack of trust on the timing, not quite sure where everyone's going to be exactly when they're supposed to be there,"" said Cook, who finished the game hitting on 14-of-30 passes for 163 yards and a pair of INT. ""So I think you might actually put a little bit extra juice on it, and it might appear that way.""

With the Jets (3-10) forced to chase the game early, Isaiah Williams latched onto a punt and returned it 73 yards for a TD with 42 seconds left in the first quarter. For the remainder of the first half, the Jets' defense tightened, holding Miami (6-7) to a field goal. Before the end of the half, Cook and the offense found a bit of rhythm after he connected with John Metchie III for 10 yards and then got into the red zone when Williams was interfered with by Minkah Fitzpatrick on a long pass along the visitors' sideline. The play was good for 39 yards to Miami's 16.

Three plays later, with 37 seconds left in the half, Cook's pass intended for Metchie in the end zone came up short and was intercepted by Rasul Douglas.

""Forcing the ball in the end zone, trying to make plays at the end of the half,"" Cook said. ""Throw the ball away, find your check down.""

On the Jets' third possession of the second half, which spanned the third and fourth quarters, a fake punt that RB Isaiah Davis turned into a 20-yard gain kept the drive alive. In rapid fashion, Cook completed a 15-yard toss to rookie TD Mason Taylor (5 catches, 51 yards), a 17-yard pass to Andrew Beck to Miami's 24 and another one to Taylor for 13 yards. After Breece Hall ran 6 yards to the Dolphins' 7, Cook's pass to an open Metchie slid off his hands and could not be corralled.

""I think we just ... personally, I got to be better,"" Metchie said. ""We got to execute. We got to take advantage of all the looks and opportunities that we get out there, regardless of who's out there, regardless of who's throwing the ball.""

Cook was harried throughout the game by Miami's defensive front, which sacked him 6 times and Miami's second interception with 1:19 left to play sealed the result.

""It's always tough, I mean that's the nature of being a backup quarterback,"" HC Aaron Glenn said. ""But that's really any position, you're not going to get all the reps that you want to get during the week, but mentally you have to have yourself ready to play. And for the most part, I think he was. I thought Miami did a really good job of pressuring, they brought the house a couple of times on him, but we got to do a better job.""

For Cook, being thrown into the game with limited preparation was a challenge, not an excuse.

""To have this tape, this experience to watch, to build on, to learn from, however many reps I got today that's going to be huge for me,"" Cook said. ""I look forward to seeing the tape, building off of it.

""However the reps shake out this week, next week, I'm going to be ready to play, whether the starter, whether the backup, whether the third string, it doesn't matter. I'm going to be ready to play, ready to win the Jets a football game. I think it's going to depend on how the tape looks. You know, I'm going get to watch it here shortly, and I'm going to adjust, go back to work tomorrow, and we'll get it right.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/okhddhbmazwb6axjohj8,N,,2025-12-07 19:59:37.882216

Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones exited a monumental Week 14 matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars with a non-contact injury. The team later ruled him out for the rest of the game with an Achilles injury.

Jones appeared to lose his footing while planting to make a throw. He slammed his helmet while on the ground and later tried to limp off the field before falling down and requiring assistance.

The 28-year-old was playing through a fibula injury, throwing two touchdown passes apiece in losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans. Jones started, but couldn’t finish Sunday’s battle for control of the AFC South.

Dumped by the New York Giants last year, Jones resurrected his career with the Colts. They entered Sunday fourth in total offense behind the former No. 6 pick, who began the game with a career-high 101.3 quarterback rating and 8.1 yards per attempt.

His injury is a crushing blow for the AFC contender. Despite suffering consecutive losses, the Colts started Sunday two points behind the New England Patriots for the conference’s best scoring margin.

The Colts turned to another former Duke quarterback in Riley Leonard, who hadn’t completed an NFL pass before replacing Jones on Sunday. The sixth-round rookie finds himself at the center of a vital division battle between two 8-4 squads, and Indianapolis may need him during the final four games.

""Early signs say a serious injury,"" said Quinn, who added that Ertz will undergo imaging Monday.

Quarterback Jayden Daniels also left Sunday's game and didn't return after he was knocked to the ground following a third-quarter interception, landing on the left elbow that was dislocated Nov. 9. Quinn, though, said Daniels could have returned, but he opted to hold out the QB -- who was playing for the first time since his dislocation -- with the Vikings well in control.

Ertz was hurt with 2:10 left in the third quarter when he reached for a pass on second-and-11 and was hit in his leg by safety Jay Ward. Ertz had to be helped off the field and was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He was soon carted to the locker room, a towel draped over his head, and was ruled out with the knee injury early in the fourth.

""He's one of the linchpins of our team,"" receiver Terry McLaurin said. ""I ain't going to lie; it was tough for everybody.""

""It breaks my heart when you see a great one like him, an all-time great [get hurt],"" said tight end John Bates. ""He does everything the right way, the way things should be done. He's just a pro's pro.""

Ertz, 35, has 49 receptions for 493 yards and four touchdowns this season. Last week, Ertz moved into fifth place on the all-time receptions list for a tight end. He now has 825.

""This guy is one hell of a competitor in every way,"" Quinn said. ""To see the frustration and emotion with that, all of us are feeling that.""

Daniels was forced out with 8:24 remaining in the third quarter when he was hurt after he threw an interception and tried to chase down linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel. Cornerback Isaiah Rodgers blocked Daniels, who landed hard on his left elbow. He remained on the ground for a minute before sprinting to the bench. The medical stuff huddled around him and removed a padded protective device, before taking him to the medical tent.

Daniels was listed as questionable to return but remained on the sideline as Marcus Mariota took over at QB and finished out the game.

""As a team, at this point, we were off and felt like that was the right call,"" Quinn said of opting to keep Daniels from returning.

Daniels had been cleared for contact this week and was a full participant the final two days of practice. Both he and the Commanders wanted him to return, hoping to get a chance for him to play the final five games.

He still could play this season, according to Quinn.

""It's an important development time for him, but there's no zero-risk game,"" he said. ""You try to manage that. But for the development point of it, it's important.""

Daniels has finished only four of his seven starts this season and has been knocked out in each of the past three with injuries. He has been hurt three times -- a sprained knee cost him two games, a hamstring injury cost him one and the dislocated elbow cost him three.

Daniels completed 9 of 20 passes for 78 yards and an interception before exiting against the Vikings.

His teammates were appreciative of Daniels' mindset on the play in which he was hurt, even if it occurred during a season in which he's battled multiple injuries.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1207%2Fr1586427_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 18:00:26.882120

It was Daniels' first game back from dislocating that same left elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. After throwing an interception to Minnesota edge defender Andrew Van Ginkel, Daniels was trying to chase down Van Ginkel when Isaiah Rodgers (legally) came in and shoved Daniels to the ground.

Daniels was in clear pain leaving the field, and Marcus Mariota came in on the ensuing drive; Mariota's first drive also ended in an interception. Daniels entered the medical tent and emerged with a towel over his head and without the arm sleeve he had been wearing over his elbow. Washington ruled him questionable to return.

Daniels suffered a plethora of injuries this season. He sprained his knee in a Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers and missed the next two games. He came back and helped lead the Commanders to a Week 5 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, but Washington lost in Week 6 to the Chicago Bears, and in Week 7, Daniels suffered a hamstring strain in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He missed one game before returning in Week 9, when he suffered the dislocated elbow.

Daniels — who was just coming back from a left elbow injury — was the first player to leave Sunday. After being intercepted, he was shoved onto his already injured left elbow and left the contest.

That brought in backup Marcus Mariota, who — not long after coming into the game — sailed a pass to veteran tight end Zach Ertz downfield. Ertz had to leap to try and make the catch. While the ball hit him in the hands, Ertz couldn't come up with the reception. Before he hit the ground, Ertz was hit directly in the knee area by Minnesota Vikings safety Jay Ward.

Content warning: Video of the injury is gruesome.

Ertz had to be helped off the field. He was emotional as he was carted back to the locker room.

The Commanders quickly ruled Ertz out for the rest of the game due to a knee injury.

After the contest, Commanders coach Dan Quinn said Ertz is feared to have torn his ACL, which explained his emotional response before being carted off the field. Ertz will undergo additional testing to confirm the injury. If he tore his ACL, Ertz would miss the rest of the 2025 NFL season.

The 35-year-old Ertz was in the midst of another solid season with the Commanders. While he's no longer a huge threat for 1,000-yard seasons, Ertz emerged as a reliable red-zone target for Daniels last season.

That connection appeared to continue this season, as Ertz caught touchdowns in each of the first two games, which were started by Daniels. Ertz then went on a scoring drought with Daniels sidelined by a knee injury. But he caught touchdowns in Daniels' next two starts.

Prior to Week 14, Ertz had 49 receptions for 493 yards and four scores, all of which came in games started by Daniels.

An injury to Jones is a haymaker of a blow to a Colts team that was already reeling.
The loss of Jones clearly hit the Indianapolis locker room hard on Sunday.","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The Colts fear that starting quarterback Daniel Jones will miss the rest of the season with the Achilles injury he suffered early in Sunday’s 36-19 loss to the Jaguars.

Jones went down after releasing a throw, without taking a hit, and immediately reached for a right ankle.

Visibly upset, Jones was seen slamming his helmet to the ground and wasn’t able to leave the field without help from trainers. Doctors briefly examined Jones, then took him to the locker room and declared him out for the game immediately.

“Daniel Jones has an Achilles,” Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said. “Could be season ending. I don’t have the full details on it, but we’ll get more clarity on that.”

Steichen typically does not reveal details on injuries after games.

But he acknowledged that the early medical assessment of Jones’ Achilles injury indicated that the team fears the worst.

“Not for sure, but it’s not looking good,” Steichen said.

An injury to Jones is a haymaker of a blow to a Colts team that was already reeling.

Indianapolis lost its 11th straight road game to the Jaguars, a defeat that gives the Colts four losses in their last five games, and the injury to Jones leaves Indianapolis in a difficult spot. The Colts had built themselves around Jones’ preparation this season.

The loss of Jones clearly hit the Indianapolis locker room hard on Sunday.

Jones has completed 68% of his passes for 3,101 yards, 8.1 yards per attempt, 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions this season, directing a Colts offense that got off to a fast start before struggling over the last month.

Without Jones — and without backup Anthony Richardson, who remains on injured reserve after undergoing surgery on his orbital bone following a freak pregame accident with a resistance band before the team’s win over Arizona — the Colts had to turn to sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard for the rest of the game Sunday.

“It’s obviously a tough situation to be in when your starting quarterback goes down,” Steichen said. “Any time you lose a guy that puts in so much work and so much effort, is always there for his team and is showing up with the fibula injury, goes out there and freaking plays, just so much respect for him.”

Jones returned to the sidelines in the second half, wearing a boot on his right foot and helping Leonard quarterback in his place.

“He was the first one to put the raincoat on me, the first one to ask me what I see on that play and help me out, what to expect on certain situations,” Leonard said. “It’s exactly who he is. He’s very consistent, win or loss.”

The Colts have rallied around Jones’ preparation and leadership this season.

Jones tried to keep his presence on the sideline Sunday.

“That’s him being a great teammate,” Steichen said. “He has a huge injury. Some guys would sit in the locker room; he wants to be out there with his guys.”

Unfortunately, it sounds like Jones may be done this season.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PIND/87658467007-2250563229.jpg?crop=3743,2106,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-07 19:59:41.580669

A real concussion protocol, at minimum, focused on centering a player's safety would rule players out the moment they exhibited any concussion symptoms.","We knew the NFL's supposedly rigid concussion protocol — ostensibly instituted to protect NFL players from themselves after suffering head injuries — was a farce a long time ago. But the way the Bengals handled Tee Higgins suffering an obvious concussion during Sunday's matchup against the Buffalo Bills took the league's very soft principle and made an open mockery of it.

Then again, I'm pretty confident the NFL doesn't care all that much outside of the optics.

After slamming his head onto the turf on a catch attempt in the first half, Higgins went into concussion protocol and was evaluated in the Bengals' blue medical tent. He was cleared and allowed to return to the game, even as someone who had missed Cincinnati's recent Thanksgiving game specifically because of a concussion, which has a high chance of recurrence in the immediate aftermath.

Later, when Higgins bobbled a catch over the middle, he hit his head on the turf again. It was obvious Higgins was still dealing with the effects of the first hit. But the NFL's fake and complete sham of a concussion protocol let him come back into the game and take another needless shot when he was already vulnerable:

For reference, the NFL's concussion protocol mid-game is pretty simple. Once a player shows symptoms of a concussion, they are evaluated by a person who ""spotted"" them for symptoms of a head injury. Provided they don't have any ""no-go"" symptoms, an apparent unaffiliated doctor or athletic trainer will clear them to return to the game. But this presumes that said medical professional will always act in good faith and that the player themselves won't have any direct input into their return to the field (meaning they could, in theory, try to hide their symptoms so they can still play).

A real concussion protocol, at minimum, focused on centering a player's safety would rule players out the moment they exhibited any concussion symptoms. You cannot return to a game once you show signs of a head injury. Full stop. This sentiment should go double for a guy like Higgins, who was actively recovering from another concussion only a couple of weeks ago!

Don't let the NFL lie to you. It still does not care about head injuries. It only wants you to think it does. Higgins' situation on Sunday is a perfect example of this dynamic.","https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/SFTW/87659836007-usatsi-27765616.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-07 19:59:47.132255

It was very nearly an interception for Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who had a pass deflected in the fourth quarter. Miraculously, despite a broken wrist, Rodgers managed to reel it back in despite an interception being called on the field. Upon review, officials deemed that Rodgers was down with possession of the ball, as his knee hit the ground before giving it up to a defender.

Joe Burrow, WYD?!

Burrow had just thrown a 63-yard pick 6 to Christian Benford to give the Buffalo Bills a 32-28 lead in the fourth quarter ... and followed it up with another interception on his next pass attempt. The Bills regain possession of the ball at Cincinnati's 39-yard line.

Burrow's second interception of the game came on a pass deflection, reeled in by Bills defensive end AJ Epenesa for his second pick of the season.

Minnesota dominated from the start, beating Washington, 31-0. Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy passed for 163 yards and three touchdowns in the game. Jordan Mason had a rushing touchdown and 52 yards on the ground while Aaron Jones Sr. rushed for 76 yards.

This was the first time Washington had been shut out since 2019 and their worst shutout since Week 8 of 2005 against the New York Giants, 36-0.

Washington couldn't get anything going in this game, and to add insult to injury, quarterback Jayden Daniels left the game as he seemed to re-injure his left elbow. He passed for 78 yards and an interception before leaving the game. Marcus Mariota took over and passed for 30 yards and a touchdown. Running backs Chris Rodriguez Jr. and Jacory Croskey-Merritt combined for 84 yards on the ground.

Have a game, rookie!

26-year-old rookie Tyler Shough has regained the lead for the New Orleans Saints in Week 14 thanks to his second rushing touchdown of the day — a stunning score from 13 yards out. He somehow avoided what should have been a sack from the Buccaneers, bouncing toward the left for the score.

With just over eight minutes to go in the fourth quarter, the Saints hold a 24-17 lead over the Buccaneers as Tampa Bay looks to gain a lead in the division with a win in Week 14.

With time still left to go in the early window, Shough sits as the QB4 in Yahoo Fantasy leagues this week with 21.4 points.

Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen will not allow this game to get away as he takes it 40 yards on the ground to keep the Bills in it against the Bengals. The Bills trail the Bengals 28-25. This was the longest rushing TD of Allen's career, with his previous high coming in 2022 (36 yards).

It's been a slow 2025 season for Titans running back Tony Pollard — but things have opened up for him in Week 14. He scored his second touchdown of the day late in the third quarter, exploding up the middle for 35 yards for six.

With the successful PAT from Joey Slye, the Titans take a 21-17 lead over the Cleveland Browns heading into the fourth quarter.

Pollard had just two rushing touchdowns this season prior to Week 14. This marks his first multi-touchdown rushing game since Week 1 of the 2023 season with the Dallas Cowboys.

Washington Commanders veteran tight end Zach Ertz was carted off the field following a low hit resulting in a leg injury. Based on the severity of the hit and the look of the potential injury, it seems that the hit could have ended Ertz's season.

Content warning. The play can be seen here.

The Ravens are staying alive Sunday, as Lamar Jackson throws his first passing touchdown since Nov. 9 to TE Isaiah Likely, following up a rushing touchdown earlier in the game.

The touchdown was set up by an explosive 55-yard run from running back Keaton Mitchell, which brought the Ravens inside Pittsburgh's 10.

Despite his two scores, it's been an up-and-down contest for Jackson so far, going 8-of-14 for 68 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception, currently with a 64.0 NFL passer rating. Zay Flowers currently sits as the team's leading receiver, having caught three of seven targets for 46 receiving yards.

Bills running back James Cook fumbles for the second time in the same drive, but the second time, the Bengals recover in the end zone and take over possession.

On an earlier play in the drive, Cook broke a long run, and as he dove for the end zone, the ball was knocked out by a Bengals defender but went out of bounds around the one-yard line. Cincinnati leads Buffalo 21-18 in the third quarter.

Seahawks WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba continues to bolster his campaign for Offensive Player of the Year, scoring his ninth touchdown of the season on Sunday.

JSN currently leads the league with 1,423 receiving yards and a 128.6 NFL passer rating when targeted, averaging 16.2 yards per reception. He currently leads the team with 88 receiving yards and would manage his ninth game of 100-plus receiving yards this season with another 12 in Week 14.

Weather may just be becoming a factor in the Saints-Bucs Week 14 matchup, as rain pours down ... and Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield makes a devastating interception to set the Saints up for the go-ahead touchdown — a 33-yard rushing touchdown from 26-year-old rookie quarterback Tyler Shough.

That marks the first rushing touchdown of Shough's career, making his fifth career start Sunday as New Orleans looks to evaluate their future at the position. The Saints selected Shough with the 40th overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3ELiNcpiGNqacmFaJ_j.hg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/b9902310-d39e-11f0-aefb-7eeb125fdcc5,N,,2025-12-07 16:00:58.796532

The Colts were in a fight for the AFC South division as Jones was putting together an MVP-like season to get the team there. The two teams were tied at the top of the division with Sunday’s game becoming important for the playoff race.

Jones had 3,041 passing yards and 19 touchdown passes with Indianapolis at 8-4 on the season. The injury upends Jones’ quest for an MVP and a Comeback Player of the Year award.

He joined the Colts as a free agent after he finished the 2024 season with the Minnesota Vikings. The New York Giants released him in the middle of the year, deciding to embark on a new journey with a new quarterback.

Daniels' injury occurred after he threw a fourth-down interception. The quarterback was trying to chase down the intercepting player, Andrew Van Ginkel, when Vikings cornerback Isaiah Rodgers came and threw a block on him.

Daniels went tumbling to the ground as a result of the block. As he did, he hit his left elbow – which he previously dislocated in Week 9 – on the ground. He briefly remained hunched over in pain on the field before making his way back to the sideline.

Originally, Daniels sat on the bench while receiving medical attention. Before long, he had the brace on his left elbow removed and made his way to the blue medical tent.

Jayden Daniels injury update

Daniels was officially deemed ""questionable"" to return by the Commanders because of his elbow injury.

Daniels remained in the medical tent on Washington's first drive after his injury. He eventually exited the tent wearing a towel on his head and without a wrap on his injured arm.

Marcus Mariota checked into the game to replace Daniels. The veteran threw an interception on his first drive in place of the second-year quarterback.

Now the running back is dealing with an injury that puts his availability in doubt. Achane exited Week 14 with a rib injury and headed to the locker room prior to halftime.

In many ways, Achane is the engine that powers Mike McDaniel's offense. The Dolphins are trying to keep their slim playoff hopes alive, but losing the star running back certainly won't help their ability to compete going forward.

Here's the latest on Achane.

De'Von Achane injury update

Achane is questionable to return with a rib injury.

The running back departed after being evaluated in the blue medical tent. Achane was carving up the New York Jets defense in the first half, totaling 105 scrimmage yards and a touchdown on just eight touches.

Miami jumped out to a 21-7 lead by the end of the first quarter, remaining in complete control on the road against the rival Jets.

The 5-7 Dolphins entered Week 14 with a 1% chance of making the playoffs, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. It remains to be seen if that will play a part in how Miami handles the injury to their star.

Jaylen Wright

Achane has been a do-it-all running back for the Dolphins, making him the clear RB1 atop the depth chart.

The rookie, Gordon, leapfrogged Wright towards the end of the preseason. A more physical back, the Oklahoma State product doesn't typically see a lot of work, having recorded just 53 carries this season.

Wright has been buried on the depth chart, totaling just 18 carries in his second season.

Jones dropped back to throw late in the first quarter and seemed to lose his footing as he delivered the throw. He fell to the wet turf and immediately grabbed his right lower leg area. He has also been dealing a fibula fracture in his left leg over the past several weeks.

Jones proceeded to slam his helmet to the turf multiple times before he was helped to his feet and walked gingerly to the injury tent. A few minutes later, he walked slowly to the locker room and was ruled out of the game.

Jones had played the past two games with his fibula injury (believed to be a hairline fracture), which had restricted his mobility in losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans. He seemed to be moving more fluidly on Sunday before sustaining his Achilles injury, even scrambling for a first down early in the game.

The injury leaves the Colts in an extremely difficult situation given the facial injury that forced backup and 2023 first-round choice Anthony Richardson Sr. to injured reserve. Sixth-round pick Riley Leonard, a rookie from Notre Dame, replaced Jones in the lineup, playing the first meaningful snaps of his career.

Facing third-and-8 from Indianapolis’ 42-yard line, Jones dropped back to pass, but after throwing a 7-yard pass to wide receiver Alec Pierce, he immediately fell to the ground and clutched at his right Achilles. The Colts ruled him out a short while later.

Colts running back Jonathan Taylor was flagged for a chop block, which negated the play, but while the refs sorted out the penalty, Jones remained down. He slammed his helmet on the ground in frustration before eventually getting up and limping over to the sideline. Jones was briefly looked at in the medical tent, dropping his head into his hands as he hopped on the table, before heading back to the locker room and being quickly ruled out due to an Achilles injury.

Riley Leonard replaced Jones at quarterback. The rookie, a sixth-round pick in the 2025 draft, had logged just six snaps and two pass attempts (zero completions) this season entering Sunday’s contest. Leonard took over the QB2 role in Week 6 after Anthony Richardson Sr., the 2023 No. 4 pick, suffered an orbital fracture during a pregame warmup accident.

If Jones is indeed out for the season due to a right Achilles injury, it would be a devastating blow for the Colts. Jones, who signed a one-year, $14 million deal to join Indianapolis in free agency, had been a revelation since winning the starting job over Richardson. He powered the Colts to a 7-1 start, and The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reported that the Colts and Jones’ representatives were set to begin contract extension talks after the season. Indianapolis believed in Jones so much that it traded wide receiver AD Mitchell and its next two first-round picks — essentially two chances to draft another quarterback — to the Jets to acquire two-time, first-team All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner. Gardner went down last week with a left calf injury and is out indefinitely.

Jones had already been playing through a fractured left fibula, which the Colts believed would heal as the season went on. The QB was moving better Sunday than he had in previous weeks, but his day was cut short due to the Achilles injury, which could have far-reaching implications not only for Jones but the future of the Colts franchise.

The only other quarterback on the Colts’ roster is third-stringer Brett Rypien, whom the team signed after Richardson was placed on injured reserve. However, since Indianapolis did not call Rypien up from the practice squad to the active roster for Sunday’s game, he can not step in if Leonard were to get hurt. The Colts’ emergency QB in this scenario is lefty tight end Tyler Warren, who played QB in high school.

Looking beyond Sunday, Colts coach Shane Steichen kept the door open for Richardson to return later this season. While he didn’t have a timeline, he said the team is “hopeful” Richardson will return to the team this season.

“He’s just resting his eye right now, and when that time comes, I’ll let you guys know for sure,” Steichen said recently. “Obviously, anytime you’re dealing with an eye, you want to make sure he’s got full vision in that eye.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/07134726/GettyImages-2250558506-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-07 15:00:26.336062

The Indianapolis Colts quarterback is already dealing with a fractured fibula. Now, he's dealing with a new injury in Week 14. While the left leg was the one with the fracture, Jones appeared to suffer a non-contact injury to his right Achilles on a rainy day in Jacksonville.

In the midst of a playoff race, Indianapolis can ill afford to lose the quarterback that has been key to their success. And for Jones, it's a tough reality to face after reviving his career with the Colts.

Here's the latest on Jones.

Daniel Jones injury update

Jones has been ruled out with an Achilles injury.

The quarterback limped to the locker room after being evaluated in the blue medical tent with a non-contact right leg injury.

It wasn't a good-looking scene in Jacksonville as Jones fell to the ground after a throw on third down. He immediately reached for his right calf, slamming his helmet on the field as trainers evaluated the injury.

Riley Leonard came into the game to replace Jones.

Colts QB depth chart

Daniel Jones

Riley Leonard

The Colts are rolling with just two healthy quarterbacks on their active roster. Jones has owned the QB1 since winning the competition over Anthony Richardson during the offseason.

Richardson has been on injured reserve with an orbital fracture, leaving Leonard as the other remaining signal caller on the roster.

Leonard was drafted by the Colts in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. The Notre Dame product made a brief cameo appearance on Oct. 26 against the Tennessee Titans, but hasn't seen any other game action in his rookie season.

Brett Rypien is on the Indianapolis practice squad, but he was not elevated to the active roster for Week 14. If Leonard falls victim to injury, the Colts will be without a traditional quarterback the rest of the way.

This marks his first career touchdown.","Colts quarterback Daniel Jones has promptly been ruled out with an Achilles injury in Week 14, meaning it's rookie Riley Leonard the rest of the way.

Leonard was a sixth-round selection out of Notre Dame, throwing for 2,861 yards, 21 touchdowns and 8 interceptions in his final season with the Irish after spending the three years of his collegiate career at Duke. Leonard added another 906 rushing yards and 17 touchdowns on the ground.

It's brutal news for Jones, amidst a potential Comeback Player of the Year campaign in his first year with the Indianapolis Colts. His 19 passing touchdowns marked the second most of his career since his rookie season with the New York Giants.

Jones entered this game with a career-high 67.9% completion rate and 11.9 yards per completion average. Jones entered the week leading the league in successful pass rate, per Pro Football Reference.

The Colts and Jaguars are fighting for sole possession of first place in the AFC South with a win in Week 14.

Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones is down with what appears to be a right lower-leg injury.

Jones was able to stand up initially after the play but was unable to make his way off the field without assistance, slamming his helmet into the field several times before making his way off with trainers. He is now in the blue medical tent.

He'll be replaced with Riley Leonard, as former first-round pick Anthony Richardson remains on injured reserve after suffering an orbital fracture in pre-game warmups in a fluke accident back in Week 6.

Jakobi Meyers continues to prove himself worthy of Jacksonville's mid-season trade to acquire him.

He's now had four consecutive games with 50-plus yards or a touchdown, with at least 41 receiving yards in each of his four games with the Jaguars leading up to Week 14.

After punting on the opening drive, Jacksonville has now scored on back-to-back drives, with Trevor Lawrence having gone 7-of-9 for 107 passing yards and a touchdown. Second-year WR Brian Thomas Jr. leads the team with 57 receiving yards in his second game returning from injury after missing several games with an ankle injury.

The New Orleans Saints are on the board early!

Set up with a strong 54-yard return from WR Mason Tipton, the Saints needed just 2:27 before scoring the first touchdown of the day — a three-yard run up the middle from RB Devin Neal.

Neal, a sixth-round rookie, made his first career start in Week 13, but had a modest day with just 47 rushing yards. He gets the start today in place of Alvin Kamara, who's been out with knee and ankle injuries and didn't practice ahead of Week 14.

""Last week, we know, Sauce suffered a calf strain,"" Rapoport said on Sunday. ""Considered to be more mild than anything else, and especially if you consider how absolutely terrible it looked, it seems like it's way better than anticipated. My understanding is this week he progressed a lot. He is feeling good.

""Now, not going to play today (against Jacksonville), probably not going to play next week, but December 22nd against the 49ers is the first realistic opportunity for Sauce to be out there. If not, December 28th against the Jags again, also a possibility. No IR for Sauce was good news.""

Gardner suffered the injury on the second defensive play of the Colts' Week 14 matchup with the Houston Texans.

In Gardner's first two games with the Colts, he has allowed five receptions on 10 targets for 38 yards with two pass breakups. He's also made 12 tackles.

Rookie running back Dylan Sampson, rookie defensive tackle Mason Graham and defensive tackle Mike Hall Jr. are also active despite having been listed as questionable.","J.J. McCarthy’s angst, or lack thereof. Can he just play? Is he cringing after throws, trying to ensure every pass and decision is perfect? Or can he center himself and let it rip? O’Connell talked about all of this earlier this week and now says, “Let’s just make the throws. Let’s just throw and catch.”

Perhaps doing that will allow McCarthy’s arm talent to take over. Maybe his lower body mechanics will still falter, yet he’ll be able to make up for it with feel and adaptability. Is it likely? I’m not so sure. Is it possible? Yes. McCarthy has five games until 2026 to prove he can stay healthy and make the throws required in NFL games. Consistency for four quarters is the goal. Even if the Commanders’ defense may be more capable than the numbers suggest, this is an opponent that presents a better opportunity than most.

BALTIMORE — When the Steelers traded George Pickens this offseason, general manager Omar Khan insisted that the team had enough talent and depth at the position. Part of the reason Khan felt that way was because he expected Roman Wilson to take a big step in Year 2.

Thirteen weeks later, Wilson is inactive for the most important game of the season in Baltimore, as two 6-6 teams clash with the lead in the AFC North on the line. The move makes way for Adam Thielen (who was claimed off waivers this week) and Marquez Valdes-Scantling (who was promoted from the practice squad for the first time as a Steeler).

While the roster decision was necessary, it's another reminder of how poor player evaluation and roster construction put the Steelers in their current situation. It comes just one week after Darius Slay, who the Steelers believed could help lock down anyone in man coverage, was inactive and then waived.

Last season, the Steelers’ receiver depth chart featured Pickens at the top — a huge gap — and then everyone else. The Steelers shuffled some pieces at the top by acquiring Metcalf and dealing Pickens, but it still looked like they had one legitimate WR1 and then a bunch of uncertainty.

“I know people make comparison to last year, but it’s not even close to being the same,” Khan said in May. “We made the investment in DK. We’ve had another year with some of the young guys, gotten to know them, watch them develop. We added Robert Woods. Roman [Wilson's] healthy. Seeing him the last couple of weeks out here and how he’s doing. We saw how he was progressing at the end of last year. Obviously, he didn’t have a chance to get on the field, but there was some excitement there. We have a good group.”

Woods didn’t even make the team. Wilson, who has 12 receptions for 166 yards, hasn’t taken a significant step forward. And Calvin Austin III has only 17 receptions for 180 yards, one year after he posted 36 catches for 548.

As quarterback Aaron Rodgers has criticized this group for failing to create enough separation, the Steelers have made some moves recently to reshape the position. While the changes make a difference or will it be too little, too late?

The Steelers’ other inactive players are: QB Will Howard (3rd QB), S Kyle Dugger, OL Calvin Anderson, DT Brodric Martin-Rhodes, WR Ke'Shawn Williams and DT Derrick Harmon.

Sole possession of first place in the AFC South is at stake in the first game between the 8-4 Jaguars and Colts this month. No Parker Washington for the Jaguars in a windswept, sodden Jacksonville. A lightning delay is possible…

But DE Travon Walker returns for the NFL’s No. 1 run defense, which should prove handy against Jonathan Taylor. This is a step up in class for Jacksonville, who are yet to play a top 10 rushing offense.

The Colts last won in Jacksonville in September 2014, when quarterback Chad Henne was benched for Blake Bortles in a 44-17 defeat.

Things to watch: Trevor Lawrence (as always). Not only if he takes care of the football, but his ability to run.

Brian Thomas Jr. With Washington out, can he stretch the field (and hold on to the football)?

And the pass rush. Can the returning Arik Armstead and Walker pressure the hampered Daniel Jones?

Jaguars inactives:

WR Parker Washington

S Andrew Wingard

LB Yasir Abdullah

OL Walker Little

TE Johnny Mundt

DL Emmanuel Ogbah

The Browns are shorthanded on their offensive line today due to injury, but they have defensive ends Alex Wright and Isaiah McGuire healthy and active.

Wright missed the last two games with a quad injury, and McGuire had been questionable due to a knee injury. Rookie running back Dylan Sampson, rookie defensive tackle Mason Graham and defensive tackle Mike Hall Jr. are also active despite having been listed as questionable.

The big changes are on the offensive line, where KT Leveston takes over at right tackle for Jack Conklin (concussion) and Teven Jenkins replaces Wyatt Teller (calf) at right guard. Jenkins makes his first start for the Browns after alternating series with Teller last week. The Browns are slated to start their eighth different offensive line combination this season.

Defensive end Myles Garrett enters the game with 19 sacks, 3.5 from tying the single-season record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt. Nobody's been sacked more this season than Titans rookie Cam Ward (48), and Garrett is on a tear. Garrett already has three games this season of at least three sacks; he had four last month vs. the Ravens and five in October at New England.

Expect to see 1-11 Tennessee's game plan revolve around not letting Garrett to the record. The Browns have been outstanding on defense all season and had 10 sacks, one short of a franchise record, in Week 12 at Las Vegas.

Garrett's pursuit of history and rookie Shedeur Sanders' quest to put himself in the team's long-term plans are the two most compelling storylines surrounding the 3-9 Browns. Sanders makes his third start today after the Browns managed just one touchdown in last week's 26-8 loss to the 49ers.

Sanders' 34-yard touchdown pass to rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. gave Cleveland its only score last week in a game plan that was centered around the running of rookie Quinshon Judkins. Expect another run-heavy plan today with another makeshift offensive line in place. Fannin has been Sanders' favorite target and there's no reason to expect that to change when the Browns go to the air.

Judkins ran 23 times for 91 yards last week. Judkins, Fannin, Graham and linebacker Carson Schwesinger headline an outstanding Cleveland rookie class. Schwesinger is the favorite to win NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and has consistently made big plays while opposing offenses devote extra attention to Garrett and defensive tackle Maliek Collins, who had 6.5 sacks before suffering a season-ending quad injury last week. Both Hall and veteran Shelby Harris will see increased snaps in Collins' absence.

Quarterback Justin Fields is out with a knee injury, as expected, for Jets-Dolphins so undrafted rookie Brady Cook — signed to the active roster off the practice squad on Saturday — will be the No. 2 quarterback behind Tyrod Taylor. Fields reported knee soreness this week and missed Friday's practice — this coming a week after Fields told reporters he wasn't exactly keen on being a ""Wildcat"" quarterback option for the Jets offense because of the risk of injury. It's fair to wonder if Fields has played his last game in a Jets uniform.

And the Jets will likely, at some point, get a chance to see what they have in Cook as a potential future backup option. Taylor has a history of injury issues and there's no guarantee he'll stay healthy long enough to start each of the five remaining games. Cook has been getting more No. 2 reps in practice this week as a result.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/xzBsRZARiMQs_O7v3TBSC1OdV_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-07 13:00:45.866297

For the Buccaneers, that means the absence of All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs, who suffered an oblique injury in last week's win over the Arizona Cardinals. Wirfs' only practice of the week was a limited one on Friday and he was listed as questionable on the Bucs' Friday injury report. Wirfs was also sidelined for the first three games of the 2025 season after undergoing knee surgery in July.

Meanwhile, the Saints will be without their starting right tackle, 2024 first-round pick Taliese Fuaga. Like Wirfs, Fuaga has also missed three other games this season due to back and knee issues. He was ruled out on Friday by the Saints due to a new ankle injury.

The Buccaneers and Saints submitted their list of inactives at 11:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, 90 minutes before the scheduled kickoff of their Week 14 meeting at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. The Buccaneers elevated safety Marcus Banks from their practice squad for the game and thus had to name six inactives to get down to the game-day limit of 48. The Saints elevated wide receiver Kevin Austin and kicker Charlie Smyth from their practice squad and were required to name seven players inactive.

In addition to the absence of Fuaga, the Saints will also play Sunday's game without running back Alvin Kamara and starting safety Justin Reid, both of whom are dealing with knee issues.

Biggest NFL Week 14 Injuries:

Daniel Jones Injury Update

Colts QB Daniel Jones hobbled to the locker room in the first half on Sunday after suffering a non-contact injury to his left leg.

Jones has been dealing with a stress fracture in his right leg in recent weeks, but has played through the pain thanks to a 3D-printed brace.

Riley Leonard replaced Jones at quarterback.

CeeDee Lamb Injury Update

Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb suffered a concussion when he came down hard on the turf attempting to make a catch on Thursday night.

Coach Brian Schottenheimer said Lamb “had a good day” on Friday, but the receiver still has to go through the concussion protocol.

He will get a few more days than usual to clear the protocol with the Cowboys next playing on December 14, but it is not a given he is ready to go by then.

George Pickens will take back over as the clear No. 1 target if Lamb is forced to sit out a game.

Let’s examine where smart money is leaning for a trio of matchups using our VSiN NFL Betting Splits, which are updated every 5 minutes and come directly from DraftKings and Circa Sports.

1 p.m. ET: Miami Dolphins (-2.5, 41.5) at New York Jets

The Dolphins (5-7) have won three games in a row and just held off the Saints 21-17 but failed to cover as 5.5-point home favorites. On the other hand, the Jets (3-9) just snapped a two-game losing skid with a 27-24 win over the Falcons, winning outright as 3-point home dogs.

This line opened with Miami listed as a 3-point road favorite.

The public is happy to lay the short chalk with the surging Dolphins. However, despite receiving 63% of spread bets at DraftKings we’ve seen Miami fall from -3 to -2.5.

Why would the oddsmakers drop the line and make it easier for the public to cover when they’re already backing the Dolphins to begin with? Because respected wiseguy action has jumped on the Jets plus the points, triggering sharp reverse line movement in their favor.

New York has betting system value as a divisional dog, with the built in familiarity leveling the playing field and benefiting the team getting points.

Divisional dogs getting 3-points or less are 10-8 ATS (56%) with a 7% ROI this season and 99-80 ATS (55%) with a 7% ROI since 2020.

Tyrod Taylor is 3-0 ATS this season and 36-21 ATS (63%) with a 21% ROI in his career, including 24-12 ATS (67%) with a 26% ROI as a dog.

The Jets have additional betting system value as a dog in a low total game (41.5), with the fewer amount of expected points scored making it harder for the favorite to cover the number.

The Dolphins are 4-3 at home this season but just 1-4 on the road. Miami is also in a fade “weather” spot as a warm southern team going north in December. Tua Tagovailoa is 0-7 when the temperature is 46 degrees or less. The forecast calls for 40 degree temperatures today at MetLife Stadium.

The Jets could also be worth a look in a wiseguy Wong Teaser. By taking New York up from +2.5 to +8.5, savvy pros can pass through the top key numbers of 3 and 7.

1 p.m. ET: Indianapolis Colts (-1.5, 45.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars

The Colts (8-4) have dropped three of their last four games and just fell to the Texans 20-16, losing outright as 3-point home favorites. Meanwhile, the Jaguars (8-4) have won three straight and just brushed aside the Titans 25-3, easily covering as 6-point road favorites.

This line opened with Indianapolis listed as a 3-point road favorite.

The public still believes in the Colts and 55% of spread bets at DraftKings are laying the points with Indianapolis.

However, despite receiving a slight majority of tickets we’ve seen the Colts fall from -3 to -1.5. The movement toward Jacksonville has been steady and consistent all week without any notable buyback on Indianapolis. This signals sharp reverse line movement in favor of the Jaguars at home.

At Circa, the Jaguars are taking in 84% of spread bets and a whopping 95% of spread dollars, a one-way “low bets, higher dollars” bet discrepancy and further evidence of heavy pro action backing the home dog out in Vegas.

Jacksonville has betting system value as a divisional dog and is also in a prime Wong Teaser position (+1.5 to +7.5).

We’ve also seen a heavy dose of smart money play the under, dropping the total from 47.5 to 45.5, with some shops inching down to 45 on gameday.

At DraftKings, the under is taking in 43% of bets but 72% of dollars, a sharp contrarian split in favor of a lower scoring game.

Outdoor divisional unders are 24-15 (62%) with an 18% ROI this season and 322-267 (55%) with a 6% ROI since 2017.

1 p.m. ET: Cincinnati Bengals at Buffalo Bills (-6, 54.5)

The Bengals (4-8) just snapped a four-game losing streak with a 32-14 win over the Ravens, winning outright as 7.5-point road dogs. Meanwhile, the Bills (8-4) just took down the Steelers 26-7, easily covering as 3-point road favorites.

This line opened with Buffalo listed as a 6.5-point home favorite.

Sharps have jumped on the Bengals plus the points, dropping Cincinnati from +6.5 to +6. Some shops even touched down to +5.5 earlier in the week. Essentially, all movement and liability has been in favor of the Bengals plus the points.

At Circa, the Bengals are receiving 50% of spread bets and 61% of spread dollars, a “low bets, higher dollars” bet discrepancy indicating public indecision but also respected smart money out in Vegas.

Dogs who missed the playoffs the previous season playing an opponent who made the playoffs the previous season are 45-34 ATS (57%) with a 9% ROI this year. If the dog is getting 6-points or more, they improve to 26-16 ATS (62%) with a 19% ROI this season.

Joe Burrow is 20-11 ATS (65%) with a 24% ROI as a dog in his career.

The Bengals enjoy a 3-day rest advantage, having last played on Thanksgiving (Thursday) while the Bills last played on Sunday.

Pros also seem to be expecting a higher scoring game, as the total has been bet up from 51.5 to 54.5.

At DraftKings, the over is taking in 63% of bets and 65% of dollars.

1 in the NFL in yards and points allowed per game.","It’s week 14 in the NFL, and with the Giants at 2-11 and Jets at 3-9, it’s already draft season in the East Rutherford.

Let’s not get too deep into the question of whether the Jets should tank for Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, because they’re not doing that.

(As an early aside, we don’t really even know yet if Mendoza will end up being “The Guy.” There’s still a showdown with Ohio State on Saturday, the entire College Football Playoff, and all of the pre-draft hype and marketing).

The Jets have won two in a row to drop below the expected Mendoza line, and any more success would cause them to have to trade way too much of the haul they just got for Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams.

You can also make the case that it would be better for the Jets to build their team out a little more and add the QB of the future next year, when they have three No. 1 picks. If Oregon’s Dante Moore and/or Alabama’s Ty Simpson stay on campus, the 2027 draft will be chock-full of quarterbacks.

It could be instructive that the current holders of the top two picks — the Titans and Giants — drafted quarterbacks into bad teams and already have fired their head coaches. Cam Ward (first) and Jaxson Dart (25th) could still end up being cornerstone players, but their teams remain in terrible shape.

If I’m Darren Mougey and Aaron Glenn, I look for a home-run hitter at wide receiver and keep building the wall on the offensive line. Whenever the new quarterback arrives, he’d be equipped to succeed. I’d also trade down a few times to add picks in the third and fourth rounds. This is how Glenn will be able to build the defense he wants with “his guys.”

As for Sunday’s game against the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium, I think the tank fans will get to keep grousing. The Jets have risen to seventh in rushing yards per game while the Dolphins are 29th in rushing yards allowed. The Jets special teams also could continue to make a difference. Now, if they could only force a turnover or two on defense …

Oh, and fun fact: Guess which team is the best against the spread in the AFC. It’s the Jets at 8-4.

The pick: Jets +3.

BALTIMORE RAVENS (-6) over Pittsburgh Steelers

One week, the Steelers defense gives up three touchdown passes to Caleb Williams in a 31-28 loss at the Bears. The next, 249 rushing yards in a 26-7 home trampling by the Bills. Not what you want with Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson ahead. Aaron Rodgers is also dealing with a fractured wrist and mangled nose.

Seattle Seahawks (-7) over ATLANTA FALCONS

Both teams are in the top four in sacks. I trust Sam Darnold to handle the pressure a little better than Kirk Cousins. It’s a lot of points to give on the road, and the Falcons can still be dangerous, but if you like the Seahawks to win, you might as well lay the number. Seven of their nine wins have been by eight points or more.

Cincinnati Bengals (+5.5) over BUFFALO BILLS

The Bengals have a few extra days after their stunning Thursday rout in Baltimore. The weather forecast is in the Bills’ favor — 29 degrees with a few snow showers. Hoping this great Joe Burrow-Josh Allen QB matchup delivers a close game.

CLEVELAND BROWNS (-4) over Tennessee Titans

The Titans rank 32nd in yards per game and points per game. Myles Garrett’s front lawn is one of the last places they’d like to be, particularly with temperatures dropping into the 20s. All but one of the Titans’ 11 loses have been by six points or more.

Washington Commanders (+2) over MINNESOTA VIKINGS

After back-to-back overtime losses to the Dolphins and Broncos to run their losing streak to seven games, the Commanders are ready to win one. Terry McLaurin makes all the difference. Keep an eye on the injury news as both Jayden Daniels and J.J. McCarthy are attempting to return.

TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS (-8.5) over New Orleans Saints

The Bucs should just hang a “Questionable” sign on Raymond James Stadium, given all of the top players on offense who might or might not play Sunday. The defense, however, is intact, and New Orleans is averaging just 13.5 ppg in Tyler Shough’s four starts.

JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (+1.5) over Indianapolis Colts

The teams are tied at 8-4 atop the AFC South with the Texans on their heels. The Colts’ record breaks down to 6-1 home/neutral and just 2-3 on the road. The Jags are 4-2 at home. Daniel Jones is playing on a broken leg and Sauce Gardner (calf) is doubtful for Indianapolis.

Denver Broncos (-7.5) over LAS VEGAS RAIDERS

Surprised this spread is so low for a 10-2 vs. 2-10 matchup. Maybe it’s because the Raiders covered in a 10-7 loss at Denver on Nov. 6. The Raiders are done until the draft party, as I see it. And now Geno Smith is dealing with a foot injury. Any loss of mobility would be critical against the swarming Denver defense. This could be a chance for Courtland Sutton and Evan Engram to flex a little.

Chicago Bears (+6.5) over GREEN BAY PACKERS

I’ve seen some Packers backers point to the Bears plus-17 turnover differential as something that’s unsustainable. Keeping an eye on this phenomenon over the years, my sense (without any official statistics) is that the big takeaway teams can keep doing it throughout the season before it becomes a regression point the next year.

The Lambeau after-dark weather will have a real feel of around zero degrees, but I don’t see that as much of an edge for the Pack against another cold-weather team.

Los Angeles Rams (-8) over ARIZONA CARDINALS

Unlike Broncos-Raiders, this line strikes as a little high for a 9-3 team at a 3-9. The Cardinals did cover a +4 last week at Tampa Bay. Happy to back the Rams off a loss. Since Oct. 12, five of their six wins have been by 14 points or more, so that takes some of the trepidation away from this number.

Houston Texans (+3.5) over KANSAS CITY CHIEFS

Keeping an eye on injury news for the right side of the Chiefs offensive line, where there are questions about Trey Smith and Jawaan Taylor. If they’re out or compromised, Patrick Mahomes will be looking at a face full of Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr., as the Texans defense ranks No. 1 in the NFL in yards and points allowed per game. Anderson also won’t forget the laughable roughing the passer called on him in last season’s playoff game at Arrowhead.

Monday

Philadelphia Eagles (-3) over LOS ANGELES CHARGERS

The Eagles offense isn’t completely broken. A.J. Brown has 242 receiving yards in the past two games, both losses. This pick is mainly built on the defending champs circling the wagons for a Monday night road game in which they might have the crowd advantage. That could spur them on. Also, Justin Herbert had surgery Monday to insert a plate and screws into his non-throwing hand. He’s preparing to play, but that can’t feel good. And three of the Chargers’ four losses have been by 14 points or more.

McCarthy's redshirt rookie season in the NFL hasn't gone to plan. In his return from last year's torn meniscus, the Vikings signal-caller has started just six of a possible 12 games, struggling in many of them.

Ahead of McCarthy's third campaign in Minnesota, expect the franchise to buttress him with some help in the quarterback room.

The Vikings are expected to add a veteran QB this offseason in an effort to ""enhance"" the room and ""push"" McCarthy, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Sunday on NFL GameDay Morning.

McCarthy will be entering the third year of his rookie contract in 2026. The only other QB slated to be on the roster is undrafted rookie Max Brosmer, who was dreadful in his lone start for Minnesota this campaign (19-of-30 passing for 126 yards and four interceptions in the Vikings' Week 13 shutout loss to Seattle). McCarthy missed that game with a concussion but is set to return Sunday for the 4-8 Vikings against the Washington Commanders (3-9).

Carson Wentz was McCarthy's backup this year and served as a competent fill-in in the five games the starter missed due to a high ankle sprain. Wentz, who will be 33 at the start of next season, is currently on season-ending injured reserve after undergoing left shoulder surgery.

McCarthy, 22, is familiar with sharing the Vikings' QB room with a veteran with significant starting experience. Wentz and 2024 starter Sam Darnold were both top-three picks with a combined 150 starts before joining Minnesota.

Darnold was a stop-gap option ahead of the No. 10 pick McCarthy in 2024 but exceeded expectations and led the Vikings to 14-3 record and a playoff appearance. Minnesota let him walk to Seattle in the offseason, handing the starting reins to McCarthy and adding Wentz late in the summer to back him up. Daniel Jones, a former No. 6 selection who finished the 2024 campaign on Minnesota's practice squad, also left in the offseason to Indianapolis.

If the Vikings add a new QB in the 2026 offseason, he could be more Wentz than Darnold or Jones, capable of pushing McCarthy and showing him the ropes but not a signal-caller in his prime.

McCarthy has had his moments in his second NFL campaign, leading a furious comeback against Chicago in Week 1 and beating the Lions in his return from the ankle injury. But he's had as many if not more down days, most recently in Week 12 against Green Bay, when he threw for just 87 yards on 19 attempts, tossing two picks and taking five sacks in a 23-6 defeat.

Who could join McCarthy in Minnesota in 2026? There are a slew of veteran options, including Russell Wilson, Marcus Mariota, Tyrod Taylor, Joe Flacco, Jimmy Garoppolo, ex-Vikings Case Keenum and Teddy Bridgewater and, yes, Wentz.

Baltimore (6-6) is also trying to bounce back with a win, having lost on Thanksgiving against the Bengals. Prior to last week's loss, the Ravens had won five straight games after starting the season with a 1-5 record.

Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson missed several games with injury earlier this season and has thrown for 15 touchdowns and just 4 interceptions in the nine games he's played in.

Image via Corey Perrine/Florida Times-Union / USA TODAY NETWORK

Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Parker Washington will not play in today’s Week 14 matchup against the Indianapolis Colts. The announcement comes after Washington was listed as questionable earlier in the week due to a hip injury suffered during Jacksonville’s win over the Tennessee Titans. Reports from NFL Network's Ian Rapoport on December 7 confirmed that the Jaguars are choosing caution, ruling him out. Washington exited last week’s game early and followed a DNP/limited/limited practice pattern heading into Sunday. Despite progress, the team determined he was not ready to return to full-speed action.

How Parker Washington’s absence impacts Jacksonville’s offense?

Washington has played an important role this season as Jacksonville’s No. 3 wide receiver, contributing both as a pass-catcher and a return specialist. In 12 games so far, he has recorded 36 receptions for 447 yards and three touchdowns, with 23 receptions resulting in first downs. His special teams value has also been notable, adding two punt return touchdowns this year. Without him, the Jaguars will rely on a rotation to fill his role. Tim Patrick, Dyami Brown, and recently elevated receiver Austin Trammell are expected to split snaps behind starters Brian Thomas Jr. and Jakobi Meyers. Trammell is also expected to take over punt return duties.

Jaguars make roster adjustments ahead of Week 14

In preparation for Washington’s absence, the Jaguars made several roster moves on December 6. Safety Eric Murray was activated from injured reserve, and wide receiver Austin Trammell and defensive back Cam’Ron Silmon-Craig were elevated from the practice squad. Trammell’s elevation comes only days after he moved back to the practice squad, highlighting the coaching staff’s confidence in him as a depth option. Offensive coordinator Liam Coen has already stated that Dyami Brown and Tim Patrick will see expanded roles with Washington out. Today’s matchup holds major playoff implications. Both the Jaguars and Colts enter Week 14 with 8-4 records, tied at the top of the AFC South standings. Jacksonville has momentum, winning three straight games and four of its last five, while Indianapolis enters the contest on a two-game losing streak. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence leads a Jaguars offense averaging 202.8 passing yards per game, while running back Travis Etienne remains the team’s top rusher with 843 yards and five touchdowns. Defensively, the Jaguars rank first in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game (82.4). While Washington’s absence will be felt, Jacksonville will look to maintain its recent form in a matchup that could help shape the AFC postseason picture. The game is scheduled to kick off at 1 p.m. ET. Also Read: Cowboys news roundup: Key updates on CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens, and more heading into Week 14

The final full month of the NFL regular season has arrived, and that means it’s crunch time.

Divisional crowns remain up for grabs, and playoff seeding is far from resolved. Coming up is one of the most hotly contested Decembers in recent memory.

This week’s docket kicked off with Thursday night’s matchup between the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys in which the Lions gave their playoff hopes a jolt and the Cowboys were left with their backs against the wall. The action resumes Sunday with 12 more contests — seven between divisional opponents.

The week concludes with Monday night’s showdown between the Philadelphia Eagles, who aim to rebound from last week’s loss to Dallas and remain in the driver’s seat of the NFC East, and the Los Angeles Chargers, who own an identical 8-4 record and hope to make up some ground on the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos.

Here are five of the most compelling storylines of Week 14.

Battered AFC North brawl

It’s a trying year for AFC North teams. The Pittsburgh Steelers got off to a 4-1 start while the Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals battled injuries and the Cleveland Browns’ season quickly spiraled out of control. But the Steelers have since failed to string together consecutive victories, losing five of their last seven, including two straight. The Ravens used a five-game winning streak to save their season and overtake the Steelers for first place, but then got blown out by the Bengals on Thanksgiving. Now, the 6-6 Steelers and Ravens meet Sunday in Baltimore with the division lead up for grabs.

A battered Aaron Rodgers enters this game with intentions of keeping Pittsburgh in the fight. He’ll need some help, however, in the form of improved pass protection from his line, dependability from his pass catchers and some defining stops from his defense — all elements that have proved hard to come by for the Steelers as of late.

Across the way, Lamar Jackson and company aim to rebound from a turnover-plagued outing against Cincinnati. The Ravens’ offense added pressure to a defense that had played much better since the bye week, holding opponents to an average of 13.4 points and forcing two turnovers a game. But the Ravens surrendered 382 yards to Cincinnati, including 261 passing yards and two touchdown passes from Joe Burrow in his return from injury. Pittsburgh’s anemic offense doesn’t pose nearly the same kind of challenge, however, so the Ravens have the opportunity to get back on track defensively. And Jackson and the offense could take advantage of a Steelers defense that entered the week ranked No. 27 against the pass (247.4 yards per game) and No. 17 against the run (117.7 ypg). (Steelers at Ravens, 1 p.m. (ET) Sunday, CBS)

Duel of desperation

Neither Josh Allen nor Burrow anticipated finding themselves in such perilous positions this late in the season. But a 3-2 month caused the Buffalo Bills to drop all the way to the seventh spot in the AFC. And Burrow’s nine-game injury absence and a porous defense have placed the Bengals on the brink of elimination. Now these teams meet in Buffalo, each badly needing a victory to help stabilize its situation.

Catching the idle New England Patriots (winners of 10 straight) for the AFC East title seems challenging, but Buffalo can improve its positioning in the playoff race. Allen remains in need of consistency out of young wide receiver Keon Coleman. A James Cook outing similar to last week’s 32-carry, 144-yard showing against Pittsburgh could also ease pressure on the quarterback. On the surface, Cincinnati’s defense seems like the perfect victim given the Bengals’ last-place rankings in total defense, passing yards and points allowed. However, Cincinnati did turn Jackson and the Ravens over five times last week, and held Derrick Henry to 60 yards and denied Baltimore on seven of 10 third downs. Which unit shows up this week?

Meanwhile, Burrow’s return last week has sparked hope in Cincinnati. He did show some rust, completing only 52 percent of his passes. But he directed third-quarter scoring drives of 61 and 68 yards, and the Bengals snapped a four-game losing streak. In theory, the playoffs remain in reach. It may take winning out and some stumbles by Pittsburgh and Baltimore, but everyone in Cincinnati is highly motivated to do just that. Buffalo’s defense battles inconsistencies, but it is the top unit against the pass, holding foes to 163.2 yards per game and a 59.5 completion percentage. The Bills have surrendered just 12 touchdown passes and have eight interceptions. So, Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase will certainly face stiff competition. (Bengals at Bills, 1 p.m. (ET) Sunday, Fox)

Unlikely AFC South clash

Entering the season, you would’ve been hard-pressed to find any projections that counted the Indianapolis Colts and Jacksonville Jaguars among the contenders in 2025. But both teams enter December very much in the playoff hunt. Indianapolis has led the AFC South for much of the season, but a stumble by the Colts and three-game surge by Jacksonville has now placed the Jaguars in first place, for now. These 8-4 teams meet Sunday in Jacksonville in a game that will give the victor a leg up in the division with four weeks left to go.

After an up-and-down first half of the season, the Jaguars emerged from their bye and have won four of their last five. Jacksonville’s offensive and defensive lines have paved the way for success. On offense, a physical front has led to success in the run game, which has ensured balance while also easing pressure on quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Defensively, the Jaguars have proved stout against the run, which has helped put foes in unfavorable down-and-distance situations and Jacksonville’s pass rushers and defensive backs in prime position for impact plays. The Jaguars have averaged 128.2 rushing yards per game in this 4-1 stretch while holding foes to just 70.2 per contest. A robust defensive effort against the run is a must this week if they aim to derail the Colts and running back Jonathan Taylor, who leads the NFL with 1,282 yards and 15 touchdowns rushing.

Taylor has topped the 100-yard mark five times this season, and has surpassed 120 yards in four of those contests. He also has five multi-touchdown games. Taylor’s production has helped set up Daniel Jones for a year of resurgence. Jones has eclipsed the 3,000-yard mark for only the third time in his career and has 19 touchdown passes (second-most since entering the league in 2019). Jones, however, is playing with a fracture in his fibula, which has limited his mobility and the number of rollouts the Colts used to position him for effectiveness. Jones is coming off two of his worst outings (losses to Kansas City and the Houston Texans) and last week completed just 51.9 percent of his passes, which factored in Indianapolis scoring a season-low 16 points. Can the Jaguars manage to harass the hobbled quarterback similarly to how the Texans did and render one of the league’s top-scoring offenses (29.8 points per game) ineffective? (Colts at Jaguars, 1 p.m. (ET) Sunday, CBS)

Northern rivalry renewed

Once a fierce rivalry, Bears–Packers hasn’t had much juice in recent history. In the last decade, Green Bay has owned Chicago, posting a 17-3 record. During that time, the Packers have reached the playoffs seven times while the Bears have done so just twice. Sunday, however, these familiar foes meet for a game that actually features massive implications. Chicago enters with a 9-3 record and in first place in the NFC North while Green Bay trails with an 8-3-1 record.

There’s a lot riding on this game. A win would give the Bears (winners of five straight and nine of their last 10) their biggest statement yet and a little cushion in the division standings, which they surprisingly lead. A Packers victory, however, would give them an edge entering the final stretch of the season. Green Bay (6 1/2-point favorite) also has a slightly more favorable remaining schedule than Chicago.

Prepare for all kinds of fireworks and an intriguing chess match between two of the brightest offensive minds in the game in Ben Johnson and Matt LaFleur. But these defenses should not be overlooked. Chicago leads the NFL with 26 takeaways while the Packers hold opponents to just 18.8 points per game and boast a disruptive pass rush anchored by Micah Parsons. Green Bay’s defense also ranks among the best against the run (98.3 yards allowed), which could complicate matters for the Bears, whose 153.8 rushing yards per contest lead the NFC and rank second overall.

Loser leaves town in KC?

When the season kicked off, the Chiefs and Texans were regarded as two of the leading potential contenders in the AFC. Both wound up stumbling out of the gates, however, and quickly lost ground as counterparts passed them by. Now as the fourth quarter of the season begins, each finds itself in dire situations. If the playoffs started today, both Kansas City (6-6) and Houston (7-5) would be on the outside looking in. Because of this, Sunday night’s meeting at Arrowhead Stadium should have a playoff-like atmosphere with the Chiefs and Texans each battling to keep hope alive.

The squads seemingly are trending in opposite directions. Kansas City has lost three of its last four games and is a distant third in the AFC West while Houston has won four straight and stands within striking distance of the Colts and Jaguars.

Despite their struggles, the Chiefs continue to field one of the most efficient offenses, ranking top five in yards, second in total EPA and ninth in points. However, Kansas City has struggled to deliver the explosive plays past iterations were known for, and the Chiefs’ defense — although stingy, holding foes to 19.3 points per game — also has struggled to consistently get off the field in key moments, ranking 25th on third downs. All of that makes for an extremely small margin for error, and during this 1-3 stretch, opponents have outscored the Chiefs 101-91.

Houston, meanwhile, has steadily improved offensively and has done a better job of complementing a fierce defense that has dominated potent offenses like those of Buffalo and Indianapolis. Kansas City has beaten Houston in the last five meetings, including in the divisional round of the playoffs in January. But in a league where the pack seemingly has caught up to the Chiefs, it’s anyone’s guess if Andy Reid and his offense can stay a step ahead of DeMeco Ryans and his defense and preserve Reid’s chances of taking Kansas City to the postseason for an 11th straight year.

This NFL Week 14 injury report includes Jayden Daniels, Mike Evans, and Justin Herbert.

Also included is the SIC Player Edge projection, a proprietary ratings metric you can use when thinking about betting player props or filling out your fantasy football lineups.

Justin Herbert – Hand

Justin Herbert had surgery on Monday to his hand, likely a metacarpal fracture with plates and screws. There’s a high chance he plays with a splint or cast on. He already logged a limited practice today, and it’s the off-hand for the quarterback. He already played through the broken hand finishing the game, and he’s played through a broken left finger before in the past. I expect him to play out of shotgun and not be as mobile to avoid risking ball security, but he will play for the Chargers on Monday Night Football.

Justin Herbert has a -10.8% SIC Player Edge projection which reflects the health of Herbert, the Chargers Pass Offense and the Eagles Pass Defense therefore we expect him to be UNDER his projected passing prop and DFS points.

Jayden Daniels – Elbow

Jayden Daniels. Remember when he dislocated his elbow? Everyone thought, “Oh my gosh, surgery, his season is over,” and we were saying, no, he’s going to make a return quicker than people think. He’s good to go this week and already had a full practice. The only question is whether the Commanders will risk it. They’ve been protective of their star franchise player, but they’re 3–9 and running on fumes for their playoff chances to win the division. It’s likely that Jayden Daniels plays this week.

Jayden Daniels has a -4.6% SIC Player Edge projection which reflects the health of Daniels, the Commanders Pass Offense and the Vikings Pass Defense therefore we expect him to be slightly UNDER his projected passing prop and DFS points.

Marvin Harrison Jr. – Heel

Marvin Harrison has two straight DNPs due to a heel injury coming off an appendectomy. He played pretty well last week. Even though he has not practiced, there is an outside chance that he plays, as wide receivers play on their toes, not their heels.

Marvin Harrison Jr. has a -26.2% SIC Player Edge projection which reflects the health of Harrison, the Cardinals Pass Offense and the Rams Pass Defense therefore we expect him to be UNDER his projected passing prop and DFS points.

Mike Evans – Collarbone

Mike Evans’ injury was more recent, but he should return more quickly. Both have logged limited practices so far this week. Mike Evans has just a clavicle fracture; it’s been six-plus weeks, he’s ready to go, and he’s been working out lower body with no problems. There’s still a chance he could be activated and play this week.

Jayden Reed – Collarbone

Jayden Reed will likely have a slightly slower recovery. Yes, his collarbone fracture was earlier this season than Mike Evans’, but remember, he had the fifth metatarsal Jones-type fracture with surgery, and that is likely the rate-limiting step for his return for the Packers.

According to ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter, Mayfield and his teammate Bucky Irving were each fined for a touchdown celebration that included their use of the ""nose wipe"" gesture after scoring against the Arizona Cardinals this past week. Mayfield was fined $14,491, while Irving was left $6,349 lighter in the wallet.

Neither player was flagged for the incident. Tampa Bay went on to win the game 20-17.

NFL vice president Troy Vincent previously stated that the gesture would be fined as a ""violent gesture"" in 2025 due to its ""gang connotations."" He said that the NFL wanted to kill the gesture and that other players don't like it either.

""[The nose wipe] has gang connotations; it’s disrespectful,” Vincent said in April. “It’s just where we are in society. Young men, they come from that era, from that age, and they’ve grown up on social media. If anybody Googled ‘nose wipe,’ you’ll see the language that is used and where that’s affiliated. I think the players know better. I know they know better.

“We’re focusing on a small fraction (of players), but sportsmanship is important... When you see it, you’ve got to kill it. You’ve got to stop it immediately. Most players don’t want it in the game either.”

State of the Bucs

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been going through a bit of a rough patch lately. Despite starting the season 6-2, they've fallen to 7-5 after suffering a three-game losing streak in November. They weren't even that competitive in several of their losses.

The losses have allowed the rival Carolina Panthers to draw even with them at seven wins apiece and the two sides face each other twice in the final three weeks of the season.

Needless to say, it would behoove Mayfield and the Bucs to start playing a little more like the Super Bowl contender they think they are, and fast.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_spun_articles_751/ed3c821d406113cbc05989f42bd97bd1,N,,2025-12-07 11:05:55.920676
