Cockcroft, John Keim, Courtney Cronin, Josh Weinfuss, Ryan McFadden, Mike Reiss, Jordan Raanan",,,,,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47172027/will-brandon-aiyuk-return-san-francisco-49ers-season-faq,"The Niners tried to grant that request only for Aiyuk to use his contract leverage to nix those offers.
So a week before the season, the 49ers gave Aiyuk an extension that included $76 million in guarantees.
But Aiyuk missed multiple rehabilitation sessions in the offseason and the Niners voided his 2026 guarantees, including that option bonus.
Still, in Aiyuk's case, it seems like there would have to be a major shift for him to play for the Niners this season or in the future.
In late November, it was mentioned to Shanahan that the voiding of Aiyuk's guarantees seemed to point to his eventual departure.","The San Francisco 49ers are at their Week 14 bye and though they're looking forward to some much-needed downtime, they're also reaching critical mass when it comes to wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk's status for the rest of the season and beyond.

Coach Kyle Shanahan said the Niners won't open anyone's -- including Aiyuk's -- practice window during the bye which means there are four more weeks for Aiyuk to return to practice and, potentially, play in the regular season.

Of course, while the 27-year-old has yet to be physically cleared to return from a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee (an injury he suffered in Week 7 last season), it remains to be seen if he will even do so if he gets the green light. That's because, in July, the 49ers took the drastic step of voiding the roughly $27 million in guarantees contained in Aiyuk's contract for 2026 after Aiyuk failed to live up to the contract he signed in August 2024, including missed rehab sessions.

""I've been coaching over 20 years, and I've never been in a situation where a contract's been voided,"" Shanahan said on Nov. 22. ""It's extremely unusual to me.""

Now, the 49ers and Aiyuk are at a crossroads where his talent could be of use as the Niners (9-4) make a playoff push, but a potential return could also prove a distraction if he and the 49ers aren't able to put aside their differences.

Now a once promising future for the Niners and Aiyuk looks far murkier than it did on Aug. 29, 2024, when the sides signed a four-year, $120 million extension that, at the time, was the second largest in franchise history.

ESPN NFL Nation 49ers reporter Nick Wagoner, senior NFL insiders Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler, and NFL draft analyst Jordan Reid weigh in on what lies ahead for Aiyuk and the Niners.

How did the 49ers and Aiyuk get here?

Throughout the 2024 training camp, Aiyuk and the 49ers engaged in a contentious contract negotiation in which Aiyuk requested a trade after taking to social media multiple times to voice his displeasure. The Niners tried to grant that request only for Aiyuk to use his contract leverage to nix those offers. At the time, it seemed that the right amount of money might buy happiness for both parties.

So a week before the season, the 49ers gave Aiyuk an extension that included $76 million in guarantees.

But it didn't take long for those good feelings to vanish. Soon after Aiyuk signed, he and Shanahan had an awkward public exchange on the practice field on Sept. 27, 2024, when Aiyuk wore red shorts when the rest of the team was wearing the required black ones. Aiyuk was seen taking the shorts off on the field and kicking them as he changed in to the correct ones. That it happened publicly after Aiyuk signed the contract was a signal that all was not well despite the new deal.

Aiyuk then struggled on the playing field. He was averaging 58.5 yards per game with no touchdowns in the first six weeks. Then, he suffered a devastating knee injury on Oct. 20, ending his season.

At that point, the frustration of the contract negotiations lingered.

Multiple sources told ESPN that the Niners had hoped to trade him last offseason but the injury put an end to any realistic hopes of a good return in trade, though, as the market for an injured player with a big contract never materialized.

On April 1, Aiyuk's $24.935 million roster bonus for 2026 became guaranteed. But Aiyuk missed multiple rehabilitation sessions in the offseason and the Niners voided his 2026 guarantees, including that option bonus.

Still, Aiyuk earned praise from Shanahan and receivers coach Leonard Hankerson for taking an active role in helping the receivers and rehabbing in training camp, perhaps in an effort to get the Niners to reconsider the voided guarantees.

Aiyuk had 50 days from when his guarantees were voided to file a noninjury grievance (recourse for the player through the NFLPA that allows them to challenge club punishments related to contracts, fines or suspensions), but he did not. And though he has been around the facility for rehab in recent weeks, his presence for team activities and practice has been scarce, though teammates say they have been in contact with him.

""I reach out to him as much as I can, check on him,"" receiver Ricky Pearsall said before the 49ers' Week 12 win against the Panthers. ""Sometimes when you're in this business, you're always busy. He's busy doing his thing, so sometimes you're not communicating every single day. You would like to check on people like that. But when he pops in my head and I think of him, I'll reach out to him."" -- Wagoner

Will Aiyuk play for the 49ers again?

If the surprising 2022 Jimmy Garoppolo reunion taught us anything, it's that nothing should be ruled out. Still, in Aiyuk's case, it seems like there would have to be a major shift for him to play for the Niners this season or in the future.

In late November, it was mentioned to Shanahan that the voiding of Aiyuk's guarantees seemed to point to his eventual departure. At the time, Shanahan demurred.

""What happened in July, to me, doesn't have anything to do with the future,"" Shanahan said then. ""When it comes to the future of this, I would love for B.A. to be here. I would love for him to get healthy and get back to really helping us out and being a part of this team. We haven't had that in a little bit and I still hold out hope that he can get there. But he obviously hasn't gotten there yet.""

It should be noted that Aiyuk is on the physically unable to perform list, not injured reserve, which means the Niners could, in theory, open his practice window to see how healthy he is and how he might fit back into a team he hasn't played with in more than a year before possibly activating him and it wouldn't count against their allotment of eight players they can designate to return from IR. The window for Aiyuk to return to practice or be activated could extend if the Niners make the postseason.

Also, Aiyuk's knee injury was severe and it's fair to wonder if he can perform near the standard he has played at previously, which might make sitting the rest of the regular season more prudent if he can't be at or near full strength.

There is also a delicate balance to keep in mind in the locker room. And while the Niners could use someone of Aiyuk's considerable talents on the field, they also need to ensure they don't disrupt the chemistry and culture this year's team has built during an adverse season.

The more likely scenario is that Aiyuk and the Niners decline to bring him back this season and then part ways -- in whatever form that might take -- in the offseason when the Niners won't have nearly the financial burden they would have before voiding his future guarantees. -- Wagoner

What would be the contract and salary cap implications of moving on from Aiyuk?

With the future guarantees voided, the contract math on Aiyuk is pretty simple. The 49ers would incur a $29.585 million dead-money cap charge if they release him outright. They could designate him as a post-June 1 release and spread that money over two years, carrying a $13.325 million dead-money charge in 2026 and the rest in 2027. And the same math applies if they traded him -- a $29.585 million dead-money hit with the option to spread it over two years if they were to deal him after June 1.

Reminder: Teams cannot trade a player before June 1 and designate the move as a post-June 1 transaction. They would have to actually wait until after June 1 to trade him to be able to spread the dead money out, or else absorb the full $29.585 million dead-money hit in 2026. -- Graziano

What sort of market would exist for Aiyuk in free agency if he is released?

Somewhere on the top shelf of available free agent receivers. Dallas' George Pickens is considered the top option, but Dallas could take him off the market with the franchise tag. Aiyuk would most likely be in the class with Indianapolis' Alec Pierce and Green Bay's Romeo Doubs. His turbulent past two years in San Francisco must be accounted for, but he's only 27 and has a transferable skill -- he's an elite route runner, assuming he becomes healthy enough to still beat corners.

One team to potentially watch for Aiyuk is Washington. He is close with quarterback Jayden Daniels, his former teammate at Arizona State. And general manager Adam Peters -- a John Lynch disciple from his time in San Francisco -- understands the Aiyuk experience well. -- Fowler

Will the 49ers be looking to add another receiver in the 2026 NFL draft? If so, who would be a good fit?

The 49ers have been diligent in drafting wide receiver talent, as they've selected at least one in four of the past five years. And with another loaded class of wideouts on deck in 2026, San Francisco will likely be searching for talent at the position once again.

One common trait the Niners look for in wide receiver prospects is the ability to pick up yards after the catch. And that means KC Concepcion (Texas A&M) and Chris Bell (Louisville) would be two realistic options at the back end of Round 1 -- the 49ers are projected to pick No. 28, per ESPN's Football Power Index -- and both would make a lot of sense. Concepcion has 423 yards after the catch this season, while Bell has 378. -- Reid",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1202%2Fr1583553_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 22:59:25.050854

That hurt the whole defensive line right there.
Graham had played alongside Collins in the interior, starting all 12 games this season, while Harris has appeared in each game.","A career season for DT Maliek Collins has been unexpectedly cut short.

Head coach Kevin Stefanski announced on Dec. 1 that Collins would miss the remainder of the 2025 season with the quad injury that will require surgery. Collins sustained the injury in the third quarter of Week 13 against the 49ers and was carted off the field with the injury, then ruled out for the remainder of the game.

""Very disappointed for Maliek, he's obviously been playing such good football, and he provides great leadership for this team,"" Stefanski said. ""He's made a big impact on this football team on the field and off the field. I think our young room, we have some older guys in there, but we have a lot a bunch of young guys in there. I think they've learned a lot from the professional that Maliek is on a day in and day out basis, and I think you have to carry that with you throughout.""

His absence for the remainder of the season is a tough loss for the Browns' defense that has been a dominant force up front through 12 games. Not only did he provide another veteran presence on the defensive line, but also his ability to pass rush from the interior created opportunities for himself and for teammates across the defensive line to pressure and bring down opposing quarterbacks. He was disruptive, defeating blocks in one-on-one situations and was affective in their run defense.

Collins recorded a career-high 6.5 sacks, as well as a game-high 2.5 sacks in Week 12 against the Raiders. He also had 12 quarterback hits, seven tackles for loss, 24 tackles and one fumble recovery this season.

Not only did Collins capitalize on his own success, but his impact on the defensive line created opportunities on the edge for players like DE Myles Garrett – who has 19 total sacks this season and 30 quarterback hits. Earlier in the season, Garrett called Collins ""one of the most unique rushers I've had the privilege to be around with the combination of finesse and power.

Collins' stats quietly illustrated how his presence on the defensive line was undeniably effective. Collins entered Week 13 leading defensive tackles in the league in sacks and was on his way to a potential Pro-Bowl nod for his weekly contributions to the Browns' dominant defensive front.

""He's been amazing. He's done a great job,"" Garrett said following the Browns' 26-8 loss to the 49ers. ""I mean as far as his trajectory, he was going to have a double-digit sack season which he had yet to do. And it sucks seeing him go down, and just hurt seeing that look on his face, just disappointed, knowing that he had so much left for the year and giving more to this team. So, we're behind him 100 percent and we're going to support him however we can.""

When Collins signed with the Browns during the early days of free agency in March 2025, he knew he was joining a defensive scheme that benefited his skillset. He wanted to continue playing in an attack-style defense – the only defensive style he had played in during his NFL career – as well as have the chance to reunite with defensive line coach Jacques Cesaire.

He quickly stepped into his leadership role, as before training camp began, Collins worked out with rookie DT Mason Graham to help him acclimate to the NFL. Graham said he has continued to rely on Collins throughout the 2025 season, asking questions and working with him on his style of play.

Over the course of the season, Stefanski said he admired Collins' approach to his role through how he works on his craft early on the practice field, takes notes in the meeting rooms and provides a veteran leader to younger players on the defensive line. With his dedication to his game, leadership qualities and ability to make plays in both the run and the pass, Collins also served as a game captain in Week 4 against the Lions.

""(DT) Maliek (Collins) is one of our leaders,"" DT Shelby Harris said. ""He's one of our favorite guys, and it's always tough to lose somebody like that who's having a career year and someone who is truly happy for everyone else's success. That hurt the whole defensive line right there. That is one of our guys and you never want to see somebody go down like that.""

With Collins out for the remaining five games of the season, the Browns will rely on two younger players in Graham and DT Mike Hall Jr., as well as a veteran in Harris to fill the snaps Collins took each week. Graham had played alongside Collins in the interior, starting all 12 games this season, while Harris has appeared in each game.

Graham has 31 tackles, including five tackles for loss and four passes defensed in his rookie season. Harris has recorded 21 tackles, six tackles for loss and three quarterback hits. He recorded four tackles and a tackle for loss against the 49ers, three of which came after Collins exited the game.

Hall provides depth to the interior after returning in Week 8 from a knee injury that caused him to miss the first seven games of the season. In five games, Hall has six tackles, two tackles for loss, four quarterback hits and 1.5 sacks. His best game came against the Raiders in Week 12 with four tackles and two quarterback hits.

In the final stretch of the season, the Browns will find that combination to fill the interior spot on the defense and help sustain that interior pass rush presence.

""When you lose a guy like Maliek, you don't replace him. Everybody's just got to step up. It's multiple guys that have to step up,"" Stefanski said.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/browns/w52duvrspkwnouobxtl3,N,,2025-12-02 19:03:28.048026

Even though he probably could have stepped out of bounds earlier and gained a few less yards, he said he wouldn't change a thing.

It doesn't matter that Dart sat out the previous two games because of a concussion and was checked for a concussion in four of the previous eight games.

""No, look, I understand the question, but this is football,"" Dart said. ""I'm going to get hit if I'm in the pocket or outside the pocket. I feel like I played this way my whole entire life. It shouldn't be any shocker to anybody if you followed along with my career.

""We're not playing soccer out here. You're going to get hit. Things happen. It's just part of the game.""

Dart said he was scrambling out of the pocket on the second-and-13 play and was trying to get the first down before Christian Elliss sent him flying through the air. Dart landed on the Giants' sideline.

The hit was deemed legal. Dart was still inbounds at the time of the hit. ""Guy made a good hit,"" he said.

Interim coach Mike Kafka didn't have any problem with the play from his quarterback. Even if it led to a big hit.

""Obviously, don't want him to take any hits that are unnecessary, but he was working his way out of bounds,"" Kafka said.

Tight end Theo Johnson immediately came in to defend his quarterback. He picked up a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness on the play.

Dart's offensive line also came to protect him.

""We're not here to just get rolled over,"" right guard Greg Van Roten said. ""It's your quarterback. Especially if you think it's late, cheap or dirty, you let them know that's not acceptable. If they do s--- like that, we will respond accordingly.""

Dart said he didn't play any differently coming back from the concussion. He said playing safer wasn't running through his mind. The rookie first-round pick was just playing his game.

He was 17-of-24 passing for 139 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. He rushed four times for 20 yards and wasn't thrilled with the performance.

""Not good enough because we lost,"" Dart said.

It was the Giants' seventh straight loss. It was their 13th straight road defeat dating to last season.

Dart still insists he was his usual aggressive self Monday night. The Giants (2-11) even kept him in the game down three scores with just over two minutes left.

""Like I said, I played like this my whole life,"" Dart said. ""Turn on my high school tape, turn on my college tape, it's not a shocker to anybody. It's how I've played. I felt like if you just watch the game, like, I did slide. I did avoid a lot of hits, so you're going to get hit. It's football.""

The Giants did call the game Monday night a bit differently. In the game in which Dart was hurt last month, they used him on six designed runs. They didn't call any designed runs Monday.

Still, some of his teammates would rather him avoid the type of hit he took in the first quarter.

""I told him earlier [Monday], be smart, protect ourselves. Obviously, he's not going to listen because he's just so competitive, loves the contact,"" veteran offensive lineman Jon Runyan said. ""That's just how he is. We're just going to have to keep talking to him. Maybe he'll listen to us one of these days.""

Fortunately for Dart and the Giants, the quarterback said he felt good coming out of Monday night's game. He bounced back from the massive hit from Elliss and immediately jogged back to the huddle.

The play on which he suffered a concussion in Chicago and this hit in New England aren't going to alter his thinking.

""I got knocked out of the game against Chicago on a fluke play. You watch the hit, I lose control of the ball and I don't brace myself because I'm trying to re-catch the ball,"" Dart said. ""It's not because of the hit. It's because I lost the ball. So just like any other league, you take new steps, there's bigger, faster players. My body feels good. I'm going to play aggressive. I feel like if I just turn into a complete pocket passer, that's just not how I want to play the game. I feel like there's an advantage to me using my legs. So, yeah.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1202%2Fr1583620_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 19:59:47.212421

Lions defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard insisted Monday the normally jovial Joseph was in good spirts and excited to return to practice.
Before Monday, Joseph last practiced Oct. 3, two days before the Lions' Week 5 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.","Kerby Joseph was on top of the world.

A first-team All-Pro selection and the NFL's reigning interception leader, Joseph signed a four-year contract extension with the Detroit Lions in late April that made him the league's highest-paid safety.

Seven months later, there are serious questions about how much of that contract he'll see.

Joseph returned to practice on a limited basis Monday, Dec. 1, for the first time in nearly two months and addressed the knee injury that has kept him out the past six games in a brief and somber exchange with reporters.

Joseph, wearing a balaclava on his head that covered his mouth, talked for just under 2 minutes and replied to 14 questions with no answers of more than 11 words.

""My knee messed up,"" Joseph said.

Asked how he can fix it, Joseph said, ""You don’t fix it. You just keep the faith.""

Joseph missed time in training camp with a knee injury and suffered a bone bruise in the same spot in a Week 4 win over the Cleveland Browns.

Lions coach Dan Campbell said Sunday, Nov. 30, that Joseph was dealing with ""a little wear and tear"" in his knee in addition to the bone bruise, and indicated it could be a problem for years to come.

Joseph's injury is cartilage-related, a person familiar with the injury but not authorized to discuss it publicly, told the Free Press, and surgery is not currently considered an option.

""I don’t think it’s necessarily going away, but I think you do the best you can to manage it,"" Campbell said. ""It’s like a lot of these guys that have gotten some injuries here or deals with could be cartilage or meniscus or anything like that, it’s you do your best to manage it and there’ll always be a little wear and tear and it’s just how bad is it?""

Joseph, 25, said he felt ""blessed"" to be back at practice and vowed, ""If I’m out there I’m going to go 100%.""

But he did little to assuage concerns about the long-term health of his knee.

Joseph indicated the problem would not be fixed by offseason surgery, and when asked how worried he is he's dealing with a chronic issue, he said, ""Can’t be worried, I trust in God’s plan.""

When healthy, Joseph has been one of the most productive defensive backs in the NFL and a key part of the Lions defense.

A third-round pick out of Illinois in 2022, Joseph led the Lions with four interceptions in each of his first two seasons and had a career-high nine picks last year. He had three more interceptions during the Lions' 4-1 start this year, and still leads the team in that category despite last playing in a Week 6 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.

Lions defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard insisted Monday the normally jovial Joseph was in good spirts and excited to return to practice. Before Monday, Joseph last practiced Oct. 3, two days before the Lions' Week 5 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.

“Kerby’s doing great,"" Sheppard said. ""He’s ready to get back. He was as upbeat as I’ve ever seen him last week, leading into the week, knowing that he’s scratching and clawing, hopefully it’s a chance we get him back pretty soon here. But Kerby’s good, man.""

Joseph deleted his account on the social media platform X in recent days and erased pictures from his Instagram account. Early Monday morning, he posted a black screen with the words, ""God help me,"" in an Instagram story.

He said ""it's all God's plan"" when he'll return for game action, and said he took down some of his social media ""to lock in.""

Asked for what he was locking in on, Joseph said, ""Got to lock in on life.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/28/PDTF/86408209007-092825-lionsbrowns-1-h-039.jpg?crop=2669,1501,x0,y139&width=2669&height=1501&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-02 18:04:20.796193

While it seems impossible to play football a week after surgery for a broken bone, Herbert could still play in Week 14.
Daniel Jones Jones is another quarterback with a bone injury, but his ailment involves his lower extremity.
Details surrounding the nature of Jones' fracture are limited, but the injury appeared to effect Jones' mobility in the loss to Houston.","Broken. Crack. Fracture. All these terms can be used interchangeably to describe damage to a bone. This week's NFL Injury Report is filled with players managing bone-related ailments. While these terms may be interchangeable the differences in fractures can be wide, as they may vary in cause, pattern of the break and other medical-related classifications. This degree of variability often dictates treatment options that in turn influences time lost. Let's take a look at several of these cases.

Justin Herbert

The Chargers quarterback suffered a broken hand in the team's win over the Raiders. The injury occurred to his left hand after he struck it on the helmet of Las Vegas safety Jeremy Chinn. He briefly left the game but returned to action with the hand casted and gloved. X-rays on the injury revealed a fractured metacarpal. The metacarpal bones are the bones that bridge the area between the wrist and fingers. The distal ends of the metacarpals form the knuckles of the fist. Herbert underwent surgery on Monday to repair the fracture site, suggesting the bone fragments displaced when they broke. Surgical hardware will stabilize the bone and help ensure the bones adequately fuse together during the healing process.

While it seems impossible to play football a week after surgery for a broken bone, Herbert could still play in Week 14. The medical staff will address any of Herbert's associated symptoms and then pad the area to protect it. Because the injury occurred to his non-throwing hand, the injury should not be functionally limiting. Furthermore, there have been other examples of players who underwent metacarpal fractures and did not miss time following surgery, including former NFL players DeMarco Murray and Terrell Owens. The Chargers have labeled Herbert as day-to-day, and he will get an extra day of recovery with the team playing Monday night. Hopefully we get a better idea of his availability before Sunday's slate of games, but he does appear to be trending in the right direction. Trey Lance will start if Herbert is unable to go.

Aaron Rodgers

While there is reason for optimism about Herbert's status, Rodgers is a good example of how a fracture can be limiting for a quarterback, even on a non-throwing hand. Rodgers' injury is multiple fractures in his wrist, though all the breaks were classified as nondisplaced, meaning surgery was not necessary. However, Rodgers did not look comfortable in his return to action, finishing 10-of-21 for 117 passings yards, with no touchdowns. He also fumbled early in the second half. Given the description, it remains likely Rogers' injury involves the distal ends of his lower arm bones or the tiny carpal bones. Without a specific diagnosis, it's hard to speculate how long the wrist will be a problem, but most bones take four to six weeks to heal completely. This process can be prolonged if the invovled bone is one that has a poor blood supply. Rodgers is expected to play in Week 14 despite also suffering a nasal laceration in the loss to the Bills, but it is worth exploring healthier options in all formats.

Daniel Jones

Jones is another quarterback with a bone injury, but his ailment involves his lower extremity. The Colts quarterback is reportedly playing with a broken fibula. The fibula is the smaller of the two lower leg bones and sits on the outside aspect of the leg. While the fibula is not considered a weight-bearing bone, it still plays a crucial role in stability and functional movement. Details surrounding the nature of Jones' fracture are limited, but the injury appeared to effect Jones' mobility in the loss to Houston. He had just one rush attempt for a single yard and he did not scramble out of the pocket. Jones will continue to play despite the injury, but those invested in the signal caller will need to appropriately adjust their expectations.

Omarion Hampton

The Chargers running back is working his way back from an ankle fracture that is believed to have involved the previously discussed fibula. Fibula fractures often accompany an ankle sprain, as a lateral malleolus fracture or an avulsion fracture can happen when a small piece of bone is pulled away from the fibula by a one of the ankle ligaments. Hampton has not played since suffering the injury in Week 5 but has entered his 21-day practice window after being sent to the injured reserve. He did not play against the Raiders but could be activated in time for Monday's game. Look for Los Angeles to split carries with Kimani Vidal as they look to ease Hampton back into the mix.

Turf Burns

Marvin Harrison: Harrison was unable to finish his first game back following his emergency appendectomy. The reason for his departure was not related to his previous surgery but instead a new heel injury. A heel injury could be a variety of things including a bruised fat pad, a bone contusion of the calcaneus, or a plantar fascia injury. The Cardinals did not provide much insight on the nature of the injury, but coach Jonathan Gannon did compare the problem to the heel injury that is currently sidelining Cardinals cornerback Max Melton. As a result, it seems likely Harrison will miss his third game in the last four contests. Michael Wilson will take over at the top of the Arizona depth chart.

Aaron Jones: The Vikings veteran running back is considered day-to-day with a shoulder injury sustained in the loss to the Seahawks. He was injured on a play that resulted in a fumble and was unable to return. The team did not reveal details about the injury, but reports have suggested it is not considered serious. Look for him to be limited throughout the week ahead, with Jordan Mason becoming an intriguing waiver wire addition if he is available.

Amon-Ra St. Brown: Brown made an early exit from Detroit's Thanksgiving Day loss to the Packers and was not at practice on Monday when the team began their preparation for Thursday's game against the Cowboys. St. Brown suffered an ankle sprain that coach Dan Campbell said could sideline him for at least one week. Fortunately, the ankle is not a high ankle sprain and not considered a long-term issue. He will be evaluated throughout the limited week ahead, but anyone rostering St. Brown should have an insurance policy readily available. Jameson Williams excelled after St. Brown went out, catching seven of his 10 targets for 144 yards and a touchdown. Isaac TeSlaa also benefited from the elevated role, catching two passes for 35 yards and a touchdown.","https://res.cloudinary.com/rotowire/image/upload/ar_16:7,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto:custom_no_override,q_auto,w_800/eaiknkrbmpvvgqnikkcl.jpg",N,,2025-12-02 18:04:25.322602

The last time defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, cornerback Kenny Moore II and cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. played together was late September. By the time Moore returned from an Achilles' injury sustained in that Week 3 win over the Tennessee Titans, Ward was on injured reserve with a concussion sustained during pre-game warmups ahead of Week 6. And when Ward made it back for the Colts' Week 12 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Buckner was into his second of a minimum four games on injured reserve due to a neck injury.

Throw in the addition of cornerback Sauce Gardner ahead of Week 10, and now the calf injury he sustained early in Week 13, and the Colts have had to dip into their depth at some critical positions this season.

But that's the nature of the NFL, a league in which teams that handle attrition the best often have the best shot at contending.

""It's a part of our league,"" defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo said. ""It's a part of our league that every team has to deal with in one shape, form or fashion. So, you move on. ... I think the beauty of our place is we have depth and we trust the guys that are out there.""

At defensive tackle, Adetomiwa Adebawore has played at least 44 snaps in each of the Colts' last three games, which is a significant uptick for the 2023 fourth-round pick. He's generated 13 pressures in the last three games, per Pro Football Focus, tied with defensive end Laiatu Latu for the most on the Colts since Week 10. Veteran defensive tackle Neville Gallimore has seen his snap share tick up a bit without Buckner, too.

And at cornerback, the Colts looked to Jaylon Jones (31 snaps) and Mekhi Blackmon (46 snaps) to fill in for Gardner against the Texans.

Buckner is eligible – but not guaranteed – to come off injured reserve in Week 15, and while head coach Shane Steichen didn't have a timetable for Gardner's return, he said Monday injured reserve (which would sideline him for a minimum four games) was not something the Colts were considering.

Still, for Anarumo – and for most other coordinators around the NFL – the next few weeks will be about continuing to seek solutions on defense without key a key contributor or two for a critical stretch of the season.

""It's unfortunate with Sauce – play two, he goes down,"" Anarumo said. ""We certainly had some things cooked up, but you adjust. We have faith in the guys that are coming in the game with JJ (Jaylon Jones) and Mekhi, and you adjust when a guy like Buck goes down. So, I just think everybody in the league deals with injuries. We're no different. You just got to be able to adapt and overcome those things and try to do what the guys do best. It may change a little bit, but you try not to change the whole thing from a structural standpoint.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/rw9dn3wp5snize62r8bo,N,,2025-12-02 19:03:31.042253

Herbert said the team is optimistic and reminded everyone that he is not a doctor. This is the second time in three seasons he has hurt the non-throwing hand, and the last time the Chargers leaned heavily on shotgun snaps to protect him. For fantasy purposes the real twist is Jim Harbaugh openly prepping Trey Lance for goal-line reps. Even if Herbert suits up there is a real chance Lance gets specialty work inside the 5, which would trim Herbert’s touchdown ceiling.

Amon-Ra Trending Toward Sitting

Amon-Ra St. Brown did not practice Monday because of his ankle injury. Most reports point to a one- or two-week timeline, which means a Thursday return against the Cowboys feels unlikely. A Monday DNP sets the tone. If he is out Jameson Williams becomes the only true volume option Detroit has and would step into a featured role for fantasy.

Kyren Williams Expected to Be Fine

Sean McVay said Williams looked pretty good after Sunday’s ankle scare. Williams exited the game then returned and still punched in a touchdown. He will probably land on the injury report but the fact that he already played through it keeps expectations high for Week 14. He remains a locked-in high-volume fantasy play.

Tee Higgins Still in Protocol

Zac Taylor confirmed Higgins is still working through concussion protocol. Higgins was hurt in Week 12, which gives him a chance to clear in time for this weekend. This will be a major storyline as most leagues head into a crucial final regular season matchup. When Higgins plays he brings strong WR2 value with touchdown upside.

Aaron Jones Sr. Avoids Major Injury

Jones is believed to be day to day after hurting his shoulder in Sunday’s loss to Seattle. He left in the third quarter and never returned but early reports suggest he dodged the worst outcomes. If he can go, he would face Washington in Week 14. If not, Jordan Mason becomes the favorite for early down work with Zavier Scott taking the passing game snaps. That combo would offer fringe flex value in deeper leagues.

McCarthy Could Return Against Washington

Kevin O’Connell said J.J. McCarthy has a chance to play next week as he works through concussion protocol. He can be cleared as early as Tuesday. The matchup with Washington is softer than the brutal run he just survived but the Vikings offense has been so inconsistent that neither he nor Max Brosmer can be trusted in superflex unless you are desperate.

Dan Quinn said Daniels has not yet been cleared for functional contact although he is ripping passes in practice. The team will wait until later in the week to decide his Week 14 status. Marcus Mariota could start again if Daniels is not ready. Mariota would be a viable superflex option in a favorable matchup while Daniels would jump right back into QB1 territory if he is cleared.

Drake London Has a Shot to Return

Raheem Morris said London has a chance to play this week after missing two games with a sprained PCL. He avoided injured reserve, which kept the door open for a quick return. We need to see him practice by Wednesday. If he is active, he immediately slides back into his usual target hog role.

Mike Evans Nearing Practice Activity

Todd Bowles said it is possible that Evans practices this week. Evans broke his collarbone in Week 7 and has missed about six weeks which lines up with early timelines. The Bucs would need to designate him for return before he can officially practice, which would then start a 21-day evaluation window. Tampa is 7-5 and fighting for playoff positioning so Evans’ return would be massive. He is not guaranteed to play soon, but the arrow is finally pointing up.

Kyler Murray Will Not Be Activated This Week

Jonathan Gannon said the Cardinals will not open Murray’s return window. Murray has not played since Week 5 and eventually lost the job to Jacoby Brissett. With the Cardinals playing out the string and facing major decisions on Murray’s future there is no urgency to bring him back. We’re headed toward a divorce in the offseason.

Jayden Reed Still Waiting on Clearance

Matt LaFleur said Reed still needs final medical clearance before he can return. Reed has been practicing since the team opened his return window, but they have not yet pulled the trigger on activating him. Reed broke his collarbone in Week 2 and has barely played this season. If activated he would likely be eased back into the rotation.

MarShawn Lloyd Designated for Return

The Packers designated Lloyd for return from injured reserve. Lloyd has yet to play a snap this season because of a hamstring injury and has only appeared in one game since being drafted last year. Even if he is activated, he projects to sit behind Josh Jacobs and Emanuel Wilson, which makes him a deep stash only in dynasty formats.

That wraps up today’s Daily Dive. Herbert’s hand. Amon-Ra’s ankle. A bunch of players on the verge of returning. Fantasy managers need to stay sharp this week because playoff berths are on the line everywhere.",https://dmxvtdt4jwgem.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Amon-Ra-St.-Brown-vs-KC.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 18:04:30.986941

Just prior to the start of the 2025 regular season, Goedeke signed a four-year contract extension, rewarding his contributions on the field.
Against the Cardinals in Week 13, Goedeke played a pivotal role in opening lanes for Bucky Irving and extending blocks when quarterback Baker Mayfield scrambled.
He is a generational talent; he really helps our offense and is kind of the heartbeat of our offense.","Standout right tackle Luke Goedeke has cemented himself as a pillar on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offensive line after returning from injury. Goedeke aggravated a foot injury in Week Two against the Houston Texans, after suffering the initial injury in the season opener. He was placed on injured reserve on September 18 and missed six games.

Just prior to the start of the 2025 regular season, Goedeke signed a four-year contract extension, rewarding his contributions on the field. Originally a second-round selection out of Central Michigan in the 2022 NFL Draft, he served as the starting left guard for the first half of his rookie campaign before being moved to his natural spot at right tackle in the last game of the season. After undergoing a learning curve during his first year facing a hellacious gauntlet of talented three-techniques, Goedeke won the starting job at right tackle in 2023 and has formed a stout tandem with linemate Tristan Wirfs. Deemed the ""enforcer"" by teammates in the run game, Goedeke sets the tone.

""It is part of shaping me into who I am,"" reflected Goedeke. ""It just made me battle-tested for future adversity that I may face. It feels like it was so long ago. Just looking back on it, that was four years ago. Time in the NFL flies…It is night and day difference.""

Goedeke can play low to high with a good center of gravity and he has outstanding athleticism at the second level to create seams for rushers. He generates power from his lower body and packs a lethal punch on initial contact. Goedeke plays with a fiery competitive disposition and moves opponents off their spot. He is effective on pulls with smooth footwork and has the anchor to counter bull rushes. Against the Cardinals in Week 13, Goedeke played a pivotal role in opening lanes for Bucky Irving and extending blocks when quarterback Baker Mayfield scrambled.

""He has the dawg in him for sure,"" said Goedeke of Mayfield during the Players’ Table Show. ""He will die on the sword out there for us or on a shield out there for us. Throughout the week, I think we were all kind of a little unsure, asking, 'Is Baker going to play this week?' So, when we knew that he would play eventually, it was a big sigh of relief. He is a generational talent; he really helps our offense and is kind of the heartbeat of our offense. To have him out there, it gives you a sigh of relief, just a lot more comfortable with him out there as well.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/moaakcsso02q2vdp50qo,N,,2025-12-02 17:03:43.852171

Could that change in Week 14 against the Minnesota Vikings?
Here are the latest injury updates about Daniels and his status for Week 14 and the rest of the 2025 NFL season.
When will Jayden Daniels return?
The Commanders have not provided a definite timeline for Daniels' return.","The Washington Commanders have been without Jayden Daniels for the last three games because of an elbow injury. Could that change in Week 14 against the Minnesota Vikings?

Daniels has made slow-but-steady progress in his attempt to return from a dislocated left elbow. The second-year quarterback returned to the practice field ahead of Week 13. He hasn't yet been cleared for contact, but once he is, he may have a chance to return to that lineup.

Naturally, if Daniels is able to return, the NFL's reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year would provide Washington's offense a boost. It would also mark an improbably short comeback from an injury that many initially feared would knock him out for the season.

Here are the latest injury updates about Daniels and his status for Week 14 and the rest of the 2025 NFL season.

When will Jayden Daniels return?

The Commanders have not provided a definite timeline for Daniels' return. His status for Week 14 remains in question, as Washington coach Dan Quinn revealed during a Nov. 1 media availability the second-year quarterback had not yet been cleared for contact.

""He's still going through that process of the functional testing,"" Quinn told reporters. ""I'll have a better sense as we go through the week.""

Quinn then told reporters the team wouldn't have a concrete update on whether Daniels will potentially be able to play the team's Week 14 game against the Minnesota Vikings until Friday.

Daniels originally returned to the practice field ahead of Washington's Week 12 game against the Denver Broncos. Quinn made it clear the 24-year-old was ""unlikely to play"" but characterized his participation as a good sign.

""Man, it's good to get started and get the return to play going,"" Quinn said at a Nov. 24 media availability. ""That's a big deal for us.""

Quinn has made it clear he believes ""it's important"" for Daniels to play again in 2025, if he's healthy enough to do so. The second-year quarterback is in agreement with his coach.

""If I'm healthy, and I'm ready to go, I want to be out there,"" Daniels told reporters on Nov. 25.

Who is Commanders backup QB?

Marcus Mariota is the Commanders' backup quarterback and has temporarily replaced Daniels in the starting lineup.

Mariota, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Oregon, has posted a 1-5 record across six starts in place of Daniels. The 32-year-old has completed 63.2% of his passes for 1,359 passing yards, nine passing touchdowns and six interceptions while adding 248 yards and a score on the ground.

Mariota has a 35-45 career record across 80 starts. Before the 2025 season, he had not started an NFL game since he went 5-8 across 13 starts with the Atlanta Falcons in 2022.

Commanders QB depth chart

Daniels is one of four quarterbacks in the Washington organization. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Jayden Daniels (injured)

Marcus Mariota

Josh Johnson

Sam Hartman (practice squad)

Johnson, 39, has backed up Mariota in Daniels' absence. The veteran has played for an NFL record 14 different teams since being selected in the fifth round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He has a career record of 1-8 and last made a start for the Baltimore Ravens in 2021.

Hartman signed with the Commanders as an undrafted free agent out of Notre Dame in 2024. He hasn't yet played a regular-season snap at the NFL level.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/02/USAT/87567069007-jayden-daniels-commanders-120225.jpg?crop=3868,2178,x0,y304&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-02 15:02:42.072035

Twice in a three-game span, he attempted to come back from an injury that’s been listed as back, hip and pelvis and described as a sports hernia and “core muscle injury” over the course of the season. By any name, the ailment kept him from making it to the second half of either game without reaggravation ending his day.

The Bengals didn’t put their $30 million edge rusher on injured reserve, rather leaving the door open for his return every week.

At every Monday news conference since the injury, coach Zac Taylor has called Hendrickson “out” or “doubtful” before any hope could be mustered to even entertain a comeback to a defense in dire need of pressure off the edge.

Taylor did the same this Monday in advance of Sunday’s critical game in Buffalo, adding an underlying exasperation to his latest “week-to-week” explanation of Hendrickson’s future return possibilities.

When asked whether Hendrickson is still working behind the scenes in meetings, as normally associated with injured players, Taylor said, “mostly rehab stuff with trainers.” Not exactly a ringing endorsement.

Will he be back this season?

“We’ll just keep taking it week-to-week,” Taylor said.

All this leads to a murky, $30 million question: What exactly is going on with Hendrickson these days?

The Bengals could use extra juice in their pass rush, even if only in a subpackage of plays in high-leverage situations. Instead, those are going to 2024 sixth-round pick Cedric Johnson.

Hendrickson last spoke on the record with the media on the Monday before the trade deadline. When asked specifically about speculation that he is not playing because of his expiring contract at the end of the season and potentially lucrative free agency, he merely pointed out he wouldn’t be rushing himself back early.

“I can’t control what people’s evaluations and questions of me are,” Hendrickson said on Nov. 3. “I can only say that I have a standard for my play and I think they have a standard for their recovery process. The Jets game was a little early, in hindsight. Having unfortunate setbacks like that are kind of annoying. This is uncharted territory for me over the last four years. Navigating these will be a day-to-day process in figuring out when it is best and when the time is to get back to doing what I love.”

If there had been a diagnosis that Hendrickson would not be able to return in the following four weeks, Cincinnati could have placed him on injured reserve, saved the roster spot it has needed amid a roster crunch in recent weeks, and waited for Hendrickson to recover before clearing him back for practice.

None of that happened. Instead, every week he’s immediately ruled doubtful or out for that week’s game. Hendrickson didn’t travel with the team to Baltimore last week.

Hendrickson says he doesn’t want to have setbacks or play at a level below his highest standard. There are obvious reasons for him to have that stance rather than putting a lesser version of himself on tape as the league judges his worth.

The current view is that Hendrickson belongs among the league’s best. He led the NFL in sacks last season, finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting, racked up 39 sacks over his last 41 games and has been selected to four consecutive Pro Bowls.

Age and health will be the only factors held against an otherwise unassailable resume. He turns 31 on Friday and will hit free agency in March as one of the top players available, assuming he doesn’t receive the franchise tag. He’s played at least 15 games in all four seasons with the Bengals before this year.

“This is new territory for me,” Hendrickson said last month. “Navigating these waters of being tough but being smart is a new challenge. I am embracing this challenge; it’s different and new. I love these guys, that’s the unfortunate thing.”

This comes at the same time when an outpouring of love and admiration has been directed toward fellow captain Joe Burrow, who worked his way back a month ahead of schedule and played with special protection in the cleat to limit exposure to his left foot in an attempt to return to the field despite dwindling playoff hopes.

Coaches and players have pointed to Burrow’s willingness to play despite the pain and small chance of reaching the postseason as an inspiration for their effort. That showed in the 32-14 upset of the Ravens on Thanksgiving.

There’s always going to be a level of pain to play through and tolerance to consider when returning from any injury. Only Hendrickson knows how serious that is, and nobody on the Bengals’ staff can truly determine his pain level; they can only ask.

It’s created a confusing situation, to be sure. There is no injured reserve trip coming, which suggests a return could be soon, but instead, Hendrickson keeps being immediately declared doubtful at the start of every week. Nothing sounds imminent or shows signs of progress.

All that’s known is Hendrickson won’t be playing in Buffalo, and if the Bengals can’t find a way to beat the Bills, there likely won’t be any 2025 team goals that warrant a return to the field for the Bengals’ star edge rusher.

That trend continued Tuesday, as second-year cornerback Terrion Arnold will reportedly miss the rest of the 2025 NFL season due to shoulder surgery, according to NFL Network.

After an uneven rookie season, which earned Arnold some down-ballot Rookie of the Year award votes, the 22-year-old corner has had trouble staying on the field in Year 2. Arnold originally sustained a shoulder injury in Week 5. At the time, Lions head coach Dan Campbell expressed concern, saying Arnold could be ""out a long time"" due to the issue.

But the Lions got better news than expected after further evaluation. Arnold missed a few weeks before returning to action in Week 9. That return was short-lived, as Arnold sustain a concussion the following week, preventing him from playing in the Lions' next two contests.

He returned to face the division-rival Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving, but played just 18 snaps in the contest. Arnold recorded four tackles during the game.

On Monday, the team may have shed some light on Arnold's limited playing time in that contest, placing the second-year corner on Injured Reserve due to a shoulder injury. While that move left open the possibility Arnold could return if the team made a run in the postseason, Tuesday's report suggests that won't be the case. Arnold will reportedly miss the rest of the year due to season-ending surgery.

The Lions expected big things from Arnold when the team selected him with the No. 24 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. He experienced an up and down rookie year, allowing a 99.2 passer rating on balls thrown his way as a rookie, per SI.com.

Arnold didn't do much to prove himself in Year 2, though injuries clearly played a role in his less than stellar metrics. PFF grades Arnold as the 91st best cornerback in the NFL this season.

Despite his on-field struggles, Arnold's injury comes at a tough time for the Lions. The team briefly thought it was going to get standout center Frank Ragnow to come out of retirement for the stretch run, but the veteran failed his physical due to a hamstring injury and won't play in 2025. The team could also be without standout tight end Sam LaPorta, who underwent back surgery ahead of the team's Thanksgiving game against the Packers. Campbell said LaPorta would likely miss the rest of the season due to the issue.

Under Campbell's watch, the Lions have transformed from bottom feeder to one of the best teams in the NFL. Despite some lofty regular-season win totals, however, the Lions have yet to reach the Super Bowl under Campbell.

Even without some key players, the Lions are talented enough to rally down the stretch and emerge as a legitimate contender. But those injuries are going to make it an uphill battle for last year's No. 1 seed in the NFC.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3T2vPUioa_AIpmFoVGSJOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/abec0b30-cf97-11f0-9f68-3b06934939b6,N,,2025-12-02 16:04:31.711785

PFF's fantasy football recap focuses on player usage and stats, breaking down all the vital information you need to achieve fantasy success in 2025.

New York Giants @ New England Patriots

Rhamondre Stevenson starts for the Patriots: TreVeyon Henderson had been the primary running back for New England in each of the past four games.

New England started the season with a three-man rotation between Stevenson, Henderson and Antonio Gibson. Gibson suffered a season-ending injury, which seemed to open the door for both Stevenson and Henderson to see more playing time, but instead, Stevenson played more than 70% of the snaps from Weeks 6–8. Stevenson missed Weeks 9–11 because of an injury, during which Henderson made several big plays, running 47 times for 264 yards and four touchdowns while catching 10 passes for 66 yards and a touchdown.

Stevenson returned last week, but Henderson remained the starter. Stevenson’s primary role was as a third-down back. Henderson ran 18 times for 66 yards and caught three passes for 15 yards. He has been held under 4.0 yards per carry in three of his four games as a starter.

This week, Stevenson was back to being the lead back in all situations. Henderson rotated in more frequently than he did in Weeks 6–8, but this still marked a significant decrease for him. Henderson averaged more yards per carry, while Stevenson was more effective as a receiver, helped by a 36-yard reception.

The Patriots have their bye next week and close out the fantasy season against the Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets. The Bills and Jets are two of the top five teams in allowing fantasy points to running backs. Henderson is no longer a top-10 must-start option, but he can likely stay in fantasy lineups with those matchups. This also makes Stevenson a potential fantasy starter in those games.

Stefon Diggs plays a smaller role: The former All-Pro wide receiver played less than 50% of his team’s snaps for the second straight game.

The Patriots have stayed relatively healthy at wide receiver this season, outside of Kayshon Boutte missing a few games. They used a heavy rotation at the position through the first nine weeks, with Boutte playing 66.6% of snaps, Mack Hollins 60.9%, Diggs 55.4%, DeMario Douglas 30.3% and Kyle Williams 20.9%. The first four receivers all played more than 50% of snaps in 11 personnel, while Boutte and Hollins led the way in 12 personnel. Diggs played the second-most snaps in 11 personnel at 78.2% and the third-most snaps in two-receiver sets at 41.9%.

Boutte returned last week, and New England shifted its wide receiver strategy. Hollins and Boutte both saw their roles increase, each playing more than 80% of snaps. That included both playing more than 94% of snaps in 11 personnel and at least 87% in 12 personnel. This left Diggs playing 78.4% of snaps in 11 personnel but just one snap in 12 personnel.

This week, he played more in 12 personnel but was rotated out more often in 11 personnel than in any other game this season. Douglas was the one rotating with Diggs. While Diggs entered the week leading the team in yards per route run at 2.35, Douglas wasn’t far behind at 2.20, and Douglas’ separation numbers have been more impressive this season. Douglas narrowed the YPRR gap with three receptions for 33 yards, while Diggs caught three passes for 26 yards.

The Patriots have their bye week, then two favorable matchups in their final three games, but it will be very difficult to trust Diggs in those games, given his current role in the offense.

Monitor Tyrone Tracy Jr.’s health: Tracy suffered a hip injury in the fourth quarter and didn’t return.

Tracy has been the Giants' lead running back over the past four weeks since Cam Skattebo suffered a season-ending injury. He has played 59.5% of snaps, while Devin Singletary has played 40.8%. Those tendencies held on both early downs and third downs. Tracy had taken 100% of the late-down snaps, while Singletary had 84.4% of the short-yardage and goal-line snaps. This has given Tracy more fantasy value thanks to increased rushing and receiving production, but the gap between them hasn’t been large because Singletary has scored two goal-line touchdowns.

Tracy took all eight snaps on the first two drives, which was a change from the previous four games, as Singletary had always gotten involved early. Tracy ran the ball twice for gains of 1 yard and 2 yards. Singletary took over on the third drive and had runs of 6 and 8 yards among his first three carries. That success earned him another drive, where he continued to string together solid runs. He finished the first half with nine carries for 40 yards, while Tracy had only the two early runs.

Tracy started the second half, but the Giants were down by 23 points. He found some success early in the half, but it was too late for him to have a big game after the missed time in the first half. Singletary’s touchdowns this season have generally come on goal-line carries, but he took a direct snap for a 22-yard touchdown to open the fourth quarter. Tracy suffered a hip injury in the fourth quarter and was carted to the locker room. Singletary took over as the lead running back for the remainder of the game.

The Giants have their bye week next week and close the fantasy season with games against the Washington Commanders, Minnesota Vikings and Las Vegas Raiders. Singletary becomes a clear waiver-wire target if Tracy’s injury turns out to be serious. He would likely play more than 70% of snaps in those three games, and that is a top-10 schedule for running backs over that stretch.

Miscellaneous Notes

New England’s third-string running back and returner, Terrell Jennings, suffered a head injury on an early special teams play and was ruled out before halftime.

Patriots wide receiver Efton Chism III was back in the lineup after being a healthy inactive last week. He played five games from Week 6 to 11, primarily playing on special teams as a kick returner.

Patriots tight end Hunter Henry was limited in practice on Thursday with a toe injury.

New England tight end C.J. Dippre couldn't play due to a back injury, his second straight absence. New England had only two active tight ends, rather than finding a replacement for Dippre.

Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart was active this week after missing the last two games with a concussion. He practiced in full this week.

Wide receivers Wan’Dale Robinson (ankle) and Darius Slayton (hamstring) were limited in practice to start the week, but were able to practice in full by Saturday.

The Giants haven’t had much consistency at wide receiver from one week to the next, but this was the second straight week with Robinson as the top receiver, with Slayton and Isaiah Hodgins as the other primary receivers. The Giants used more 11 personnel than usual, leading both Slayton and Hodgins to see more playing time than in other recent weeks.

Fourth wide receiver Gunner Olszewski suffered a concussion on a second-quarter kick return and didn’t return.

The Giants activated wide receiver Dalen Cambre from the practice squad for this game on Monday.

New York wide receiver Jalin Hyatt was a healthy scratch. He was active last week, but didn’t play an offensive snap. He’s caught five passes for 35 yards this season.

Table notes

Snaps include plays called back due to penalties, including offensive holding or defensive pass interference. The other three stats have these plays removed.

Targets may differ from official NFL sources. The most likely discrepancy would be from a clear thrown-away pass, where the NFL may give the target to the nearest receiver, while this data will not.",https://media.pff.com/2025/12/Stefon-Diggs-Kyle-Williams-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2025-12-02 15:02:46.952345

Mercogliano",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6852986/2025/12/02/ny-rangers-adam-fox-injury-braden-schneider/,"1 defenseman Adam Fox out multiple weeks with a left shoulder injury, Schneider will be tested even more.
“It’s an opportunity to step up and see if I can put the big-boy pants on and do a job for us,” Schneider said.
We’ve got to show our best.” Rangers seeking ‘assertive play’ from Morrow Rookie Scott Morrow will also be called upon to help fill the void left by Fox’s injury.
“Assertive play,” Sullivan said.
Eliminating hesitation from his game.” Morrow acknowledged as much, noting “defensive reads” as the main area where he needs to show improvement.","TARRYTOWN, N.Y. — Braden Schneider has earned more and more trust from his coaches in each season of his NHL career. This year, Mike Sullivan has played the New York Rangers defenseman in what the coach called “a pretty elevated role” for an average of 18 minutes, 27 seconds per game, up from 17:52 last season.

With No. 1 defenseman Adam Fox out multiple weeks with a left shoulder injury, Schneider will be tested even more. The void presents a chance for the 24-year-old. The Rangers have held him in high regard since drafting him with the No. 19 pick in 2020, but he has yet to fully break out in a top-four role.

“It’s an opportunity to step up and see if I can put the big-boy pants on and do a job for us,” Schneider said.

Schneider moved into Fox’s spot on the top pair at practice Monday, lining up alongside left-side defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov. Sullivan said that the Rangers will have to replace Fox’s ice time by committee. Schneider, though, might see the biggest uptick in responsibility of any New York defenseman, set to play more minutes and face stiffer competition. He’s currently fifth among New York defensemen in quality of offensive opponent, according to Hockey Stat Cards, which uses colleague Dom Luszczyszyn’s Net Rating model. Gavrikov, meanwhile, leads New York’s defensemen in the metric.

“I’ve got to expect to play fast with (Gavrikov), to play hard defense with him and to try to create in the o-zone with him when we can,” Schneider said. “I think if we can be a good stalwart pair and play fast and get pucks in our forwards’ hands, I think we can be effective.”

Carson Soucy and Will Borgen, who remain the team’s second pair, will also likely have to take on tougher matchups. The Matthew Robertson-Scott Morrow third pair has a combined 40 games of NHL experience, and Sullivan has shown some hesitance to rely on Morrow early this season.

The Rangers count on Schneider much more for his defense than his offense. He has a 1.0 defensive rating, per Hockey Stat Cards, but a minus-3.2 rating on offense. In 27 games, he has five points. Schneider knows he’s not Fox offensively — “obviously we’re not going to fill that hole that he brings,” he said — but he believes he can chip in offense in more simple ways.

“For me, offense is kind of a byproduct of good defense,” Schneider said. “I’ve just got to make sure I’m doing the job physically. I’m a physical leader on this team. If I can bring that and get the pucks in our forwards’ hands, that’s my main objective.”

He also noted the importance of getting pucks through to the net. Sullivan said he needs the Gavrikov-Schneider pair to defend hard and be efficient with the puck. He doesn’t want them to change the way they play and hunt for offense with Fox out.

“I think that’s the game that they play when they’re at their best,” Sullivan said.

“We’ll try to bring our ‘A’ game,” Gavrikov added. “It’s really important right now, especially in our situation. We’ve got to be productive. We’ve got to show our best.”

Rangers seeking ‘assertive play’ from Morrow

Rookie Scott Morrow will also be called upon to help fill the void left by Fox’s injury.

The 23-year-old is a 2021 second-round pick who was part of the package the Rangers acquired in the July 1 trade that sent former top-four staple K’Andre Miller to the Carolina Hurricanes. He was an AHL All-Star last season and has a reputation as an offensive defenseman dating back to his days at the University of Massachusetts, but he was cut toward the end of his first training camp with New York and clearly has work to do to earn Sullivan’s trust.

The coach was upfront about that when asked what he needs to see from Morrow.

“Assertive play,” Sullivan said. “Making decisions with conviction and not being in between. Eliminating hesitation from his game.”

Morrow acknowledged as much, noting “defensive reads” as the main area where he needs to show improvement.

“Every defenseman who’s young kind of screws up from time to time and maybe misplaces situations,” he said. “I mean, hockey’s a very fluid game. You never really encounter the exact same situation twice, so it’s just getting those reps in my own zone, playing the rush, and just trying to learn from the things I do well and don’t do well. I watch some of the great guys on our team and just continue to hammer away at that. Be a little bit more physical. I know that’s something that the whole team’s trying to harp on right now, so if I can bring some more of that, too, that’d be big.”

Sullivan limited Morrow to a modest average of 13:37 time on ice in his first four NHL appearances of the season, which have been scattered around 12 AHL games with the Hartford Wolf Pack. Morrow called the back-and-forth “a little challenging” but said he’s feeling more comfortable lately.

The Darien, Conn., native will remain in a sheltered role in Fox’s absence, at least to start. He spent Monday’s practice skating on the bottom pair alongside Robertson while quarterbacking the second power-play unit. The Rangers are understandably hesitant to thrust a player who’s had defensive growing pains into a spot that would require tougher matchups, but with Fox expected to miss multiple weeks, there’s a runway for Morrow to prove he’s ready to take on more.

There isn’t one player who can replace Fox, but no defenseman on the roster is as similar in terms of skill set. Morrow is a right-handed shooter who’s capable of transporting pucks and creating offense, which the Rangers sorely need. Now, it’s a matter of seizing the opportunity without overthinking it.

“You’ve got to take it defense-first, and add offense wherever you can,” he said. “In the past in Carolina, there were times where I tried to force the offense – especially if it’s the third period, and you’re like, ‘Oh, I might not get another shift unless I make a play here.’ Things like that. Foxy is on LTIR. If I get in a spot where I’m not worrying about being in the lineup or getting another shift, I think it’ll ease my mind a bit. I’ll be able to settle in and kind of just play the game and let the game come to me, instead of trying to force things.”

Sullivan trying five forwards on PP1

With Morrow not on the top power-play unit, Sullivan went with a five-forward arrangement in practice Monday: Artemi Panarin in Fox’s typical spot as quarterback with Mika Zibanejad, Vincent Trocheck, J.T. Miller and Will Cuylle in front of him. Asked why he didn’t go with a defenseman — likely Morrow, Gavrikov or Schneider — running the power play as most units do, Sullivan said, “We don’t think that’s the strength of their games to this point.”

The coach also used six forwards when New York tried to score at six-on-five late in the Tampa Bay game.

Panarin said playing the point is “not really new” for him. He and Fox sometimes switched spots as power plays unfolded, and he likes the position because it allows him to play with the puck more and use his vision.

“It’s probably the best position to see the ice because you can go on both sides,” he said. “On the ice, it shows everything.”

New York’s power play has been getting results lately. It is up to 12th in the NHL with a 21.3 percent conversion rate and is nine for its past 25 (36 percent success rate). Losing Fox will be a major adjustment, though the unit should remain dangerous with Panarin at the point.

Sullivan knows a five-forward power play comes with defensive risks. Opponents, starting with Dallas on Tuesday, could look to be opportunistic shorthanded against forwards not as comfortable defending while skating backwards.

“We’re going to see how it plays out,” Sullivan said. “Obviously, we need to have some conscience on the power play with five forwards, without a doubt. And that’s a conversation that we’ll have.”

“I have to play a little safer up top, but I also can’t be too conservative,” Panarin added. “It won’t work like that. The NHL isn’t an easy league. You have to take risks.”

Notes

• Though defensive pairings drew much of the attention at Monday’s practice, Sullivan’s quest to find the right combinations for his top-six forward group is ongoing. He’s rearranged several times in recent weeks, with Monday featuring another new look. Panarin joined Zibanejad and Alexis Lafrenière on the top line, while Miller shifted to Trocheck’s left wing. Jonny Brodzinski was elevated to play right wing next to those two, while Cuylle dropped down to the third line with Noah Laba and Brett Berard.

“We’re looking for chemistry,” Sullivan explained when asked Saturday about all the juggling. “We’re looking for traction, consistency of play, all of those things. When we get it, we’ll stay with it. We’ve moved people around. There’s been people injured also. That’s been part of it. J.T. was out for a period of time. Troch was out for a bunch of games. That changes the dynamic a lot. Ideally, we’d like to settle into some consistent combinations and then build. But we just haven’t found a comfort level at this point where we see the elements that I’m talking about.”

• The Rangers called up goaltender Dylan Garand to back up Igor Shesterkin when Jonathan Quick went down with a lower-body injury, but Sullivan didn’t use him in the team’s three games last week. Notably, the coach played Shesterkin in the Boston and Tampa Bay games on back-to-back days. The team sent Garand back to AHL Hartford after the Lightning game and brought up Spencer Martin, who was at practice Monday. Martin started the year with CSKA Moscow in the KHL, then signed a two-year deal with the Rangers midseason. He was still wearing his KHL mask at Monday’s practice.

• Adam Edström left practice early Monday with a lower-body injury. Sullivan didn’t have a further update after the skate. Taylor Raddysh, meanwhile, missed practice for personal reasons.

• With Edström considered day-to-day and Raddysh’s status uncertain, the Rangers recalled forward Brennan Othmann from Hartford on Monday evening. The 22-year-old appeared in one previous NHL game this season on Oct. 26 against the Calgary Flames, but a couple defensive miscues resulted in a quick hook and eventual reassignment to the AHL.

New York has been actively listening to trade offers for the 2021 first-round pick, but his value has taken a hit based on a turbulent start to the season. Othmann has posted seven points with a minus-five rating through 15 games with Hartford, with his first goal coming in Wednesday’s 6-3 loss to the Springfield Thunderbirds.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/01162011/GettyImages-2243696258-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-02 16:04:35.916035

“Well, he’s not out for the year, but this is a very significant injury,” Breer said while appearing on NBC Sports Boston’s pregame coverage. “He has a Grade 3 MCL sprain. That essentially means his MCL is torn. It’s a four-to-six week injury.”

“One of the reasons they decided to put him on injured reserve was actually to protect him from himself,” Breer said. “They felt like because of who he is, how tough he is, the sort of competitor he is, he would push to get back earlier than that. So, this puts a governor on it. This forces him to go through a full recovery.

Coach Kevin Stefanski made the announcement Monday that Collins will have to undergo season-ending surgery.

The 10-year veteran defensive lineman sustained the non-contact injury during the third quarter. He was second on the team with 6 1/2 sacks along with 28 quarterback pressures.

Collins is also a key reason why All-Pro pass rusher Myles Garrett needs four sacks to break the NFL's single-season record of 22 1/2.

“When you lose a guy like Maliek, you don’t replace him. He’s made a big impact on this football team on the field and off,"" Stefanski said.

""We have some older guys in there (the defensive line room), but we have a bunch of young guys in there. I think they’ve learned a lot from the professional that Maliek is and I think you have to carry that with you throughout.”

Collins' injury with 9:36 remaining in the third quarter also set off a fracas between some of the Browns defensive linemen and San Francisco wide receiver Jauan Jennings. Garrett and Shelby Harris said some of Jennings' comments after the play crossed the line.

Harris didn't hide his feelings about Jennings after Sunday's game.

“He says some things that you should not say to another man, ever,” Harris said. “But I don’t respect it because you say that, then run behind your O-line. That’s some real soft (stuff), and I want that known.

“I see exactly why they punched your (groin). I’m surprised nobody punched him in the jaw yet.”

It was the second straight game Jennings drew the ire of opposing defenses. Carolina safety Tre’von Moehrig was suspended one game without pay after punching Jennings during the fourth quarter of last Monday's game.

Moehrig said he punched Jennings because of continuing physical play after the whistle and trash-talking throughout the game. Jennings walked over to Moehrig after the game, shoved and punched him in the face before both players were separated.

Jennings was fined $12,172 by the league for the punch.

Garrett said he was trying to separate everybody and find out what the problem was, before Jennings started coming at him.

“He had a lot to say that was demeaning and disparaging toward some of our players. ... I mean, some guys just roll like that,” Garrett said. ""I don’t feel like that belongs in the game. But, hey, if that works for him and them, then more power to him.""

Stefanski didn't have any comments about what occurred, saying he was focused on Collins' injury and not what was happening elsewhere on the field.

San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said on Monday that it was his understanding Jennings' comments were not about Collins, who played for the 49ers last season.

“It just sounded like there were players standing around for a while because of the injury and then they got chirping at each other. I don’t know what words were said, but it sounded like he offended some guys with the words,” Shanahan said. “I’d have to hear it to have an opinion on it. I haven’t heard what he said that offended them so much. Until I do, I don’t have much of an opinion on it. That’s just trash talk between a couple of people out on the field and I kind of leave it at that.”

Shanahan also defended Jennings' playing style despite him getting under the skin of his opponents the past couple of games.

“I think Jauan plays to the whistle as well as any player in this league. He’s extremely aggressive and plays as hard as he can to the whistle and he’s been doing that as Niner fans know and you guys know since he’s been here,” he said. “I think sometimes that offends other players and rubs people the wrong way because they’re not used to people going that hard to the whistle. But I think what JJ is very good at is not breaking rules.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/maeilek-collins-browns-AP-25335707372508,N,,2025-12-02 17:03:50.071995

,,2025-12-02 15:15:59+00:00,NFL.com,Giants QB Jaxson Dart won't change his style: Big hits 'just part of the game' - NFL.com,Kevin Patra,,,,,https://www.nfl.com/news/giants-qb-jaxson-dart-won-t-change-his-style-big-hits-just-part-of-the-game,"""Look, like, I understand the question, but this is football,"" Dart said following the 33-15 loss, via the team's official transcript.
The Giants' dynamic young quarterback was hit often Monday night, taking two sacks and the Pats picked up seven QB hits on 24 pass attempts.
Dart was adamant that he doesn't need to change his style, nor is he willing to consider that approach for fear it would hinder his game.
I feel like if I just turn into a complete pocket passer, that's just not how I want to play the game.
Interim coach Mike Kafka didn't scrutinise the play from his quarterback, even the big hits.","Missing two games due to a concussion isn't going to alter Jaxson Dart's game.

The rookie returned to the lineup Monday night against the New England Patriots, and almost immediately got blasted. During a first-quarter scamper up the sideline, Dart declined to step out of bounds, got lit up by Christian Elliss, and was sent flying into the bench area. It was a legal hit, but Dart's teammates took exception, with tight end Theo Johnson getting flagged for unnecessary roughness.

""Look, like, I understand the question, but this is football,"" Dart said following the 33-15 loss, via the team's official transcript. ""Like, I'm going to get hit if I'm in the pocket or outside the pocket. I feel like I played this way my whole entire life. It shouldn't be any shocker to anybody if you followed along with my career. We're not playing soccer out here. You're going to get hit. Things happen. It's just part of the game.""

Dart added that the hit ""didn't hurt, so that didn't play any thought in my mind.""

The Giants' dynamic young quarterback was hit often Monday night, taking two sacks and the Pats picked up seven QB hits on 24 pass attempts. Dart also ran four times for 20 yards. He finished 17 of 24 passing for 139 yards with one touchdown toss.

The quarterback has been a breath of fresh air for a franchise that has lived in the cellar much of the past decade. However, there is concern that his style of play won't afford him a long career. He's been checked for concussions in multiple games this season before missing the past two tilts while in the league's procotol.

Dart was adamant that he doesn't need to change his style, nor is he willing to consider that approach for fear it would hinder his game.

""My body feels good. I got knocked out of the game against Chicago on a fluke play,"" he said. ""You watch the hit, I lose control of the ball and I don't brace myself because I'm trying to re-catch the ball. It's not because of the hit. It's because I lost the ball. So just like any other league, you take new steps, there's bigger, faster players. My body feels good. I'm going to play aggressive. I feel like if I just turn into a complete pocket passer, that's just not how I want to play the game. I feel like there's an advantage to me using my legs.""

Interim coach Mike Kafka didn't scrutinise the play from his quarterback, even the big hits.

""Obviously, don't want him to take any hits that are unnecessary, but he was working his way out of bounds,"" Kafka said.

Dart insisted that he doesn't need to change how he plays, noting that he did slide on several runs.

""Like I said, I played like this my whole life,"" he said. ""Turn on my high school tape, turn on my college tape, it's not a shocker to anybody. It's how I've played. I felt like if you just watch the game, like, I did slide. I did avoid a lot of hits, so you're going to get hit. It's football.""

Yet, NFL players are bigger, faster, stronger than anything Dart has faced, even during his SEC days.

It's natural for a player to want to hang on to an aspect of his game that makes him dynamic. But growth and development in avoiding big hits are needed to ensure he's not a flash in the pan, like so many other quarterbacks before him.

""I told him earlier [Monday], be smart, protect ourselves. Obviously, he's not going to listen because he's just so competitive, loves the contact,"" Giants offensive lineman Jon Runyan said. ""That's just how he is. We're just going to have to keep talking to him. Maybe he'll listen to us one of these days.""",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/umbx9xevfi9rhme9wl3i,N,,2025-12-02 12:05:42.547533

The 23-year-old recorded a career-best 35 receiving yards and scored his second touchdown on Thanksgiving after St. Brown's injury.","The Detroit Lions didn't just lose their Thanksgiving Day game against the Green Bay Packers in 2025. They also lost one of their key offensive players.

Wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown exited the game in the first quarter after suffering an ankle injury when a lineman rolled on his leg from behind while he was engaged in blocking a defender.

St. Brown was able to walk off the field under his own power but quickly headed to the locker room. He was walking with a slight limp and was ruled out for the remainder of the contest after initially being deemed ""questionable"" to return.

The good news for the Lions? St. Brown's injury doesn't appear to be long-term. That said, with the team playing a second consecutive Thursday game, his status entering Week 14 will bear watching as the Lions look to work their way back into the NFC playoff picture.

Here's what to know about St. Brown's injury and when he could return to the field.

Is Amon-Ra St. Brown playing Week 14 vs. Cowboys?

The Lions have not yet announced whether St. Brown will be available for the team's Week 14 game against the Cowboys.

St. Brown didn't practice on Dec. 1, according to the Lions' injury report.

It isn't clear exactly when Detroit will announce a decision on St. Brown's status. That said, ESPN's Adam Schefter said in a Dec. 1 appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" he expects the Lions to wait to make a decision about St. Brown's status until closer to the game.

""I don't think they'll be ready to rule him out quick,"" Schefter said. ""Maybe they will, but I think he's gonna give it a chance to be able to try to be able to play on Thursday. I'm not telling you he will, but this is guy is very, very tough.""

NFL fans will have a better understanding of St. Brown's potential availability based on the Lions' practice reports. Those will be released Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday ahead of the team's ""Thursday Night Football"" game against the Cowboys.

If St. Brown can practice on a full basis early in the week, he may be able to suit up without missing any extra action. If he's limited or a non-participant, it may be difficult for him to suit up for Detroit's second consecutive Thursday game.

Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update

St. Brown was originally classified as ""week-to-week"" after suffering a low ankle sprain in the Lions' Thanksgiving loss to the Green Bay Packers, per NFL Media's Tom Pelissero.

While St. Brown is considered week-to-week because of his ankle injury, Pelissero reports the 26-year-old receiver should avoid being placed on injured reserve. That means the Lions expect St. Brown to return to action without having to miss the minimum four games required by such a stint.

Pelissero also noted the Lions will have a mini-bye after Week 14, which will allow St. Brown some extra rest should Detroit need to hold him out. That could help the fifth-year veteran return to the field quickly, even if he isn't able to suit up against the Cowboys.

Lions WR depth chart

The Lions have six receivers on their 53-man roster, but just two are presently healthy. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Amon-Ra St. Brown (injured)

Jameson Williams

Kalif Raymond (injured)

Isaac TeSlaa

Tom Kennedy

Dominic Lovett

As long as St. Brown remains out of action, Williams will be Jared Goff's top target. The 2022 first-round pick has generated 706 yards and six touchdowns on 38 receptions this season and will use his blazing speed to get open and make big plays.

TeSlaa, a rookie third-round pick out of Arkansas, could also be more involved in Detroit's offense. The 23-year-old recorded a career-best 35 receiving yards and scored his second touchdown on Thanksgiving after St. Brown's injury. His 6-4, 214-pound frame and elite-level catch radius will make him a legitimate red-zone threat if he sees increased opportunities.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/01/USAT/87553626007-amon-ra-st-brown-lions-120125.jpg?crop=6613,3723,x10,y36&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-02 12:05:50.947462

Chargers: Herbert has missed only four games in his career, all coming after he broke a finger on his left hand late in the 2023 season.","INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Justin Herbert broke a bone in his non-throwing hand during the Los Angeles Chargers' first offensive series Sunday. After covering it with a hard cast and a white glove, he spent the rest of the afternoon exclusively taking shotgun snaps and handing off to his running backs whenever possible.

By the time Maxx Crosby knocked Herbert to the ground in pure frustration over yet another third-down conversion in the fourth quarter, the quarterback and his Chargers firmly had the upper hand in this long-simmering rivalry.

Herbert threw touchdown passes to Quentin Johnston and Ladd McConkey, and Kimani Vidal made a 59-yard scoring run during a 31-14 victory over the spiraling Las Vegas Raiders.

Vidal rushed for a career-high 126 yards for the Chargers (8-4), who snapped back from an embarrassing loss at Jacksonville and won for their fourth win in five games to keep pressure on the Denver Broncos atop the AFC West. Los Angeles improved to 4-0 in the division.

Herbert will have surgery Monday on the unspecified broken bone on the back of his left hand, but he is optimistic he won't miss any playing time down the stretch.

“I did my best to go out there and take care of business, and I thought we ran the ball really well, so it was really cool to see,” Herbert said. “I'm treating it as if I'm playing (next) Monday.”

Jaret Patterson rushed for his first NFL touchdown since 2021 with 1:55 to play, helping Los Angeles beat its longtime West Coast rivals for the fourth straight time. The Chargers' comfortable victory underlined the current gulf between the Bolts and the Raiders (2-10), who had less support in the SoFi Stadium crowd than in past seasons.

Herbert didn't put up big numbers after he injured his left hand, apparently when he was thrown to the ground by Jeremy Chinn. Johnston fought through contact to score a 10-yard TD one play later, but Herbert went to the locker room and missed part of the next series.

“He's as tough as they come,” Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said.

Herbert finished 15 of 20 for 151 yards, improving on his career-low 81 yards passing against the Jaguars despite throwing a goal-line interception to Kyu Blu Kelly shortly after his return to the game. He threw only eight passes after halftime, but led a determined offense that converted 12 of its 17 third downs.

Geno Smith passed for 165 yards and threw two touchdown passes to Brock Bowers in the sixth consecutive loss by the Raiders, who have just one victory since Week 1.

At least the Raiders’ long-struggling offense showed mild improvement in its first game under interim offensive coordinator Greg Olson after high-priced Chip Kelly was fired a week ago.

Las Vegas’ 82-yard TD drive in the second quarter was the offense’s longest in four weeks, and the Raiders topped 10 points for the fourth time in eight games when Bowers made a ridiculous one-handed TD grab with 7:49 to play.

“No one knows how hard it is to step into that role when you haven’t been all season,"" Smith said of Olson's first game as play-caller. ""To speak new terminology, to try to get players involved in the game ... but I thought he did a great job, and I’m really appreciative.”

But four-time Pro Bowl selection Crosby exemplified the Raiders' mood when he inexplicably floored Herbert at midfield several seconds after Herbert hit Johnston for a first down with 3:55 to play. The penalty handed 15 yards to the Bolts on a drive that ended in Patterson's TD.

“I was hot about that,” Chargers safety Derwin James said. “I've got a good relationship with Maxx. I know he ain't that type of player. Hopefully he didn't try to do it on purpose.”

Herbert acknowledged he might have been celebrating his completion with a bit more zeal than necessary before he was knocked down by Crosby, who didn't speak to reporters.

“He had been getting after us all day, so I think it was just one of those plays where emotions got the best of him,” Herbert said. “I've got a ton of respect for him as a player.”

Tuli Tuipulotu had two of the Chargers’ five sacks while they limited the Raiders to 156 total yards, including just 31 on the ground.

Raiders coach Pete Carroll was proud of his defense's resilience in the first half, but felt the Bolts took control with Vidal's long TD run 57 seconds after halftime.

“I think we had three guys there that could make the play,"" Carroll said. “It winds up being a (59)-yard touchdown play. That was a backbreaking play in the game. And then we needed to respond, and we didn’t have it to respond, and so they get up by a couple scores, and that plays into their hands.”

The Chargers went up 21-7 on McConkey's 7-yard TD catch late in the third quarter.

Herbert is considered day-to-day, according to the Chargers, who added that his status for their Week 14 home game against the Philadelphia Eagles will be determined later this week.

Herbert was hurt in Sunday's win over the visiting Las Vegas Raiders and said afterward he was preparing like he'd be playing against Philadelphia.

The injury occurred in the first quarter, when Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn hit Herbert on a scramble. Chinn's helmet appeared to connect directly with Herbert's left hand. Herbert stayed in the game, clearly favoring the hand, and threw a touchdown to wide receiver Quentin Johnston on the next play. The signal-caller then went to the locker room with athletic trainers and missed nine plays while a hard cast and glove were applied to his left hand.

Herbert said the most challenging part of continuing to compete was holding on to the football; because of that, the Chargers played the remainder of the game out of the shotgun and pistol formations.

Coach Jim Harbaugh said the Chargers will prepare backup quarterback Trey Lance this week for under-center goal-line scenarios, whenever necessary. Typically, Herbert takes all of the team's first-team reps, but Harbaugh said Lance will get time with the starters in those specific packages.

""That'll be a point of emphasis this week,"" Harbaugh said Monday.

Harbaugh also marveled at Herbert's ability to play through the injury.

""There's never any grimace or flinch,"" Harbaugh said. ""It's pretty amazing.""

Two seasons ago, Herbert fractured the middle finger on his left hand also against the Raiders. The Chargers primarily played out of the shotgun to manage that injury.

""I think in terms of experience, I've gone through similar things, and so I think it'll be helpful,"" he said. ""But at the end of the day, just got to go out there and make sure that everything is good, you're comfortable.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1201%2Fr1583102_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 16:04:39.120823

1. New England Patriots (11-2)

Week 13 result: Beat the Giants 33-15

>Week 13 ranking: 2

X factor for final stretch: Defensive tackle Christian Barmore

With starting DTMilton Williams on injured reserve because of a high ankle sprain for at least the next two games and No. 3 DT Khyiris Tonga slowed by a chest injury from Week 12, more of the burden falls on Barmore. Through the first nine weeks, the Patriots hadn't allowed an opposing running back to gain 50 rushing yards in a game. But in Weeks 10-12, Patriots opponents averaged more than 5.0 yards a carry. -- Mike Reiss

2. Los Angeles Rams (9-3)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Panthers 31-28

>Week 13 ranking: 1

X factor for final stretch: LinebackerByron Young

This Sunday showed just how important the Rams' pass rush has been to their success on defense. That group has been particularly helpful to an injury-riddled secondary by pressuring opposing quarterbacks. Young is the leader -- at least in sacks -- of their pass rush with a career-high 10 this season. The 2023 third-round pick is also setting himself up for a big contract extension, which he's eligible for after the season. -- Sarah Barshop

3. Denver Broncos (10-2)

Week 13 result: Beat the Commanders 27-26 (OT)

>Week 13 ranking: 3

X factor for final stretch: Running back RJ Harvey

With J.K. Dobbins on injured reserve (foot), Harvey is clearly the team's RB1 and the only ""big'' back on the roster at 205 pounds -- no other player at the position is over 200 pounds. He has shown improvement in pass protection, so that should give him some additional third-down snaps in the weeks ahead. But the Broncos need him at his decisive best as a runner if their run game is going to be more than ornamental. -- Jeff Legwold

4. Seattle Seahawks (9-3)

Week 13 result: Beat the Vikings 26-0

>Week 13 ranking: 5

X factor for final stretch: Wide receiver/returner Rashid Shaheed

Not long after acquiring Shaheed from the Saints last month, the Seahawks had to put rookie receiver/punt returner Tory Horton on injured reserve. While the trade has proved to be timely, it has yet to be as impactful as Seattle envisioned. Shaheed has only 73 scrimmage yards on nine touches in four games with the Seahawks. But among the reasons they gave up fourth- and fifth-round picks for one of the NFL's premier deep threats was to give opposing defenses someone else to worry about other than Jaxon Smith-Njigba. If teams follow Minnesota's lead and bottle up the league's leading receiver, Seattle will need Shaheed to step up. -- Brady Henderson

5. Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)

Week 13 result: Beat the Lions 31-24

>Week 13 ranking: 7

X factor for final stretch: Wide receiver Jayden Reed

The Packers aren't just getting back another receiver soon. They're getting back their leading receiver in each of the past two seasons. Reed hasn't played since he broke his collarbone in Week 2. He underwent surgery to repair that, as well as a fracture in his foot, and is expected to return either this week against the Bears or next week against the Broncos. Reed is the Packers' most versatile receiver and should make their passing game even more difficult to defend down the stretch. -- Rob Demovsky

6. Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Bears 24-15

>Week 13 ranking: 4

X factor for final stretch: Running back Saquon Barkley

The reigning Offensive Player of the Year has had a difficult time getting going in 2025. He is on pace for 1,048 rushing yards, just about half of his production from hisrecord-breaking 2024 season (2,005). He has faced more stacked boxes and is running behind an offensive line that hasn't been as buttoned up as last season's group. The ground game is vital to Philadelphia's operation. The Eagles need to figure out how to unlock Barkley if they have designs on making another run. -- Tim McManus

7. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)

Week 13 result: Beat the Browns 26-8

>Week 13 ranking: 9

X factor for final stretch: Returner Skyy Moore

Moore's emergence over the past month has played a crucial role in San Francisco's special teams turnaround. He ranks fifth in the NFL in yards per kick return (28.1) and 11th in yards per punt return (12.1). He has nearly scored on one of each and has said repeatedly it's just a matter of time until he takes one all the way. The Niners need contributions from all over the roster in order to make up for what they've lost to injury, so Moore could be particularly important down the stretch. -- Nick Wagoner

8. Chicago Bears (9-3)

Week 13 result: Beat the Eagles 24-15

>Week 13 ranking: 11

X factor for final stretch: Cornerback Nahshon Wright

Wright is a big reason the Bears lead the NFL in takeaways (26). The backup-turned-starter for 11 of 12 games is second on the team in interceptions (five), including the Bears' only pick-six. He also has three fumble recoveries and a forced fumble. Considering the Bears' lack of consistent pass rush, they will continue to lean on Wright to earn extra possessions. Those instinctive plays, such as a forced fumble on the Eagles' tush push Friday, are keeping Wright on the field even as the rest of the Chicago secondary gets healthy at a critical time. -- Courtney Cronin

9. Buffalo Bills (8-4)

Week 13 result: Beat the Steelers 26-7

>Week 13 ranking: 10

X factor for final stretch: Running back James Cook III

The Bills' rushing attack -- fueled by Cook and his offensive line and coached by Aaron Kromer -- has been a vital piece of the team's success. To secure a spot in the postseason, the Bills need production on the ground when their inconsistent passing game falls short. Three of the Bills' four losses have come when Cook rushes for fewer than 100 yards. The team is 0-4 when he has fewer than 20 carries. -- Alaina Getzenberg

10. Indianapolis Colts (8-4)

Week 13 result:Lost to the Texans 20-16

>Week 13 ranking: 6

X factor for final stretch: Running back Jonathan Taylor

The Colts are 5-0 when Taylor rushes for 100 yards or more. That's a bit of an oversimplification because he tends to close out wins by running the ball and chewing up clock. But there's a relationship between the Colts having an efficient offensive performance and Taylor being productive. In recent weeks, neither has been true, and Indy has lost three of four, with Taylor averaging 62.7 yards in those losses. -- Stephen Holder

11. Detroit Lions (7-5)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Packers 31-24

>Week 13 ranking: 8

X factor for final stretch: Defensive end Aidan Hutchinson

The Lions are still fighting for a playoff spot after entering the season with high expectations as Super Bowl contenders. Detroit's pass rush has struggled with just four sacks over the past four games; Hutchinson had 1.5 sacks in a rough November. The Lions need Hutchinson, and the defense, to find a groove. ""Look, we have five games left of the regular season. We're at a point where there's some adversity for sure,"" he said during Sunday's practice. ""We call ourselves a gritty team, it's all over this building. It's what people say about us, but I think it's easy to be gritty when you're winning games and it's all sunshine and rainbows."" -- Eric Woodyard

12. Houston Texans (7-5)

Week 13 result: Beat the Colts 20-16

>Week 13 ranking: 16

X factor for final stretch: Quarterback C.J. Stroud

The Texans have an elite defense that's the No. 1 scoring unit in the league (16.4 points per game allowed). So all Houston needs is an effective offense, led by Stroud, that can score 24 points per game. Usually, that's all the defense needs to capture the win -- it has given up more than 20 points in only two games. Stroud admitted he was a ""little rusty"" in his return from a concussion Sunday, but the Texans need him to return to form with a defense that could power them to another divisional title and potentially a deep playoff run. -- DJ Bien-Aime

13. Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4)

Week 13 result: Beat the Titans 25-3

>Week 13 ranking: 14

X factor for final stretch: Defensive end Josh Hines-Allen

It took Hines-Allen 11 weeks to get his third sack, which gave him a franchise-record 56 for his career. In the past two weeks, however, he has had three sacks and a league-high 16 QB pressures -- one more than Cleveland's Myles Garrett. The Jaguars need Hines-Allen to maintain that surge because of injuries to defensive end Travon Walker (knee) and defensive tackle Arik Armstead (hand). Walker hasn't practiced in two weeks, and Armstead couldn't play with a cast on his hand against the Titans. Hines-Allen will have to carry the pass rush, especially in Sunday's critical game against Indianapolis with the AFC South lead on the line. -- Mike DiRocco

14. Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)

Week 13 result: Beat the Raiders 31-14

>Week 13 ranking: 13

X factor for final stretch: Running back Omarion Hampton

The 2025 first-round pick has been on injured reserve since Week 5 because of a left ankle fracturebut could return to the field as early as Monday against the Eagles. Hampton had been a consistent, bruising force on the ground and a safety valve in the passing game for Herbert. Hampton caught 17 passes from Weeks 3 to 5, tied for second most on the team with wide receiver Keenan Allen. Hampton was also third in the NFL in yards from scrimmage (364) over that span. His return should jump-start this offense at a crucial part of the season. -- Kris Rhim

15. Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1)

Week 13 result: Beat the Chiefs 31-28

>Week 13 ranking: 19

X factor for final stretch: Cornerback Trevon Diggs

Diggs hasn't played since mid-October, but he was designated for return from injured reserve Sunday. He suffered a concussion in an at-home accident and was placed on injured reserve to help right knee soreness that had developed. He was not playing at his prior Pro Bowl level before going on IR, but perhaps he can find that form in a Cowboys defense that has improved with the additions of Quinnen Williams, DeMarvion Overshown,Shavon Revel Jr.and Logan Wilson. Diggs would provide another playmaker as the Cowboys fight for a playoff spot. -- Todd Archer

16. Kansas City Chiefs (6-6)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Cowboys 31-28

>Week 13 ranking: 12

X factor for final stretch: Wide receiver Rashee Rice

After missing the first six games while serving a suspension, Rice has been a difference-maker for quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Alongside tight end Travis Kelce, Rice will need to continue to elevate his play, in particular his ability to gain yards after the catch, to keep the Chiefs' playoff hopes alive. Mahomes will likely need to rely even more on short passes to Rice because Kansas City is dealing with numerous injuries along its offensive line. -- Nate Taylor

17. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5)

Week 13 result: Beat the Cardinals 20-17

>Week 13 ranking: 15

X factor for final stretch: Running back Bucky Irving

Since entering the league last season, Irving has a missed tackles forced rate of 35.2%, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. That's the best rate among players with 250 or more carries over that span. With quarterback Baker Mayfield dealing with a shoulder injury to his non-throwing arm andChris Godwin Jr. just now getting healthy, the Bucs have needed Irving to move the chains. And as Mayfield put it, "" [ Irving ] gets a lot of attention whether he's getting the ball or not. The play's never over -- it doesn't have to be blocked up perfect."" -- Jenna Laine

18. Carolina Panthers (7-6)

Week 13 result: Beat the Rams 31-28

>Week 13 ranking: 20

X factor for final stretch: Quarterback Bryce Young

When Young plays well and limits turnovers, the Panthers have a chance. The past two weeks are prime examples. He had three touchdown passes and a season-high passer rating of 147.1 against the Rams on Sunday. The week before that, Young had two picks and a passer rating of 60.8 in a loss to San Franciscowhen the defense played well enough to win. With teams stacking up against the run, Young has to perform well in the passing game. -- David Newton

19. Baltimore Ravens (6-6)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Bengals 32-14

>Week 13 ranking: 17

X factor for final stretch: Quarterback Lamar Jackson

The Ravens need Jackson to return to form if they have any hope of making the postseason. Since 2018, he has the best regular-season record in December and January at 22-4, throwing 53 touchdowns and eight interceptions. In order for him to reach that level again, he has to break out of a career-worst slump. Over the past three games, he has completed less than 60% of his passes and hasn't produced a touchdown -- his longest drought since becoming a starter. The Ravens don't necessarily need MVP Lamar, but they can't overcome another meltdown like his Thanksgiving performance. -- Jamison Hensley

20. Miami Dolphins (5-7)

Week 13 result: Beat the Saints 21-17

>Week 13 ranking: 22

X factor for final stretch: Running back De'Von Achane

If you've seen just one Dolphins game this season, you know how important Achane is to the offense. He ranks third in the NFL with 1,034 rushing yards and sixth with 1,404 scrimmage yards. He is the only Dolphins player with more than 60 touches, having caught or carried the ball 240 times this season. As Miami has turned into a top rushing offense over the past month, its long-shot run to the playoffs will go as far as the third-year back can take them -- especially if quarterbackTua Tagovailoa and the passing game continue to struggle. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

21. Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Bills 26-7

>Week 13 ranking: 18

X factor for final stretch: Quarterback Aaron Rodgers

With so many areas of concern, it's hard to pin down one player as the team's X factor entering this crucial stretch. Rodgers, though, is a good place to start. The offense mustered a season low of points against the Bills and possessed the ball for just 18 minutes. The defense has glaring issues, too. But if Rodgers and the offense can sustain drives, that could alleviate the load carried by the defense. -- Brooke Pryor

22. Cincinnati Bengals (4-8)

Week 13 result: Beat the Ravens 32-14

>Week 13 ranking: 25

X factor for final stretch: Linebacker Barrett Carter

Very few rookies are shouldering as much of their team's hopes as Carter. The fourth-round pick out of Clemson is the starting middle linebacker and relays the team's defensive playcalls. Defensive coordinator Al Golden noted that Carter did a good job of operating the run defense in the team's Week 12 loss to the Patriots. Cincinnati built on that performance with a five-takeaway outing against Baltimore. If the Bengals' defense can play well with Carter in the middle, Cincinnati will hang around the playoff conversation. -- Ben Baby

23. Washington Commanders (3-9)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Broncos 27-26 (OT)

>Week 13 ranking: 24

X factor for final stretch: Wide receiver Deebo Samuel

Samuel is playing for a new contract, which could be in Washington -- depending on how he finishes. Age will be a factor, as he turns 30 in January; it was a sticking point in the Terry McLaurin negotiations. Samuel leads the team with 58 catches for 534 yards and five touchdowns. He's on pace to top his career high of 77 catches from 2021. Washington needs to upgrade its receivers with more explosiveness, which Samuel has improved. But he could be an interesting free agent target for other teams. McLaurin will earn $18.35 million in 2026, leaving Washington with at least $90 million in cap space, so it can afford another expensive signing at receiver. But any deal for Samuel must make sense. -- John Keim

24. Minnesota Vikings (4-8)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Seahawks 26-0

>Week 13 ranking: 21

X factor for final stretch: Quarterback J.J. McCarthy

The Vikings are all but eliminated from the playoffs, so their most important organizational priority is to decide whether they need a new quarterback for 2026. The Vikings are unlikely to give up on McCarthy, the No. 10 pick in 2024. But they will be forced to face some difficult decisions if he doesn't reverse what has been the worst performance by any starting quarterback this season. Should they pair him with a short-term veteran who could replace him if 2026 starts poorly? Do they need to acquire someone to start, pushing McCarthy's timeline back to 2027? These are by far the most important questions for the franchise. -- Kevin Seifert

25. Atlanta Falcons (4-8)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Jets 27-24

>Week 13 ranking: 23

X factor for final stretch: Wide receiver Darnell Mooney

After Mooney garnered nearly 1,000 receiving yards last season, this has been something of a lost year. He broke his collarbone in the first practice of training camp and has yet to find any consistency since returning in Week 2. Mooney seemed to turn the corner in Week 12 with a 49-yard touchdown catch from quarterback Kirk Cousinsbut then had just two catches for 25 yards against the Jets. He carries a cap hit of more than $18 million next season, so he could force the Falcons into a tough decision if he doesn't show a return to form. -- Marc Raimondi

26. Arizona Cardinals (3-9)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Buccaneers 20-17

>Week 13 ranking: 26

X factor for final stretch: Tight end Trey McBride

McBride has established himself as Mr. Consistent. Sunday was his 14th straight game with five or more receptions, a new Cardinals record and the second most in NFL history behind Travis Kelce's 15 straight games in 2018. With McBride's versatility, he can be a playmaker off the line or split wide, causing mismatches wherever he is on the field. With receiverMarvin Harrison Jr.'s heel a concern and uncertainty around Kyler Murray's return from IR, McBride is Arizona's most stable playmaker. -- Josh Weinfuss

27. Cleveland Browns (3-9)

Week 13 result: Lost to the 49ers 26-8

>Week 13 ranking: 28

X factor for final stretch: Quarterback Shedeur Sanders

Sanders, a fifth-round pick, will make his third straight start against the Titans, and ESPN's Adam Schefter previously reported that the Browns are open to giving Sanders an extended look for the rest of the season. He has shown flashes in his two starts (60% completion rate, two touchdown passes) and will have an opportunity to leave a lasting impression on Cleveland's decision-makers ahead of the offseason. The team has two first-round picks in the 2026 draft. -- Daniel Oyefusi

28. New York Jets (3-9)

Week 13 result: Beat the Falcons 27-24

>Week 13 ranking: 30

X factor for final stretch: Defensive end Will McDonald IV

McDonald, a 2023 first-round pick, is on pace for his second double-digit sack season, but he has had stretches of inconsistency. Four of his seven sacks came in Week 10 against the Browns. His pressure percentage of 11.7% is down from last season's 16.3%, per NFL Next Gen Stats. The Jets have to make a decision on McDonald's fifth-year option by May. Right now, it's projected at $14.9 million (fully guaranteed) for 2027. -- Rich Cimini

29. New York Giants (2-11)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Patriots 33-15

>Week 13 ranking: 27

X factor for final stretch:LinebackerKayvon Thibodeaux

Thibodeaux missed his third straight game Monday night because of a shoulder injury, and he has just 2.5 sacks in 10 games. The edge rusher started 2025 strong, but the injury has hurt his value moving forward. Thibodeaux has a fifth-year option in 2026, but he could have been up for a new contract had this season gone well. Now, it will be interesting to see how he finishes on the field. It could go a long way in determining his future with the team. -- Jordan Raanan

30. New Orleans Saints (2-10)

Week 13 result:Lost to the Dolphins 21-17

>Week 13 ranking: 29

X factor for final stretch: Wide receiver Chris Olave

The Saints' last win came when Olave had his only 100-yard game of the season in Week 10 against the Panthers. The Saints are down two receivers now that Brandin Cooks and Rashid Shaheed are goneand running back Alvin Kamara is hurt. That means there aren't a lot of pass-catching options for rookie quarterback Tyler Shough. Devaughn Vele had his best game as a Saint against the Dolphins, but the Saints need Olave to get their offense going.-- Katherine Terrell

31. Las Vegas Raiders (2-10)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Chargers 31-14

>Week 13 ranking: 31

X factor for final stretch: Wide receiver Jack Bech

Wide receiver is among the long list of needs the Raiders will address in the offseason. But with Las Vegas out of the postseason picture, the final five weeks of the season should open the door for its rookie second-round pick to prove he can be a meaningful contributor in 2026. Bech has only 10 catches for 114 yards, though eight of those receptions resulted in first downs. The former TCU standout has upside. It's a matter of the coaching staff allowing him to showcase his potential in the coming weeks. -- Ryan McFadden

32. Tennessee Titans (1-11)

Week 13 result: Lost to the Jaguars 25-3

>Week 13 ranking: 32

X factor for final stretch: Defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons

Despite missing two games, Simmons has 6.5 sacks and is on pace for his first double-digit-sack season. He leads the Titans with 29 quarterback pressures (second most among DTs in the NFL), 12 of which came against double-teams. Simply put, as he goes, the Titans' defense goes. Simmons' ability to beat double-teams allows other defensive linemen to get one-on-one matchups. And his impact extends beyond the pass rush. He's consistently making plays behind the line of scrimmage, as shown by his 10 tackles for loss. -- Turron Davenport

""I think it's a strain,"" Gardner said.","The Indianapolis Colts made the most surprising move of the NFL trade deadline, acquiring star corner Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets. Just three games into his tenure with the Colts, Gardner is dealing with an injury.

The 25-year-old corner left Sunday's 20-16 loss to the Houston Texans after just three plays with a calf injury. An MRI on Monday confirmed Gardner did not injure his Achilles. He's reportedly considered week-to-week with a calf strain and hopes to return before the end of the regular season, per NFL Network.

Gardner was injured while trying to cover Texans tight end Cade Stover. During the play, Gardner started limping on the field. It was unclear when he suffered the injury during the play.

He laid on the field after the play and needed help walking off. Gardner initially went into the blue medical tent on the sideline before limping to the Colts' locker room. The Colts originally deemed him questionable to return.

That changed at the start of the second quarter. When the broadcast came back from a commercial break, Gardner was on the sideline in street clothes with a walking boot on his left foot. Gardner was later spotted using crutches to get around on the sideline.

The Colts ruled him out for the rest of the contest.

Gardner: 'I think it's a strain'

After the contest, Gardner told reporters that he think's he's dealing with a calf strain and not an Achilles injury.

""I think it's a strain,"" Gardner said. ""Felt like I got shot in the calf. But it was, like high. ... I don't think it's, like, an Achilles.""

Gardner was then asked to clarify if he avoided an Achilles injury.

""I wouldn't just say, like avoid,"" Gardner said. ... ""I don't think that's what it is.""

Gardner confirmed that he was scheduled to undergo further diagnostic testing of the injury.

Since entering the NFL in 2022, Gardner has proven to be one of the best corners in the league. He won the Defensive Rookie of the Year award and was a first-team All-Pro. Gardner's strong play continued in his second season, as he once again was a First-team All-Pro.

Gardner turned in yet another solid year in 2024 and was out to a strong start with the Jets before his shocking trade to the Colts at the deadline.

Prior to 2025, Gardner has been a durable player, missing just three games in his first three seasons.

Head coach Mike Vrabel’s side defeated the New York Giants by a score of 33-15 to get there at Gillette Stadium.

Here’s a glance back on Monday’s 8:15 p.m. ET kickoff as the bye week awaits.

Maye cruises to 10 in a row

The road to an 11-2 record required a 10th win in a row. It also required Drake Maye.

The Patriots quarterback completed 24-of-31 passes for 282 yards against the Giants. Making the difficult appear easy, his night brought two early touchdowns and no turnovers.

Taking the field “11” personnel, New England’s opening drive stretched a dozen plays. It ended with a third-and-goal incompletion on a corner route and a field goal. That had been an all-too-familiar outcome in the red zone for a team ranked in the middle of the pack there entering Monday. But quickly back on the field with a 10-0 lead in hand, a fading goal-line touchdown to wide receiver Kayshon Boutte was the result next time out. With that, the Patriots stood with 17 points through only 16 offensive snaps.

The 23-year-old MVP candidate under center kept cruising. Against the blitz, Maye connected with rookie wideout Kyle Williams’ track speed on the perimeter. A clean release off the line of scrimmage was met by perfect ball placement for a 33-yard touchdown strike to the Washington State product.

The score read 30-7 at halftime. Maye had a 143.1 passer rating as well as 10.4 yards per pass attempt by then. Heading out of it, he added a fourth-and-6 conversion to veteran wideout Stefon Diggs and spread the wealth to eight different targets by game’s end.

Fellow captain Hunter Henry again led the aerial attack with 73 receiving yards. A 36-yard pickup on a sail route was among them for the tight end, who had a touchdown nullified by offsetting penalties.

Unlocking a new starting five

The Patriots had been healthy enough to start the same offensive linemen for 10 of the season’s initial 11 games. But that run reached its end. With left tackle Will Campbell on injured reserve due to a knee injury and left guard Jared Wilson ruled out due to an ankle injury, a new combination was unlocked for Monday.

Without the rookies from LSU and Georgia, New England turned to 2024 starters Vederian Lowe and Ben Brown on the blindside. And while center Garrett Bradbury became a late addition to the questionable list because of an illness, the ironman of 778 offensive snaps remained next to right guard Mike Onwenu and right tackle Morgan Moses.

The Giants went on to notch three sacks during the visit to Foxborough. The latest No. 3 overall pick, Abdul Carter, got the first for no loss to force a punt. Zaire Barnes and Dane Belton also got in the column for New York.

Rookie swing tackle Marcus Bryant would be a healthy inactive in favor of recent 53-man roster addition Thayer Munford Jr., who reported as an eligible tight end in jumbo sets.

Backfield hits the century mark against NFL’s 32nd run defense

New York’s defense headed into Monday allowing an NFL-worst 157.2 rushing yards per game and 5.9 yards per carry. Behind a reconfigured offensive line, New England’s running backs combined to hit 107 yards on the ground while averaging 4.65 yards per carry.

Rhamondre Stevenson, who missed three games with a toe injury before easing back last week, regained the starting reins. The veteran lowered the pads and turned 12 handoffs into 40 yards while also chipping in 40 yards as a receiver. TreVeyon Henderson spelled him with wind in his sails. The No. 38 overall pick out of Ohio State posted 86 yards from scrimmage across 14 touches. A slicing, dicing long of 26 was reached in the closing minutes.

Rounding out New England’s backfield, Terrell Jennings returned the game’s opening kickoff 39 yards before heading from the blue medical tent to the locker room to be evaluated for a head injury.

Dart throws for 139 yards as red jerseys zero in

After two games gone, Jaxson Dart cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol ahead of Monday night. The Giants quarterback went 17-of-24 passing for 139 yards with one touchdown in primetime.

Continuing to test the boundaries, the scrambling first-rounder out of Ole Miss would be sacked twice by the throwback Patriots. Captain and sack leader Harold Landry III got the first off the edge. Undrafted free agent Elijah Ponder got the next for his third in a month’s span.

Back-to-back punts were how the game began for the Giants’ offense. But Cover 0, missed tackles and poor angles sent Darius Slayton through the secondary on an in-breaking throw. The veteran wide receiver, who later added a two-point conversion, faced little resistance on what became a 30-yard touchdown.

Patriots safety Jaylinn Hawkins had kept that scoring drive alive with unnecessary roughness just one play prior, yet bounced back on the next series to deflect a third-and-10 deep shot into the end zone.

New England began in the nickel defense. Carlton Davis III, fresh off critical deflections on the road, continued to have a hand at home. The cornerback room’s eldest statesman broke up a pass intended for tight end Theo Johnson and diagnosed another in the flat to running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. for a loss of three yards on third-and-3.

Durden makes first career start up front

September promotion Cory Durden got the call for his first career start next to Christian Barmore on the interior defensive line. A career-high in snaps followed for a player let go by New York at the 53-man roster deadline. So did tackles after gains of one and none.

The opportunity arrived with four-year, $104 million disruptor Milton Williams on injured reserve and nose tackle Khyiris Tonga scratched 90 minutes before kickoff because of a chest injury. Rookie defensive tackles Joshua Farmer and Eric Gregory were also involved in the rotation on a night that saw the Giants commit to the ground game.

New York’s running backs finished with 104 yards across 22 carries. But the NFC East visitors didn’t get back into the end zone until the final frame got underway. A direct snap on third-and-6 wound up as a 22-yard touchdown run for Devin Singletary.

Jones’ return headlines long night on special teams for Giants

An ankle injury resulted in Brenden Schooler missing his first game since the finale of the 2022 season. But there would be moves made on special teams by another past All-Pro and present Patriots captain.

Marcus Jones, who scored last week at Paycor Stadium on an interception return, broke off a 94-yard punt return down left sideline in the first quarter for a 10-0 lead. It went for the Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award nominee’s third touchdown of the season. Entering the evening averaging 13.6 yards per punt return in his career, he now finds himself qualified for the top spot league history.

The transitional phase continued to be eventful from there.

A Younghoe Koo field goal was kept off the board before it could be registered as an attempt. Stubbing his cleat into the turf, no contact with the football was made. Instead, the well-traveled Giants kicker would be sacked by well-traveled standard elevation Jeremiah Pharms Jr. for a loss of 13 yards. And as halftime approached, ex-Patriot Gunner Olszewski sustained a helmet-to-helmet collision on a kickoff return and was helped to the sideline. It went in the books as an all-linebacker sequence between a hit by Christian Elliss, a forced fumble by Marte Mapu and a fumble recovery by the aforementioned Ponder.

The reigning AFC Special Teams Player of the Week also had a leg in things. Patriots rookie kicker Andy Borregales converted on 4-of-5 field goals and 3-of-3 extra points versus the Giants. He split the uprights from 22, 30, 28 and 23 yards away. A pull wide left from 45 yards would be in the cards.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2249459842.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C6.420172171046%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-12-02 03:59:15.104416

Rodgers returned to the field for the Steelers on Sunday, Nov. 30, after missing the previous week with a fractured wrist. He played with a large protective cast.

Unfortunately for Rodgers, he left this game with even more bruises and bandages.

Rodgers, who turns 42 years old on Dec. 2, suffered a significant cut on his nose that led to blood flowing out after a hard hit in the third quarter of the Steelers' 26-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills on a cold evening in Pittsburgh.

The former Green Bay Packers quarterback missed a series while being checked out by medical staff, the second straight game Rodgers played in that he exited with an injury.

While he returned to this game, the hits are adding up on Rodgers for a struggling Steelers team that has lost five of its last seven games and is on the outside looking in at the AFC playoffs at the moment.

Here's the latest on Aaron Rodgers' injuries from his nose to his wrist:

What happened to Aaron Rodgers nose?

The Steelers came into the second half against the Bills ahead 7-3 and with the ball. But the game would change on one play.

On the first play of the third quarter with the Steelers starting their drive at the 26-yard line, Rodgers had a play-action before dancing around in the pocket for a bit.

However, Rodgers was quickly getting trapped among Bills defenders ready to pounce. And that's when defensive end Joey Bosa struck. He hit Rodgers from behind, stripping him of the ball in the process while sending him crashing headfirst to the field.

Bills cornerback Christian Benford scooped up the ball and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown.

Rodgers' nose was gashed and blood immediately started coming down from it.

Rodgers went to the medical tent to get bandaged up. Backup quarterback Mason Rudolph came into the game on the Steelers’ next possession and it didn't go well. He threw an interception that the Bills turned into a touchdown following an eight-play drive to up their lead to 16-7 on their way to the victory.

Rodgers would re-entered the game but a three-and-out followed with momentum shifted to the Bills' side.

Aaron Rodgers injury update: Is Aaron Rodgers' nose broken?

After the game, Rodgers was asked if his nose was broken.

""I hope it’s not broken,"" Rodgers said in his post-game press conference. ""Just had to stop the bleeding. It was bleeding all over the place.""

Aaron Rodgers' wrist

Rodgers was already banged up. He was playing with a large cast on his fractured left wrist after suffering that injury two weeks earlier when he was sacked in the Steelers' game against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Rodgers missed the second half of that game as well as the team's next contest against the Chicago Bears.

While he returned on Sunday, he played in the shotgun throughout the game to avoid any extra contact on the snap. However, he landed hard on the injured wrist when taking the sack from Bosa.

""Felt good enough to be out there,"" Rodgers said about his decision to play. ""Not ready to take a snap under center yet. Hopefully, next week for that.""

The Steelers travel to play the Baltimore Ravens in the first of two matchups between the AFC North rivals over the final five games. The division lead will be on the line between the two 6-6 teams.

Justin Herbert busts his hand, uncertain for Week 14. Being a Charger? You know it don’t come easy. After a September that suggested this might finally be the year for our beleaguered Bolts, it’s instead been a year. As in, “it’s been a long year, brother.” Bad enough, but especially so since it’s encompassed only two months in Chargerland. LT Joe Alt is out, which has had Herbert running for his life. Now he has a broken finger, one that requires surgery. Herbert being a football player, he will probably somehow play through for it Week 14 against the Eagles. Herbert being a Charger, it figures to go disastrously. Not producing like a QB1 for some time now, Herbert will be impossible to rank inside the top 12 should he manage to suit up for the final week of the fantasy regular season.

Adonai Mitchell sends a disturbance through the fantasy force. If our guy could only catch a ball, he would be a star. Sunday he caught eight of them, but he also caught the one of them, finally hitting the big play he has been building toward all season, if not all decade. Mitchell’s 52-yard score featured him both blowing right by the corner and also coming back to an imperfect pass to make a beautiful sliding grab in the end zone. Week, spiked. Career, potentially saved. Longtime readers of this website know you can hardly declare “mission accomplished” when a player of Mitchell’s ilk finally has a good game, but we have proof of spiked week concept. Although as volatile as they come, Mitchell’s WR4 upside can no longer be denied heading into Week 14 against the Dolphins.

Bryce Young goes sicko mode in upset victory. Young’s latest comeback victory was tallied in the utmost of styles. The young quarterback has eight career touchdown passes of 30-plus yards. Three of them came against the Rams on Sunday, including what proved to be his game-winning, 43-yard dart to Tetairoa McMillan. Young remains frustratingly inconsistent, but that in and of itself is progress. Before he was just consistently bad. Now there’s an Any Given Sunday element to his game that has him doing things like coming back and beating the best team in the NFC. He’s still too much of an enigma to trust in one-QB fantasy leagues, but Young is quietly raising his floor while, yes, actually hitting his ceiling every now and then.

Aaron Rodgers adds broken face to litany of indignities. “Frozen Favre” comes to mind. If you don’t remember Favre’s broken jaw against the Patriots during his final season, that’s ok. It’s a lot like what we saw from Rodgers on Sunday. One key difference is Rodgers actually returned to the game. The question is why. Increasingly injured and entirely immobile, Rodgers has no one to throw to. Of the players who are out there catching passes, they are constantly drawing Rodgers’ ire. This is joyless football, but more damningly, it’s ineffective, boring football. There is no point to this experiment. There are no upside outcomes. It’s hard to hang it up. Rodgers, of course, deserved to go out “on his own terms.” They’ve just proven to be exceptionally depressing. Not even DK Metcalf is looking like more than a boom/bust WR4 for the fantasy playoffs.

Four More 13 Storylines

Michael Pittman Jr. turns invisible as Colts begin to fade in earnest. MPJ is the ultimate safe pair of hands. The guy who can move the chains on second or third down. So why does he have just eight catches for 59 yards over his past three appearances? Daniel Jones and matchups. The Colts are no longer dictating the pace of play. Playing from behind far more often over the past month, they find themselves in more obvious passing situations. That, to put it mildly, is not where Jones shines. So it has counterintuitively hurt Pittman’s volume and production as the Colts have been in more traditional passing scripts. Playing from behind also means a greater emphasis on down-field wideout Alec Pierce. Suddenly, it’s not just about moving the chains, but having to make something actually happen. That is not Pittman’s specialty. Pittman is still startable, but he’s back in his low-ceiling WR3 ancestral homeland rather than his high-floor WR2 environs from earlier this year.

Brian Thomas Jr. barely contributes in return as Parker Washington leaves with injury. How badly has Brian Thomas Jr. struggled this season? The official Jaguars account is tweeting out blocking highlights. Active for the first time since Week 9, Thomas could muster only two catches on three targets. Although it’s the Jags had more than a half of non-competitive game script against the Titans, target rivals Jakobi Meyers and Brenton Strange both managed to go at least 3/45/1. Washington was lost in the process, clearing out some of the target competition riff raff, but it might almost be to the point that you’re better off letting BTJ go off on your bench rather than sinking your third receiver spot. If you don’t have that luxury or don’t believe in sitting supposed stars, Week 14 opponent Indy is at least down its No. 1 corner after losing Sauce Gardner to a calf injury.

Bucky Irving shakes off snap count for touch domination. Technically, the Bucs were not lying. Irving’s snaps were indeed rationed. He was on the field for just 54 percent of the plays. It’s just, when he was out there, he was getting the ball. 19 times to Rachaad White’s five and Sean Tucker’s two. There was no committee. There was certainly deliverance for a Bucs offense that needed an extra element with the passing attack amongst the most injured in the league. In the end, it was not a dominant Irving performance, but one that gave the defense something extra to think about. It also hinted at much more to come if 19 handles is Irving’s return baseline. If you made it this far with your playoff odds intact, Irving is looking like quite the hold.

Aaron Jones injures shoulder yet again as Max Brosmer goes Peterman Mode. Jones is one tough player — with one loose shoulder. The Vikings want Jones to be the focal point of their offense as their passing attack ceases to exist. His upper body simply will not allow it. It’s removed any hope of a rescue mission for this moribund offense, and left fantasy managers without a potential RB2. With Jones likely to miss Week 14 against the Commanders, it creates yet another spot start opportunity for Jordan Mason, though the 49ers castoff has lacked explosiveness while displaying only modest efficiency. With touchdowns all but impossible to come by in this offense, Mason remains an uninspiring FLEX.

Trey McBride already has more touchdown receptions (seven) from Jacoby Brissett in seven career starts than he does from Kyler Murray (five) in 38 career starts.

Along those same lines, Jacoby Brissett is now tied with Dak Prescott for the most 300-yard passing performances of the season (four).

If you thought Max Brosmer went beyond merely “pulling a Nine” and instead “pulled a Peterman,” that’s because he did, via Benjamin Solak: “Max Brosmer is the first quarterback to throw 4-plus interceptions in his first career start since … Nathan Peterman in 2017.”

Head coach Dave Canales talked with reporters on Monday, putting a bow on a successful Week 13 showing against the Los Angeles Rams. With the team about to hit their bye week, he was asked about the status of right guard Robert Hunt—who has missed the last 11 games due to a biceps tear.

""He's working his way back, he's doing a great job in return-to-play,"" Canales replied. ""He's getting stronger, and we just have to continue to take it week by week to see. We want that strength in his arm to come back so that he has balance and can be able to stop a big man trying to redirect—and we're gonna have to be really smart about that.

""I can't tell you exactly what the timeline is. But it'll be a weekly thing to kinda see where he's at.""

Hunt went down in Carolina's Week 2 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The right guard position has since been manned by the likes of Brady Christensen, Austin Corbett, Chandler Zavala and, most recently, Jake Curhan—who got the starting nod in Sunday's 31-28 victory.

Canales was later asked about cornerback Jaycee Horn, one of a handful of absentees from the upset win. He said that he expects to have Horn back following the break.

""Both he and [Claudin Cherelus] are still in the concussion protocol, but daily improvement,"" Canales stated. ""And we'll circle back around once we get closer to next week.""

Among those inactive for the Week 13 contest is first-round rookie left tackle Will Campbell.

Campbell suffered a right MCL sprain during the Patriots' 26-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals last Sunday. On Wednesday, New England placed Campbell on injured reserve, meaning he'll miss at least the next four games.

Should Pats fans expect Campbell back this season? NFL insider Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated shared the latest on the LSU product Monday during Pregame Live.

""Well, he's not out for the year, but this is a very significant injury,"" Breer said. ""He has a Grade 3 MCL sprain. That essentially means his MCL is torn.

""It's a four-to-six-week injury, and one of the reasons they decided to put him on injured reserve was actually to protect him from himself. They felt like because of who he is, how tough he is, the sort of competitor he is, that he would push to get back earlier than that. This puts a governor on it. This forces him to go through a full recovery.

""They're going to try to get him back for the last game of the regular season. Even that may be pushing it a little bit. This is not a minor injury, though. This is an MCL tear, a Grade 3 MCL sprain, which again necessitates a four-to-six-week recovery.""

MORE PATRIOTS

Campbell's injury is a tough blow to a Patriots offensive line that has taken a significant step forward following an abysmal 2024. With Campbell and rookie guard Jared Wilson both injured, New England will face adversity as it looks to improve on its 10-2 record and earn the top seed in the AFC.

While the Patriots could activate Campbell for their regular-season finale, Breer believes the team will be cautious given the nature of the injury.

""I just think it's one of those where you have to be careful about guys pushing it,"" he added. ""It's the type of injury that you can aggravate and you can make worse by playing on it. And there are a lot of examples of guys, especially in a position like Will Campbell's, trying to play through these sorts of things. So I think in a certain way, the Patriots put him on IR trying to look out for him and trying to make sure that he does go through as full a recovery as you can in season.

""But I would say this: if the Patriots were in the position they were at this time last year, when there was nothing to play for, they would probably shut him down for the rest of the season.""

Through the first 12 games of his NFL career, Campbell has excelled at protecting quarterback Drake Maye's blindside. Vederian Lowe will replace him as the Patriots' starting left tackle, with Ben Brown expected to take over for Wilson.",https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2025/10/Will-Campbell.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-02 03:59:38.322153

""My understanding is the plan is for Justin Herbert to play on Monday after surgery on his hand,"" Rapoport reports.","The Los Angeles Chargers earned a 31-14 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 13, but it came at a cost.

Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert suffered an injury to his left hand early in the game. The 27-year-old was eventually able to return to the game while wearing a heavily padded glove on his non-throwing hand.

Herbert finished the day without issue, completing 15-of-20 passes for 151 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.

However, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh told reporters following the game Herbert had suffered a fracture in his left hand that would require surgery. That brought into question the star quarterback's status moving forward.

Here's what to know about Herbert's injury and how long it might keep him out of action.

How long is Justin Herbert out?

NFL Media's Ian Rapoport reports Herbert is dealing with a fractured metacarpal in his left hand, but it may not sideline him at all.

""My understanding is the plan is for Justin Herbert to play on Monday after surgery on his hand,"" Rapoport reports.

Rapoport's reporting aligns with what Herbert told reporters during his postgame news conference Sunday. The 27-year-old quarterback said doctors were ""very hopeful"" the injury would not cause him to miss any time.

""I'm treating it as if I'm playing on Monday,"" Herbert said, per USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon. ""I think they're very hopeful for that. I think that's just something that we'll see tomorrow and we'll get a feel for. But I think they were really hopeful. So that's always a good thing.""

Harbaugh told reporters during a postgame news conference the quarterback had suffered a fracture in his left hand and would have a procedure to address the injury on Monday, Dec. 1.

Harbaugh didn't provide a timetable for Herbert to return to action. The veteran coach also did not rule him out for Los Angeles' ""Monday Night Football"" game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 14.

The Chargers (8-4) will enter Week 14 as the top wild-card team in the AFC. However, they are only a game ahead of the first team out of the AFC playoff picture – the Houston Texans (7-5) – so their standing could quickly change.

It isn't clear whether that reality will impact Herbert's timeline to return or if the Chargers will be content to see if their backup quarterbacks can carry them until Herbert is fully healthy.

Who is the Chargers backup QB?

Trey Lance is the Chargers backup quarterback. The 25-year-old is in his first season with the Chargers after signing a one-year deal with the team in free agency.

Lance was the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He spent the first two-plus seasons of his career with the 49ers, playing sparingly due to injuries before being traded to the Dallas Cowboys.

Lance has a 2-3 record across five career starts and has completed 56.1% of his passes for 1,144 yards, five touchdowns and four interceptions. He has also added 288 yards and a touchdown on 69 career carries.

Chargers QB depth chart

The Chargers have three quarterbacks in their organization at present. Below is the pecking order within the unit:

Our experts' Week 13 takeaways,"Dan Pompei, Ted Nguyen, Mike Jones",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6849844/2025/11/30/nfl-takeaways-week-13-scores-results/,"Each Sunday, three of The Athletic’s NFL writers react to the biggest news, plays and performances from the day’s games.

As of Sunday evening, the top seeds in the NFC and AFC playoff picture were the Chicago Bears and the New England Patriots (although the Denver Broncos equaled the Patriots’ record by the end of the night). Could it be a Super Bowl Shuffle rematch, 40 years after the Bears beat the Patriots?

Why not, after a Week 13 in which heavyweights such as the Los Angeles Rams, Philadelphia Eagles and Baltimore Ravens all lost, while the once-high-flying Indianapolis Colts fell to the Houston Texans, creating a jumble atop the AFC South. And don’t look at the AFC North, where the Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for first — at 6-6.

NFL writers Mike Jones, Ted Nguyen and Dan Pompei share their thoughts on a Week 13 in which playoff races tightened as the season’s home stretch approached.

After a strong start, the Steelers have now lost five of their past seven games and could barely move the ball in Sunday’s 26-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills. What’s gone wrong, besides Aaron Rodgers getting injured?

Jones: There’s a lot wrong with the Steelers’ offense, but topping the list is the lack of a consistent, explosive downfield pass catching threat. DK Metcalf is averaging 13.4 yards per reception, 25th in the league through Sunday night. He hasn’t been a consistent chain-mover either, producing just 30 first-down receptions, 29th in the league. The Steelers don’t have another pass catcher in the top 100 in the NFL in receiving yards (tight end Pat Freiermuth is 106th with 298 yards). Pittsburgh’s decision to trade George Pickens to Dallas looks worse and worse as the season goes on. He has 1,142 receiving yards and eight touchdowns for the Cowboys, which is more than Pittsburgh’s wide receiving unit as a whole. He had issues with maturity and professionalism in Pittsburgh, and the Steelers didn’t want to reward Pickens with a rich contract extension. But they certainly miss his production. The other big issue involves Pittsburgh’s offensive line, which struggles both in run blocking and pass protection. So, that’s why they can’t move the ball well, even against a weaker defense like Buffalo’s.

Pompei: The Steelers exemplify the NFL’s mushy middle. They get after the passer but don’t do anything else particularly well. They also aren’t incompetent enough in any area to the point of not being unable to compete with most teams. We shouldn’t forget they have quality wins against the Patriots and Colts, so the Steelers are not a pushover. A healthy Rodgers would go a long way to making the Steelers a playoff contender. Rodgers may no longer be a quarterback his team can win because of, but he absolutely is a quarterback his team can win with. He has not been at his best, however, since the season opener.

Nguyen: Even when the offense was playing better, the Steelers had very little margin for error. Rodgers was already averse to taking hits before the wrist injury and was getting rid of the ball faster than any other quarterback. That can work when you have a favorable game script, but when the Steelers needed to throw downfield, Rodgers wouldn’t — unless he got wide open opportunities. The defense was predictable and got exposed early in their downturn. Coach Mike Tomlin made some adjustments and that side of the ball has played better lately, but the offense has been so bad that it hasn’t mattered. Though Tomlin may still be a great motivator and culture-setter, the game may have passed him by.

Mike Vrabel of the Patriots and Ben Johnson of the Bears, whose teams are both in contention for first-round byes in the playoffs, are the betting favorites for Coach of the Year. Who’s your pick as of today?

Pompei: So many good choices. Beyond Vrabel and Johnson, there are Todd Bowles, Dave Canales, Liam Coen, Sean Payton, Kyle Shanahan, Shane Steichen, and maybe Brian Schottenheimer if the Dallas Cowboys remain on their trajectory. The winner will be decided in December. But as of now, Johnson should be in the lead. His staffing, leadership, messaging, player evaluation, player development, game planning and play calling have been outstanding. The Bears’ mentality has completely changed, and it’s a reflection of their head coach. What’s more, Johnson’s absence has been felt in Detroit as much as his presence has been felt in Chicago.

Nguyen: This is such a close race between several deserving candidates. Mike Macdonald has the Seattle Seahawks playing like a machine, Sean McVay has the Rams playing as good as they have in his tenure, and Shanahan has the San Francisco 49ers in the playoff picture despite several devastating injuries. The job Johnson has done with the Bears has been remarkable. The offense went from one of the worst in the league to one of the most explosive, in one season.

I’ll give the nod to Macdonald though. The Seahawks’ defense is the best in the league, and his decision to move on from Ryan Grubb and hire Klint Kubiak as his offensive coordinator has been one of the most impactful of the season. The Seahawks are true contenders, and Macdonald got them there in his second season.

Jones: Kyle Shanahan. Yes, Johnson has infused the Bears with life, and he’s helping Caleb Williams develop into a franchise quarterback. And yes, Vrabel has quickly restored the Patriots into a first-class unit. But Shanahan — despite multiple stints without his starting quarterback and despite losing a plethora of other difference-makers for the season, including defensive stars Fred Warner and Nick Bosa — still having his team in the playoff hunt is most impressive. Any other team would have crumbled. But Shanahan and his staff keep on plugging in replacement players and positioning them for success.

After the Texans upset the Colts and the Jacksonville Jaguars dominated the Tennessee Titans, the AFC South now has three teams within a game of each other. Who’s your pick to win the division?

Pompei: The Texans are the most interesting and best team in the division at the moment, with four straight wins including Sunday’s victory over the Colts. They arguably have the league’s best defense, which is a good thing to have in December. If they could get C.J. Stroud playing like he did in 2023, they almost assuredly would be the South’s best. We shouldn’t sleep on the Colts, but they are showing how difficult it is to sustain a superior level of play over 17 games. The season finale between the Colts and Texans will decide the division.

Jones: I’m going with the Jaguars. Despite the maddening inconsistencies that plague Trevor Lawrence, Liam Coen’s team has a lot working in its favor. The Jaguars have one of the league’s leading rushing attacks. They have an opportunistic defense, which ranks among the league leaders in takeaways. And their remaining schedule plays out pretty favorably. They have two games (Weeks 14 and 17) against the sagging Colts, who have now lost three of their last four. They also play the New York Jets (which should be another win), travel to Denver (the toughest test remaining) and close out the season against Tennessee. Houston is surging with four straight wins but might come up short in its pursuit of the Jaguars. Indianapolis isn’t the same with Daniel Jones hobbled, and the Colts have a mean final stretch (with games against the Seahawks and 49ers and another game against Houston, plus two against Jacksonville) and seem primed for a dream-killing fizzle.

Nguyen: I thought the Colts could shift their identity into a defensive team with cornerbacks Charvarius Ward and Sauce Gardner locking down receivers, but Gardner was hurt early on Sunday and the Texans were able to create enough explosive plays in the pass game to win. Jones was already falling back to earth before his leg injury, but with his mobility hindered, this Colts offense will be limited. They played an elite Texans defense Sunday, so we’ll see if they can get on track against the Jaguars.

Both the Texans and Jaguars seem to be getting it together at the right time. The Texans’ offense has limitations, but they’re getting chunks in the passing game. If that continues, and with that defense, I think they have a shot at taking the South.

Just when we all crowned the Rams the best team in the NFL, they looked unsteady on both sides of the ball in a 31-28 loss to the Carolina Panthers. Did that shake your faith in Los Angeles as the Super Bowl favorite?

Nguyen: The Rams were playing such good, consistent ball that they were bound for a letdown. I don’t want to take away from the Panthers. They deserve a ton of credit for winning the game, and their offensive line — even with injuries — owned the Rams up front. The three biggest plays in this game were Matthew Stafford’s two interceptions (one in the red zone and a pick six) and his fourth quarter fumble. Stafford had only thrown two interceptions before this game. I don’t think we’ll see too many games in which Stafford is as careless with the ball, so I’m not concerned with the Rams moving forward.

Jones: Every now and then, a quality team has one of those uncharacteristically bad performances and loses to a team it had no business struggling against. That’s what happened to the Rams on Sunday. Stafford threw two interceptions after enjoying a record-setting streak of 28 touchdown passes without an interception. He then had a fumble that snuffed out the Rams’ chances for a game-winning drive. L.A.’s defense also appeared flat and gave up too many big plays, failing to record a takeaway for the first time in five games. Hats off to the Panthers for their performance, but I still believe in the Rams. They’ll get this game out of their system and will probably use it as a wakeup call before gearing up for a strong finish to the season and a deep playoff run.

Pompei: Perhaps the Lombardi Trophy was awarded a bit too early? The Rams had an excellent run and remain one of football’s best. But it’s a long season and most teams slip up here and there, as the Rams did Sunday. We can’t forget the Rams have a number of quality wins, having beaten the Texans, Colts, Ravens, Jaguars, 49ers, Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, among others. They will be defined by how they play in December and January, and — they hope — February. This appears to be one of those wide-open seasons in which no clear Super Bowl favorites can be established. We are likely in for some wild surprises.

The Panthers, Lions and Cowboys all have between a 22 and 30 percent chance to make the playoffs, according to The Athletic’s Playoff Simulator. Whose chances do you like best?

Pompei: Over the previous two seasons, the Lions won 20 more games than the Panthers and eight more than the Cowboys. It would be foolish to read too much into the past, but what we can be sure of is the Lions know how to win. They have struggled at times this season to replicate the formulas that served them well in the past, but they remain the best team of this trio, all things considered. The Cowboys have the most momentum, but there are five weeks that could change that. What we don’t know is how all three teams will change over the stretch run, so for now the bet is on the Lions.

Nguyen: The Panthers look to have the easiest remaining schedule and an upcoming bye week to get healthy, but they’ve been up and down all season. They can drop a game to the New Orleans Saints after winning over the Packers at Lambeau Field, and then beat the Rams a few weeks later. I’m not sure if I can trust them down the stretch. The Cowboys’ offense is one of the most well-designed systems in the league, and it’s hard stopping their two alpha receivers, CeeDee Lamb and Pickens. Their defense has improved after trading for Quinnen Williams, but there are still major holes in their secondary. They have a pretty favorable schedule after they play the Lions next week. This is a cheap answer, but I think whoever wins that game will make the playoffs.

Jones: The Panthers have surprised me, and they do have two stunning upsets against the Rams and Packers, leading Super Bowl contenders. But they’re far too inconsistent. I don’t see them overtaking the Buccaneers for the NFC South title. I feel like Detroit is probably the most well-rounded of these three longshot playoff hopefuls, but catching the Bears and the Packers, who already have the season sweep, could prove challenging. Dallas is intriguing, having reeled off three straight wins and showing improvement on defense thanks to reinforcements added at the trade deadline and the healthy return of some key players. And the way that Philadelphia is looking as of late, the Cowboys just might have a shot at winning the division. So, I’ll give my nod to Dallas.

Yes, it was against the Browns, but the battered 49ers somehow keep winning and are now 9-4 after a 26-8 victory in Cleveland. Could they actually be dangerous in the playoffs, despite all the injuries?

Jones: I do think the 49ers could be dangerous. Because of everything they have been through, I view them as extremely battle-tested. They have proved they can go toe-to-toe with the best of them. They have already split games with the Rams and they have a win over Seattle. They’re a well-rounded, well-coached team, despite a lack of star power on defense because of all of the injuries that they have suffered. Many of their core players have significant playoff experience, and experience really matters when you get to the postseason. So, I won’t count out the 49ers.

Nguyen: It really depends on how much Brock Purdy can continue to heal from the turf toe injury that caused him to miss six weeks. He’s scrambling less, it doesn’t look like he can drive the ball, and his arm strength was already limited before the injury. This offense needs to be elite to make up for all of the defensive injuries, and it won’t be until Purdy is closer to his old self. This team had a lot of playoff experience and brilliant coaches. Shanahan and defensive coordinator Robert Saleh will be difficult to coach against in the playoffs, but for it to matter, Purdy has to be better.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/30190844/GettyImages-2249245908-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-01 22:59:38.846503

The Giants did not provide an official timeline for Skattebo's return from injury.
The only update then-coach Brian Daboll gave reporters after the running back's surgery was that ""all went well.""","The New York Giants have been without running back Cam Skattebo since the fourth-round rookie suffered a gruesome-looking ankle injury in the team's Week 8 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Skattebo's injury occurred when he was trying to catch a pass from fellow rookie Jaxson Dart. Skattebo was met by Eagles linebacker Zack Baun from behind as the ball arrived. The running back's leg got caught under him as he was twisted to the ground.

And once Skattebo rolled onto his back, his right ankle was pointing the wrong direction.

Skattebo was quickly tended to by the Giants' medical staff. The 23-year-old's injured right leg was placed into an air cast. He was then taken to the locker room before being taken to a local hospital and having emergency surgery to repair the injury.

Eventually, it was revealed Skattebo had suffered an open ankle dislocation on the play. Additionally, he suffered a fractured fibula and a ruptured deltoid ligament as a part of the injury.

How long will Skattebo be out as a result of those injuries? Here's what to know about his recovery timeline and when he could return to the field.

When will Cam Skattebo return?

Skattebo will not be returning to the field in 2025. He is expected to miss the rest of the season as he recovers from surgery to repair his dislocated ankle, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport.

The good news for the Giants? Skattebo is expected to be sidelined for 4-6 months after his ankle injury and surgery. That will allow the 23-year-old to return for the team's offseason program and put him on track to be ready for Week 1 of the 2026 NFL season.

""If all is good and clean and the surgery went as well as everyone believes, he should be back with no issues for next year,"" Rapoport said on NFL Network the morning of Oct. 27. ""It's a gruesome injury but the recovery is actually not as bad. We've seen several others with similar injuries come back and play the next year. Dak Prescott comes to mind. So, 2026 for Cam Skattebo.""

The Giants did not provide an official timeline for Skattebo's return from injury. The only update then-coach Brian Daboll gave reporters after the running back's surgery was that ""all went well.""

""He's recovering,"" Daboll said Oct. 27. ""Obviously, he'll be missed but on the road to recovery. … He's got a road ahead of him.""

Skattebo has been similarly mum about his timetable for return, but he told Blake Niemann of Fox 10 Phoenix that ""everything is going good"" when asked about his injury while in attendance at his alma mater, Arizona State, for its rivalry game against Arizona on Nov. 28.

""We’re taking the right steps everyday to get better and that’s what matters,"" Skattebo said. ""We don’t put a timeframe on anything, we’re just gonna continue to work until I’m ready.""

Skattebo has kept busy since suffering his injury. Not only did he attend the Territorial Cup, but he was also in attendance for a WWE event at Madison Square Garden and even briefly got in on the action.

Skattebo, who has been seen standing and using a mobility scooter for his injured right leg, made it clear he would continue to have fun despite facing criticism for his involvement in the WWE skit.

""Aye, honestly if you don’t like that I’m having a good time while dealing with a tough time, then just go ahead and unfollow and casually move on,"" Skattebo said. ""I’m not able to play football and have the fun I’ve been having my whole life so I am doing things outside the box trying to find stuff to keep me happy. Enjoy the rest of y’all’s week and just don’t talk about me if you ain’t got nothing nice to say""

Giants RB depth chart

The Giants have three healthy running backs remaining in their organization with Skattebo sidelined for the season. Below is a look at the group's pecking order.

Tyrone Tracy Jr.

Devin Singletary

Eric Gray

Dante Miller (practice squad)

Tracy has operated as the Giants' de facto backfield leader in Skattebo's absence. The Purdue product has generated 239 rushing yards on 58 carries while adding 138 yards and 11 catches through the air.

Singletary has also been involved in the Giants' ground-heavy attack, totaling 154 yards on 46 carries with two touchdowns while serving as a foil to Tracy.

Gray, a fifth-round pick from 2023, made his season debut in Week 12 against the Lions and played primarily as a kick returner. Meanwhile, Miller has appeared in two games this season but has primarily played special teams. Neither seems likely to play a significant role in the backfield, barring injury.

Skattebo finished the season having 410 yards and five touchdowns on 101 carries. He remains the Giants' leading rusher, though Tracy is poised to pass him provided he can gain 13 yards in Week 13 against the New England Patriots.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/01/USAT/87544296007-cam-skattebo-giants-113025.jpg?crop=2655,1494,x2327,y336&width=2655&height=1494&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-01 22:59:42.525426

""There are so many plays where he's setting somebody else up, whether it's getting doubled in the pass rush, or he's running a stunt to free someone else up, or in the run game, he's making the ball go a certain direction. There's at least a dozen a plays every game where not a lot of people in the world can make those type of plays. So he deserves that recognition.""

Along with Minnesota dialing up a lot of pressure, after the game Smith-Njigba said, ""Coach (Brian) Flores does a great job mixing up looks, and we're taking what they give us, and Sam (Darnold) made the best decisions for the team and Zach (Charbonnet) and K9 (Kenneth Walker III) doing their thing. It was one of those days.""

""Our guys were great,"" Macdonald said. ""I'm not on the offensive sideline while we're playing defense, but the feeling you have on our sideline and from what the guys are telling me is, everybody's all in trying to get the mission accomplished and trying to go win the game or whatever it takes to win. Now every competitor's going to want to be a play a positive part of being an asset of the team so they can go win. I'm sure Jax, of course he wants to ball. Everybody wants the ball more. I want the ball more, but they don't need to give it to me. But we've talked about this all the time, one of the things that makes Jax so special is that the day to day, how he practices, how he brings it every day, how he supports his teammates. It makes him a really cool teammate.""

For the better part of Sunday's game, Minnesota's pass rush was making it difficult for quarterback Sam Darnold and the offense to get much going. Darnold finished 14 of 26 and threw for 128 yards and was sacked a season-high four times. Seattle was able to build enough of a lead thanks to a perfect day from Jason Myers who went 4/4 on field goals, and a defensive touchdown by Ernest Jones IV, that eventually they turned to running the ball. Macdonald said Darnold stuck with the plan throughout the game.

""The way the game declared, we didn't we didn't need him to drop back and chuck it around the yard 40 times,"" Macdonald said. ""So we knew we needed to stick with our plan to kind of ground it out there in the second half and we executed that. I thought we played way better in the second half, to help us win the game.""

""Andrew Van Ginkel made a great anticipatory play and Sam just played football in that moment,"" he said. ""Held it, got to the second window and off we went, getting out of the backed up situation. So there's straight outs to it, but things we can probably put ourselves in some better situations sometimes, credit to them on a couple of those designs that they got the better of us in those situations.""

At one point in the second quarter of Sunday's game, rookie safety Nick Emmanwori found himself matched up with Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson on third-and-five. Emmanwori was sticky in coverage on one of the NFL's best receivers, and undercut Max Brosmer's pass, nearly intercepting it on the sideline. It would have been a great play for any NFL cornerback tasked with guarding the All-Pro receiver, but it was even more impressive for a 6-foot-3, 220-pound safety who has spent much of his rookie season playing in the box.

""He's shown the ability to do it, so if you show the ability to do something, we're going to let you go do it,"" Macdonald said of Emmanwori's expanding role. ""It's really that simple. It's pretty cool. He allows us to do some things in the back end that we've really never been able to do. So that's a great opportunity for us.

""We had him at 9-technique, 5-technique, he's playing the slot. We're putting a lot on his plate. That's part of my message to him, 'You've got a lot on your plate, there's a lot of expectations, and rightfully so, you've earned those opportunities. Go prepare your tail off so you can play the brand of ball you want to play. Then go let it rip, and if something happens throughout the game, we'll fix it or we'll put you out of that situation, but just go to the next one and keep rolling.'""

""We're working through that,"" he said. ""We've never really had a player like him, so we are kind of making it up as we go to a certain extent. I hate to admit that, but we kind of are.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/k8knogz7rwzplyrbr00z,N,,2025-12-01 22:59:51.723677

But he has a message for fans: His season-ending injury is just a temporary setback for him.

""I'll be back,"" the Packers' fourth-year defensive tackle posted on Instagram with a series of photos from the season, followed by the hashtag ""gopackgo.""

Wyatt was injured late in the Packers' 31-24 win over the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving after he had his leg rolled into on the team's final defensive snap that ended with a Micah Parsons sack.

The Packers' former first-round pick stayed on the ground for several minutes while being tended to before being taken to the locker room on a cart.

“It doesn't look good, guys,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said after the game. “I'm sick for him. I'm sick for us. I mean, that's a critical loss for our football team, for our defense, obviously. And I can't say enough great things about him in terms of just watching him mature, not only as a football player, as a person.

“I've got a lot of love for Devonte Wyatt, I think the whole locker room does, too. So, it's a little bittersweet.”

His teammates showed him that love.

Tucker Kraft, who is also out for the season with a torn ACL, commented on Wyatt's Instagram post: ""Buddy!!""

Others like running back Emanuel Wilson, wide receiver Malik Heath and defensive end Kingsley Enagbare gave him heart emojis.

Lukas Van Ness, who has missed six games, including the Lions contest, with a foot injury, gave him fingers-crossed emojis as did defensive tackle Colby Wooden, who will be called up to fill the interior of the defensive line in Wyatt’s absence.

Offensive linemen Rasheed Walker and Elgton Jenkins, who is on injured reserve also with a broken ankle, gave him praying hands. Rashan Gary, who also knows the feeling about missing significant time with an injury after a torn ACL ended his 2022 season after Week 9, replied to Wyatt: ""You know the vibe.""

And third-round pick Justin Walley, who was tracking toward starting this season, was placed on season-ending injured reserve following a torn ACL he sustained in a joint practice with the Baltimore Ravens during training camp in August.","Head coach Shane Steichen said Monday the Colts are not considering placing cornerback Sauce Gardner on injured reserve, and the two-time first-team AP All-Pro's Achilles is intact after he sustained a calf injury in the first quarter of the Colts' Week 13 loss to the Houston Texans on Sunday.

Steichen said Gardner will ""miss some time"" but the Colts expect him to return at some point this season. Had he been placed on injured reserve, Gardner would've been sidelined for at least the Colts' next four games (Weeks 14-17).

The Colts acquired Gardner in a deadline deal on Nov. 4, sending their 2026 and 2027 first-round picks along with wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to the New York Jets in exchange for the 24-year-old cornerback.

Gardner will be the latest Colts cornerback to be sidelined due to injury this season. Kenny Moore II (Weeks 4-6), Charvarius Ward Sr. (Week 2, Weeks 6-10) and Jaylon Jones (Weeks 2-8) all have previously missed time; Mike Hilton, who was elevated from the Colts' practice squad and played in Weeks 4 and 5, has been on the practice squad injured list since sustaining an injury in Week 5.

Wyatt, a first-round pick in 2022, is under contract through next season because the Packers picked up the fifth-year option on his rookie deal.
The Packers had hoped Van Ness, another first-round pick in 2023, would be back to full strength by now after he missed five games.
Van Ness had a walking boot on his right foot Monday, and there is no timetable for his return yet.
""It just wasn't exactly where I wanted it to be,"" Van Ness told ESPN on Monday.","GREEN BAY, Wis. -- The left ankle injury that Devonte Wyatt sustained in the Green Bay Packers' win over the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving will end the defensive tackle's season, coach Matt LaFleur said Monday.

Combine that with the lingering foot injury edge rusher Lukas Van Ness has not been able to come back from and the Packers' defensive line has gotten even thinner heading into Sunday's NFC North battle-for-first-place game against the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field.

Tests on Wyatt confirmed what LaFleur indicated after the game when he said, ""It doesn't look good.""

""Certainly he's a guy that's going to be pretty tough to replace,"" LaFleur said Monday. ""I think it just falls on everybody else kind of raising the level of their game.""

Wyatt, a first-round pick in 2022, is under contract through next season because the Packers picked up the fifth-year option on his rookie deal. That is worth $12.938 million for the 2026 season unless the two sides agree to a long-term extension.

He became an even more important part of the Packers' defense when they traded defensive tackle Kenny Clark to the Cowboys as part of the Micah Parsons deal shortly before the regular season. Wyatt had four sacks in 10 games this season and 27 tackles in all, including six for a loss. He missed two games earlier this season because of a knee injury.

Colby Wooden and Karl Brooks are expected to be the Packers' top two defensive tackles going forward, although Brooks missed the last game because of an ankle injury. The Packers also will lean on rookies Warren Brinson (sixth round) and Nazir Stackhouse (undrafted), who played together at the University of Georgia, to pick up some of the interior line snaps.

The Packers had hoped Van Ness, another first-round pick in 2023, would be back to full strength by now after he missed five games. Van Ness tried to come back Nov. 23 against the Minnesota Vikings but lasted just six defensive snaps and then was out for last week's game against the Lions.

Van Ness had a walking boot on his right foot Monday, and there is no timetable for his return yet.

""It just wasn't exactly where I wanted it to be,"" Van Ness told ESPN on Monday. ""Was hoping to get back on the field and return to play, played a limited amount of snaps and it didn't feel quite right yet, so just back on the rehab plan and hoping I can turn the corner shortly. But until then, just rehab, work with the training staff and coaches, and hope I can get healthy soon.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1201%2Fr1583473_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 20:01:31.518558

Injury updates heading into Week 14 The Bills only had one new injury to report coming out of Sunday's victory over the Steelers as DE Joey Bosa is dealing with a hamstring injury.
The Bills will be without kicker Tyler Bass (groin) for the remainder of the season after he underwent surgery last week.
Bass hasn't appeared in a game this season while dealing with the injury and was placed on injured reserve prior to Week 1.
Cook's pregame text sets tone for backup tackles ""I told them I trust them and believe in them,"" Cook said.","Benford locks down Metcalf as Buffalo's pass defense trends upward

The Bills defense as a whole hasn't had the smoothest of journeys this season, but their pass coverage unit has been among the league's best since coming out of the bye. Buffalo's EPA (expected points added) allowed per dropback in Weeks 7-13 ranks 4th-best in the NFL, an improvement from 9th in Weeks 1-6.

After giving up just 108 total passing yards to the Steelers, the Bills have the league's top passing defense at 163.2 yards per game. Buffalo has held 9 of their 12 opponents so far to under 200 yards passing.

On the season, only the Eagles, Broncos and Texans are allowing a lower completion percentage to opposing QBs than the Bills (59.5%). Buffalo also ranks 6th in the NFL in opposing QB passer rating (80.9)

Defensive coordinator Bobby Babich believes one factor that has contributed to the success of the secondary in recent weeks has been the cohesion of the group, citing ""change in the lineup because of injuries"" that occurred early in the season.

""There was a lot of different moving parts,"" he said. ""But I think we're starting to get in a flow and a rhythm, and those guys are doing a pretty good job limiting the pass game.""

One wrinkle that was on display in Pittsburgh was CB Christian Benford shadowing WR DK Metcalf throughout the game. Benford shared postgame that it was in the game plan for him to follow Metcalf no matter what side of the formation the WR lined up on.

""Wherever he was going, I was going,"" he said.

McDermott detailed Monday that the Bills don't always use that approach but felt it was best for this week's game plan and trusted Benford to get the job done.

""It's really growth,"" he said of Benford. ""Last year was one of the first times we ventured into that schematic version of our defense.""

According to NextGenStats, Benford lined up against Metcalf 13 times, 10 of which came in man coverage, and did not allow a single reception during those snaps.

""I thought Christian really did a great job of limiting their number one receiver last night. And give Bobby credit and the defensive staff in terms of the plan as well,"" McDermott said.

Injury updates heading into Week 14

The Bills only had one new injury to report coming out of Sunday's victory over the Steelers as DE Joey Bosa is dealing with a hamstring injury.

""We'll see where that goes,"" Sean McDermott said.

McDermott shared that LT Dion Dawkins remains in concussion protocol after missing Week 13 while LB Terrell Bernard (elbow), RT Spencer Brown (shoulder), WR Joshua Palmer (ankle) and TE Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) are all ""improving"".

The Bills will be without kicker Tyler Bass (groin) for the remainder of the season after he underwent surgery last week. Bass hasn't appeared in a game this season while dealing with the injury and was placed on injured reserve prior to Week 1.

Cook's pregame text sets tone for backup tackles

""I told them I trust them and believe in them,"" Cook said. ""And just let's go get a win.""

Anderson and Van Demark were thrust into the starting tackle roles against the Steelers with Dion Dawkins and Spencer Brown out with injury. It was the first time this season Buffalo played a game with more than one starting offensive lineman injured.

Buffalo's ground game flourished to a tune of a season-high 249 yards and six runs with gains of 12+ yards. Cook logged his NFL-leading seventh 100-yard rushing performance on a career-high 32 carries.

""I saw Jimbo pregame, and he just had that look in his eyes,"" Joe Brady said. ""He was ready to rock yesterday, he had full confidence in the guys up front. He knew Vandy and Alec were going to be good to go.""

McDermott shared that while Cook is a quiet-natured person, he is undeniably a leader on the team and someone the locker room rallies around.

""The energy he comes to the sideline with, you can feel he has a presence, even when sometimes things aren't going our way or his way, or what have you.

The 2025 NFL regular season is almost over, with just five weeks before the playoffs. As the postseason draws nearer, injuries become all the more important for contending teams. Suffering a major injury so close to the playoffs can end a player’s season for good. And even a minor injury could still have them hobbled early in January.

This week’s injury lineup features several important players to contending teams, headlined by Chargers QB Justin Herbert.

Let’s explore some of the most important injuries from Week 13 of the 2025 NFL season.

Colts CB Sauce Gardner (calf)

The Colts hoped that Sauce would immediately transform their defense. He has played well so far, but his latest injury could keep the superstar cornerback out for a little while.

Gardner is expected to miss a few weeks with his calf injury. Thankfully, he avoided the worst-case scenario (such as an Achilles injury) which could have easily been a season-ending injury.

Advertisement

It is great news that Gardner will be able to return during the regular season. However, the timing of his injury is still not ideal for the Colts.

Indianapolis is 8-4 but on a two-game losing streak. They are currently losing ground against the Jaguars (8-4) and Texans (7-5) in the AFC South.

The Colts play the Jaguars in Week 14, and doing so without Sauce is certainly not ideal.

Hopefully the Colts can keep their hopes of becoming division champs alive while Gardner gets healthy.

Chargers QB Justin Herbert (hand)

Herbert suffered a hand injury during LA’s big win against Las Vegas on Sunday.

The veteran quarterback fractured his left hand and is set to undergo surgery on Monday, according to head coach Jim Harbaugh.

At this point, the Chargers are uncertain if Herbert will miss any time. But it certainly seems possible considering it is a hand injury, even to his non-throwing hand.

Perhaps the Chargers will consider their standing in the AFC playoff race before deciding when to rush Herbert back.

Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle)

The superstar wide receiver suffered an ankle injury during the first quarter against the Packers on Thanksgiving.

St. Brown left the game and did not return, and Detroit felt his absence throughout the rest of the game on offense. Thankfully, his injury does not sound too severe.

NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported on Friday that St. Brown is believed to have suffered a low ankle sprain.

Detroit plays against Dallas on December 4th, but then has 10 days before their next game against Los Angeles.

The Lions will want St. Brown back on the field soon as they compete for a playoff spot in the NFC.

Vikings RB Aaron Jones (shoulder)

Jones started the game for the Vikings and played into the third quarter. But he suffered a shoulder injury and did not return to the game.

Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell said Jones will need further evaluation to determine the extent of his injury.

If Jones misses time, Jordan Mason could absorb most of his carries.

Meanwhile, O’Connell added that starting center Ryan Kelly suffered a hip flexor injury against the Seahawks. Kelly already missed multiple games this season after suffering multiple concussions.

The Vikings are already 4-8, so it will be interesting to see if they start resting players for the remainder of the season.

Browns DT Maliek Collins (knee)

Collins was carted off the field after suffering a knee injury against the 49ers. He was quickly ruled out for the rest of the game.

The Browns announced on Monday that Collins suffered a season-ending quadriceps injury. He will undergo surgery and is bracing himself for a lengthy recovery.

Veteran Sam Kamara could see more work with Collins out for the season.

Steelers LB Patrick Queen (hip)

Queen suffered what appeared to be a hip injury against the Bills in Week 13. However, further testing determined that Queen’s hip is not the issue.

NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported on Monday that Queen is believed to have suffered a lower back bruise. He will undergo further testing to determine the severity of his injury.

The situation could change, but there is currently hope that this is not a long-term injury.

Hopefully Queen can return soon as the Steelers try to stay alive in the AFC playoff race.

Bills edge rusher Joey Bosa (hamstring)

Bosa suffered a hamstring injury during the fourth quarter against the Steelers. He left the game and did not return.

It is currently unclear if Bosa’s injury is significant, or if the Bills were simply trying to play it safe with their star pass rusher.

Advertisement

Bosa has remained surprisingly healthy during his short stint in Buffalo. The veteran edge rusher has an extensive injury history. He even gave Bills fans a scare during the summer when he missed OTAs because of a calf issue.

Bosa’s injury history alone make this a potentially concerning situation for the Bills.

Fans should keep an eye out for further updates and monitor how much Bosa practices, if at all, ahead of Week 14.

Cleveland's first of two consecutive home games was impacted by a fourth down fumble and a muffed punt that resulted in 13 49ers points in a 26-8 loss. The Browns aim to start the month of December in the win column against Tennessee.

""We did too many things that make it hard to beat a good team,"" head coach Kevin Stefanski said. ""It's not about one play. There's not one play that I'm talking about. But just in general, as a team, we have to play complementary football, and that'll be our focus. That's something that we're watching the tape right now, pointing it out in ways that we could better offensively, defensively, special teams.""

Here are the main pieces of news and storylines heading into Week 14's game against the Titans.

Kevin Stefanski gives injury updates

Stefanski provided updates on DT Maliek Collins, RB Dylan Sampson, T Jack Conklin and G Wyatt Teller.

Collins will miss the remainder of the season with a quad injury that will require surgery. He was in the middle of a career season when he went down during the third quarter against the 49ers in Week 13. He had set a new career-high for sacks in a season with 6.5 in Week 12 against the Raiders and was inching toward career-highs in quarterback hits and tackles for loss.

""Very disappointed for Maliek, and he's obviously been playing such good football, and he provides great leadership for this football team,"" Stefanski said. ""So disappointed for him, but he will bounce back.""

Sampson suffered a calf injury in the third quarter against San Francisco before being ruled out in the fourth quarter. Stefanski said Sampson is day to day heading into Week 14. Conklin is in the concussion protocol after being evaluated near the end of the second quarter.

Teller is considered week to week with a calf injury and will miss Week 14, Stefanski said. G Teven Jenkins will take over his duties at guard after rotating snaps at the position previously with Teller.

""I felt like it would help Wyatt (Teller) play better,"" Stefanski said about putting Jenkins and Teller on a rotation at guard. ""I think Teven's (Jenkins) deserving of some plays and I thought both guys played really well yesterday.""

Browns' defense faces Cam Ward

Cleveland's defense's first test without Collins will be against the Titans and the 2025 first overall pick QB Cam Ward. Tennessee is 1-11 this season and has not won a game since Week 5.

Opposing defenses have impacted Ward all over the field, as he has been sacked two or more times in all 12 games. He has thrown for 2,351 yards and seven touchdowns but has been intercepted six times. Ward has stayed interception-free since Week 8 but has fumbled the ball nine times, including four times in the last four weeks.

The Browns have generated takeaways as a defense, recording 15 this season. They are tied for 11th for most takeaways in the NFL with nine interceptions and six fumble recoveries. The key to beating Tennessee is for Cleveland to keep forcing turnovers, according to LB Devin Bush.

""We just have to put him in a situation to struggle some more if he wants some success,"" Bush said. ""So as much as we can do that, the better off we'll be.""

Harold Fannin Jr. experiences the highs and lows of the NFL

As TE Harold Fannin Jr. turned his head, he caught the ball and ran six yards before putting his head down at the 3-yard line to power his way into the end zone in the second quarter. The touchdown was Fannin's third of the season and put the Browns up 8-7 with a two-point conversion from RB Quinshon Judkins.

Fannin has had a productive rookie season as he leads Cleveland with 51 receptions for 505 receiving yards and has three receiving touchdowns – tied with TE David Njoku for the most receiving touchdowns on the Browns.

In the third quarter, Fannin experienced the flip side of being in the NFL. Fannin fumbled a direct snap on fourth-and-1 at the Browns' 33-yard line and failed to convert. The 49ers scored with the short field and took a 17-8 lead.

""I feel like all players go through (wanting a play back),"" Fannin said. ""There's going to be some highs, there's going to be some lows but just come to work, ready to work every day.""

Preparing for Week 12 and Week 13 included building chemistry with QB Shedeur Sanders as the starter. Fannin has been a top option for Sanders since the rookie signal-caller entered at the beginning of the second half against the Ravens in Week 11.

Sanders and Fannin have connected eight times for 108 yards in three weeks. Sanders' first pass to Fannin was for 25 yards to get to the Ravens' side of the field in Week 11. The pass between the two rookies came with 2:31 left in the game as Sanders attempted to lead a comeback in his first regular season action. The two have spent extra time together to talk through different scenarios in order to build their chemistry.

""Obviously the practices, but I feel like I was just sitting down talking in the locker room, seeing how he wants things and seeing how I see things,"" Fannin said. ""Trying to just meet in the middle, really.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/browns/r0qjkbdgsd9fb1te1wny,N,,2025-12-01 19:04:37.253123
,,2025-12-01 22:42:17+00:00,www.vikings.com,Kevin O'Connell: Offensive Adjustments & Early Injury Updates for Week 14,Rob Kleifield,,,,,https://www.vikings.com/news/kevin-oconnell-offensive-adjustments-injury-updates-week-14,"Including the first shutout of the Vikings since 2007, Minnesota has totaled 307 yards over its past two games.
That's the team's second-lowest yardage output in a two-game span; the only stretch worse was Weeks 8-9 in 1971 (254).
""And I do believe that will lead to a little bit more rhythm and timing to our pass game,"" he continued.
O'Connell kicked a new week off with primarily positive updates on a handful of players, though.
""We're just not doing enough offensively to allow some of those bright spots to help us win,"" O'Connell concluded.","EAGAN, Minn. — What is Vikings Head Coach Kevin O'Connell's signature product?

The plain-as-day answer is an explosive offense, especially through the air. Minnesota's passing game ranked in the Top 5 in the NFL in pass touchdowns through each of his first three seasons at the helm.

Sadly, 2025 has transformed that production into a distant memory. Minnesota has started three QBs this year, beginning with J.J. McCarthy, then Carson Wentz and on Sunday undrafted rookie Max Brosmer, the sixth, seventh and eighth players to start at that spot since O'Connell's debut 2022 season.

This year's trio has 12 TDs. McCarthy owns the longest scoring pass among the three, with a 27-yarder to RB Aaron Jones, Sr., in his NFL debut. Wentz flicked the second-longest TD – 16 yards to RB Zavier Scott in Week 4 – and former backup RB Cam Akers, who coincidentally is on Seattle's practice squad now, is the club's current leader for longest TD pass thanks to his 32-yarder that was crucial to winning overseas.

O'Connell met with Twin Cities media members on Monday to debrief Sunday's 26-0 loss at Seattle and described it as a ""very disappointing"" day for the offense, led by Brosmer, who threw four interceptions.

Including the first shutout of the Vikings since 2007, Minnesota has totaled 307 yards over its past two games. That's the team's second-lowest yardage output in a two-game span; the only stretch worse was Weeks 8-9 in 1971 (254). (Incredibly, that roster went 11-3 and claimed the NFC Central division crown.)

Furthermore, combining Sunday's shutout and the pair of field goals at Lambeau Field, the six points scored by the Vikings is tied with Weeks 4-5 in 1991 for their second-fewest in consecutive games. The 1980 squad managed three points in Weeks 7-8. So you know, the 1962 club scored seven in Weeks 3-4.

When one reporter asked about home fans possibly expressing themselves negatively in a normally advantageous environment, O'Connell said it's not something to prepare for but empathized with how the fanbase may feel about the poor play on offense and the frustration that's mounted because of it.

""I understand how passionate our fans are and how much they love the Minnesota Vikings and that is not lost on me [for] one moment,"" O'Connell assured. ""If anything, you feel a total, complete obligation to our team, first and foremost – everybody that puts so much hard work in at this organization – but it's not lost on me how important our fans are to us and how much they mean to us from an energy standpoint and the support we do get. And you want to provide them with reasons to cheer and reasons to be excited about their team. And [it's] not always the easiest thing to do when you're kind of having to transform what you are in your current state as an offense. But also, it's about winning football games.""

He added: ""We've got five opportunities left. And I really look at it like opportunities to take every moment we have – sunup to sundown, all day, every day – to see the fruits of the improvement show up so that we can play complementary with a defense that's getting healthy and should be in a good place.""

Here are four takeaways from O'Connell's day-after-game press conference:

1. Introspection time

O'Connell cited three main areas he wants to personally improve: 1) determining ways to coach the details of the plays that are called; 2) figuring out what types of plays are going to be used; and 3) evaluating the number of plays that the offense will take into games (more on that in the next section).

After being asked how he plans to look inward to solve the offense's problems, O'Connell discussed a few topics, including his effort to commit to the run and his aggressiveness to get seven points instead of settling for three on failed fourth-and-1 attempts (one run, one pass) in the red zone the past two weeks.

""But I think, overall, it's just kind of figuring out exactly what we need to be [as an offense],"" he said.

""My job as a coach is to acknowledge [the lack of execution we're accustomed to] and understand A) how to coach it better – and still try to strive to see the improvement and try to stay true to who or really what our offensive philosophy is and has really helped us have a lot of success,"" O'Connell added. ""You don't really get mired down in the feelings of it; it's just – what's the best path moving forward?""

The play isn't ""remotely acceptable,"" O'Connell said, but his focus is ""finding a way to press onward.""

2. Assessing inventory

O'Connell didn't talk in depth about Brosmer's grasp of the offense, but he detailed some missed opportunities by the group early in the game and emphasized his discontent with the fourth-and-1 play call that allowed Seattle OLB DeMarcus Lawrence to freely attack Brosmer and incited him to flip an underhand pass near Josh Oliver that was intercepted and returned for an 85-yard TD by Ernest Jones IV.

""Ultimately, I didn't like the play call,"" the coach said, noting his confidence in the run game was low due to an inefficient start. ""I think at that point we were right around a 1-yard [per carry] average, maybe, and in that moment we better have a schematically more sound play, and that's totally on me. It's not on Josh. It's not on Max. It's not on anybody. That one was on me, and it was a massive play in the game.""

O'Connell spoke extensively about scaling down the playbook.

Decreasing the number of plays available to increase the potential for success is an adjustment that could help struggling young QBs. A reduced menu could also raise execution across the entire offense.

""It's handling movement, defensively, in the run game so that you don't end up with unblocked players at the point of attack,"" O'Connell detailed. ""Or in the pass game, it's maybe where there's a concerted effort to move Justin [Jefferson to scheme him open] and the formation is required for that where even if there's one play in a 10-play sequence, where if we don't align properly, whether it's a backside player's split, whether it's on the inside edge or the outside edge or in a normal split, or if it's where we want the location of a grouping of receivers we've just got to do a better job being a little bit more detailed.

""And I do believe that will lead to a little bit more rhythm and timing to our pass game,"" he continued. ""And then we've got to continue to work through finding ways to still throw the football where maybe we're using two of our eligibles to help with some of the things that have gone on up front, whether it's on the left side this week (missing starters Christian Darrisaw and Donovan Jackson) or losing Ryan [Kelly] in-game or at different times throughout the season where we've had a rotation [on the o-line].""

The bottom line is O'Connell knows he must minimize his spread of plays to maximize outcomes.

Sidenote: We rabbitted down a hole this morning to supply perspective on Brosmer's performance.

Here's worthwhile historical context regarding QBs of Brosmer's ilk: Undrafted rookies playing on the road in career start No. 1 are 5-12 since Chicago Cardinals QB M.C. Reynolds lost at Cleveland in 1958.

Brosmer was the third straight to lose after Tommy DeVito (2023) and Anthony Brown (2022). The most recent winner was Devlin Hodges leading Pittsburgh past Philip Rivers and Los Angeles on Oct. 13, 2019.

In first-start roadies at Seattle, undrafted QBs in any season of their career are 0-3 all-time. David Archer preceded Brosmer, losing a game in 1985, and Terry Luck lost eight years earlier in the Pacific Northwest.

Ignoring draft status and seasons, Brosmer became the 10th QB ever to make his starting debut on Seattle's visiting sideline. The last to do it before him was 2024 12th overall pick Bo Nix. The last to win was Dave Walter, a product of Michigan Tech, whose only NFL victory was beating the sea birds in 1987.

Also of note: Brosmer is the 81st undrafted QB to start a game as a first-year player – and the 36th to do so as a rookie based on Pro Football Reference's rookie qualifications – dating to 1953. And while Brosmer is one of 13 from the pool of 81 with three-plus picks (and one of six with four INTs) in those initial starts, he happens to be one of 18 with a completion rate greater than 62% – his clip ranked 16th.

Brosmer, by the way, is the third undrafted QB to make his first start dressed in Vikings garb. Todd Bouman, a Lyon County, Minnesota, native, and former QB at St. Cloud State, signed with the club as a UDFA in 1997 and later was allocated to NFL Europe. Bouman finally got his starting shot in 2001 and passed for 348 yards and four TDs in a rout of Steve McNair's Titans. Before that, journeyman Sean Salisbury replaced Rich Gannon as the starter in 1992 and had 238 yards in a 31-17 win over the Rams.

3. Injury check-in

The Vikings arrived at Lumen Field banged up and left with some additional concerns.

O'Connell kicked a new week off with primarily positive updates on a handful of players, though.

Darrisaw is expected to resume his normal practice workload this week, which has been restricted all season as part of his recovery from an ACL injury. There's hope the starting left tackle will be able to suit up at home against Washington. His buddy on the line, the rookie left guard Jackson, is improving and is expected to be day-to-day. Also in the trenches: Kelly sustained a hip flexor injury but has ""a real chance"" to play in Week 14, and veteran Blake Brandel is in the concussion protocol, although he's symptom-free.

Additionally, O'Connell mentioned that starting RB Jones reaggravated a shoulder injury he sustained several weeks ago but isn't ""any worse for the wear"" after a big hit knocked him out of Sunday's action.

As for McCarthy, the coach anticipates him stepping back in as the starter ""barring any unforeseen changes to where he's at today."" One of the final phases of McCarthy clearing the concussion protocol is logging a full practice, which could happen as soon as Wednesday. The 22-year-old is 2-4 as the starter.

4. On the bright side

Amidst the darkness, several players on Minnesota's defense and special teams continue to flash.

On Sunday, rookie returner Myles Price compiled 169 yards on six kickoff returns (28.2 avg.). He leapfrogged David Palmer in 1998 for the most punt/kick return yards in one season in franchise history.

Punter Ryan Wright was solid, as well, pinning Seattle inside its 20 twice. His long punt went for 60 yards and his average of five was 50.4. Twelve of Wright's past 25 punts have landed inside the opponent's 20.

Defensively, the Vikings are doing their best to keep games tight.

O'Connell said, ""I didn't want to end today without talking about Dallas Turner and the game he had yesterday. Eric Wilson having another great game. We saw Jay Ward get out there and play his role that he's found, kind of, as of late in our defense from a physicality standpoint, tackling – all those things.""

Turner's 2.0 sacks surged his 2025 total to a team-high 5.5. Wilson is right behind him with 4.5, and his four tackles for losses at Seattle improved his single-season highwater mark to 14 – and four in one game counted as the most by a Viking since Jonathan Greenard had that many at Chicago in Week 12 last year.

(Note: Antoine Winfield and Kevin Williams matched each other with efforts of five TFLs, the most in Vikings annals, in back-to-back weeks during the 2008 slate – at New Orleans and then against Detroit.)

""We're just not doing enough offensively to allow some of those bright spots to help us win,"" O'Connell concluded. ""And that is what we've got to try to continue to work towards. I know this, everybody's going to be totally all in on whatever needs to get done. And we're going to continue to work to do that.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/v6odruqm7yodue1vbbit,N,,2025-12-01 21:59:59.037771

""I think it's one of those things where you just stabilize it (and play),"" Herbert said.","Who's starting, who's hurt, and who's on the move?

NFL news is nonstop, and we're breaking it all down week by week this season.

Here's the latest on what's happening around the league entering Week 14:

Colts Sauce Gardner dealing with calf injury

Indianapolis Colts coach Shane Steichen said Monday that starting cornerback Sauce Gardner is expected to miss ""some time"" after injuring his left calf during Sunday's 20-16 loss to the Houston Texans but that Gardner avoided hurting his Achilles tendon.

Steichen didn't provide details on how much time the two-time All-Pro might miss but said he believed Gardner would return this season and that he's not expected to go on injured reserve.

Gardner was hurt on the Texans second offensive play of the game while in coverage, but he did not appear to get hit when he went down. He stayed on the field for several minutes before he was helped off the field and taken to the locker room.

The Colts envisioned pairing Gardner with two other Pro Bowl cornerbacks, Charvarius Ward and Kenny Moore II, to create one of the league's top secondaries when they acquired him in a trade deadline deal that included sending two first-round picks to the New York Jets.

So far, though, those plans haven't worked out. Gardner, Moore and Ward have only played one full game together.

Browns lose Collins for rest of season

Cleveland Browns defensive tackle Maliek Collins will be lost for the rest of the season after suffering a quad injury in Sunday's 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Coach Kevin Stefanski made the announcement Monday that Collins will have to undergo season-ending surgery.

The 10-year veteran defensive lineman sustained the non-contact injury during the third quarter. He was second on the team with 6.5 sacks along with 28 quarterback pressures. Collins is also a key reason why All-Pro pass rusher Myles Garrett needs four sacks to break the NFL's single-season record of 22.5.

""When you lose a guy like Maliek, you don’t replace him. He’s made a big impact on this football team on the field and off. We have some older guys in there (the defensive line room), but we have a bunch of young guys in there. I think they’ve learned a lot from the professional that Maliek is and I think you have to carry that with you throughout.""

Collins' injury with 9:36 remaining in the third quarter also set off a fracas between some of the Browns defensive linemen and San Francisco wide receiver Jauan Jennings. Garrett and Shelby Harris said some of Jennings' comments after the play crossed the line.

Chargers QB Herbert to undergo surgery

Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert will have surgery Monday to repair a broken bone in his non-throwing hand.

Herbert is optimistic about his chances to play next week for the Chargers (8-4), who beat the Raiders 31-14 on Sunday for their fourth victory in five games. Herbert played the final three quarters against Las Vegas with a hard cast on his left hand while exclusively taking shotgun snaps.

""I think it's one of those things where you just stabilize it (and play),"" Herbert said. ""I'm not the doctor, unfortunately, but they were hopeful, so I think that's a good thing.'

Herbert wasn't sure when his hand was broken, but it appeared to happen late in the Chargers’ opening drive when he was thrown to the ground by Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn after a short scramble. Herbert threw a touchdown pass to Quentin Johnston on the next snap, but trainers took him off the field a few minutes later.

""I'm treating it as if I'm playing Monday,"" Herbert said of the surgery and recovery, and the Chargers' next matchup against the Eagles. ""I think they were very hopeful for that, so I think that's just something we'll see tomorrow and get a feel for.""

Herbert has 2,842 yards passing with 21 touchdowns and 10 interceptions this season, his sixth for the Chargers.

Vikings waive WR Thielen

The Minnesota Vikings waived wide receiver Adam Thielen on Monday, allowing the 13-year veteran an opportunity for more playing time elsewhere down the stretch of his expected final NFL season and ending a disappointing return to his original team.

Thielen had just eight catches for 69 yards for the Vikings (4-8) this year and was a healthy scratch for their game at Seattle on Sunday, a 26-0 loss that was their first shutout in 18 years. With the Vikings struggling badly on offense, Thielen was rarely used behind the top three wide receivers Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and Jalen Nailor.

Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said Thielen's agent asked last week for his release so he could find a more significant role with another club. Thielen plans to retire after this season.

""Following discussions through the weekend and out of respect for Adam, we have agreed to give him the opportunity to pursue more playing time elsewhere. Adam is one of the all-time great Vikings, and we wish him and his family continued success,"" Adofo-Mensah said.

Here are five takeaways from Chargers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh's Monday press conference:

1. Justin Herbert injury update

Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert has undergone surgery for a broken bone in his left hand.

The team released the following statement on Monday afternoon:

Chargers QB Justin Herbert underwent successful surgery today in Los Angeles to stabilize a fracture in his left hand.

Herbert's return to play is considered day-to-day, and his status for next Monday's game against Philadelphia will be determined later in the week.

Herbert was injured in the first quarter of the Bolts eventual 31-14 win over the Raiders.

Trey Lance led the Chargers next offensive series but Herbert returned to the game a few minutes into the second quarter and promptly threw a 10-yard pass to Keenan Allen to move the chains on third down.

""They just put a hard cast on it, put a glove around it. I think that was basically it,"" Herbert said postgame about returning to action.

Herbert stayed in for the rest of the game but he did not line up under center, instead staying in shotgun and pistol formations to avoid any snaps near the line of scrimmage.

Both Harbaugh and Herbert said Sunday that it's unclear if the quarterback will miss any time going forward. The Chargers next game is a Week 14 primetime date with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday Night Football.

Herbert said both he and the Chargers medical staff are hopeful that he won't have to miss any games.

""I'm treating it as if I'm playing on Monday,"" Herbert said. ""I think they were very hopeful for that. I think that's something that we'll see [Monday] and we'll get a feel for. I think they were very hopeful so that's always a good thing.""

Harbaugh said: ""We'll see where the week takes us.""

The Chargers Head Coach later added: ""He's as tough as they come. Taped it up, glove and played a great game.""

With five games left, the Chargers sit at 8-4 and occupy the No. 5 seed in the AFC playoff picture.

2. Harbaugh pleased with Lance

As mentioned above, Lance was thrust into action for 10 snaps Sunday against the Raiders.

He took over late in the first quarter when the Bolts began at their own 7-yard line, completing his only pass attempt to wide receiver Tre' Harris for a nine-yard gain on his second play.

Harbaugh on Monday was asked about how Lance fared in Week 13.

""Calm, cool, collected. Came in and held down the fort. Really did a good job coming off of our own goal line,"" Harbaugh said. ""I thought he did really good moving us down the field.""

Although the Bolts mostly ran the ball with Lance at quarterback, he helped the Bolts get to midfield before Herbert returned to the game.

""Then all of the sudden it was third-and-5 and Justin just ran in,"" Harbaugh said. ""Converted on a throw to Keenan on the boundary and really never looked back.""

Harbaugh said Monday that he wants to get Lance more reps this week in practice, particularly in goal line scenarios, in case Herbert potentially plays and is limited there again Monday night.

""All possibilities. We'll be better prepared for those situations,"" Harbaugh said. ""Looking back on it, I don't think we've gotten enough reps with Trey in those situations. But that will be a point of emphasis this week.

""Justin is a quarterback who takes all the reps, he's a machine like that,"" Harbaugh added. ""We'll make sure Trey is getting more of those goal line reps, under center. I need to do a better job of that.""

3. All options under center

One reason Harbaugh wants Lance to get more reps is that the Chargers were unable to take advantage of a situation Sunday against the Raiders.

On Herbert's first full drive back in the game — which came after an interception from Tony Jefferson — the offense faced fourth-and-1 at the Las Vegas 18-yard line.

But with Herbert unable to line up under center, he was in shotgun as Kimani Vidal was stopped for no gain and a turnover on downs.

Harbaugh noted Monday that he would have liked Lance in the game or to use Tyler Conklin on a surprise sneak, which the Bolts did back in Week 1 against the Chiefs in Brazil.

""In hindsight, we would have a different play called there either using Trey under center or we could have gone with Conk,"" Harbaugh said. ""We would have liked to have that back. Guys overcame it but we could have gone with other options.""

""Right after we were like, 'Ahhh.' Could have, should have,"" Harbaugh added.

Harbaugh, speaking in general terms, said Monday that they Chargers were able to get to most of their playbook despite not being able to go under center.

""We improvised and adjusted. Many of the under center plays you could do in pistol,"" Harbaugh said. ""There's certain plays it takes you out of, but there's other plays you can take from the pistol or the gun.""

""We'll just see where the week takes us and what we can do … but you can still do them,"" Harbaugh added.

4. An update on Omarion Hampton

Harbaugh was also asked about the status of rookie running back Omarion Hampton, who returned to practice last week but was not activated for Sunday's game.

""We opened his window and we certainly wouldn't have done that — his 21-day window — if he wasn't close. Again, feel like he's been on track and let the week play out,"" Harbaugh said.

Hampton has been on Injured Reserve since suffering an ankle injury in Week 5. He said last week that he was excited to get back on the field at some point and help the Bolts with a playoff push.

""It feels good, feels great just to be back out with the guys. Couldn't ask for nothing better,"" Hampton said Thursday.

He later added: ""I don't know a percentage, but I feel super good. I'm getting back to where I'm at. Getting more comfortable with it, so I feel really good where I'm at.""

Hampton had been one of the Chargers most productive offensive players before his injury, tallying 86 total touches for 450 yards and two touchdowns.

5. Praise for the physicality

Sunday's win over the Raiders was a Harbaugh-type victory through and through, meaning the Bolts dominated up front, especially in the trenches with the run game.

The Chargers ran for 192 yards, their second-highest total of the season, while allowing a season-low 31 rushing yards to the Raiders. The difference of plus-161 yards was the Chargers second-best mark of the season only behind the Vikings win.

And you can bet Harbaugh loved how the Bolts responded after a down day in the trenches in Week 11.

""There was definitely a point of emphasis on it. All things paid dividends and were all pieces of the puzzle schematically,"" Harbaugh said. ""There was a lot of variation, we probably ran 30 different types of runs during the game so that was really good.""

""Some stellar plays by Kimani Vidal,"" Harbaugh said. ""And J-Pat ... great to see his first touchdown [with the Chargers] and the yards after contact he created.""

Harbaugh also credited the Chargers pass catchers with hanging tough against a division-rival defense. While it was a relatively quiet day on the stat sheet, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston found the end zone and Keenan Allen came up clutch on third downs.

""You talk about tough, physical play, it was anybody who had the ball in their hands during the game was able to not turn it over,"" Harbaugh said. ""There were hard hits and contested catches by the receivers.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chargers/hi1esvz46nab8huvwcjo,N,,2025-12-01 20:01:41.666867

“It’s his calf,” Steichen said.
“Felt like I got shot in the calf or something, but it was like high (in my calf),” Gardner said after the game.
“I wasn’t fearing (an Achilles injury).
Despite the injury, Gardner appeared to be in relatively good spirits as he interacted with his coaches and teammates during Indy’s eventual 20-16 loss.","Indianapolis Colts star cornerback Sauce Gardner will miss “some time” due to a left calf injury, coach Shane Steichen said Monday.

Steichen declined to outline a specific timetable for Gardner’s return, but the coach did say the cornerback won’t be placed on injured reserve and that he expects Gardner to suit up again for the Colts this season. The cornerback’s absence will be a big loss for Indianapolis to overcome, but it’s still a relief for him and the team that further testing did not reveal an Achilles injury.

“It’s his calf,” Steichen said. “His Achilles is good to go.”

Gardner exited Sunday’s loss to the Houston Texans after playing just two snaps. He came up lame while being blocked by Texans tight end Cade Stover and needed to be helped off the field and back to the locker room.

“Felt like I got shot in the calf or something, but it was like high (in my calf),” Gardner said after the game. “I wasn’t fearing (an Achilles injury). I wasn’t thinking it.”

Gardner was quickly ruled out for the remainder of the game. He returned to the sideline while using crutches and wearing a boot on his lower left leg. Despite the injury, Gardner appeared to be in relatively good spirits as he interacted with his coaches and teammates during Indy’s eventual 20-16 loss.

The Colts acquired Gardner, 25, in a massive trade with the New York Jets on Nov. 4. Indianapolis shipped its next two first-round picks and wide receiver AD Mitchell to New York in exchange for Gardner, who was the 2022 No. 4 pick and Defensive Rookie of the Year. Gardner is also the only cornerback since the NFL merger in 1970 to have earned a first-team All-Pro selection in each of his first two seasons.

Gardner was supposed to give Indianapolis a boost amid its playoff push, but now it appears the Colts will have to make at least part of that push without him. The Colts were in first place in the AFC after defeating the Atlanta Falcons in Week 10, which was Gardner’s franchise debut, but that was their only victory in November. Indianapolis has now lost back-to-back games for the first time this season and three of its last four.

The Colts will likely turn to Jaylon Jones and Mekhi Blackmon while Gardner is out. Jones, a 2023 seventh-round pick, has started 28 games over the past three years. Blackmon, a 2023 third-round pick whom the Colts acquired in an August trade with the Minnesota Vikings, has started seven games this year.

“That’s the NFL. Guys are gonna get hurt. Guys are gonna get injured and miss time,” Steichen said. “… You gotta put the pieces together and scheme it up and put your guys in position to go be successful. Whoever’s out there, we got faith and trust in whoever steps into that role and how we use them.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/01123826/GettyImages-2249213729-scaled-e1764610734408.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-01 19:04:44.555493

With the final set of bye weeks upon us and fantasy playoffs starting for many leagues, it’s officially crunch time.

Let’s dive in.

Week 14 Byes: Carolina Panthers, New England Patriots, New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers

NFL Week 14 Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers

Herbert will undergo surgery today to fix a metacarpal fracture in his non-throwing hand. That said, he is expected to be ready to play in week 14 against the Eagles.

J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings

Kevin O’Connell stated that McCarthy no longer has any concussion symptoms and should return if he has no setbacks and practices fully on Wednesday.

Sam Darnold, Seattle Seahawks

Darnold is dealing with an ankle injury. That said, it’s not expected to hamper him heavily, and he will likely be good to go this weekend.

NFL Week 14 Injury Report: Running Backs

Aaron Jones, Minnesota Vikings

Jones has been dealing with various issues this year and will have his recent shoulder injury evaluated further, per head coach Kevin O’Connell. This evaluation has shown that this is not a serious injury, and he’s currently day-to-day per Adam Schefter.

NFL Week 14 Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Marvin Harrison, Arizona Cardinals

Marv returned from his appendectomy only to miss time in the second half of the game due to a heel injury. Given that he was unable to return and the team has been removed from playoff contention, this may be used to shut MHJ down for the remainder of the season.

Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions

Head Coach Dan Campbell has stated that he doesn’t have a clear idea of whether ARSB will be available on Thursday against Dallas. He stated he is not expected to have any idea of his status until game day. This ankle injury could be a limiting factor for ARSB as the Lions fight for a playoff push, as they currently are not in the playoffs.

Drake London, Atlanta Falcons

London is now being considered “day-to-day” and has a chance to play this weekend, per head coach Raheem Morris. This would be a big addition back for this Falcons offense and for fantasy managers.

Tee Higgins, Cincinnati Bengals

Higgins is still in concussion protocol per Ben Baby of ESPN. His absence was noticed in Joe Burrow’s return, and the hope is that he can clear protocol and return to the lineup this weekend, though we have seen an increase in multi-week absences from concussions this year.

Jayden Reed, Green Bay Packers

Reed has yet to be medically cleared for game action. That said, head coach Matt LaFleur plans to see where he is at by the end of the week, signifying that he could return to action sooner than expected.

Parker Washington, Jacksonville Jaguars

Washington left this weekend's game against the Titans with a hip injury. He’s been a solid fill-in for managers, but they may be without him moving forward into the playoffs if he misses time.

Mike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Evans is expected to return to practice this week. This is huge news for the Buccs, and while he likely won’t be active this week, managers can hopefully get him back active after this weekend.

NFL Week 14 Injury Report: Tight Ends

Dalton Kincaid, Buffalo Bills

Kincaid has continued to remain inactive with his hamstring injury. He had started to return to practice in a limited fashion, but he will likely need to log full practices prior to returning to game action.",https://d29m18w01sxjzp.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/source/fatest/st_brown_nfl_injury_report_week_14-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 18:05:14.699405

Cowboys’ initial injury report","The Detroit Lions (7-5) and Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1) have declared their initial Week 14 injury reports as they prepare to square off in an NFC showdown. With this game being played on a Thursday, the Lions’ practice schedule is altered this week. Their initial report comes out on Monday, while the injury declarations will be announced on Wednesday.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Zylstra, who has been out most of the season with an ankle injury, has returned to practice. With the Lions’ tight end room currently without their top two options, Zylstra could bring a big boost to the room when fully healthy and ready to return.

Paschal appeared to be progressing through the injury evaluation window, but was downgraded and unable to practice midway through last week, indicating something unexpected likely happened. Unfortunately, his injury evaluation clock expired last Wednesday, and the Lions elected to leave him on the NFI list, thus ending his 2025 season. With Paschal being in a contract year, he’ll enter the offseason with his future in limbo.

“It just wasn’t enough time, really, to really be able to say that we knew he would be able to get through the year or that he was ready,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said on Sunday. “That’s what it came down to. Hate it for him, but it’s where it was at.”

No practice

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) — injured in Week 13

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle)

TE Brock Wright (neck)

CB Terrion Arnold (shoulder) — New injury

St. Brown’s injury is not expected to be long-term, and an MRI confirmed a low ankle sprain with no structural damage, but it could keep him out of this game and possibly the next. St. Brown will surely be pushing to play this week, but don’t expect the Lions to take any chances with one of their core players. If there’s any risk, they’ll likely hold him out.

Raymond’s availability is still a bit of a mystery as the Campbell did not provide an update ahead of this report, but hopefully, we’ll know more on Tuesday.

Wright’s neck injury was clarified a bit this week: Campbell called it a “trachea” injury, and Dave Birkett later reported that the tight end actually fractured cartilage in his throat, similarly to what Frank Ragnow did five years ago. Unfortunately, without new information, this could result in a long-term injury.

“Nothing new from last week,” Campbell stated. “We’re still sending out scans for this trachea and just seeing if there’s any other second opinions that would change the outlook for him playing. And right now, there’s really nothing, right now, that would change that. And I know that frustrates him; he wants to play. But we’re just kind of in a holding pattern right now.”

Arnold just cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol and returned to limited work in Week 13. He didn’t appear to suffer his shoulder injury in the game, but he was unable to practice on Monday, indicating it likely popped up afterward.

Limited practice

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

TE Shane Zylstra (ankle, IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 20

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

C Graham Glasgow (knee) — Upgraded from no practice

S Brian Branch (toe/ankle)

S Kerby Joseph (knee) — Upgraded from no practice

Vaki continues to play through his most recent injuries, though his thumb injury is likely what’s keeping him from a special teams returner role. It’s worth noting that he is no longer listed with an ankle injury.

Decker has routinely alternated between participating in practices and taking time off to allow his body to heal. Nothing new to worry about here.

Glasgow’s doing “better,” Campbell said on Sunday, while also making sure to note that they’ve only done walkthroughs ahead of Monday’s practice. Nothing is certain at this stage of his rehabilitation, but a return to the field is a step in the right direction.

Branch has had lingering foot injuries for just over a month now, but he’s been able to play through them for the most part. It’s worth keeping an eye on things, but the concern level is very low.

Joseph has now missed six games as the Lions work toward getting “some stability in the leg.” But he’s been running and doing some individual work for a while now, and a return to practice on Monday is a big next step.

“I mean, he’s closer than he was before,” Campbell noted on Sunday. “He’s close. We’ll know a lot more, really, tomorrow (Monday). Today’s a walkthrough, so tomorrow (and Tuesday), see where he’s at. But he is getting better, like we said, he gets better every week.”

No longer on the injury report

RB Jacob Saylors (back/knee)

WR Isaac TeSlaa (hand)

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

RG Tate Ratledge (knee)

G Miles Frazier (knee)

EDGE Marcus Davenport (shoulder)

Saylors has also played through his injuries and is contributing fully on special teams, but he’s now off the injury report. With Craig Reynolds off to the Patriots, Saylors and Vaki’s roles have increased.

TeSlaa has been banged up of late but has been able to play through an oblique and hand injury. With St. Brown and Raymond not practicing, the rookie should be in line for another starting role this week.

Sewell has been a regular on the injury report of late, but he’s managed to play through all of his injuries. Now that he’s off the injury report, the expectation is that he’ll start again this week without concern.

Ratledge has also been able to play through his injuries, as the rookie’s body has been able to bounce back quickly when dealing with an injury. With him clear of the injury report, things are looking up.

Frazier was activated from PUP last week, but was ruled inactive for the game. It’s not clear whether his ankle or inexperience kept him from participating, but he’s headed in the right direction.

Davenport was activated from IR last week and was immediately dropped into the starting lineup. With Kelvin Sheppard demanding more from the team’s pass rush and even considering altering the scheme, having a player like Davenport at his disposal will certainly help.

Rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart has missed each of New York's last two games while in the NFL's concussion protocol, and the Giants remained winless in games the rookie has not started. Will Dart play against the New England Patriots on ""Monday Night Football""?

Dart suffered his head injury in a Week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears – resulting in his fourth concussion check since the Giants' final preseason game. Team doctors diagnosed the rookie with a concussion, putting him in the NFL's five-step concussion protocol that he had to clear before returning. The Mississippi product reached the penultimate step of the five-part protocol last week but was unable to clear the final hurdle before Week 12's loss to the Detroit Lions.

That changed in Week 13, and Big Blue's first-round pick will indeed make his highly anticipated return to action as the calendar turns to December.

Here's what to know about Dart's status for ""Monday Night Football"":

Is Jaxson Dart playing today?

Yes. Dart will make his first start since Week 10. The Giants rookie's eighth career start will be against the team that New York defeated in its last two Super Bowl appearances: the Patriots.

Dart will face off against a fellow young gunslinger in New England's rising star and second-year quarterback Drake Maye. Maye is among betting favorites to win this year's NFL MVP award, while Dart is second in BetMGM's betting odds to win the Offensive Rookie of the Year award.

The Giants quarterback may have been more of a shoo-in for the award if he hadn't missed New York's last two games while working his way through the NFL's concussion protocol. Dart suffered his head injury in a Week 10 loss in Chicago, which was one of the final nails in the coffin for head coach Brian Daboll. The Giants fired him after the game.

New York is winless (0-5) in games in which Dart has not started behind center. Veterans Winston (0-2) and Russell Wilson (0-3) both struggled at times and were both unable to overcome late-game defensive collapses.

The Giants are already mathematically eliminated from playoff contention, but Dart's return for the final stretch gives the team a bit of intrigue for the last six weeks of the season.

Jaxson Dart stats

Dart took over as the Giants' starting quarterback in Week 4 after the team got off to an 0-3 start. He has since missed two games while dealing with a concussion he suffered in Week 10.

Here's how the rookie's stats look through seven career starts:

Completion rate: 128-of-204 (62.7%)

Passing yards: 1,417

Touchdowns: 10

Interceptions: 3

Passer rating: 93.5

Rushing: 57 attempts for 317 yards (5.6 yards per carry) and seven touchdowns

Giants QB depth chart

Jaxson Dart (active – concussion protocol)

Jameis Winston

Russell Wilson

Dart is active for his first game since Week 10's loss to the Bears. Winston was elevated to the team's backup quarterback spot after that game, and he started each of the Giants' last two games against the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions.

Wilson, like Winston, was a veteran free agent New York signed in the offseason. After beginning the year as Big Blue's starting quarterback, he struggled to run the offense and slid to the third spot on the Giants' depth chart.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/01/USAT/87551231007-jaxson-dart-giants-imagn.jpg?crop=4803,2702,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-01 18:05:23.553269

The team released veteran wideout Adam Thielen on Monday at his request, allowing the 35-year-old to finish his career with another franchise.

Thielen and the Vikings confirmed the news with posts on social media Monday. The team said Thielen approached it about finishing out his NFL career in a competitive situation. The Vikings decided to grant that wish.

Thielen confirmed as much, saying this will be his final season in the NFL and he wanted to compete over the final weeks of his career.

While Thielen didn't explicitly say it, it's pretty clear the veteran is hoping for a Super Bowl run before he hangs up his cleats. That wasn't going to come with the Vikings. After nearly winning the NFC North last year, the Vikings find themselves at 4-8 this season thanks to poor quarterback play, among other issues. With the playoffs all but out of the question for the Vikings, Thielen will look to hook on with a team still in the hunt.

The 35-year-old hasn't been super involved in the Vikings' offense this season. Through 11 games, Thielen has just eight receptions for 69 yards. He likely wouldn't start on a more competitive team, but could provide solid depth with the playoffs quickly approaching.

Whether he can catch on with another club depends on how the rest of the NFL views Thielen at this point in his career. During his prime, he was a sure-handed, target commander with a knack for getting open in the end zone.

From 2016-2022, Thielen averaged nearly 1,000 yards and 7.7 touchdowns per season with the Vikings. He made two Pro Bowls over that period, earning a second team All-Pro nod in 2017. Though his yardage totals dropped at the back end of that stretch, Thielen made up for it with his end-zone dominance. He caught 14 touchdowns in 15 games in 2020 and 10 in 2021 despite only playing in 13 games.

Following the 2022 NFL season, Thielen joined the Carolina Panthers on a three-year deal. He gained over 1,000 receiving yards in his first season with team.

After a down year in 2024, the Panthers agreed to trade Thielen back to the Vikings in a draft-pick swap. He hasn't emerged as a big option back in Minnesota, though the team does have both Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison on its depth chart, making it hard for Thielen to make a significant impact.

If contending NFL teams still believe Thielen has something left, he could still fulfill his dream of competing for a title before his career is over. If not, there's always the possibility a late injury opens the door for Thielen to get one more shot at a Super Bowl win.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Rf16GuxrZuwWiD.UxkjeMQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/5572e1b0-ceda-11f0-adff-7e91f3593ddb,N,,2025-12-01 18:05:32.223476

Wiggins is day-to-day, Head Coach John Harbaugh said Monday.

""We'll see where he's at on Wednesday and we'll see where he's at going forward from there,"" Harbaugh said.

The Ravens would love to have Wiggins play Sunday in a huge AFC North matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers at M&T Bank Stadium.

If he cannot play, the Ravens still have Marlon Humphrey and Chidobe Awuzie as their top two cornerbacks, with T.J. Tampa and Keyon Martin as the top backups.

In Aaron Rodgers' first game back from a fractured wrist Sunday against the Buffalo Bills, he threw for 117 yards, and burly tight end Darnell Washington was the leading receiver with two catches for 45 yards.

Justice Hill to Return this Season; Rasheen Ali Steps in Well

Justice Hill went on injured reserve last week before the Ravens placed the Bengals, but it isn't a season-ending neck injury, Harbaugh said.

Harbaugh said Hill had a disc issue that was bothering him and started causing issues. He's expected to miss three to four weeks.

""Justice does have a chance to come back,"" Harbaugh said.

Rasheen Ali stepped into Hill's role and played the most snaps (29) of any of the team's running backs against the Bengals. That was partly because the Ravens were in their two-minute offense so much as they tried to claw their way from behind.

Harbaugh commended Ali on the job he did Thursday night, but also would've liked for Derrick Henry and Keaton Mitchell to have more action.

""He played really well,"" Harbaugh said. ""He pass protected well, he ran his routes well, he chipped well. He had one run I thought he was tentative on.""

Rookie linebacker Chandler Martin will not return this season, however, and will undergo surgery to repair a torn ACL suffered on the opening kickoff Thursday night. He had five special teams tackles in two games.

""He started to establish himself. That was neat to see as a young player,"" Harbaugh said.

Tavius Robinson, Ar'Darius Washington Set to Return to Practice

There's a ""good chance"" that two key Ravens defenders, outside linebacker Tavius Robinson and safety Ar'Darius Washington, return to practice this week, Harbaugh said.

Robinson has been sidelined since suffering a foot injury in Week 5 against the Houston Texans. Washington has been rehabbing since going down with a torn Achilles injury in May.

Robinson is a rugged run defender that the Ravens would love to plug back into the mix up front. He also had two sacks in the first five games.

The Ravens are already using Kyle Hamilton, Malaki Starks, and Alohi Gilman on nearly every defensive snap, so it's tougher to project how Washington would be used upon his return, but he is a versatile and strong player who would help.

Harbaugh Discusses Emery Jones Jr.'s Debut and His Future Role

Harbaugh indicated that left guard is likely to remain the only position this season for rookie Emery Jones Jr., who saw his first NFL action against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Jones played 16 snaps in a rotation with starter Andrew Vorhees, who had 44 snaps. Jones can also play right guard, where Daniel Faalele has started every game, but the Ravens want to avoid putting too much on Jones' plate.

""It's possible, but it's hard to do,"" Harbaugh said of playing both left and right guard. ""Take a rookie and put him on both sides, you kind of compound the [learning] curve.""

Harbaugh said Jones showed promise as he continued to develop as a third-round pick from LSU. He underwent shoulder surgery after the Combine and did not begin practicing until Oct. 1.

""I thought he played hard and showed some athleticism and some fight and some gusto,"" Harbaugh said. ""Played like a rookie in a lot of ways, a lot of things to clean up. He'd be the first to tell you that.

""But you can't really start making those improvements until you play. He got a chance to do that, which was really positive. We just have to see going forward how much we want to continue that [rotation] as we go.""

Harbaugh Can Only Live With Extending Ball Near Goal Line 'When It Turns Out Good'

Isaiah Likely committed one of Baltimore's five turnovers against the Bengals, getting the ball knocked out of his hands when he extended it just before reaching the goal line.

Harbaugh made it clear that extending the ball near the goal line should only be done with the utmost caution. Zay Flowers also lost a crucial fumble in the 2023 AFC championship game after he extended the ball near the goal line while being tackled.

""I want the ball secured in ball security position – high and tight, period,"" Harbaugh said. ""Extending the ball on the goal line has its place, when you've got two strong hands on the ball and you have space and there's no traffic. I see that, I can live with that. [But] I can only live with it when it turns out good. Because even if you do that and you don't execute it, then it was too much.""

Harbaugh understands the temptation of wanting to reach out the ball, but it's a risky move that can be very costly.

""You have to make a little bit of an allowance for pro football players who are very talented,"" Harbaugh said. ""You see some great plays made. We're not going to coach our guys out of that. But when you take it to the next level of doing something that's not sound, that's not good. That's not winning football.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/ravens/momubfdpixwliz0eb2pw,N,,2025-12-01 17:04:19.215681

Gardner, traded to Indianapolis from the New York Jets last month in a stunning transaction, sustained the injury on the first defensive series against Houston, prompting fears that he might have sustained a dreaded Achilles tear.

Gardner could not initially walk without assistance and did not return to the game. He was provided crutches by the team's medical staff but was later able to walk gingerly without assistance after the game. After further examination Monday, the news was positive, Steichen said.

""His Achilles is good to go, but he'll probably miss some time,"" he said of Gardner. ""How much time? I do not know at the moment.""

Placing Gardner on injured reserve, which would require him to miss a minimum of four games, is not a consideration, Steichen said. The Colts (8-4) have five regular-season games remaining and are in a fight for a spot in the AFC playoff field.

Gardner's absence changes things for the Colts. They had intended to use him and fellow standout cornerback Charvarius Ward in static roles on the right and left sides of the defense, respectively. But Gardner's injury upended that plan, with Ward switching roles Sunday and following Houston's top receiver, Nico Collins, around the formation. That made for a much heavier lift.

""Just having to rise to the occasion,"" Ward said Monday. ""I don't think I played well. ... I'll get better, though.""

Collins had five catches for 98 yards in the game. It was just the second game with Gardner and Ward paired in the Colts' backfield, with Ward having returned from injured reserve just one week earlier.

The Arizona Cardinals will continue to navigate their backfield without Trey Benson, as the promising young running back remains on injured reserve with no firm return date in sight. Benson has been working his way back from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the recovery has taken longer than initially hoped. With Week 14 approaching, the uncertainty surrounding his availability has become one of the team’s most closely watched storylines. Benson hasn’t appeared in a game since Week 4, and while he was designated to return from injured reserve on November 19, the Cardinals have yet to activate him. He logged a limited practice earlier in the week, but his subsequent absence raised questions about whether he experienced a setback. Although speculation continues, head coach Jonathan Gannon has kept details guarded, reiterating that Benson’s status is being evaluated on a day-to-day basis as the deadline to activate him draws near.

Trey Benson activation deadline approaches with Week 15 emerging as most likely return target

The Cardinals have until December 10 to decide whether to bring Benson back to the active roster, giving them a shrinking window to make a call. Reports from team insider Darren Urban suggest that the next week will be a crucial checkpoint, especially with the 21-day activation period nearing its conclusion. Despite early signs of progress, Benson finishing the week as a non-participant in practice has tempered expectations for a Week 14 return.

Trey Benson 🔥 Scariest RB in College Football ᴴᴰ

This makes Week 15 the more realistic target, barring a significant improvement in his condition. The Cardinals continue to approach Benson’s recovery with caution, mindful of both his long-term health and the importance of having him fully ready when he returns. In the meantime, Arizona’s depth at running back remains under pressure, and the team must keep adjusting its offensive approach while awaiting clarity on Benson’s comeback. As the Cardinals push deeper into the season, Benson’s recovery timeline remains a key storyline for fans tracking roster decisions and the team’s offensive rhythm. His return could provide a valuable boost, but for now, all signs point to continued patience as Week 14 approaches, making his comeback even more critical.

This is actually the first time in NFL history where there are five divisions that include a lead under one game this late in a season. That includes the NFC North, as the 9-3 Chicago Bears lead the 8-3-1 Green Bay Packers, who are one spot above the 7-5 Detroit Lions.

The Bears are now the No. 1 seed in the NFC following the Los Angeles Rams' shocking loss to the Carolina Panthers, but Chicago's newfound top-seed hope could be shortlived. This Sunday, the Bears have to travel to Green Bay to play the Packers who would overtake Chicago in the division with a win. But where does all this leave the Lions?

Detroit is now officially a long shot to repeat as division champions, listed at +950 over at FanDuel Sportsbook. In fact, the Lions are currently listed as underdogs to make the playoffs straight up at +122. Following their Thanksgiving loss to the Packers, the Lions are in treacherous waters, and on Thursday night they'll host a red-hot Dallas Cowboys team that has won three straight games, a run which includes back-to-back victories over last season's Super Bowl participants.

Games and seasons don't come down to one play or one player, but if the Lions don't have this one player on the field Thursday against the Cowboys, their playoff chances will take a massive hit. That player is wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown.

The impact of Amon-Ra St. Brown

The Lions' WR1 suffered a low-ankle sprain early in the Week 13 loss to Green Bay, according to NFL Media. The injury can sideline a player for one to two weeks, but St. Brown is going to try to play through it. Remember, Detroit is already without tight end Sam LaPorta, so losing St. Brown could ground Jared Goff's offense.

According to CBS Sports Research, the Lions rank No. 1 in yards per play with St. Brown on the field since he began his NFL career in 2021, and No. 25 with him off the field. Detroit also ranks No. 2 in offensive efficiency with St. Brown on the field, and No. 16 with him sidelined. His 505 receptions rank second all-time in a player's first five career seasons, and he's recorded at least 1,161 yards receiving in each of the last three seasons, and double-digit touchdowns in the last two seasons.

While the Cowboys famously had a terrible defense early in the season, that is no longer the case. Dallas acquired star defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and linebacker Logan Wilson at the trade deadline, added linebacker DeMarvion Overshown and cornerback Shavon Revel Jr. to the lineup, and cornerback Trevon Diggs is expected back in the near future as well. And those consecutive wins against last seaon's AFC and NFC champs? The Cowboys are actually the only team in NFL history to beat both of the prior season's Super Bowl teams in a five-day span. The fact that they came back from a 21-0 deficit against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 12, and then fended off Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs on Thanksgiving just adds to the story.

If Lions fans are looking for a bit of good news, this team has alternated wins and losses in eight straight games. Plus, the last time the Lions and Cowboys met, Jerry Jones experienced his largest home loss in the form of a 47-9 beatdown. However, this Lions defense has struggled as of late, and the offense could be dealt a tough hand in not having LaPorta or St. Brown on the field for this pivotal Week 14 NFC showdown.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/01/4f060c11-2318-4662-ba89-c31d4195ea99/thumbnail/1200x675/6fa865cd0e5b53cd7d5acbd76f8e930c/st-brown.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:05:14.299859

1. IF THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO CONSIDER FROM SUNDAY …

It’s that maybe Sam Darnold wouldn’t have fixed this Vikings team.

Back when the NFL schedule came out, Sam Darnold and the Vikings must have circled this week on their calendars. It would be somebody’s revenge game.

Seahawks versus Vikings.

NFC Heavyweights!

But leading into this game, we all knew how it would end — with a Seahawks win. The biggest surprise was that no one would walk away vindicated, if only because the Seahawks were not picking on someone their size. No, this was just a sadly lopsided game where Seattle looked like a superteam compared to the lowly Vikings.

The Vikings’ quarterback problems got to the point where people actually thought — myself included — that Max Brosmer, an undrafted free agent, might be an upgrade over J.J. McCarthy. No, Brosmer was just as bad as (and probably worse than) McCarthy.

Brosmer threw four interceptions.

The Vikings finished the game with 162 yards and 11 first downs on 13 drives.

They were so bad that I wonder if this was inevitable for Minnesota. And rather than thinking, Wow, Darnold really could’ve gotten this team into the playoffs and they should have re-signed him. I found myself thinking, Wow, maybe Darnold actually escaped a Minnesota team that would’ve sunk him.

And the Vikings have to figure out not just who they’ll play at quarterback but also how they’ll support him in ways that they failed to do this year. Coach Kevin O’Connell was awesome last year. But the quarterback whisperer might need to renew his reputation next year — and with whispers to a new quarterback.

But who?

One thing is for sure, Darnold is better off in Seattle, where all he had to do was throw for 128 yards in a blowout win. And given the inconsistency we’ve seen in the NFC, the Seahawks are legit contenders. They seem like the type of team that can support Darnold — and help him face his demons (ghosts?) in big games.

2. LOST MY TRUST & EARNED MY TRUST

Earned my trust: Jerry Jones

No owner is easier to mock than Jerry Jones. No general manager is easier to mock than Jones. And that’s partially because he’s the only guy who does both jobs, for better and for worse. But it’s also because he has the spirit of a Kardashian, enjoying the drama. It’s hard to tell — when Jones makes a major transaction (or doesn’t ink a major contract) — whether he’s doing something for team-building value or for entertainment value.

But just because it’s easy to mock him, it doesn’t mean it’s always right. So when Jones bailed on linebacker Micah Parsons and bought in on defensive tackles Quinnen Williams and Kenny Clark (while retaining some draft value in the process), people could not see the logic in it. And they ripped him.

I felt like I could see what Jones was trying to do — rebuilding the Cowboys’ shoddy defense in ways that he once did with the team’s offense in the 1990s after the Herschel Walker trade. It’s actually working. This defense has life, in large part because of Williams, who has been a monumentally better player for the Cowboys than he was for the Jets this season. Now, Parsons remains one of the NFL’s most dominant pass-rushers. That was on full display on Thanksgiving, with Parsons racking up 2.5 sacks and 10 pressures, per Next Gen Stats. But the Cowboys outlasted Patrick Mahomes because of their offense (built around Dak Prescott and their two receivers, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens) and their top-to-bottom defense, which is on the rise.

Mahomes was absolutely incredible. He played one of the best games I’ve seen him play in quite some time. Despite that, the Cowboys kept their season alive.

I’m starting to believe the Cowboys can make the playoffs. Which is empirically stupid. Their chances are just 17%. Make fun of me all you want. Make fun of Jones all you want. I’m starting to believe in the 2025 Cowboys.

Lost my trust: 49ers WR Ricky Pearsall

In the Niners' first four games, Pearsall put up two 100-yard games and totaled 20 catches for 327. He seemed to be on his way. There was a chance — a good chance — he could be the solution to San Francisco's receiver problem, with Brandon Aiyuk dealing with injuries (and attitude issues).

And then he suffered a knee injury that knocked him out for six weeks.

In the last three games since his return, he has just five catches for 20 yards. And now, Pearsall remains yet another uncertainty in the Niners' receiving corps. It hasn’t really mattered, because their defense has been dominant and tight end George Kittle has lifted the passing offense. But it has clouded the picture of whether Pearsall can be WR1.

3. BLIND PASSING CHART TEST

4. WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS AFRAID TO SAY:

The Panthers shouldn't give Bryce Young a big extension this offseason, but they should exercise his fifth-year option.

The Panthers’ upset over the Rams had me thinking: If the QB keeps this up, Carolina might feel like it has to extend Young.

It was an incredible game from Young — the best of his career. His total EPA was 15.1. His completion percentage over expected was 8.8. He was great against the blitz (5 of 6 for 93 yards). And of course, he was absolutely stellar on money downs, with a pair of long touchdowns on fourth down and a handful of impressive third-down conversions, including the game-clinching throw. He did all that against the Rams, the team we've considered the NFL’s best and most complete.

So, yeah, it’s time to start thinking about the Panthers' level of commitment to Young.

They could extend him as early as this offseason. That has been the trend recently, with teams like the San Francisco 49ers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Arizona Cardinals, Green Bay Packers and Philadelphia Eagles signing their quarterbacks to a big deal before their fourth season.

The Dolphins and Giants did their best to wait out Tua Tagovailoa and Daniel Jones, respectively, by going into their fourth year. But both teams ended up signing their guy — and for too much money. By waiting, they ended up backing themselves into a corner.

So how will Carolina handle Young? He has been so hot and cold from game to game. But if he keeps this up down the stretch, maybe the Panthers will consider inking him, especially if he makes a playoff game and/or wins it.

Before considering a long-term commitment, Canales should look at the Miami Dolphins and decide if that’s what’s about to happen to him. Canales and Young are doing roughly what Mike McDaniel and Tua did together when they were at their best. But over the past two years, that all fell apart without the team ever really contending. After his massive contract extension, Tua took on too much cap space for a QB of his value. McDaniel — one of the brightest offensive minds — couldn’t contend with a defense that wasn’t good, especially when his offense began to lose quality talent.

I like Canales. I like Young. Similarly, I like McDaniel and Tua.

The Panthers might not have to rush to decide on an extension, but they do have a deadline on his fifth-year option in May. Unless they plan to part ways with Young this offseason — or bring in direct competition — they should take on that extension. It’s a placeholder (that can burn the team), but is a good piece of contract leverage if they want to sign the guy long term. Plus, it’s a show of good faith that the team wants Young to be their guy for the long term.

5. RANDOM RANKING

The AFC South

Jacksonville Jaguars: In basically every metric, the other teams are better than Jacksonville. But it’s coach Liam Cohen that has me believing in the Jaguars at this point in the year. He has quietly put himself in consideration for the Coach of the Year award, managing the human roller-coaster that is Trevor Lawrence — and making wins happen despite the erratic QB. There’s so much talent on this Jacksonville roster. Cohen is the first Jaguars coach in a long time who is getting the most out of that talent.

Houston Texans: The Texans also have a great defense. They also have an erratic QB. They also have a lot of talent. And while DeMeco Ryans has continued to get the most out of his defense, offensive coordinator Nick Caley is still figuring out how to get C.J. Stroud back onto an upward trajectory.

Indianapolis Colts: Oh no. Is the collapse upon us? Jones continued to look messy on money downs (third and fourth), completing just two of his final seven passes for 44 yards and a sack. His inability to handle blitzes and pressure has proven an Achilles heel in the last few games. The Colts have two games against the Jaguars and another game against the Texans. It might be a heartbreaking finish for Indy.

Tennessee Titans: At least they haven’t ruined Cam Ward? He could be good!

6. HE SAID WHAT!?

Part 1 — Browns defensive tackle Shelby Harris called 49ers wideout Jauan Jennings ""a h--.""

Browns defensive tackle Shelby Harris did not mince words when weighing in on 49ers receiver Jauan Jennings, who exchanged words with Browns defenders after Maliek Collins went down with an injury.

""He’s a h--,"" Harris said after the game, via ABC Cleveland’s Camryn Justice. ""He said some things that you should not say to another man — ever. But I don’t respect it because you say that and then run behind your O-line. That’s some real soft s---. I want that known. I see exactly why they punched you in the nuts. I'm surprised they didn't punch you in the jaw yet.""

Jennings was involved in a controversy last week where Panthers safety Tre’von Moehrig punched Jennings … between the legs. The NFL gave Moehrig a one-game suspension for it.

Part 2 — NFL analyst Richard Sherman: ""I don’t think I have seen any team manhandle the Eagles like the Bears are tonight.""

The Bears own the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and I think I’m as guilty as anyone of conflating the hype around Caleb Williams with the hype around Chicago.

We’re getting ahead of ourselves when it comes to ""Cardiac Caleb,"" who has been good — and who has improved greatly since the beginning of the season. But his progress has not been the reason the Bears are such a good football team right now.

No, that’s because of coach Ben Johnson. (Who, by the way, is partially to credit for Johnson’s progress.)

Johnson has modeled his team after the Detroit Lions, who — for years — have displayed a rare blend of toughness and flashy explosiveness. That’s what the Bears are. And by borrowing the Lions’ identity, they have seemingly drained Detroit to fill up Chicago with that identity.

We saw that against the Eagles, who are a flagging team — lost for an identity. Richard Sherman said it. The Bears absolutely manhandled the Eagles. Even when they’re vulnerable, that’s not easy to do. The Bears aren't the best team in football. But they’re dangerous. And they’re a heck of a lot of fun.

7. WHAT I’M THANKFUL FOR …

Football is a remarkable game. But in my line of work, it’s easy to focus on tense, complicated or fraught topics. It’s Thanksgiving weekend, so it feels like a great moment to acknowledge all the football things I’m grateful for …

The players … deceptive eyes … quarterback controversies … Jahmyr Gibbs … Micah Parsons … Jaxon Smith-Njigba … the ghost rush … ""The eye in the sky don’t lie"" … fourth-quarter comebacks … a type of onside kick you’ve never seen before … exotic third-down blitzes … seeing a blockbuster at the NFL trade deadline … Tex stunt … left tackle ""eligible receiver"" touchdowns … that feeling you get in early April that the draft will never arrive … that friend you ask for fantasy football advice … Andy Reid … Patrick Mahomes … Tom Brady … LaDainian Tomlinson … ""Let’s name some guys"" … Kenbrell Thompkins … no-look throws …

What did I forget? Hit me up on Twitter, email, whatever.

""I texted them guys, both of them, today when I woke up and just told them I trust in them and believe in them. Just, let's go and let's go get a win."" Cook said after the Bills 26-7 victory. ""They texted me 'I love you brother and let's go.'""

The Bills may have to go without Dawkins and Brown when they host the Cincinnati Bengals at 1 p.m. Sunday at Highmark Stadium. The Bengals have the NFL's worst defense, allowing 31.2 points and 410 yards per game.

Dawkins has to clear the league concussion protocol. Tight end Dalton Kincaid is trending up after logging two straight limited practices last week and being listed as questionable despite not playing in Week 13.

NFL teams have to submit a report on practice participation on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for a Sunday game. There are three levels of practice participation that can be designated: did not participate, limited participation and full participation.

A game status report is due by 4 p.m. Friday for Sunday games.

Here is the Bills vs. Bengals injury report for Week 14:

Buffalo Bills injury update for Week 14

Dalton Kincaid, TE, hamstring

Dalton Kincaid has missed the last three games since suffering a hamstring injury in Week 10.

He hobbled off the field grabbing his right hamstring in the third quarter of Week 10 and walked to the Bills locker room with trainers. Kincaid did not return.

Kincaid, who missed Week 6 with an oblique injury, has 29 catches for 448 receiving yards and a team-high four touchdown receptions.

Dion Dawkins, OT, concussion

Dion Dawkins did not play in Week 13 after suffering a concussion in the Week 12 loss to the Houston Texans.

The four-time Pro Bowler Dion Dawkins was evaluated for a concussion in the final minute of the first quarter was briefly replaced by Ryan Van Demark before he was cleared to return. But Dawkins displayed more symptoms the next day and was ruled out for Week 13 against the Steelers.

Spencer Brown, OT, shoulder

Spencer Brown was inactive for the Week 13 win over the Steelers after toughing out most of Week 12 with a shoulder injury.

Brown was evaluated for the injury after grabbing his right shoulder in the third quarter and was cleared to return. Brown struggled after re-entering the game and was replaced in the fourth quarter by Ryan Van Demark.

Brown was spotted with his arm in a sling in the locker room after the game.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Nov. 21 that Brown ""potentially"" could go on injured reserve.

Terrel Bernard, LB, elbow

Terrel Bernard did not play in Week 13.

The Bills' defensive captain was suffered a dislocated elbow after being in on a tackle for a 1-yard loss on Houston running back Nick Chubb in Week 12. Bernard lied on his stomach in pain and rolled onto his back holding his right arm as he was tended to by athletic trainers. He walked into the locker room holding his right arm in the third quarter and returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling.

Bernard is considered week-to-week, according to Bills head coach Sean McDermott.

Bernard has 56 tackles, seven tackles for loss, one interception and two fumble recoveries in 10 games in 2025.

Joshua Palmer, WR, ankle

Joshua Palmer missed Week 13 after re-aggravating an ankle injury.

He was out three games from Weeks 8 through 10 after being dragged down by Atlanta Falcons cornerback Dee Alford after a 15-yard reception in the second quarter in Week 6.

Joey Bosa, DE, hamstring

Joey Bosa suffered a hamstring injury on a pass rush and exited the game against the Steelers. He walked off under his own power and was listed as questionable to return.

Bosa's strip sack on the first play from scrimmage in the third quarter resulted in a 17-yard fumble return for a touchdown by cornerback Christian Benford and turned the tide in the Bills win.

Bosa leads the Bills with five sacks and five forced fumbles, which ties a single-season franchise record.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Mecole Hardman, WR, calf

Mecole Hardman was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 20 after playing one game the Bills.

He was injured in Week 11 and did not return after suffering a calf injury in the third quarter. Hardman's first touch with was a 61-yard kickoff return in the first quarter. He muffed a punt that resulted in a lost fumble the third quarter, which is when he suffered the calf injury.

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Ed Oliver suffered a torn biceps injury which will require surgery and is out indefinitely. He was placed on on injured reserve on Oct. 28 and is eligible to return in Week 13.

Oliver was hurt in the second quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

Oliver is tied for the team lead with three sacks despite only plying in three of the Bills' seven games.

He missed four games earlier this season (Weeks 2-5) with an ankle injury after he got stepped on in practice on Sept. 10.

Taylor Rapp, S, knee

Taylor Rapp was placed on injured reserve on Oct. 24.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Rapp was battling an injury since training camp and ""it got to the point where he can't be himself.""

Rapp ha 26 tackles in six games this season.

Michael Hoecht, DE, Achilles

Michael Hoecht tore his right Achilles in the fourth quarter of the win against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

He suffered the non-contact injury while taking one step into his rush off the left edge with 14:25 remaining. Hoecht was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

Matt Prater, 41, signed to the Bills practice squad, was elevated for Week 1 and made a 32-yard game-winning field goal with no time left to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 41-40 in Week 1. Prater has since been signed to the active roster and is 10-for-11 on field goals and 17-for-17 on extra points through six games.

Cameron Johnston, P, foot/ankle

Cameron Johnston suffered left foot and ankle injuries after taking a hit to his left plant leg on a punt in the fourth quarter in the Week 4 win over the Saints. The Bills placed him on injured reserve on Sept. 30 and signed punter Mitch Wishnowsky.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Dorian Strong, CB, neck

Dorian Strong played in four games with one start before suffering a neck injury and being placed on injured reserve on Oct. 4. The rookie sixth-round pick was eligible to return in Week 10.

Damar Hamlin, S, pectoral

Damar Hamlin suffered pectoral injury in practice Oct. 9 and was placed on injured reserve.

He was eligible to return in Week 11, although Bills coach Sean McDermott said it's ""up in the air"" if Hamlin's injury is season-ending.

Hamlin started 14 games in 2024 but has played a reserve role this year with Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp as the starting safeties. He has one tackle in five games.

DeWayne Carter, DT, Achilles

DeWayne Carter suffered a torn Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.

Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, recorded 14 tackles, five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits and a pass defended in 11 games last year.

Mercogliano,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6849698/2025/11/30/new-york-rangers-adam-fox-injury/,"The New York Rangers are placing Adam Fox on long-term injured reserve and expecting him to miss multiple weeks due to a left-shoulder injury, according to two league sources.

Replacing Fox will be virtually impossible given the Rangers’ dearth of puck-moving defensemen.
From a big-picture perspective, Fox’s injury could accelerate the clock on hard choices facing team president and general manager Chris Drury.
What looked like a fringe playoff team with Fox could see its postseason hopes fade away without him.","The New York Rangers are placing Adam Fox on long-term injured reserve and expecting him to miss multiple weeks due to a left-shoulder injury, according to two league sources.

The injury was sustained on a hit from Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brandon Hagel that crunched Fox into the boards during the third period of Saturday’s 4-1 loss at Madison Square Garden. It isn’t believed to be long-term or season-threatening, but it will require some time on the shelf. The team plans to label it as week-to-week and reevaluate around Christmas, one source said.

The loss of Fox leaves the Rangers in a precarious position. While the team has largely struggled through the first quarter of the season, the 27-year-old defenseman has been their best and most consistent player.

Fox pushed his point streak to six games with the primary assist on J.T. Miller’s second-period goal Saturday, and he is tied with Artemi Panarin for the team lead with 26 points (three goals and 23 assists) through 27 games. His 10.1 net rating is easily New York’s best, according to Hockey Stat Cards, with Panarin a distant second at 4.5.

Replacing Fox will be virtually impossible given the Rangers’ dearth of puck-moving defensemen. His D partner, Vladislav Gavrikov, is second among the team’s defensemen with 11 points (four goals and seven assists) and has been rock-solid since signing a seven-year, $49 million contract last summer, but he’s limited offensively and best-suited for a stay-at-home assignment. No other New York defensemen has more than five points.

Scott Morrow, who came to the Rangers as part of the July 1 trade that sent talented defenseman K’Andre Miller to the Carolina Hurricanes, is expected to get an extended look in Fox’s absence. The 23-year-old profiles as the most skilled defensemen in New York’s thin pipeline after racking up 94 points (28 goals and 66 assists) across 109 career games at UMass, then another 39 points (13 goals and 26 assists) while earning an AHL all-star nod last season with the Chicago Wolves. But he’s off to a slow start with AHL Hartford, with only three points (one goal and two assists) through 12 games that another league source described as uneven.

The Rangers sent Morrow to Hartford to work on his defensive game and will likely use him in a sheltered five-on-five role, but they’ll need his offensive side to shine if they’re going to get any production out of their back end. He could get the first crack at assuming Fox’s position as the quarterback of a top power-play unit that’s short on alternatives.

Braden Schneider is another defenseman who will be asked to step up. The Rangers have talked for years about wanting to expand the 24-year-old’s role, but he’s been blocked by Fox and others on the right-handed depth chart. Now there’s a clear path to the top four, or perhaps even on the top pair with Gavrikov.

Those are decisions coach Mike Sullivan will have to make in the immediate future. From a big-picture perspective, Fox’s injury could accelerate the clock on hard choices facing team president and general manager Chris Drury.

The Rangers have shown defensive improvement under Sullivan, but their lack of offensive firepower and team speed have become glaring issues. They ranked 28th in the NHL with an average of just 2.63 goals per game entering play Sunday, and now they’re missing one of the league’s best playmaking defensemen.

What looked like a fringe playoff team with Fox could see its postseason hopes fade away without him. Drury will likely allow time to see if the Rangers can weather the storm, but he must recognize that the roster has deteriorated on his watch and needs revamping.

Rather than attempting to keep an unsteady ship afloat, the wise approach might be a reset in which Drury recoups some of the assets he sold off at previous trade deadlines and aims to infuse a depleted organization with young talent. That would require a stamp of approval from owner James Dolan, though, and there’s no telling if he’ll provide Drury that kind of assurance coming off last season’s crash-and-burn.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/30134413/GettyImages-1244765879-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-01 15:03:40.593359

The Giants hope Dart can take it the rest of the way without any more interruptions.","FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — He did not play in the game, but Jaxson Dart certainly looked engaged afterward, sitting in a corner of the visitors locker room inside Ford Field in Detroit, where three quarterbacks huddled together discussing what just transpired.

There was Dart, the rookie in his second week in concussion protocol.

There was Russell Wilson, a former star, now benched.

There was Jameis Winston, third string elevated into the starting job.

Winston did enough to win but, as usual, the Giants lost and the three quarterbacks were engrossed in conversation.

This looked and felt like a tutorial for Dart and he listened more than he spoke.

This trio broke down the game with one another and it was obvious the discussion was meaningful to all involved.

It was tempting at that moment to wonder how having these two accomplished veterans around him every week, to watch, to lean on, to learn from will serve Dart in the years to come.

The foundation for what the Giants hope will be a lengthy career for Dart is being set in what has already been an enthralling, turbulent and frustrating NFL initiation.

It continues Monday night when Dart returns from a two-week hiatus to face the Patriots at Gillette Stadium in a meeting of the first-place home team and the last-place road team.

The Giants are 2-10, Dart is 2-5 as a starter and he has been indoctrinated into what life is all about with a team that cannot find its way.

Five times this season, the Giants held a lead in the fourth quarter, only to lose.

Dart has felt the pain of these defeats.

“The season so far has been tough because our record could completely be flipped the other way and everybody here is in a completely different state of mind,’’ Dart said. “But I’ve just come to realize that in the NFL, if you don’t make those crunch-time moment plays and the other team does, you’re going to lose, and it doesn’t really matter how well you play up until the end of the game.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NFL STANDINGS AND GIANTS STATS

“So, at times, it honestly doesn’t even feel real because you feel like you’re in control of the entire game and somehow things just don’t work. That’s just the beauty of the sport is it could go one way, it could go the other way and when you’re playing at this level of competition, especially for me, I’ve come to realize that it doesn’t matter how you play at all until, who scores last, who has the ball last and who makes that last crucial play at the end of the game.’’

It will be quite an accomplishment if Dart can keep the Giants — losers of six straight — close for this game to come down to crucial plays at the end of the game.

The Patriots (10-2) are on a nine-game winning streak, their second-year quarterback, Drake Maye, is an MVP candidate and Mike Vrabel is the favorite to win the Coach of the Year award.

Dart’s head was slammed to the ground as he lost a fumble two weeks ago in Chicago and he did not make the required progress last week to get medical clearance to return to the field.

Add this to the long list of lessons for Dart to learn.

And also, patience.

“It’s hard,’’ he said. “I feel like every day goes by slower and you’re hoping and praying that you’re going to go in and pass your test to make it. I think I bit more nails off my fingers than I have in a long time being on the sideline watching. But yeah, it’s definitely not fun to feel like you have no control over the outcome of the game, but you just try to be the best teammate that you can.’’

Wilson and Winston have been tremendous teammates for Dart, making this particular quarterback room beneficial for a rookie to grow.

Rodgers finished 10 of 21 for 117 yards, one of the worst outings of his career. A fractured left wrist forced him to play with a cast. He briefly exited the game at one point to bandage his bloodied nose following a strip-sack from behind by Joey Bosa.

Pittsburgh hopes to expand its options with Rodgers after another week of injury recovery.

""I felt good enough to be out there, just not ready to take a snap under center, hopefully next week for that,"" Rodgers said. ""Disappointed in my performance, disappointed in the offensive performance and got to flush it.""

Rodgers placed some of the blame on miscommunication and timing errors with his receivers. Tight end Darnell Washington led the Steelers with two catches for 45 yards. D.K. Metcalf was a non-factor for the second straight game, finishing with 32 yards on five targets. The ineptitude offensively led to a chorus of boos from the Steelers' home crowd in the second half.

""I totally understand the frustration,"" Rodgers said. ""I've been booed on offense, even in Green Bay over the years. That was a boo-worthy performance.""

Playoff outlook

Pittsburgh plays a pivotal road game Sunday against the Ravens, before concluding with Miami, Detroit, Cleveland and the season finale against Baltimore at home. With three games left against divisional competition including a pair of matchups with the AFC North co-leaders, the Steelers' playoff hopes will be ultimately determined by offensive production and if Rodgers can get back on track.

Rodgers and his receivers have to get on the same page in the film room first, he said.

""When there's film sessions, everybody shows up, and when I check to a route, you do the right route,"" Rodgers said. ""We have our meetings every week. We have other opportunities outside of the facility, and [I] look forward to seeing all the boys there.""

Pittsburgh is the second team out of the AFC's playoff picture in the No. 9 spot. The fourth-seeded Ravens own the tiebreaker over the Steelers for the time being based on best win percentage in common games.

Buffalo's 23 unanswered points in the second half were tough to stomach for the Steelers, who dropped five of their last seven games since starting the season 4-1.

It's unclear if Herbert will miss time with the injury, with the Chargers set to face the Eagles on Monday. But Herbert told reporters postgame that he believes the surgery is simply meant to ""stabilize"" it and that doctors are ""hopeful"" he can play in Week 14.

Elsewhere in the AFC, Colts cornerback Sauce Gardner went down with an apparent calf strain in Indianapolis' loss to the Texans on Sunday. Gardner said postgame that he doesn't believe it was an Achilles injury, but that he will undergo additional tests to determine the severity, including how much time he might have to miss.

Overall, Sunday was also a big day for quarterbacks getting rocked: Bills defensive end Joey Bosa hit Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers so hard in Buffalo's win that Rodgers had to briefly exit the game with a bloody nose. And Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence got decked by Titans linebacker Arden Key, with the hit quickly sparking a bench-clearing scuffle. Vikings backup QB Max Brosmer also had some poor luck, with the rookie taking four sacks in his first pro game — and throwing four picks — as Minnesota's quarterback struggles continue.

It would be amiss not to note one of the bigger developments of the weekend: After the Panthers stunned the Rams with a three-point upset win, the Chicago Bears are now the best team in the NFC, almost one year to the day after firing Matt Eberflus.

""I think it's like a strain,"" Gardner said, via ESPN's Stephen Holder. ""I feel like I got shot in the calf or something, but it was like high. So I wasn't thinking the worst.""

So how much time could Gardner end up missing?

According to Jordan Schultz, Gardner suffered what was described as a ""mild calf strain.""

The injury could sideline Gardner for ""a couple of weeks,"" Schultz said. Gardner will be getting a second opinion as well.

In Gardner's first two games with the Colts, he has allowed five receptions on 10 targets for 38 yards with two pass breakups. He's also made 12 tackles.

With Gardner, the Colts have become a very man-coverage-heavy defense.

Bryce Young completed 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards and three touchdowns – two of them coming on fourth down – and the Carolina Panthers (7-6) forced three turnovers by Matthew Stafford to beat Los Angeles (9-3) and snap the Rams’ six-game winning streak. Carolina’s defense intercepted Stafford twice with Mike Jackson returning one for a 48-yard touchdown and ended the 37-year-old’s NFL record of 28 straight TD passes without an interception. Derrick Brown, who tipped a ball resulting in one of Stafford’s first pick, came up with a key strip-sack with 2:25 left in the game to preserve the win. Stafford completed 18 of 28 passes for 243 yards with two touchdown passes to Davante Adams, his 13th and 14th of the season.

Buffalo Bills 26-7 Pittsburgh Steelers

The Buffalo Bills (8-4) bounced back from a loss at Houston by pushing around the Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6). Josh Allen threw for a touchdown and ran for another, and Joey Bosa sacked Aaron Rodgers to spring Christian Benford for a game-tilting, 17-yard scoop-and-score. James Cook ran for 144 yards as the Bills piled up 249 yards on the ground and controlled the clock for nearly 42 minutes. Allen threw for just 123 yards on a windy day at Acrisure Stadium. His eight-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter essentially put the game away. It was the 76th rushing touchdown of Allen’s career, breaking the NFL record for touchdown runs by a quarterback that he briefly shared with Cam Newton.

Houston Texans 20–16 Indianapolis Colts

All of a sudden, there is a race in the AFC South after the Houston Texans won their fourth consecutive game, this one against divisional rivals the Indianapolis Colts. With quarterback CJ Stroud back in the lineup, the two-time defending South champion Texans got back in the division race. The Texans are 7-5, haven’t lost a division game this season and are third in the division, one win behind the Colts and Jaguars (8-4).

Stroud completed 22 of 35 passes for 276 yards and one interception and Nico Collins caught five passes for 98 yards and ran for a score. Stroud was 9-of-13 passing in the second half, including 3 of 3 on third down. Houston’s defense held the NFL’s No 1 scoring offense to under 20 points for the first time this season and kept Colts running back Jonathan Taylor out of the end zone. Taylor had 85 rushing yards and 36 yards receiving. The Colts were stopped on seven of 10 third-down attempts.

Denver Broncos 27-26 Washington Commanders (OT)

The Denver Broncos moved to 10-2 on the season but they had to fight hard against the Washington Commanders (3-9), who pushed them into overtime. The Broncos held a 20-17 lead late in the fourth quarter until Marcus Mariota led a Commanders drive that ended in a game-tying field goal. RJ Harvey’s rushing touchdown in overtime put the Broncos up before the Commanders scored and then attempted a two-point conversion that would have won the game. However, Mariota’s pass was batted down as Denver celebrated their victory. Treylon Burks’ spectacular touchdown in regulation had earlier lit up the game.

San Francisco 49ers 26–8 Cleveland Browns

Brock Purdy rushed for a touchdown and passed for another score in the second half, and the San Francisco 49ers (9-4) spoiled Shedeur Sanders’ first home start for the Cleveland Browns (3-9). San Francisco scored 19 unanswered points after trailing in the second quarter. All three of their touchdowns come from short fields, capitalizing on turnovers and a long punt return. Purdy completed 16 of 29 passes for 168 yards. San Francisco star Christian McCaffrey added 74 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. Sanders passed for 149 yards and a touchdown for Cleveland.

Minnesota Vikings 0-26 Seattle Seahawks

The Seattle Seahawks (9-3) shut out an opponent for the first time in more than a decade in their win over the Minnesota Vikings (4-8). Ernest Jones IV had the first of five takeaways by the Seahawks’ dominant defense. Jones returned an interception 84 yards for a touchdown. Seattle’s most recent shutout win was 26-0 over Chicago in September 2015. This one was a mismatch, with the Seahawks going against an undrafted rookie quarterback in Max Brosmer. Seattle moved into a first-place tie with the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC West, while Minnesota lost their fourth straight.

Arizona Cardinals 17–20 Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5) have snapped a three-game skid with victory over the Arizona Cardinals (3-9). Mayfield tossed a two-yard touchdown pass to All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs and Tampa Bay’s defense held in the final two minutes. Mayfield started after sitting out the second half of a 34-7 loss to the Rams because of a left shoulder injury. He threw for 194 yards and ran for 27 to help the Bucs remain first in the NFC South. Arizona have lost four straight and nine of 10.

Las Vegas Raiders 14–31 Los Angeles Chargers

Justin Herbert threw two touchdown passes while playing through an injury to his non-throwing hand, and Kimani Vidal made a 59-yard scoring run during the Los Angeles Chargers’ victory over the spiraling Las Vegas Raiders (2-10). Quentin Johnston and Ladd McConkey made TD catches and Vidal rushed for a career-high 126 yards as the Chargers (8-4) beat their longtime AFC West rivals for the fourth straight time. Geno Smith passed for 165 yards and threw two touchdown passes to Brock Bowers in the sixth consecutive loss by the Raiders, who have just one victory since Week 1.

Jacksonville Jaguars 25–3 Tennessee Titans

Trevor Lawrence threw for 229 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars to a 25-3 win over the Tennessee Titans. The win moves Jacksonville (8-4) into a tie with the Indianapolis Colts atop the AFC South heading into the first of two matchups between the teams next week. The Jaguars outgained the Titans (1-11) 272-188. Tennessee were 2-for-12 on third downs and 1-for-4 on fourth downs. Jakobi Meyers had his best day since being traded to Jacksonville from the Las Vegas Raiders in November, with six catches for 90 yards and a touchdown. The Jaguars sacked Tennessee quarterback Cam Ward three times, with Josh Hines-Allen collecting two sacks.

New Orleans Saints 17–21 Miami Dolphins

De’Von Achane rushed for 134 yards and a touchdown, Riley Patterson kicked four field goals and the Miami Dolphins won their third straight game by holding off the New Orleans Saints. Achane scored on the first possession of the game and the Dolphins (5-7) never relinquished the lead despite a shaky performance by Tua Tagovailoa, who completed 12 of 23 passes for 157 yards with an interception. Rookie Tyler Shough passed for 239 yards and two touchdowns for the Saints (2-10).

Atlanta Falcons 24–27 New York Jets

Nick Folk kicked a 56-yard field goal through heavy mist as time expired, leading the New York Jets to victory over the Atlanta Falcons. Tyrod Taylor went 19 of 33 for 172 yards and a touchdown pass and also ran for a score. Adonai Mitchell had eight receptions for 102 yards and a TD.

It is not clear yet if Clowney, who was dealing with a neck injury that kept him limited in two of Dallas practices' leading into their game against the Chiefs on Thursday, is still dealing with the neck issue or a different injury.

The first injury report for the Cowboys ahead of their road game on Thursday against the Lions will come on Monday.

Abanikanda, 23, was a fifth-round pick out of Pitt by the New York Jets in 2023 where he appeared in six games and rushed for 70 yards on 22 carries. He was waived by New York in December of 2024, and since briefly spent time with the San Fransisco 49ers and most recently the practice squad of the Green Bay Packers.

After Malik Davis was signed to the active roster to be the second option at running back in recent weeks for the Cowboys, Dallas now has another running back on the practice squad in Abanikanda.

2:30 p.m. -- After Jerry Jones said earlier on Friday morning that he expects CB Trevon Diggs to return from injured reserve before Dallas' next game against the Lions, head coach Brian Schottenheimer said the team is expecting to open his 21-day practice window on Sunday.

""We'd love to start his clock and get him going. I'm excited to see Trevon and how he looks and moves around..."" Schottenheimer said. ""I think you should expect us to do that for Sunday.""

Schottenheimer added that the Cowboys will be off on Friday and Saturday before returning to practice on Sunday.

2:25 p.m. -- The Cowboys were hit with a good amount of injuries heading into, and coming out of their 31-28 win over the Chiefs on Thursday. The good news is nothing seems to be considered long term.

Head coach Brian Schottenheimer said on Friday that CB DaRon Bland was dealing with cramps early in the game, and left in the second half with a foot injury before ultimately returning for the end of the game. Fellow CB Caelen Carson was dealing with some soreness on the quick turnaround, and has a chance to play next Thursday against the Lions.

In the safety room, veteran Malik Hooker left the game with back spasms, according to Schottenheimer. The coach added ""he should be fine"" for next Thursday in Detroit.

11:00 a.m. -- After missing the last six games with a concussion and knee injury, the Cowboys should be getting CB Trevon Diggs back for next Thursday's road game against the Detroit Lions, according to Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones.

""He'll be on the field, wanted to be on the field last night, but he'll be on the field at Detroit in my view barring an [setback]."" Jones said on 105.3 The Fan Friday morning.

Diggs is currently on injured reserve, so he'll need to be activated and return to the active roster which while require a corresponding move. His return comes at a good time for Dallas, who has won three straight games and has seen injuries recently at cornerback to Caelen Carson, who missed Thursday's game against Kansas City, and DaRon Bland, who missed some time in the second half with a foot injury but later returned.

8:12 p.m. - While his streak of 140-yard games ended, Pickens still had a productive day for the Cowboys, totaling 88 receiving yards on six catches, along with a 2-point conversion in the fourth quarter.

Williams had just 59 rushing yards, but it moved him to 955, surpassing his previously high of 903 yards with the Broncos.

The biggest play of the game for Williams occurred in the passing game, when he caught a quick pass from Dak Prescott for a 3-yard touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 7-point lead.

2 p.m. -- Tyler Guyton suffered an ankle injury in the Cowboys' victory over the Eagles and, on a short week, was ruled out for the Thanksgiving bout against the Chiefs.

Jaxson Dart has that same defensive mindset.
It's Jaxson Dart.
Get Dart to slide rather than take on defenders head-on like he did earlier this season against the Philadelphia Eagles.","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- It was the last play of Eli Manning's first career game during the 2004 season. The New York Giants legend was in during garbage time of a blowout loss to the Philadelphia Eagles when he tried to run around the pocket to make a play.

It ended poorly for Manning. The No. 1 pick earlier that year thought he had space, but that gross miscalculation saw him get torpedoed by Eagles defensive end Jerome McDougle, who was tracking back on the play. The blindside hit sent Manning flying to the turf and the ball onto the ground for a fumble as the clock hit zero.

Just 11 plays into his career, the rookie learned a quick lesson.

""That was my 'Welcome to the NFL' moment for sure,"" Manning said years later.

""I thought he was dead,"" his father Archie said after the game.

Eli Manning realized in his first game that the NFL was different than playing at Ole Miss. Some of the things he could get away with at the collegiate level didn't fly here.

Giants rookie Jaxson Dart's learning curve lasted slightly longer. His seventh start proved that if he doesn't alter his game, there will be repercussions. Dart suffered a concussion in a Nov. 9 loss to the Chicago Bears. It was the fourth time in eight games, dating back to the preseason, that Dart needed to be examined for a concussion.

It turned out to be the final straw for coach Brian Daboll. The hit occurred on Dart's sixth designed run of the contest.

The rookie has missed two games. He's expected back for the Giants on Monday night against the New England Patriots (8:15 p.m. EST, ESPN), but with the understanding that he can't keep playing recklessly. Interim coach Mike Kafka and the team are in the process of trying to fix it.

The Giants (2-10) enabled the foolhardy play to a degree under Daboll -- failing to emphasize the need to be more careful. Backup quarterback Jameis Winston, who has started two games in Dart's absence, said he would relay the message from the coaching staff and higher-ups, only when it was brought to him first. He didn't want Dart to change the way he plays football, the same way that helped him get to the NFL and the first round of the draft.

Sometimes, though, those few extra yards that Dart's heart and natural competitiveness desire are just not worth it -- especially if it's near midfield or when he already got the first down. After not being available for two games because of the concussion, his teammates realize something needs to change, for the long- and short-term benefit of the player and team.

""When he's running on the field [during practice], everyone's yelling, 'Slide! Slide!"" said tight end Theo Johnson, one of Dart's closest friends. ""I'm talking about in the building and at practice and stuff. People are like, we're all like, 'Hey, in the game, that's going to be a slide, right?' ""

""I say safeties and cornerbacks only,"" backup quarterback Jameis Winston said of who he should consider taking on 1-on-1 as a ball carrier. ""No D-linemen, no linebackers. Those are my initial things.""

""I've been telling him [to get down] since his first run in the preseason,"" starting offensive lineman Jon Runyan Jr. said.

""I tell him all the time. I'm like, 'Bro, please get down!'"" veteran wide receiver Darius Slayton said. ""Franchise quarterbacks, when they [get injured], season's over.""

The Giants can't have that happen. Keeping Dart healthy is a priority this season and moving forward. They have a lot invested in the first-round pick out of Ole Miss.

""Moving forward, I have to be more available for this team,"" Dart said this past week after getting cleared from the concussion protocol. ""This is obviously on the forefront of my mind moving forward.""

DART WAS A wild man on the field at Ole Miss. Former NFL head coach Jon Gruden described his playing style as ""reckless ... careless and ... dangerous"" after watching film from his college career. He predicted Dart would be in the blue medical tent often, getting checked for a concussion if it wasn't modified. That's exactly what has happened, on a fairly regular basis, early in his NFL career.

The Ole Miss coaching staff also regularly fought a similar battle with the uber-competitive quarterback, according to multiple sources. They too wanted Dart to protect himself better so he didn't have to leave or miss games.

The things you love about the success-driven quarterback are simultaneously what you fear most. But it's inherently him.

""He's always been a kid that things just kind of changed anytime there was a competitive atmosphere,"" said Brandon Dart, Jaxson's father. ""His competitive spirit just innately spiked. And so from the time he was a little guy, that's just how he operated. And so some of that I think is innate.""

Brandon Dart coached his son during his formative years in Utah. He chuckled during a phone conversation with ESPN at the thought of being engaged in chats with young Jaxson before practices. Jaxson Dart would light up and tell his father who he would want to face that day in tackling drills. It was always one of the bigger, tougher kids. Then, when he would prepare for drills, young Jaxson would shake his head, slap his head and get hyped.

""He just loved that part of football,"" Brandon Dart remembers. ""He just loved hitting; he loved tackling. He liked getting everybody hyped up. And it just puts a smile on my face because I just remember those days as a little kid. Just his love for the game. And that was just him. Everybody just knew. When you're up against J-Dart, you better bring it because you know what you're going to get out of him.""

This is what makes it so difficult to get Dart to stop trying to run over linebackers. It's who he is at his core. And it's what has always driven him to success.

Dart was a linebacker at the youth level. His father was a safety who played at the University of Utah. His brother, Diesel, is currently a three-star recruit at Corner Canyon High School in Utah whose primary position is also safety. Jaxson Dart has that same defensive mindset. He wants to deliver that hit more than take it, even though he's a quarterback and plays on the other side of the ball.

But this is the NFL, not college football or high school football in Utah.

""It is not running over SEC cornerbacks anymore,"" a high-level NFC executive warned prior to the draft. ""It's NFL safeties and linebackers. It's different.""

WHILE DART HAS struggled to stay out of the blue tent, he hasn't had any problem getting in the end zone. He has produced 17 total touchdowns in seven starts. All the Giants quarterbacks combined produced just 19 touchdowns last season.

Ten of Dart's touchdowns have been passing and seven are rushing scores. Dart has averaged 3.4 designed rushes per game this season. That's third behind only the Jets' Justin Fields and Eagles' Jalen Hurts. His 5.0 yards per rush on designed runs is second only behind Baltimore's Lamar Jackson.

Clearly, there is a lot to like with Dart. It's part of what makes the Giants' head coaching vacancy so desirable.

""First of all, it's the New York Giants,"" former NFL head coach Jon Gruden told ESPN. ""I mean it is one of the founding franchises of football. It's New York. It's Jaxson Dart. You know what kind of talent he is. You know he has the arm talent, the athleticism. I know he's a smart guy. He's a great competitor. I think that is pretty much a good summary of why this is a desirable job.""

For many, Dart's presence will be near the top of the list of why they want the job. Gruden raved about him predraft. He sees the potential in the young quarterback and nothing that's unfolded so far at the next level has changed his opinion.

Dart's talent and skills have seamlessly translated to the NFL. With him behind center, the Giants scored 30+ points against the Denver Broncos and Eagles. No other quarterback has put up 30 points against either of those defenses this season.

The early returns seem to indicate that Dart has a realistic chance to be a high-end quarterback.

""This has the potential to be a great situation,"" Gruden said. ""But Dart has to do his part. He's got to stay healthy. He has to stay out there. He has to be what he's supposed to be.""

It's contingent on him learning to avoid putting himself in danger.

THE GIANTS WILL now reinsert Dart into the lineup knowing they can't just operate the same way they did before the concussion. It's on them to make sure their prized possession doesn't get put into situations that are disadvantageous to his health.

""The best ability is availability,"" Winston said.

Perhaps that means Kafka will call fewer designed runs. Or maybe just stress more frequently and urgently to get down or out of bounds when Dart's near the boundaries post-concussion.

It sounds as if some changes will be made.

""Yeah, I mean, you definitely take it into account,"" recently promoted Giants offensive coordinator Tim Kelly said.

One offensive player told ESPN he didn't expect designed runs in this week's game plan against the Patriots. That should help limit the hits that Dart takes.

People both inside and outside the Giants organization spoke with Dart recently and urged the rookie quarterback to be more thoughtful with when and how he runs, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Quarterbacks coach Shea Tierney even said recently they've shown Dart videos of other quarterbacks to point out the difference between being aggressive and acting in self-preservation.

It's still a slippery slope. The Giants don't want to completely take away what makes Dart so dangerous in the first place.

""I'm still getting used to this game. I'm getting used to this speed, this level,"" Dart said. ""In college, you can watch my tape, I very rarely slid. This is a different beast. For me, I have to obviously be more responsible when I'm in the open field. But I felt I was getting better at it each and every week.""

Dart slid twice in Chicago before he was injured. He said this week he didn't take any unnecessary hits in that Bears game.

But Tierney said they're stressing to ""pick your spots."" It all depends on the game situation. When you're in the ""city"" with all kinds of people around, get down. When you're running in the ""country,"" keep running. Kelly even noted it's not worth fighting for every last yard in the first quarter.

Situational awareness is paramount. Experience is invaluable. Dart only gains it by playing. That is why it was so important for him to return this late in the season. He wanted to return last week but didn't clear the protocol.

The answer, it seems, isn't to overhaul the main circuit board. Just reconfigure a wire or two.

""There's a balance,"" Kafka said.

Get Dart to slide rather than take on defenders head-on like he did earlier this season against the Philadelphia Eagles. Get out of bounds rather than fight for a few extra yards near the sideline. Find a way to get to the ground and duck under big hits when there is traffic.

Manning turned into a master of avoiding big hits. The hope is that Dart can improve at it as well with more experience, even if it means still running and making plays with his legs.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1124%2Fr1580188_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 12:05:59.681154

The Patriots, riding a nine-game win streak, are heavy favorites against the Giants, who have lost six straight and who were the lone team eliminated from playoff contention prior to Thanksgiving.

After being sidelined the last two weeks, Dart (concussion) returns as QB1 for the Giants. The rookie has brought excitement and hope to the Giants, but that has yet to translate into wins.

The Patriots’ head into their bye week following Monday’s game. The time off is necessary for a Patriots’ offensive line dealing with injuries, including losing two starters to injured reserve earlier this week.

The Giants enter the week following a 34-27 loss to the Detroit Lions. Following another late game collapse, Defensive Coordinator Shane Bowen was fired by interim Head Coach Mike Kafka. Bowen’s issues went well beyond the loss to the Lions. The Giants have lost five games this season in which they held a lead of at least 10 points. They have also given up a league-high 133 points in the fourth quarter.

The Patriots’ ninth straight win was last week in Cincinnati. Maye, the second-year signal caller for New England, led the Pats to a 26-20 win throwing for 294 yards and a touchdown.

The procedure is scheduled for Monday, and Herbert said he expects to play in the Chargers' next game, Dec. 8 against the Philadelphia Eagles on ""Monday Night Football.""

""It's one of those things where you just stabilized it, and I'm not the doctor, unfortunately, but they were hopeful,"" Herbert said. ""So, I think that's a good thing.""

Herbert sustained the injury in the first quarter when Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn hit him on a scramble; Chinn's helmet appeared to connect directly with Herbert's left hand. Herbert stayed in the game, clearly favoring the hand, and threw a touchdown to wide receiver Quentin Johnston on the next play.

He then went to the locker room with trainers and missed nine plays while a hard cast and glove were applied to his left hand. Herbert said the hardest part of continuing to play was holding on to the football. Because of that, the Chargers didn't take any snaps from under center for the rest of the game. Herbert said backup quarterback Trey Lance was prepared to take snaps under center in any goal-line scenarios.

""I think it's just something that we will monitor as the week goes on,"" Herbert said.

Two seasons ago, Herbert fractured the middle finger on his left hand in a game against the Raiders. The Chargers primarily played out of the shotgun to manage that injury.

""I think in terms of experience, I've gone through similar things, and so I think it'll be helpful,"" he said. ""But at the end of the day, just got to go out there and make sure that everything is good, you're comfortable.""

With four minutes left in the fourth quarter Sunday, Raiders outside linebacker Maxx Crosby shoved Herbert as he celebrated following a third-down conversion. Officials flagged Crosby for unsportsmanlike conduct, prompting another Herbert celebration. A brief shoving match ensued between players, and an argument broke out between Chargers wide receivers coach Sanjay Lal and Crosby.

""It's an emotional game, and I've got nothing but respect for him as a player and as a teammate,"" Herbert said, ""but at the end of the day I could have kept my cool a little bit better, too.""

Herbert injured his left hand on a scramble during the Chargers' opening drive when he was hit to the turf by Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn.

""He is [still in the protocol] as of right now, but we'll see how he does tomorrow,"" O'Connell said.
""Our goal is he clears, and he can have a good week of practice and have an opportunity to play next week.""

J.J. McCarthy could be cleared from the concussion protocol as soon as Monday, coach Kevin O'Connell said Sunday, and he would be in line to start the Vikings' Week 14 game against the Washington Commanders.

""He is [still in the protocol] as of right now, but we'll see how he does tomorrow,"" O'Connell said. ""Our goal is he clears, and he can have a good week of practice and have an opportunity to play next week.""

On Sunday, rookie Max Brosmer threw four interceptions in Minnesota's 26-0 loss to the Seattle Seahawks -- the first time the Vikings have been shut out since Week 17 of the 2007 season. Their 305-game streak since then, including the regular season and playoffs, was the third-longest active streak in the NFL.

McCarthy has not played much better. In six starts, he has produced the NFL's worst QBR (24.7) among 33 quarterbacks who have started at least six games. But with a 4-8 record, and a minuscule chance to make the playoffs, the Vikings' highest organizational priority is to give McCarthy as many snaps as possible to determine whether the team can count on him to be the starter in 2026.

Some around the NFL wondered if Brosmer could give the Vikings another option, but his first NFL start was rough. It has been 18 seasons since Minnesota had a quarterback finish with four interceptions and no touchdown passes in a game.

Brosmer's day began going downhill just before halftime. With Seattle holding a 3-0 lead, O'Connell went for it on fourth-and-1 at the Seahawks' 4-yard line. O'Connell called a play-action bootleg pass that he said gave Brosmer the option of running or throwing to one of several potential reads in the flat.

The Seahawks covered it well. With defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence about to sack him, Brosmer flipped an underhand throw toward tight end Josh Oliver that was intercepted by linebacker Ernest Jones IV and returned 85 yards for a touchdown.

O'Connell put the ball in Brosmer's hands on that play, he said, because Minnesota had struggled to run the ball. At that point, Vikings running backs had carried five times for 9 rushing yards.

""We wanted to try to see if we could get Max out on the perimeter with a run-pass option,"" O'Connell said, ""and ended up having a looping player in his face right away.""

In retrospect, Brosmer said he should have taken a sack. He had impressed the Vikings during training camp with his quick processing and decision-making, but O'Connell said he appeared to be processing through his reads too quickly Sunday.

Brosmer completed 19 of 30 passes for 126 yards Sunday. He completed only 1 of 9 passes that traveled 10 or more yards past the line of scrimmage.

""He was just a little sped up like a normal young player could be in his first start,"" O'Connell said, ""and then we just never could really make that one or two or three [plays] in a row.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1201%2Fr1583123_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 00:58:35.381383

What the Steelers haven’t been is consistent, and as December begins, it’s fair to wonder if consistency is ever coming.","PITTSBURGH (AP) — Aaron Rodgers hopes his bloodied nose isn’t broken. The reeling Pittsburgh Steelers feel the same way about their season.

The four-time MVP’s fractured left wrist turned out to be far from Pittsburgh’s biggest problem in a 26-7 loss to Buffalo on Sunday that dropped the Steelers back into a tie with Baltimore atop the AFC North.

The 41-year-old Rodgers took a big hit from Bills edge rusher Joey Bosa on the first play of the second half. Bosa drilled the future Hall of Famer into the Acrisure Stadium turf, the ball popped free and Christian Benford scooped it up for a momentum-swinging score.

Rodgers laid face down for several moments before jogging to the sideline. He sat out a series while getting patched up in the medical tent and returned with tape and splotches of blood on his nose.

It wasn’t pretty. Fitting for a group that has looked the part of a first-place team in name only for the better part of two months. The Steelers (6-6) have dropped five of seven, with three of the setbacks coming by 10 points or more at the hands of teams in the playoff mix.

“We’ve got to flush this one,” Rodgers said.

If they want to salvage a season that is threatening to spin out of control, they don’t have much of a choice.

Rodgers, playing exclusively out of the shotgun or pistol to protect his injured wrist, completed 10 of 21 passes for 117 yards, most of them in garbage time.

“We just didn’t have a lot of positive plays,” Rodgers said. “I felt good enough to be out there. ... Disappointed in my performance. Disappointed in the offensive performance.”

Pittsburgh managed just 166 yards, its third-lowest total in coach Mike Tomlin’s 19 years. Yet the offense was just one of the Steelers’ many issues.

A defense that knew the Bills and reigning MVP Josh Allen would challenge it on the ground wilted repeatedly.

Buffalo rolled up 249 yards rushing, the most by a visitor at Acrisure Stadium since it opened in 2001. James Cook ran for 144 yards, and Allen mashed his way into the end zone for an 8-yard score early in the fourth quarter that put the game out of reach.

The Bills controlled the ball for nearly 42 minutes and snapped the ball 74 times, nearly double that of the Steelers (40).

“It was (a butt) kicking in all areas,” linebacker T.J. Watt said.

Perhaps just as concerning is the way the Steelers lost their composure. Cam Heyward, a seven-time Pro Bowler and fixture in the locker room for 15 years, was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct in the third quarter when he responded to what he described as Allen kneeing him in the stomach.

“Just jawing back and forth and ticked off the entire game because as a quarterback you’re getting protected, but I’m not,” Heyward said. “It just (ticks) me off.”

There’s plenty to get riled up about. While Pittsburgh still controls its playoff destiny, it also faces a closing five-game stretch that includes two meetings with the run-heavy Ravens and a visit to Detroit.

Tomlin believes his team can find the answers it needs over the next month. Yet the reality is the Steelers have been unable to consistently get stops all season when they can’t produce turnovers.

Pittsburgh had two takeaways in the first half to mask the fact that it was outgained by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Buffalo did a better job protecting the ball in the second half, and the Steelers yielded.

The fans grew so restless that they chanted “Fire Tomlin!” during the second half. While Tomlin didn’t acknowledge hearing it, the longest-tenured coach in major North American professional sports was not surprised.

“I share their frustration tonight,” Tomlin said. “We didn’t do enough.”

Tomlin said he’s “looking at everything” in terms of solutions, though Pittsburgh has been mostly healthy. What the Steelers haven’t been is consistent, and as December begins, it’s fair to wonder if consistency is ever coming.

“Players need to take accountability, myself included,” Rodgers said. “And I will.”

Trey Lance led the Chargers next offensive series but Herbert returned to the game a few minutes into the second quarter and promptly threw a 10-yard pass to Keenan Allen to move the chains on third down.

""They just put a hard cast on it, put a glove around it. I think that was basically it,"" Herbert said about how he returned to the game.

Herbert stayed in for the rest of the game but he did not line up under center, instead staying in shotgun and pistol formations to avoid any snaps near the line of scrimmage.

Herbert said postgame that Lance was ready to come in if the Bolts got into possible goal line formations.

""It was more so just about ball security and understanding if we don't have to go under center, there's no need for it,"" Herbert said. ""We were ready in four minute if we were, if we were going to go in goal line or anything like that Trey was ready to go. I think it's just something we'll monitor as the week goes on.""

Harbaugh added: ""Getting under center, felt that would be difficult. We're operating exclusively out of the shotgun.""

Herbert said the most difficult part of playing with the cast was holding onto the ball.

""Ball security is at a paramount. I think I did a good enough job of that today in the pocket just giving the ball to the running backs. It's just stuff to work on,"" Herbert said.

However, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh revealed after the game that quarterback Justin Herbert broke a bone in his left hand, his non-throwing hand, and will undergo surgery on Monday.

Herbert injured his hand on the Chargers' opening drive, which was capped by a 10-yard Quentin Johnston touchdown. The star signal-caller hurt his hand after taking a big hit from Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn, but he appeared to be OK.

Following the opening scoring drive, Herbert exited the sideline and jogged to the locker room. Trey Lance took over at quarterback on L.A.'s next drive. When Herbert returned to the game that very same drive, he sported a large protective glove.

Herbert completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards, two touchdowns and one interception vs. the Raiders, and passed Dan Marino for the third-most passing yards (23,935) in a quarterback's first six seasons in NFL history. Los Angeles relied on its rushing attack Sunday, as Kimani Vidal and Jaret Patterson combined for 180 yards and two touchdowns on the ground.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/01/c9695dc8-3569-4d75-954a-1c5e75be19ae/thumbnail/1200x675/d6f752c348bb88b0d26dbc0fbd71666e/justin-h.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 00:58:53.332234

That left Jones to navigate a tricky situation as he tried to fend off numerous rushers without escaping the pocket in a game the Colts lost 20-16. He made the best of things, completing 14 of 27 pass attempts for 201 yards. Jones also connected for two touchdown passes, including an impressive 19-yard strike to receiver Alec Pierce against two defenders.

But for Jones, who is expected to be dealing with the injury for the foreseeable future, it wasn't easy and it wasn't enough. The Colts' point total was a season low, and their 281 total yards was their second lowest of the season (second only to last week's 255 in a game Jones also played hurt).

The Texans pressured Jones on 64% of his dropbacks, and his effectiveness dropped significantly when under duress. Jones completed 2 of 11 passes when under pressure. And his 1.3 yards per attempt on those plays was the second lowest of his career, according to ESPN Research.

Jones reportedly has a fibula injury but wouldn't confirm nor deny that on Sunday.

""I feel good enough to play,"" he said. ""Doctors cleared me to play, so that's what I'm going to do.""

The Texans continued a recent trend of Colts opponents sending extra rushers and blitzing Jones, an area where he exceled earlier in the season when the Colts established themselves as the most explosive offense in the league. This highlighted the limitations of his injury, which are most obvious when it comes to Jones' reluctance to leave the pocket.

He had just one pass attempt outside the pocket Sunday, according to ESPN Research. Jones also never scrambled despite the constant pass rush, suggesting an inability to escape related to his injury.

But given Anthony Richardson Sr.'s earlier facial fracture (he remains on injured reserve) and the inexperience of rookie backup Riley Leonard, the Colts have given no consideration to a quarterback change.

""We knew that he's tough and [about] the decision to keep playing,"" receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said of Jones. ""So, we've just got to keep going.""

Jones will have to dig deep because the stakes are high. After losing three of their past four games and falling into a tie with Jacksonville for the AFC South lead, the Colts find themselves in an urgent situation. They were 7-1 just a month ago and now are in a fight down the stretch.

""I definitely expect a high sense of urgency and guys being ready, eager to correct what we need to correct,"" Jones said. ""No one's losing confidence ... but we know what we have to do.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1201%2Fr1583050_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 19:59:58.601068

Biggest NFL Week 13 Injuries:

Woody Marks Injury Update

Texans RB Woody Marks injured his foot on his third carry of the game and was sent to the locker room.

The rookie has become Houston's lead back in recent weeks, getting the start and playing over 60 percent of the snaps in each of the last three games.

Marks returned to the game early in the second quarter after receiving some medical attention.

Sauce Gardner Injury Update

Colts CB Sauce Gardner exited in the first quarter on Sunday due to a calf injury.

Gardner seemed to pull his muscle on a running play and was quickly ruled out by the team.

With Gardner out, Mekhi Blackmon is back on the field at outside cornerback. He's made seven starts this season, but has played sparingly in recent weeks.

Amon-Ra St. Brown Injury Update

Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown is considered week-to-week after he suffered a low-ankle sprain on Thanksgiving against the Packers.

The Lions will play Dallas on Thursday this week, but then have a 10-day break before they head to Los Angeles and play the Rams.

If St. Brown's injury isn't too serious, his return against the Rams isn't out of the question.

Gardner would exit the Colts' Week 13 matchup with the Houston Texans on the second play of the game.

After going to the blue medical tent, Garnder was helped to the locker room, and then ruled out by the Colts a short while later.

According to Pelissero, Gardner is believed to have suffered a calf strain. Peliserro adds that these injuries ""can be tricky"" and there will be additional tests completed.

There is, however, optimism that Gardner avoided major injury as his Achilles appears to be intact.

After Gardner was ruled out, The Athletic's James Boyd saw Gardner on the Colts' sideline with a boot on his lower left leg/foot.

In Gardner's first two games with the Colts, he has allowed five receptions on 10 targets for 38 yards with two pass breakups. He's also made 12 tackles.

With Gardner, the Colts have become a very man-coverage-heavy defense.

With winter in full swing, conditions are going to be tough at Huntington Bank Field.

Weather forecasters are calling for morning rain to change over to snow showers in the afternoon near game time.

Temperatures will top out around 38 degrees and winds will be swirling up to 35 miles per hour.

In this type of environment, I’m not expecting the Browns to put the ball into the hands of Shedeur Sanders a ton in his second career NFL start.

Instead, I’m looking for Quinshon Judkins to get a ton of handoffs as Cleveland looks to protect the ball.

Judkins hasn’t been as explosive of late as he was during his first few career games earlier this season, but he gets a good matchup against injury-depleted 49ers defense.

Over their past three games, San Francisco has allowed 373 total yards per game, which is the 7th-most in football over that stretch.

In recent weeks, the Browns have also begun utilizing Judkins in the wildcat formation, giving the rookie running back even more opportunities for looks.

Veteran ball carrier Jerome Ford will miss the game with a hamstring injury, leaving the backfield for Judkins and fellow rookie Dylan Sampson.

Gardner was in the NFL's concussion protocol.","https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/30/PIND/87539593007-113025-colts-texans-0016.jpg?crop=5106,2872,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-30 15:00:45.958190

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The big development to watch for the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday is how Ahkello Witherspoon works back into a cornerback room that has surged without him. The top option coming into the season, Witherspoon has missed the past nine games, and in that time, the room around him went from a major concern to the stars of the defense. Emmanuel Forbes Jr. and Cobie Durant have combined for five interceptions over the past four games, and Darious Williams has been a steady rotational presence.

But the Rams do have to replace Quentin Lake, who rotated from nickel cornerback to strong safety to free safety but will now be out until the postseason. Durant could be an option to play inside, where Los Angeles also likes to play Josh Wallace. Roger McCreary was supposed to help here but just went on injured reserve this week.

The Rams have held four of the past six opponents to 10 points or fewer and have six interceptions across the past two games. But the tests will continue to add up, including Sunday against the Carolina Panthers and breakout rookie receiver Tetairoa McMillan.

Down in the AFC South, victory over the 1-10 Titans will give Jacksonville (7-4) an 81 percent chance of reaching the playoffs; lose and that plummets to 62 percent.

The Jags excel at two things - stopping the run and turning the ball over. They have allowed only 922 yards rushing this season (83.6 yards per game, first in the NFL), while Trevor Lawrence is fresh off tossing three touchdowns and three interceptions in the narrow overtime win in Arizona.

With head coach Liam Coen encouraging Lawrence to “let it rip”, Brian Thomas Jr returns to an offense that has averaged 30.3 points since their Week 8 bye. The Jags’ ground game is not to be underestimated either - Travis Etienne needs 25 scrimmage yards to top 1,000 yards this season.

Despite the stats, this is no gimme. The Titans have lost their last three games by a combined 16 points, Jeffery Simmons can wreck any game and Cam Ward can use his feet as well as his arm. But Tennessee are the least productive rushing offense (822 yards; 77.5 per game) and a serious team would put them away. We shall see if Jacksonville can take a step towards that today.

Jaguars inactives:

WR Dyami Brown

RB Cody Schrader

DE Travon Walker

OL Chuma Edoga

LB Yasir Abdullah

OL Patrick Mekari

TE Hunter Long

DT Arik Armstead

Atlanta’s Kyle Pitts is worth watching the rest of the season, not just today. The fifth-year tight end is 13th among tight ends this year with 459 receiving yards and he only has one touchdown. His EPA per target (minus-.09) is 33rd among tight ends this season, and he’s had critical drops in the last month.

The Falcons coaching staff continues to publicly support Pitts. “I think Kyle is having a good year. He’s playing hard,” offensive coordinator Zac Robinson said. “He’s blocking really well at the line of scrimmage. Of course, you want to get the drops off tape. He’s just got to stay confident.” However, Pitts, the No. 4 pick in the 2021 draft, is playing on the final year of his contract and he needs to show more down the stretch if he’s going to get the kind of second contract he likely is expecting.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/DryfUFSYYRg1_92Z5Geu2ZjSA_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-11-30 14:02:08.567226

Here, we break down the most important NFL injuries that bettors need to know and what NFL betting lines look like per the latest SportsLine consensus odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Saints at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee, out)

NO WR Chris Olave (back, available)

A struggling Saints team that's starting a rookie quarterback will be very shorthanded here against the Dolphins with star running back Alvin Kamara ruled out. However, Olave is good to go.

The Dolphins are favored by 5.5 points, while the total is 41.5.

Texans at Colts (1 p.m. ET)

HOU QB C.J. Stroud (concussion, will play)

IND QB Daniel Jones (fibula, will play)

Both teams will have their starting quarterbacks, which is good news for this AFC South tilt. C.J. Stroud has missed the last three weeks with a concussion, while it was reported this week that Daniel Jones is playing through a fracture in his leg. Jones' mobility against an elite Texans defense will be worth keeping a close eye on.

Indy is a 3.5-point favorite. The total is 44.5.

Falcons at Jets (1 p.m. ET)

ATL WR Drake London (knee, out)

The Falcons' season is in a rough spot and only got worse with the recent injury to quarterback Michael Penix Jr. Kirk Cousins will start the rest of the way for Atlanta, and at least for this matchup with the Jets, he won't have top receiver Drake London, who again has been ruled out with a knee injury.

The Falcons are 2.5-point favorites, and the total is 39.5.

49ers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Neither team has any major injuries of note here. Christian McCaffrey missed practice Wednesday and Thursday, but those were veteran rest days after heavy usage on Monday.

The 49ers are favored by 4.5 points, and the total is just 36.5.

Rams at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)

CAR CB Jaycee Horn (concussion, out)

The main injury of note here comes on the Carolina defense with star cornerback Jaycee Horn out with a concussion. The Rams have an elite offense with arguably the best receiver duo in the NFL in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, so Horn's absence is a big one for this matchup.

The Rams are 10.5-point favorites on the road. The total is 45.

Jaguars at Titans (1 p.m. ET)

JAX WR Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle, will play)

TENN TE Chig Okonkwo (foot, available)

The Jags' offense will get a key weapon back here with the return of Brian Thomas Jr., who missed the last three weeks with an ankle injury. Thomas has had a disappointing Year 2 after a monster rookie season, so the Jaguars will hope to get him more involved over the last few weeks of the season. Tennessee tight end Chig Okonkwo is in.

Jacksonville is a 6-point favorite on the road. The total is 41.5.

Cardinals at Buccaneers (1 p.m. ET)

AZ RB Trey Benson (ankle, out)

AZ RB Emari Demercado (ankle, out)

AZ RB Bam Knight (knee, available)

AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (illness, available)

TB QB Baker Mayfield (left shoulder, available)

TB RB Bucky Irving (foot and shoulder, available)

This game features the most injury news of the weekend, but everyone who was listed as questionable is set to play. Baker Mayfield will be suiting for the Bucs, as will Bucky Irving. The running back makes his long-awaited return. For the Cardinals, Harrison Jr. and Knight are both good to go.

Tampa is a 3.5-point favorite. The total is 44.5.

Vikings at Seahawks (4:05 p.m. ET)

MINN QB J.J. McCarthy (concussion, out)

J.J. McCarthy has had an abysmal start to his playing career, and he'll be out once again, this time with a concussion. The Vikings will turn to Max Brosmer, an undrafted rookie from Minnesota. Brosmer will have good weapons to turn to, but the Vikings have listed two starting offensive linemen as questionable against a tough Seattle defense.

The Seahawks are favored by 11.5 points, and the total is 41.

Bills at Steelers (4:25 p.m. ET)

BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (hamstring, questionable)

BUFF OTs Dion Dawkins and Spencer Brown (both out)

PITT QB Aaron Rodgers (left wrist, will play)

PITT WR DK Metcalf (ankle, will play)

The Steelers get a boost this week with the return of quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who missed last week's loss to Chicago with a fractured left wrist. The veteran signal-caller is good to go in this tough bout with the Bills, and he'll have star receiver DK Metcalf, who missed practice earlier this week with an ankle injury. The Bills are hoping to get tight end Dalton Kincaid back as he's missed the last few weeks, but their O-line will be missing two key starters against a tough Steelers front.

Buffalo is a 3-point favorite. The total is 45.5.

Raiders at Chargers (4:25 p.m. ET)

L.A. RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, out)

The Chargers will have to wait at least one more week to get dynamic running back Omarion Hampton back in the mix as the rookie is out after returning to practice this week. With Hampton out, Kimani Vidal will again serve as L.A.'s lead back against a struggling Vegas defense.

The Chargers are favored by 9,5 points against the Raiders while the total is 40.5.

Broncos at Commanders (8:20 p.m. ET)

WASH QB Jayden Daniels (left elbow, out)

WASH WR Terry McLaurin (quad, will play)

Jayden Daniels isn't yet ready to return after an ugly left elbow injury a few weeks ago, but Washington will finally have Terry McLaurin back and catching passes after a lengthy quad injury. Marcus Mariota will start under center against a Broncos team that has the No. 3 scoring defense in the NFL.

Denver is favored by 5.5 points, and the total is 43.5.

Giants at Patriots (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

NYG QB Jaxson Dart (concussion, will play)

The Pats will have a depleted offensive line after losing left tackle Will Campbell for a few weeks as he's on IR, and the team will likely be without starting guard Jared Wilson as well. The Giants will have rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart back after missing two weeks with a concussion, which paved the way for Jameis Winston to start. This will be Dart's first start under interim head coach Mike Kafka.

New England is favored by 7.5 points. The total is 46.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/11/20/5da1615d-9ae6-46d8-869b-bd3efd8a8ee5/thumbnail/1200x675/7e848c005afad0857c4ff054e44622ad/baker.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 14:02:15.103915

He's had two big-time chunk gains in the first half, including a 25-yard reception on Tampa's opening drive, followed by a 35-yard gain in the second quarter to set them up inside the Cardinals' 10-yard line.

Unfortunately, his strong drive ended with a brutal drop in the end zone, which would have been good for his first touchdown reception of the season. He currently leads the team with 56 receiving yards after entering the week with just 61 receiving yards over three games.

Slow first quarter in Indianapolis with the Colts trailing the Texans, 3-0. Colts quarterback Daniel Jones was 1 of 5 in the first quarter for two passing yards. Jonathan Taylor rushed for 23 yards on four carries.

Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud completed 6 of 10 passes for 82 yards. Running back Woody Marks left the game with a foot injury. No word yet on whether he'll retur

Just two pass attempts after being picked off in the end zone, Matthew Stafford threw his second interception of the day. This time, it was a pick 6!

It was Stafford's first pick 6 since Week 8 of the 2023 season.

With the successful PAT, the Panthers take a 14-7 lead over the Rams closing out first quarter.

The Vikings are down to their third-string quarterback, as starter J.J. McCarthy is out with a concussion in Week 13 and his backup, veteran Carson Wentz, is out for the year with a shoulder injury.

The next man up is UDFA rookie quarterback Max Brosmer, who's slated to make his first career start for Minnesota against the Seahawks.

Brosmer started his collegiate career in the FCS, playing four seasons with the New Hampshire Wildcats. He eventually made his way to the FBS for his final season, starting 13 games for Minnesota, passing for 2,828 yards, 18 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.

McCarthy has struggled in his first season as a starter after missing all of his rookie season with a knee injury, so it remains to be seen how much of a downgrade Brosmer will actually be for the offense. McCarthy has thrown an interception in each of his six starts this season, having thrown two interceptions in four of his last five games.

He's completing just 54.1% of pass attempts with 929 yards, 6 touchdowns and 10 interceptions on the year.

Plenty of action so far in Carolina!

After the Rams scored on their opening possession, Bryce Young & Co. answered with a touchdown of their own. It was a 69-yard drive, punctuated with a 35-yard catch and run from RB Chuba Hubbard.

Chuba Hubbard played five snaps on the opening drive to Rico Dowdle's four, appearing to regain some ground in the race for snaps after a breakout run from Rico Dowdle earlier this season.

Stop me if you've heard this one before:

Matthew Stafford has thrown a touchdown pass to, who else, but Davante Adams. He's now thrown 28 consecutive touchdowns without an interception, setting a new NFL record, Ari Meirov shares.

Buffalo (7-4) and Pittsburgh (6-5) need wins to keep pace in a tight AFC playoff race. The Bills are playing second fiddle for the first time in years to the New England Patriots in the AFC East, while Pittsburgh sits tied atop the AFC North with Baltimore. The Bills lost in Houston last week and have dropped two of their last three games. The Steelers have lost four of their last six games after getting off to a 4-1 start. Aaron Rodgers should be back under center after missing Week 12 with a fractured left wrist. For two teams who've recently fallen backward in the playoff race, this game doesn't get much bigger.

Mayfield will spend some time on Sunday afternoon handing off to second-year running back Bucky Irving, who is back in action after missing the Bucs' last seven games due to shoulder and foot injuries. Mayfield and Irving were two of six players listed as questionable on the Buccaneers' Friday injury report, but all six have been cleared to play.

The Buccaneers and Cardinals submitted their list of inactives at 11:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, 90 minutes before the scheduled kickoff of their Week 13 meeting at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. The Buccaneers elevated safety Marcus Banks from their practice squad for the game and thus had to name six inactives to get down to the game-day limit of 48. The Cardinals elevated tight end Pharaoh Brown and linebacker Channing Tindall from the practice squad to give them 54 available players, which meant they had to name six players inactive on Sunday.

Arizona had a lengthy injury list this week and ruled out six players on Friday, though two – running back Trey Benson and offensive lineman Christian Jones – are technically still on injured reserve. Another Cardinals running back, Emari Demercado, will be sidelined for the game due to an ankle injury; he leads the team this season with 241 rushing yards. Arizona's starting right guard, Will Hernandez, is also unavailable due to hip and knee ailments, and he was placed on injured reserve on Saturday.

So the Vikings lost Darnold but got Brosmer -- and now will have the chance to see both quarterbacks square off Sunday in Seattle.","J.J. McCarthy landed in the NFL's concussion protocol last week, months after Sam Darnold left Minnesota for Seattle.

The fallout from both of those situations will have a direct impact on Sunday's matchup between the Darnold-less Vikings and Darnold-led Seahawks.

On back-to-back fourth-quarter plays last week in Green Bay, McCarthy had his head slam into the ground -- the first when he was tackled by Packers linebacker Isaiah McDuffie, and then on the next play when he was chased and tackled by Green Bay defensive end Kingsley Enagbare.

McCarthy self-reported his symptoms on the flight back to Minnesota from Green Bay, and then found himself in concussion protocol, where he now remains, sources told ESPN.

With McCarthy out, the Vikings will start undrafted rookie quarterback Max Brosmer, who starred last season at the University of Minnesota.

And just like that, the Vikings find themselves in the type of challenging situation they were hoping to avoid this past offseason, when two of their quarterbacks -- Darnold and Daniel Jones -- were about to become free agents.

The Vikings made a passing attempt to re-sign Darnold, but they were not as aggressive as the Seahawks or Steelers. The Seahawks offered Darnold more money, and more years, than Minnesota. Seattle's offer was evidence that it wanted and valued Darnold more than Minnesota, and the Seahawks landed their new starting quarterback just days after trading former starting quarterback Geno Smith to the Raiders.

Darnold -- the son of a plumber and a teacher -- has flourished in Seattle.

McCarthy, on the other hand, has battled through another injury-plagued season -- first suffering a high-ankle sprain in Week 2 that prevented him from playing until recently, and now the concussion that will knock him out of at least Sunday's game.

The Vikings now will turn to Brosmer, whom they have eyed since last year. He first caught the eye of Vikings officials at the University of Minnesota's pro day in March 2024, right after he transferred into the program from the University of New Hampshire. Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah both attended that day and were impressed.

Golden Gophers coach P.J. Fleck later advocated for Brosmer with Adofo-Mensah, who lobbied to get the young quarterback an invitation to the NFL scouting combine in February. Adofo-Mensah lobbied for Brosmer even though the Vikings, who entered the 2025 draft with only four selections, did not have a great chance to draft him.

A few weeks later at the Gophers' 2025 pro day, the Vikings GM was overheard saying that he ""kind of wish[ed]"" he hadn't lobbied for Brosmer to the combine ""because then he'd really be our secret.""

Brosmer ultimately did not get drafted, but the Vikings were the team that was the most aggressive about signing him. He will become the first quarterback to make his first career start for an NFL team in the same state where he played college football since Joshua Dobbs, who played at the University of Tennessee and made his first start for the Titans in 2022.

Brosmer also attended the same high school as Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald -- Centennial High School in Roswell, Georgia.

So the Vikings lost Darnold but got Brosmer -- and now will have the chance to see both quarterbacks square off Sunday in Seattle.",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1030%2Fr1568359_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 12:01:55.284834

""Unfortunately, during the routine meeting with our medical team, Frank failed his physical.
Lions coach Dan Campbell said he's not sure if Ragnow will continue his comeback attempt in 2026 and beyond.
Ragnow, 29, had two season left on his contract, this year and next, when he retired abruptly in June.
""That was never discussed,"" Campbell said in a Zoom with Detroit reporters that was scheduled before Ragnow underwent his physical.","Frank Ragnow's comeback is over.

The Detroit Lions announced that Ragnow failed a physical with the team Friday, Nov. 29, two days after they removed him from the reserved/retired list in hopes of getting a boost for the playoffs.

Ragnow had a Grade 3 hamstring strain, the Lions said in a statement.

""Frank Ragnow reported to our facility yesterday and went through the normal process of meetings,"" the statement read. ""Unfortunately, during the routine meeting with our medical team, Frank failed his physical.

""The medical exam revealed a Grade 3 hamstring strain that will keep him from participating for the remainder of the regular season. For that reason, Frank will not be rejoining the Lions. Frank has always been a team-first guy and is a true warrior. He will forever be a Lion.""

Lions coach Dan Campbell said he's not sure if Ragnow will continue his comeback attempt in 2026 and beyond.

Ragnow, 29, had two season left on his contract, this year and next, when he retired abruptly in June. He made four Pro Bowls in seven seasons, was a three-time second-team All-Pro and battled a slew of injuries throughout his career.

""That was never discussed,"" Campbell said in a Zoom with Detroit reporters that was scheduled before Ragnow underwent his physical. ""It was just once we realized the severity of it, he did, then it just, that’s where it went. So nothing was discussed past the news that you guys just got.""

Campbell said Ragnow, who had been mulling coming out of retirement for about a month, according to left tackle Taylor Decker, disclosed to the team ""he had a little bit of"" a hamstring injury before deciding Wednesday, Nov. 26, he wanted to play this year.

Wednesday was the deadline for Ragnow to unretire and be eligible to play this season.

""We just didn’t know the severity of it until we had the final physical and all the tests that were run that we do with anybody we bring in,"" Campbell said. ""So yeah, we had an idea, we just didn’t know it was going to be that extent.""

The Lions' offense, led by one of the best lines in the NFL the past few years, has struggled in Ragnow's absence this season.

They've allowed 26 sacks in 12 games, are scoring four fewer points per game than they did last season and have dealt with injuries and communication issues at times up front.

Graham Glasgow moved from left guard to center to replace Ragnow in training camp and is one of the lowest-graded centers in the NFL, according to Pro Football Focus, and the Lions have relied primarily on first-year starters rookie Tate Ratledge and second-year pro Christian Mahogany at right and left guard.

Glasgow missed the Lions' Thanksgiving loss to the Green Bay Packers with a knee injury and Mahogany is out likely until the playoffs with a broken bone in his leg. Decker also has battled a shoulder injury all year.

Campbell said he does not know Glasgow's availability for next week's game against the Dallas Cowboys, but that Trystan Colon ""did some good things"" in his first start at center against the Packers.

""There was a little up and down, but, man, I thought he brought a lot of energy, I thought most of his ID’s were on point and I thought he did some good things,"" Campbell said. ""And I think the more he plays, the better he can get, too.""

While the Lions, losers of four of their past seven games, were counting on Ragnow to help them make a playoff push, Campbell said his loss won't be an emotional drain on the team.

""I mean, look, of course we’re disappointed just because Frank’s such a good dude and a great teammate and he’s a productive player,"" he said. ""But at the same time, he’s injured, too, and so man, you quickly move off of that and know what it is and he’s not playing and it’s all good, man. We adjust, we move on and we’re onto Dallas now, so we’ve been going.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/02/PDTF/83994527007-img-nfl-detroit-lions-at-1.JPG?crop=2399,1350,x0,y0&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-30 13:01:20.395107

The Steelers will obviously hope to fare better, and a win against the Bills on Sunday would go a long way in doing so.","Despite the injury, Rodgers logged two full practices to end the week, after which head coach Mike Tomlin said all systems were go for Week 13. The upcoming matchup against Buffalo comes with enormous stakes. Following the Ravens' Thanksgiving loss to the Bengals, Pittsburgh has a chance to open up a game lead over Baltimore in the AFC North ahead of playing each other in Week 14, the first of two matchups between the clubs remaining this season.

Beyond the divisional aspect, a win over Buffalo would make the Steelers and Bills an identical 7-5 and give Pittsburgh a leg up if needed in the wild-card race.

It's imperative to have Rodgers out there. Through 10 games in his first season in black and gold, he's thrown for 1,969 yards, 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions with a 97.7 passer rating, his highest since 2021.

Mason Rudolph was serviceable but unspectacular versus Chicago, going 24 of 31 for 171 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He also lost a fumble.

Would Rodgers have been the difference against the Bears, whom he's tormented throughout his career? Perhaps, but his willingness to play through injury in the aftermath should certainly provide a morale boost to a team that's been spiraling of late.

After starting the season 4-1 to open up a comfortable divisional lead, the Steelers have lost four of their past six and went into Week 13 knotted at the top with the Ravens. With this potentially being Rodgers final season in the NFL, he seemingly isn't content to miss another opportunity to turn things around.

Considering his history, there's little surprise he'd push so hard to play through the pain.

Rodgers played nearly the entirety of the 2018 season with a tibial fracture after getting hurt in Week 1. He also played his final season for the Packers in 2022 with an avulsion fracture in his right thumb from Week 5 onward.

Green Bay notably missed the playoffs during both of those campaigns.

Star wide receiver Chris Godwin has played in just three games this season after briefly returning in September from last year's season-ending fibula injury. Promising young wide receiver Jalen McMillan has yet to play this year after suffering a preseason neck injury.

That's about to change.

Sources say McMillan, the second-year wideout who burst onto the scene with a stellar rookie season, is set to have his practice window opened soon. If there are no setbacks, McMillan could begin practicing this week -- setting the stage for an infusion of help for the season's stretch run.

McMillan had 37 catches for 461 yards and eight touchdowns as a rookie, and he hoped to build on that success this year. But the third-rounder from Washington suffered three vertebrae fractures in his neck during a preseason game against the Steelers on Aug. 16 and has spent the season on injured reserve.

But this past week, however, noted spine expert Dr. Robert Watkins confirmed that McMillan has received the green light to practice, sources say.

While he's been ramping up away from the spotlight, that news opens the door for him to practice with the team this week. McMillan playing in games won't be immediate, as he will need to get into playing shape, but a return is coming.

Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles was asked this past week about the potential returns of McMillan, veteran wide receiver Mike Evans (broken clavicle) and defensive lineman Calijah Kancey (torn pectoral).

""We will have to see,"" Bowles said, ""but I think they will all be back before the season is out.""

Evans is also trending in the right direction after he broke his collarbone in a Week 7 loss to the Detroit Lions. While his return might not be this week, it could be the next. A determination on Evans' status will be based on medical scans that are coming.

As for Sunday's game against the Cardinals, Baker Mayfield is expected to play after being listed as questionable due to a sprained AC joint in his left shoulder suffered in Week 12, running back Bucky Irving is returning after dealing with shoulder and foot injuries, and guard Ben Bredeson and linebacker Haason Reddick are likely back, as well.

Plus, Godwin should play more than his handful of plays last week as he works his way back from last year's fibula fracture.

It’s as if they get food poisoning every time they set foot in Madison Square Garden.

Saturday’s 4-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning was the Rangers’ ninth defeat in 11 tries on home ice this season. They’re 2-8-1 at MSG, with five points registering as a new franchise low through their first 11 home games, according to NHL Stats. But it’s about more than just the mounting losses; it’s the embarrassing manner in which they’ve unfolded in front of the loyal Garden crowd, who continue to fill the building despite the disheartening performances.

“They were more willful than we were today,” Rangers captain J.T. Miller said of the Lightning. “At no point in that game were we deserving of winning.”

The Rangers (13-12-2) were utterly lifeless out of the gate. They skated as if they were still digesting their Thanksgiving dinner, leaving key areas of the ice open and making poor decisions with the puck on the rare occasions they got to it. Tampa Bay set up shop in the offensive zone and got comfortable there for the entire afternoon, with New York offering little pushback. It led to a dominant first period, with the Lightning earning each of the game’s first nine shots on goal and 17 of the first 18 attempts.

“We got out-competed from the drop of the puck,” coach Mike Sullivan said.

Tampa finished with 35 shots while New York mustered only 13, marking its lowest total of the season. The Lightning also held a distinct 16-4 advantage in high-danger scoring chances at five-on-five, according to Natural Stat Trick.

Seven of those HD chances came in the opening 20 minutes, which could have easily resulted in a multi-goal lead if not for Igor Shesterkin. Sullivan opted to start his No. 1 goalie on back-to-back days for the first time this season, but it wasn’t enough to inspire better play from his teammates. Shesterkin bailed them out multiple times in the opening 10 minutes, but the Rangers eventually got what they deserved when an off-target shot from Lightning forward Brandon Hagel redirected in off defenseman Carson Soucy’s skate at the 10:53 mark.

That was the only goal of a lopsided first period, providing a sliver of hope that the Rangers could regroup and rally at intermission. But not much changed in the second, with Tampa generating another seven HD chances in the middle period. Hagel scored his second goal of the game after New York got caught sleeping at the 8:57 mark — first on an ill-advised dump-in from Alexis Lafrenière that abruptly ended a three-on-two rush and handed possession right back to the Lightning, then on the ensuing counter in which no one wearing blue bothered to hustle back and defend.

“I didn’t think we had dump it,” Sullivan said. “I thought we should have challenged off the rush there. We’re trying to encourage Laf to challenge people, hang onto pucks, go wide, force that guy to have to defend you. … I felt like tonight there was a fair amount of times we just gave it back to them when we didn’t have to.”

Miller cut the Rangers’ deficit to 2-1 when an Adam Fox pass went in off his skate late in the second period, but it never felt like they had a comeback in them. Nick Paul made sure of it by redirecting a feed from Nikita Kucherov to make it 3-1 Lightning 2:02 into the third before Jake Guentzel sealed the win with an empty-netter.

It was the ultimate buzzkill following a three-game winning streak, which saw New York climb its way out of the Metro Division basement, only to stumble right back into it.

“There’s got to be a willingness and a want to be first to pucks, to embrace physicality,” Sullivan said. “We knew the type of game it was going to be. That team, they’ve got hard skill, they compete and they skate. That was the kind of game that it was going to be.

“I don’t think we had the wherewithal to match their intensity. I just felt like we lost puck battles all over the rink, and it’s hard to establish any sort of game that you want to play if you don’t win puck battles.”

Making matters worse is the uncertainty surrounding Fox, who exited in pain after Hagel crunched his left arm into the boards on a clean hit with 12:57 to play and did not return. Sullivan labeled it an upper-body injury and said the 27-year-old was still being evaluated, but an absence of any kind would be damning. There’s an argument that no Ranger would be harder to replace. It’s a two-man debate between Fox and Shesterkin, with the former representing their only point-producing defenseman — he’s racked up 10 assists during his current six-game point streak — and team MVP up to this point.

“He’s a Norris (Trophy) defenseman,” said center Mika Zibanejad in an obvious-but-telling response.

The built-in excuse is that the Rangers are tied for most games played (27) by any NHL team this season, with nine coming in the last 15 days. It’s been a grueling schedule that included 16 of their first 26 games on the road, but they’re far from the only team dealing with heavy legs. The Lightning also played three times in the last four days.

Meanwhile, New York entered as close to full strength as it’s been since the beginning of the season. Defenseman Will Borgen returned to the lineup Saturday after missing the previous five games due to an upper-body injury, while Tampa was playing without three of its top-four D — Erik Černák, Victor Hedman and Ryan McDonagh — plus No. 1 center Brayden Point.

You wouldn’t have known it watching this one. The Rangers looked flat, and worse, disengaged.

“I’ve talked about it a few times, but this game’s majority mental,” Rangers center Vincent Trocheck said. “It’s up to you to kind of fight off the negativity whenever there’s something creeping into your mind.”

The hard truth is that the Rangers are decidedly mid, as the kids say today. They’re always a threat to steal a game against quality opponents thanks to Shesterkin, but it’s been a struggle to consistently hang with the league’s best. Consider that they’ve won only five of 14 games against teams that entered Saturday in playoff position, with none of those victories coming at MSG. Then consider that Saturday started a stretch of eight home games in their next 11, with the powerful Dallas Stars next up to visit the Garden on Tuesday.

Because of New York’s flawed roster, which has been exposed for its lack of playmaking and diminished team speed, it can ill afford to compound those issues by getting outworked. That became an unfortunate trademark of the 2024-25 Rangers, and while it’s been generally better under Sullivan, there have been a handful of concerning efforts just over a quarter of the way into the new season. They’ve called themselves out on those occasions, but this is an actions-speak-louder-than-words situation.

These Rangers aren’t skilled enough to get by on talent alone — and if they don’t bring the necessary level of determination, the potential lingers for ugly afternoons like this.

“That’s something obviously that I’ll discuss with my coaching staff moving forward,” Sullivan said. “Obviously, our expectation is higher. I don’t think the players, by any stretch, have intentions of getting out-competed. Obviously, we’ve got to find a way to take more pride in that, and that’s something that we’ve got to work through as a group.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/29192949/GettyImages-2249079801-scaled-e1764462619182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-30 12:02:21.255325

You better walk it off,"" joked Wallace this week (while being completely serious).
For two weeks, he prepared as best he could, knowing he likely wouldn't play but wanting to be ready just in case.
After missing one game, a win against the Falcons in Week 11, Wallace was champing at the bit to be back on the field.
Wallace—who had 52 tackles, four for loss, four passes defended at the time of his injury—practiced as a full participant all week.","CHARLOTTE — For weeks now, Trevin Wallace has been rearing to get back on the field. Logically, he knew that the shoulder injury he suffered in Week 10 needed time to heal. Logically, he knew the Panthers had other players who could step in for two games. Logically, he knew he could still watch and learn from the sideline.

""I grew up in South Georgia, where if I got hurt, my dad was like, 'You ain't going to the hospital. You better walk it off,"" joked Wallace this week (while being completely serious).

""So I grew up like that. So, like, I felt like it's been games where I was, like, when I sat out, oh, I could have played. But just the professional aspect of being smart and knowing, like, 'Hey, your body is your money. So just get prepared for the next game and then see what you can do after that.'

""They really had to protect me from myself because I was telling them straight up, like I can go out there, shoulder, no shoulder, amputate it off, so I can go out there and play with one arm.""

That seemed like a slightly dramatic choice, though, so instead Wallace took his time recovering, even when he wanted to test the waters to play again. For two weeks, he prepared as best he could, knowing he likely wouldn't play but wanting to be ready just in case. It was easier, Wallace admitted, because he was forced to exit during a period of his career in which he was playing well.

That wasn't always the case, and this break allowed him to evaluate the defense and himself from a much healthier, mentally, at least, position.

""Obviously, you know I started off rough. Everybody knows that,"" blatantly stated Wallace. ""But I progressed over and over, so I felt good about myself. Now if I was playing bad and I was then (hurt), I'm like damn, I need to be out there because the tape is my resume,"" admitted Wallace.

""So after I got hurt, I was like, OK, you've been playing good. So maybe sit back a little bit and learn from the other linebackers.""

Those he was learning by watching, for the most part, were older than him. So he was able to mentally pick up on the game and the defensive scheme that can get lost in the heat of battle on the field. He also had a front row seat to something he had suspected but had not been a spectator for yet.

""We got a heck of a physical defense,"" whistled Wallace. ""Defense is real physical. I'd hate to be on the other side of the ball from them. So now we got a real physical defense. So things I already knew. Even on the sideline, seeing it for myself on the sideline, seeing in my helmet, like it felt cool a little bit, seeing like a game on the sideline instead of being in it.""

Like any true competitor, though, that reticence lasted only a short time. After missing one game, a win against the Falcons in Week 11, Wallace was champing at the bit to be back on the field.

""You want honest,"" Wallace warned, suggesting the answer might not be a canned compan line. ""But no, it was kind of frustrating. Just frustrating seeing, like I love the game of football and I ain't out there playing, so it is that aspect of just being, like, frustration. That's what it was. I was more frustrated.

""I still be watching films, so it's like knowing what team's going to hit us with or like what team's going to do, but it's like I'm calling it out, but I'm not out there to execute or help my teammates. So that's the frustration part.""

But that frustration is finally, seemingly, over. Wallace—who had 52 tackles, four for loss, four passes defended at the time of his injury—practiced as a full participant all week. Coach Dave Canales indicated he is expected to play Sunday against the Rams, just in time, with Christian Rozeboom still rehabbing a hip and hamstring injury and Claudin Cherelus remaining in concussion protocol.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/orykprhnsf9bx2gpydyy,N,,2025-11-30 12:03:02.502362
