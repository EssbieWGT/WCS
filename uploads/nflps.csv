,,2025-12-23 08:00:48+00:00,www.chiefhealthcareexecutive.com,Ryan Shazier's NFL career ended with a spinal cord injury. Now he helps patients in need.,Ron Southwick,,,,,https://www.chiefhealthcareexecutive.com/view/ryan-shazier-s-nfl-career-ended-with-a-spinal-cord-injury-now-he-helps-patients-in-need-,"On Dec. 4, 2017, Shazier suffered a devastating spinal cord injury in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
So mentally, that's a lot to deal with.” Shazier suffered a spinal cord contusion, which paralyzed his lower body.
He has established the Ryan Shazier Fund, which helps those grappling with spinal cord injuries.
Many patients with spinal cord injuries need more rehab sessions than they get, and Shazier says he had well over 100 rehab sessions.
“Most individuals with a spinal cord injury, everybody asks about them,” Shazier says.","As a linebacker with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ryan Shazier raced across the field with uncommon speed to tackle opposing players.

Shazier quickly established himself as a star, with his peers voting him among the top 50 players in the National Football League. Then at age 25, in just his fourth season, Shazier’s career was over.

On Dec. 4, 2017, Shazier suffered a devastating spinal cord injury in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. He was told that the odds are he wouldn’t walk again.

“I was one of the fastest people on the planet,” Shazier says. “Now I couldn't walk. So mentally, that's a lot to deal with.”

Shazier suffered a spinal cord contusion, which paralyzed his lower body. He defied the odds and managed to walk again, a prospect which seemed unfathomable in the days after the injury. But he’s taken big steps in other ways.

He has established the Ryan Shazier Fund, which helps those grappling with spinal cord injuries. The fund offers financial assistance to help pay for additional rehabilitation sessions or help with other needs, including accommodations at homes and support for caregivers.

In a conversation with Chief Healthcare Executive®, Shazier, who is 33, says he wants to help those who faced some of his challenges.

“When I got injured, it was something that I didn't really know much about,” Shazier says. “I didn't have a big understanding of the spinal cord community and the lack of resources and support.”

(See part of our conversation with Ryan Shazier. The story continues below.)

‘Meet people where they are’

Earlier this month, on the eighth anniversary of the injury that ended his football career, Shazier returned to UC Medical Center in Cincinnati. He visited staff that cared for him in the days after the injury.

“That's why I wanted to go back two weeks ago and just basically say thank you, because of the support that they gave,” he says, adding, “I just wanted to say thank you, because I wouldn't be where I'm at if it weren't for those wonderful doctors and nurses.”

Shazier was later transferred to UPMC, where he continued his recovery. When Shazier suffered the injury, he initially envisioned a return to the gridiron. But doctors told him that he had a 20% chance of even walking again.

“I wanted to get better and tried everything I could to learn how to walk and to get back to being able to play football. And I didn't understand how serious it was in the moment,” Shazier says.

He says his conditioning and his experience with years of rigorous training aided his recovery, but he still had to confront the reality of his situation.

“Nothing really prepares you for this,” he says. “There's nothing you're going to deal with … that's even relatively close.”

While he would not be able to resume his NFL career, Shazier regained the ability to walk, albeit with a slight limp.

Now, he’s aiming to help others with similar injuries through his foundation. Shazier says people have been amazed by his recovery, but many don’t understand how difficult the road is for people with severe spinal cord injuries.

“They see in my recovery, and it took so many rehab sessions for me to get there, and I'm still not 100% healthy. It took so much for me to be able to get there. So just to be able to give that back is everything to me,” Shazier says.

“This is a journey that you need as much community, as much support as you can possibly get to help you overcome it,” he says. “And that’s one of the reasons that I want to start this fund, to be able to give the same impact to those who were struggling like I was.”

The Ryan Shazier Fund offers financial support to help patients get more rehabilitation sessions. Shazier is based in the Pittsburgh area, but his fund goes beyond the Steel City.

The fund has given more than $1 million in stipends to families, and recently expanded. It is now offering services to patients across Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio.

Shazier says it’s “really exciting” to have a bigger reach.

“I think it's very important just to try to help as many people as possible,” he says.

Many patients with spinal cord injuries need more rehab sessions than they get, and Shazier says he had well over 100 rehab sessions.

“After a spinal cord injury, some of the costs associated with it after the injury could be up to over a million dollars, you know, within the first year,” Shazier says.

“If their rehab is going well, and they feel like they're making progress, and they may want more rehab to help them get to that next step, we may actually pay for more rehab sessions,” he says.

Shazier says the fund provides assistance in other ways, including helping patients who have transportation needs to get to their health providers. In some cases, the fund has helped individuals who need work done in their homes to allow them to move around more freely.

“We kind of meet people where they are,” Shazier says.

The fund also aims to help caregivers of individuals who have suffered spinal cord injuries, connecting them with others in their situation so they have people to talk to who understand their new reality. The fund also can provide financial assistance to caregivers, including transportation needs or counseling.

“Most individuals with a spinal cord injury, everybody asks about them,” Shazier says. “The person that's taking care of them, their life has changed just as the person with the injury.”

‘Building community’

Shazier says he’s gratified to help others struggling with spinal cord injuries, and he especially wants them to know that they aren’t alone.

“They felt the same way I felt,” he says. “They felt scared, they felt lost. They didn't know anybody that was dealing with the same type of injury. So now to be able to provide that support to them and just let them know that we're here if they need anything, we're trying to help them reach whatever goal that they have as well … to me, I think that's the biggest thing. Just building community.”

“When it comes to anybody that's going through some type of adversity, it takes a village and it takes a community,” Shazier says. “I think that's the thing that I really care about the most.”

While Shazier says he’d like to help everyone, he’s grateful that the foundation has grown to the point where it can offer services in three states.

“I just think it's just taking it one step at a time, growing it slowly but surely, but just trying to just be there, because the biggest thing is just providing quality of life to people and until we find a cure,” he says.

Now that the fund is aiming to help more people, Shazier says the foundation has exceeded his initial expectations.

“I remember when I first came up with it, I didn't know much about what a foundation was, and I was just like, I just want to help people with a spinal cord injury,” he says.

“And now, just to be able to hear the stories, and understanding how we've been able to allow people more opportunities and allow them to live freely, it's been nice. I'm just happy, and I'm a guy that is constantly want to keep going and keep growing, and turn this into something that we can help as many people as possible.”",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/che/ea89e99508b438968d8b8819e2dd66a363990356-636x480.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 04:00:46.307943

Two of the NFL's best headlined a Week 16 matchup with playoff implications, as Christian McCaffrey and the San Francisco 49ers defeated Jonathan Taylor and the Indianapolis Colts, 48-27, at Lucas Oil Stadium.

McCaffrey outdueled Taylor, who entered Monday Night Football ranked second in rushing yards (1,443), and Brock Purdy turned in a career-best effort to lead the Niners to a big win.

Purdy's performance gave him the edge in an intriguing quarterback battle against 44-year-old Philip Rivers, who played valiantly in his second game after a five-year retirement. The 49ers (11-4) secured a playoff berth Sunday and have now improved their chances at the No. 1 seed by beating a scrappy 8-7 Colts team that may end up missing the postseason.

Broncos linebacker Dre Greenlaw (hamstring), safety Delarrin Turner-Yell (knee), tight end Nate Adkins (knee) and wide receiver Pat Bryant (concussion) all left Sunday's game and did not return.

Greenlaw pulled up late in the fourth quarter and was quickly ruled out. Hamstring injuries can be tricky, so he seems unlikely to be ready in time for a Thursday Night Football showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 25.

Turner-Yell hurt his knee one day after being elevated from the practice squad to the game-day roster on Saturday. It was a heartbreaking development for the safety, who was making his return to action after missing all of the 2024 season after tearing his ACL in Week 17 of the 2023 season.

Adkins appeared to suffer a non-contact knee injury early in the second quarter. Adkins previously missed five games earlier this season with a knee injury.

Bryant was the most high-profile injury of the game. On the second-to-last play of the night, Bryant took a brutal hit from cornerback Montaric Brown. Bryant was then loaded onto a backboard, carted off the field and taken by ambulance to a local hospital.

Broncos coach Sean Payton said in his postgame press conference that Bryant had movement in his hands and legs, and the receiver was released from the hospital with a concussion on Sunday evening. Bryant is now in the NFL's concussion protocol, and he's extremely unlikely to play on TNF later this week.

Denver will not practice today, but the team is required to release three injury reports leading up to Thursday's game, so we should receive an estimated injury report later today. The Broncos could be missing several key players when they travel to Kansas City for an AFC West showdown on Christmas.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/22/SBRC/87878731007-broncos-injury-updates-delarrin-turner-yell.jpg?crop=5398,3037,x0,y359&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-22 23:59:02.590268

And I was like, 'Well, it's really serious,' but I got great news and I've been happy all day, for real.""
So while he could close out the season with his battle against the Chargers, he has no interest in doing so.
""I'm playing for pride and also playing for this locker room, and this brotherhood,"" the 26-year-old said.
I want to show up every time, and every time they need me, I just want to be there.""","""We got great news this morning after the MRI,"" Flournoy said on Monday, after being a limited participant in the team's walkthrough, and wearing a smile bright enough to challenge the sun itself. ""I was praying, and God has blessed me, in tremendous ways. We are working towards playing Thursday.

""I'm not giving up on the season, so I'm looking forward to playing this Thursday, if I can. I wanna play.""

The news made its way to the offensive meeting room ahead of practice, and head coach Brian Schottenheimer says it was met with everyone celebrating and several players beating on their desks and yelling to show their happiness for Flournoy, who readily admits he was afraid he'd be done for the season, and potentially the offseason program (and training camp?) after he felt something weird in his knee during the late hit.

""I was a little fearful — I was,"" he said. ""It's because of the way I got twisted up, I felt a little click and pop, and couldn't return to the game, and that hurt me. And I was like, 'Well, it's really serious,' but I got great news and I've been happy all day, for real.""

For Flournoy, football, and particularly his roster spot with the Cowboys, is so much bigger than the game itself, and that's what he's hoping to show on Christmas, and every game thereafter, for years to come. So while he could close out the season with his battle against the Chargers, he has no interest in doing so.

""I'm playing for pride and also playing for this locker room, and this brotherhood,"" the 26-year-old said. ""Being in the league, I've learned that some people are not going to be here next year, and I just want to go out and play with my brothers on this 2025 Cowboys team, two more times, and just have fun with them and just fight with them.

""Man, this brotherhood is special to me and just me being able to play for them.""

Far and away, this has been the best of Flournoy's two NFL seasons, in every category. The former sixth-round pick (2024) has already been active in 15 games (career-high) with three starts (career-high) and reeled in 407 receiving yards (career-high) on 35 receptions (career-high) with four touchdowns (career-high), and averages 11.6 yards per catch (career-high).

There's a theme there, certainly, and it's that the 2025 campaign, for Flournoy, is a career-high; and with so much promise on the horizon, and given his journey to get to this point — including a stint at Iowa Western Community College — don't count on him turning down on any rep awarded to him, regardless of the Cowboys' elimination from playoff contention.

Insert Mamba Mentality here.

""I feel like I established myself very well,"" he said. ""Job's not done, though. I still want to keep climbing and keep going, be consistent every time, and just be me. I want to show up every time, and every time they need me, I just want to be there.""

In the event Flournoy is not cleared for Christmas, he will have had roughly two weeks between the injury having occurred to the Cowboys' season finale against the New York Giants, meaning there's a great chance he'll at least have one more opportunity to finish his breakout season strong — something he was afraid wouldn't be possible just 24 short hours ago.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/xfjsopvnlvduas2jxqhv,N,,2025-12-22 23:59:07.184048

Without Buckner, the Colts pressured opposing quarterbacks on 30.8 percent of their dropbacks in Weeks 10-15, Per Pro Football Focus, 28th in the NFL. Buckner's 76.1 Pro Football Focus pass rush grade is the highest of any Colts player this season, and his 19 total pressures are fourth.

Week after week, key contributors are exiting games early, leaving managers scrambling for answers and contingency plans. As the NFL playoffs near finalization across the league, teams may begin prioritizing long-term health over short-term availability.

Below is a breakdown of the most impactful injuries from the weekend and what they could mean moving forward.

Key: Position Player, Team | Injury | Projected Return to Play

QB Lamar Jackson, Baltimore | Back | Timeline TBD

During Sunday night’s loss to the New England Patriots, Lamar Jackson was injured and later listed as questionable by the Baltimore Ravens with a back injury. After halftime, head coach John Harbaugh was coy when asked about Jackson’s status and wouldn't give a straight answer on whether his veteran quarterback would return. Shortly after, Jackson was ruled out.

By video, the injury appeared more consistent with a rib issue. It has been an injury-riddled season for Jackson. While Baltimore is not officially out of the playoff hunt, the team may take a cautious approach and consider shutting him down if his health continues to trend in the wrong direction.

RB TreVeyon Henderson, New England | Concussion | Projecting Week 18 Return

TreVeyon Henderson sustained a head injury in the second quarter of Sunday night’s game. After halftime, the team ruled the rookie running back out with a concussion.

Henderson will have a week to progress through the league’s concussion protocol, which is possible, but historically unlikely based on comparable cases.

RB Quinshon Judkins, Cleveland | Leg/Ankle | Season-Ending

Quinshon Judkins sustained a serious lower-body injury and had to be carted off the field. Postgame reports confirmed that the rookie running back suffered an ankle dislocation along with an associated fracture. As a result, Judkins’ 2025 season is over, but based on typical recovery timelines for this type of injury, he is expected to be ready for the 2026 season.

Key number 12 — The Vikings have won 12 straight games against opponents starting a rookie quarterback, the longest active streak in the NFL.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings must ask themselves this offseason how patient they can afford to be with quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who has shown his share of as-advertised winning traits and athletic talents but just as many alarming tendencies during this up-and-down debut.

How quickly the Vikings believe his mechanics can be improved and his consistency can increase might not matter as much as whether they feel he can be counted on to regularly take the field.

After hurting his throwing hand during Minnesota's victory over the New York Giants on Sunday, his fourth significant injury in two years, McCarthy was unable to play in the second half and is now uncertain to be healthy enough to play again this season. The Vikings host Detroit on Thursday, leaving only three full days to heal. They finish against Green Bay on Jan. 3 or 4.

“You would love to have him for two straight home games to finish, and we’ll see where his hand is at and if he has the ability to play for us again. I sure hope so,” coach Kevin O'Connell said.

The Vikings were off on Monday, with no update on McCarthy's status expected until Tuesday. The initial X-rays at the stadium showed no fracture, but further examination in Minnesota was planned.

After his entire rookie year was wiped out by a torn meniscus in his right knee, the 10th pick in the 2024 draft missed five games with a badly sprained right ankle and one more with a concussion.

McCarthy's hand appeared to hit a Giants defender's helmet two plays before his rushing touchdown on a head-first dive into the end zone after a third-down scramble. When McCarthy returned for the next series, he double-clutched on a screen pass before being leveled by unblocked edge rusher Brian Burns for the sack-fumble-touchdown trifecta. The pain in his hand was too severe to continue playing after that.

Not only have the injuries stunted McCarthy's development, but he can't be counted on to be a franchise quarterback if they keep occurring at this frequency.

""It's part of this game, and he’s a competitor. I think it’s something where he’s going to go out there and lay it on the line every single week,” O'Connell said.

What's working

The pass defense has been mostly impenetrable during the second half of the season. The Vikings have not allowed a passing touchdown in six straight games, tying New England (2018-19) for the longest streak in the league over the last 25 years.

Giants interim coach Mike Kafka was apparently concerned enough about rookie Jaxson Dart's ability to navigate the rush, coverage and disguises devised by Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores that only a handful of passing plays were called in the first half. Dart had just one completion before halftime, plus one interception. The 2.5 net yards per pass attempt for the Giants on Sunday was the lowest average in any game in the NFL this season, according to Sportradar.

What needs help

The Vikings have the eighth-most penalties in the league, after 11 flags went against them for 90 lost yards on Sunday in their fourth game this season with 10-plus infractions. Both Harrison Smith and Eric Wilson had third-down sacks erased by roughing-the-passer penalties, and Wilson's in the fourth quarter extended a drive the Giants finished with a field goal.

Stock up

Running back Aaron Jones injured his right ankle while being stopped for a loss on the second snap on Sunday, only to have sidekick Jordan Mason join him on the sideline just five plays later. The 31-year-old Jones gritted his way through the rest of the game with Mason unable to return, finishing with 85 yards on 21 carries, both season highs.

Stock down

McCarthy's high-velocity throws — the Vikings have tried to teach him to throttle down to match certain routes and coverages in a concept called layering — have been a challenge to catch. But drops have hindered an offense carrying a thin margin for error, and Jordan Addison has been the biggest culprit. He failed to secure a perfectly placed ball after landing in the end zone on a third-down pass from the 25-yard line on the opening drive, forcing the Vikings to settle for a field goal.

Injury report

The condition of McCarthy's right hand has become by far the most important matter of the shortened week, but the status of Mason and Jones will also bear watching.

The most concerning development was a return to the concussion protocol for center Ryan Kelly, who already spent seven weeks on injured reserve this season out of abundant caution toward his career history of head injuries.

“We’re all hoping and really just thinking about him,” O'Connell said. “Don’t have an official kind of diagnosis or anything, but any time anything like that happens, you have concerns.”

Defensive tackle Javon Hargrave didn't play on Sunday because of a thigh injury. Left tackle Christian Darrisaw, edge rusher Jonathan Greenard and safety Josh Metellus are all shut down for the season.

Key number

12 — The Vikings have won 12 straight games against opponents starting a rookie quarterback, the longest active streak in the NFL. Their last such loss was in 2018 to Buffalo with Josh Allen.

Up next

The Vikings (7-8) get the chance to be the Grinch on Christmas and eliminate the division rival Lions (8-7) from contention for the playoffs. A loss for the Lions would, coincidentally, clinch a spot for the Packers (9-5-1), their final opponent.

The Cardinals and Titans are two of four teams with a 3-12 record through Week 16, and strength of schedule is the tiebreaker.

That’s where New England’s Sunday Night Football victory over the Baltimore Ravens came into the picture, as that result improved Tennessee’s strength of schedule.

Arizona and Tennessee have the same opposing win percentage at .575. Their respective final two opponents also have the same records, so the SOS tiebreaker could be fluid over the next two weeks.

Even Monday Night Football could flip them, as a 49ers win over the Colts would drop Arizona back to sixth while an Indianapolis win would improve Tennessee’s strength of schedule.

The Athletic’s draft order model gave the Cardinals a 73% chance to finish with a top five pick after Sunday’s games.

The Cardinals lost 26-19 against the Atlanta Falcons, their seventh consecutive loss and 12th in the past 13 games. Arizona led 13-3 before the Falcons outscored the Cardinals 23-6 for the rest of the game.

Arizona visits the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams to end the season, a lame duck first game and possibly relevant finale, as the Rams jockey for playoff positioning in a juggernaut NFC.

Dolphins 6-9 (Buccaneers, Patriots)

This is a big week for the draft order, as the New York Giants visit the Las Vegas Raiders in a loser-likely-earns-the-top-pick showdown.

The Cleveland Browns host the Pittsburgh Steelers after playing the Buffalo Bills tough on Sunday (23-20 loss). Pittsburgh can win the AFC North with a victory.

The New York Jets have gotten blasted by 20-plus for three straight games and have the Patriots and Bills left on the schedule, so there’s not many reasons to expect much help there.

And the Titans have won two of their last three games and play the suddenly-frisky New Orleans Saints at home this week.

The Cardinals’ path to the top three appears to be to lose out and hope for a Browns win and either the Raiders or Giants to end the year with a couple garbage-time wins over non-playoff teams.

What does the latest mock draft say?

Pro Football Focus released a new mock draft on Monday, projecting the Cardinals go with offensive tackle Spencer Fano out of Utah with the No. 5 pick. Quarterbacks Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore flew off the board with the top two picks.

Quarterback remains a huge question mark for the Cardinals, but they don’t get the opportunity to address it in this mock draft.

On the Colts’ side, they have activated defensive tackle DeForest Buckner from injured reserve ahead of Monday night, with Brett Rypien waived as a corresponding move.

If at least one of Love or Willis is available at practice on Tuesday and Wednesday, worries can start to be mitigated.

It's certainly not what Green Bay wants right now with just two weeks remaining in the regular season.

There's still work to be done, and the Packers would surely prefer to do it with at least one of their reliable quarterbacks on the field.

,,2025-12-23 01:38:02+00:00,AP News,Ravens' Lamar Jackson forced out of game against Patriots with a back injury - AP News,"David Ginsburg, apnews.com, david-ginsburg",,,,,https://apnews.com/article/ravens-lamar-jackson-injury-patriots-db9ffe2e581a27d18cd4e61fca571543,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Lamar Jackson’s injury-plagued season has thrust Baltimore’s star quarterback to the sideline again.
Jackson sustained a back bruise in the second quarter of the Ravens’ 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday night.

And there’s no guarantee the two-time NFL MVP will get back on the field in 2025.

Jackson sustained a back bruise in the second quarter of the Ravens’ 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday night. After being kneed by safety Craig Woodson just after the two-minute warning, Jackson handed the ball off to Keaton Mitchell before shuffling to the sideline during a timeout.

He then hobbled into the tunnel and into the locker room, too sore to return in a game the Ravens desperately needed to win to stay in the thick of the playoff hunt.

“He couldn’t go,” coach John Harbaugh said. “If he could have gone, he would have gone.”

The loss dropped Baltimore (7-8) two games behind first-place Pittsburgh in the AFC North with two games to go.

The Ravens are no longer in control of their own destiny, and they have no idea if Jackson will be available to help keep their hopes alive with a victory in Green Bay next Saturday night.

“It’s a bruise of some kind. I don’t know how serious it will be,” Harbaugh said. “We’ll have to find out in the next couple days.”

Jackson is expected to receive a CT scan on Monday. He said he received a shot to ease the pain, but he still was unable to throw the ball effectively and without much discomfort.

It’s been that kind of season for Jackson, who last year finished second in the balloting for MVP and expected to carry the Ravens deep into the postseason in 2025.

Jackson missed three games earlier this season because of a hamstring injury, and since returning from that he’s been listed with knee, ankle and toe problems as well as an illness that caused him to miss a practice before facing the Patriots.

His absence contributed heavily to Baltimore’s 1-5 start. The Ravens regrouped upon his return and remained in control of their own destiny until they blew an 11-point lead in the fourth quarter against New England.

Backup quarterback Tyler Huntley went 9 for 10 for 65 yards, but the Ravens couldn’t maintain possession when it counted in the closing minutes while New England rallied from a 24-13 hole.

Huntley spoke with Jackson on the sideline during the second half, knowing the starter was depressed about being put in the position of giving advice rather than making something happen.

“He was bummed,” Huntley said, “Couldn’t barely move.”

Whether Jackson can return by next week is anyone’s guess.

“You know, you hate to see him like that,” Huntley said, “but I know he gonna be ready to get back out there when he’s ready.”

It’s tough to stay healthy as a quarterback in the NFL, and it’s even more difficult for a quarterback who likes to run the ball.

“It’s a physical game,” Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton noted. “Obviously he’s going to put his body on the line for us. You don’t get all the rushing accolades he gets without taking some hits. We all appreciate that. He plays really hard, and it sucks to see it happen to somebody like that.”

Unfortunately for the Ravens, their season has been defined by injuries, fumbles, untimely penalties and blown leads.

“It’s been a theme for the past couple years, honestly,” Hamilton said. “It’s frustrating at this point. It’s redundant.”

Two lost fumbles, seven penalties and a 380-yard passing performance by New England quarterback Drake Maye left Baltimore with a 3-6 record at home.

“Six losses at home?” Hamilton said. “That’s terrible.”

Allen did not miss a play during the game but did leave the field before halftime and had an X-ray done on his foot. He was cleared to return to the game.

When asked if he anticipated Allen being available for Sunday's game against the visiting Philadelphia Eagles, McDermott said, ""As far as I'm aware, yes.""

The coach added that Allen is sore, but that there were no setbacks and that he is not aware of any further testing needing to be done.

The injury may, however, impact Allen during the practice week.

""I don't know yet. There's a chance it does,"" McDermott said. ""We'll see. We're going to practice a little bit tomorrow based on availability. We've got a number of guys that are not going to be able to practice. We'll see how Josh shows up tomorrow and how he's feeling.""

Linebacker Shaq Thompson (neck), defensive tackle DaQuan Jones (calf) and safety Jordan Poyer (hamstring) are also day-to-day following injuries from the game.

Allen's injury took place on a sack that was ultimately credited to both Browns defenders Myles Garrett and Alex Wright. On second-and-1 from the Buffalo 23 with 1:09 remaining in the second quarter, Allen dropped back but was pressured quickly and ran around, ultimately going backward to try and avoid Browns defenders before falling to the ground.

Allen stayed on the field for a quick quarterback run up the middle on the following play but then walked to the locker room with athletic trainers before halftime, not wearing his right cleat.

After the game, Allen said, ""We're good,"" and that he ""tweaked my foot a little bit.""

TE Brock Wright (neck, IR) — Eligible to return in Week 18

OT Giovanni Manu (knee, IR) — Evaluation clock started

LB Zach Cunningham (hamstring, IR)

S Kerby Joseph (31) — (knee, IR) — Eligible to return in Divisional Round

Joseph was placed on injured reserve last Saturday, and with him not being eligible to return until the Divisional Round of the playoffs, his season is effectively over. The Lions have insisted that he’s been close to returning all season, but they’ve had a difficult time “calming down” his knee, so hopefully an offseason of rest will afford him a proper chance to heal up for 2026.

No practice

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee) — injured in Week 16

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

DB Avonte Maddox (back) — injured in Week 16

St. Brown played on 97% of offensive snaps in Week 16, but a knee injury kept him from an estimated practice on Monday. While this could be a precautionary measure, it’ll be worth monitoring his progress on a short week.

“We’ll know more a little bit later, but this is something that popped up when he came in today,” coach Dan Campbell said at his Monday press conference. “Hopeful that this is just some irritation from the game. That’s what I’m hoping, but I’ll know more later. I’ll know more tonight.”

Decker has routinely taken practices off ahead of games, and on a short week, it wouldn’t be surprising if he doesn’t practice much, if at all, leading up to this game.

Maddox injured his back against the Steelers, but he was able to finish the game, suggesting this could be a rest day for the veteran. However, because this soft-tissue injury likely popped up following the game, it’s worth monitoring.

Limited practice

C Graham Glasgow (knee) — upgraded from no practice

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula)

OL Trystan Colon (wrist)

OT Giovanni Manu (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 14

WR Tom Kennedy (abdomen) — injured in Week 16

DT Alim McNeill (abdomen) — injured in Week 16

EDGE Al-Quadin Muhammad (knee) — injured in Week 16

EDGE Marcus Davenport (shoulder) — Injured in Week 16

CB Amik Robertson (hand)

Glasgow missed the final two practices last week, then was ruled inactive and missed the game against the Steelers. Having to practice just 24 hours later is a challenging task, so it’s not surprising that the Lions are taking it easy with him to start the week. If he isn’t ready to play again this week, look for the Lions to turn to Trystan Colon (who also missed last week’s game due to injury) or Kingsley Eguakun, who started against the Steelers.

Mahogany was removed from injured reserve ahead of the Lions Week 16 game, and played a full complement of snaps, save four that were given to rookie Miles Frazier for developmental purposes. Mahogany was seen limping in the locker room post-game, so hopefully he’ll be able to rest up a bit and play through his discomfort. An estimated limited practice suggests he’ll have a chance to play this week.

Colon missed last week’s game with an injury, despite getting in some limited practices during the week. If he’s able to return to the active roster this week, he could challenge to start if Glasgow is once again unable to play.

Manu continues to work through his injury evaluation window, but the Lions are currently rostering 10 offensive linemen, so they’re not in a situation where they need to rush him back.

Kennedy, McNeill, and Muhammad all played a full complement of snaps in Week 16, yet each suffered a soft tissue injury, which likely would have limited their ability to practice on Monday. An estimated practice is a good sign that they’re in a good position to play this week, but their progress will be worth monitoring.

Davenport injured his shoulder against the Steelers and briefly needed to exit the game. Fortunately, he was cleared to return and was able to finish the game. He’s yet another monitoring situation.

Robertson was able to play in Week 16 with a club on his injured hand. However, he was limited to just 36% of defensive snaps, suggesting he will likely be limited moving forward until his hand heals up.

Vaki practiced in full last week and entered the game without an injury designation. He looks like he’s as healthy as he’s been all season.

Awosika practiced in full last week and did not carry an injury designation into the game, suggesting he was deemed a healthy scratch. If Mahogany’s injury doesn’t get better, Awosika could be back in the mix very quickly.

Harper was able to clear the NFL’s concussion protocols last week and played a full complement of snaps against the Steelers. This injury looks like it’s behind him.

McDermott shared the QB's foot is ""just sore"" and added that Allen's has not had any additional testing since the end of the game. Allen had X-rays at halftime in Cleveland but was cleared to return and did not miss an offensive snap in Week 16.

The expectation is that the injury will not impact Allen's availability for Week 17 against the Philadelphia Eagles.

However, McDermott is unsure if the injury will impact Allen's practice reps leading up to the game.

""Don't know yet, there's a chance it does. We'll see. We're going to practice a little bit tomorrow (Tuesday),"" he said. ""We'll see how Josh shows up tomorrow and how he's feeling.""

LB Shaq Thompson (neck), S Jordan Poyer (hamstring) and DT DaQuan Jones (calf) are all also listed as day-to-day.

With Christmas on Thursday, the Bills will be shifting their weekly schedule and holding their first practice of the week on Tuesday, typically a player off day. The Bills will then have Christmas Day off and hold the other two practices Wednesday and Friday.

PRACTICE SQUAD QB SIGNED TO CHIEFS ROSTER

Bills QB Shane Buechele was signed off the team's practice squad and onto the Kansas City Chiefs' active roster Monday afternoon. With Patrick Mahomes out with an ACL injury and backup Gardner Minshew injuring his knee on Sunday against Tennessee, Kansas City was in need of another QB for Week 17.

NFL teams are permitted to sign unprotected players off another team's practice squad under the condition that they are signed directly to the active roster. Teams are allowed to protect a maximum of 4 players on their practice squad from being signed elsewhere.

In this case, Buechele will now join the Chiefs' 53-man roster and could suit up as soon as Christmas Day when Kansas City hosts the Denver Broncos.

Buechele has been with the Bills since the start of the 2023 season, but was with the Chiefs (2021-22) for two seasons prior. Buechele has not attempted a regular pass in the NFL, but could be in line to do so with the Chiefs.

""More than anything, I'm happy for Shane. He and his family, they've been with us and done a phenomenal job. I have a ton of respect and love and admiration for Shane,"" McDermott shared.

McDermott added that ""we'll look into"" whether or not Buffalo wants to add another QB back to its practice squad this week.

FIRST THOUGHTS ON NEW VETERAN EDGE RUSHER

The Bills made an addition to their practice squad late last week, signing veteran DE Matthew Judon.

Judon has 72 career sacks since coming into the league in 2016 and the Bills are excited to get a player with as much experience as he has late in the season.

""We'll take a look at him this week and see where he's at and get him acclimated to kind of the way we do things and rock and roll from there,"" said DC Bobby Babich.

McDermott added that the Bills have a high ""level of respect"" for Judon and his career accomplishments.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/x6xjio7ztocdq11aqgge,N,,2025-12-22 19:03:30.013694

In addition to the Patriots clinching a playoff spot, a main headline from this matchup was Ravens star quarterback Lamar Jackson exiting in the second quarter with a back injury and not returning.

On Monday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh told reporters that Jackson has a back contusion -- or a bruise.

""Painful, certainly,"" Harbaugh said. ""Saw him in here getting treatment this morning and this afternoon, early. He's been classified as day-to-day on that, nothing beyond the contusion but I don't want to minimize the severity and pain level of that, because it's legit.""

Jackson struggled to walk out of the locker room after speaking with reporters, according to the Ravens' official website. The two-time MVP was injured on a designed run when he took a knee to the back from Patriots safety Craig Woodson. After the game, Jackson admitted his frustrations about being unable to re-enter the game.

""It's BS, bro,"" Jackson said. ""I can't control that. I'm on the ground. I'm down. I gave myself up. I got kneed in the back. ... [I'm] getting injured, and then we're fighting for a chance to make the playoffs. I can't finish the game with my guys. It's BS.""

Jackson said that he felt like the game was in the Ravens' favor when he got hurt. Jackson had completed 7 of 10 passes for 101 yards before exiting. He was injured right before the Ravens tied the game 10-10 with a field goal with 1:03 remaining in the first half. Tyler Huntley replaced Jackson under center, and completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards. Baltimore had a 24-13 lead early in the fourth quarter before the Patriots stormed back to win with two touchdowns in the final nine minutes.

""My legs felt great. I just got kneed in the back in the red zone. I just couldn't finish the game. I was trying. I [got] a Toradol shot and stuff like that, but it still didn't get [any] better,"" Jackson said. ""Pain. It hurts. [It] hurts.""

More tests will be completed, but Jackson hopes to start against the Green Bay Packers next Saturday in what is a must-win game for Baltimore. Even if Jackson starts, the Ravens haven't looked like the offensive juggernaut the NFL world has come to know in recent years. Jackson has accounted for just nine total touchdowns and seven turnovers while averaging 21.8 rushing yards per contest over the past eight games while dealing with an array of injuries. This season marks the first time Jackson has lost six games as a starter -- and Sunday marked his first career loss in Week 15 or later.

The best thing you can do at this point if you endure an injury to a starter is weigh all your options and be vigilant on the waiver wire. It was another rough week in terms of injuries to some key players, so let's go over everything from Week 16 and look ahead to Week 17 — likely your fantasy title matchup.

Lamar Jackson, QB, Ravens (back): Jackson was unable to play in the second half of Sunday night's loss to the Patriots. He's considered day-to-day with a back contusion but is hopeful to play on Saturday vs. the Packers, per NFL Network. This is big going into the fantasy championship round. Jackson would be up against a tough Green Bay defense and is pretty banged up. Plus, he hadn't been instilling much confidence in fantasy managers lately, scoring fewer than 20 fantasy points in five of the past six games. Monitor his practices this week but know Jackson is a risky option at QB. If he can't go, it would be Tyler Huntley starting.

Josh Allen, QB, Bills (foot): Allen is considered day-to-day, per head coach Sean McDermott. It doesn't appear Allen is in danger of missing Week 17 vs. the Eagles on Sunday but this news will be worth monitoring. Buffalo still has an outside shot at winning the AFC East and there are seeding implications. Allen is coming off his worst fantasy output since 2018, when he was a rookie, scoring just 6.9 fantasy points against the Browns in Week 16.

TreVeyon Henderson, RB, Patriots (head): Henderson sustained a head injury early in Sunday night's win over the Ravens. As a result, Rhamondre Stevenson got 10 touches and totaled 78 yards with a touchdown. It's a tough spot for Henderson managers who were just seeing his potential in the second half of the schedule. If Henderson is unable to to play in Week 17, Stevenson becomes an appealing RB2 play in a smash spot against the Jets. Remember, the Patriots are still vying for the AFC East title with the Bills and jockeying for playoff seeding in the conference.

Quinshon Judkins, RB, Browns (leg/knee): The Browns rookie RB suffered an injury no one should have to suffer. Not only did Judkins break his leg, but also sustained a dislocated ankle. With his season over, you may be down a starting RB for your title game. Raheim Sanders had 11 carries for 42 yards, while Trayveon Williams had four catches for 38 yards on Sunday against the Bills. If Dylan Sampson (hand/calf) can get healthy for Week 17, he could lead the backfield against the Steelers. It will be tough to trust any of these backs with a title on the line.

Advertisement

Jordan Love, QB, Packers (concussion): Love exited Week 16 early against the Bears due to a concussion. He'll end up in concussion protocol and it's unclear if he'll be ready for Week 17 against the Ravens on Saturday night. Malik Willis had 121 yards and a TD plus 44 rushing yards in relief, but he's also dealing with a shoulder injury and could miss the Baltimore game. Head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters Sunday that Josh Jacobs and Jayden Reed are emergency QBs. You'd think someone will get promoted from the practice squad or signed; Clayton Tune the likely candidate. We'll be monitoring this situation closely this week.

J.J. McCarthy, QB, Vikings (hand): McCarthy was forced to exit Sunday's win over the Giants due to a hand injury and was replaced by Max Brosmer. McCarthy's X-Rays came back negative and the QB is considered day-to-day. The Vikings have a short week, facing the Lions on Christmas Day on Thursday.

Davante Adams, WR, Rams (hamstring): Adams missed TNF against the Seahawks in Week 16 but will have a chance to get back on the field with additional rest with the Rams facing the Falcons on MNF in Week 17. With Adams out, Puka Nacua went off for a 12-225-2 line while L.A.'s three TEs were heavily involved. If Adams can get back on the field, it's a great spot for the fantasy championship. If Adams remains out, Nacua could see another 15+ targets.

Rashee Rice, WR, Chiefs (concussion): Rice was a late addition to the injury report prior to Week 16 and was inactive. The Chiefs are now down Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew at QB (seemingly both to torn ACLs). It looks like K.C. is going to start Chris Oladokun at QB the rest of the way, which doesn't bode well for the passing game. Even if Rice can get back, it's going to be tough to trust him in a title game against the Broncos.

Jordan Mason, RB, Vikings (ankle): Mason left early vs. the Giants in Week 16 and Aaron Jones Sr. took over the backfield. Mason finished with three touches and that resulted in Jones getting 23 for a total of 93 yards. If Mason is out on Thursday against Detroit, Jones gets a boost in fantasy value for the final round.

The Cincinnati Bengals sent a reminder of what their offense and team can look like playing to their full potential. The tunnel between the field and locker room inside Hard Rock Stadium featured Ja’Marr Chase loudly joking with team vice president Paul Brown. Coach Zac Taylor shared a story with Mike Gesicki about his touchdown pass while chatting in a doorway.

Then there was the wide, bright smile of Tee Higgins.

The 26-year-old cheat code, who posted two more contested catches on the head of 5-foot-11 cornerback Jack Jones on Sunday, just set off the Bengals’ bittersweet offensive symphony.

“There was a lot of laughs and jokes on the sideline,” Higgins said. “That’s all you can ask for.”

In fact, it’s all he prayed for.

His contagious smile came from a different place than many others this week. Just three days ago, Higgins was flying to Pittsburgh to meet with one of the top concussion specialists in the NFL. The decision came with advice from the Bengals’ front office that their star receiver gain the highest level of expertise about what to do with a series of concussions that turned an ugly year on the field for the Bengals into a scary one off of it for Higgins.

There’s no real preparation for sitting on a flight to find out if your brain is OK.

“Obviously, I was very anxious and nervous about what they were going to say,” Higgins admitted, speaking on what went through his head on the trip. “Honestly, praying I come here and get positive news and come back with positive news to tell the team.”

He eventually got just that and something else.

“I got peace of mind,” he said.

Higgins suffered a concussion on Nov. 23 against New England and, consequently, was inactive the following Thursday against Baltimore. He returned the next game in Buffalo, where he banged his head on the turf twice, passed tests in the blue tent twice in that game to return, only to feel symptoms after the game and go back into concussion protocol. He then missed last week’s game against Baltimore at home before taking the trip to see the specialist.

He suffered through headaches and sensitivity to light in recent weeks as he recovered.

“It’s been a tough road,” he said.

In addition to being cleared by the specialist, Higgins played with a new helmet for the first time Sunday. He said it showed up just in time to wear in the win against the Dolphins. The helmet comes with more padding and didn’t elicit any complaints from Higgins.

He certainly looked comfortable.

There he was, rising into the hot South Florida air, pulling down a 35-yard reception and a 9-yard touchdown pass to set the tone for the day.

He didn’t have to do any of this. The Bengals are 5-10 and eliminated from the postseason. Not a soul in the organization or locker room would have faulted him if he called this a season and didn’t worry about playing out the string, given what’s been going through his head.

Yet, what’s actually been going through his head was being a part of a day like Sunday, meaningless in the standings, but not in Higgins’ world.

“I’m a competitor, man,” Higgins said. “End of the day, I’m a competitor. I want to compete with my guys. That’s all it came down to.”

Higgins isn’t taking concussions lightly. The lengths he’s gone to ensure safety illustrate that. He spoke at length about the importance of anyone with concussion symptoms to step forward and report them, no matter what. This is not a young man without perspective.

He merely understands the importance of his presence and what team players do. They support their team. They take the field.

That’s why the Bengals shouldn’t have one iota of regret about paying Higgins. They need more players like him. Players who prove dedication to the team with actions and not words. In his case, his actions on the field change the entire dynamic of the Bengals’ offense.

Joe Burrow, on a day he went 25-of-32 passing for 309 yards and four touchdowns, witnessed it firsthand.

“That’s why Tee is who he is and why we value him so much; he just makes plays like that,” Burrow said. “They were pressuring a little bit early, and Tee makes those two plays, and then they can’t pressure as much. When they do, they have to play different coverages behind it, so that lets us get the ball out quickly in space. So it just started with those two for Tee … I think they had a plan, and then those two plays happened and they had to change their plan.”

There were many reasons the Bengals offense struggled in the two games without Higgins since Burrow came back and looked unstoppable in the two he’s played. He has always been the wild card that defensive coordinators can’t counter. There’s a demoralizing nature to watching him pluck explosive plays out of the air, no matter the coverage.

The Bengals know that. The entire show is built around Burrow, Chase and Higgins. On Sunday, those two set up the counter of Chase Brown running routes underneath, then drew coverage away on Gesicki’s touchdown up the seam. They kept light boxes for efficiency in the running game.

That’s how a team rips off 45 points in a little over three quarters.

“Offense was at full power today,” Higgins said. “We had everybody. You see what we can do when we have everybody together.”

The Bengals posted a gaudy 0.18 EPA/play the last two seasons on plays with Burrow, Chase and Higgins on the field together. For reference, the league leader over the last two years is the Bills at 0.14, and the league average is 0.00.

This trio, their connection and their mentality make everything work. Availability has been the only thing missing.

“He’s a soldier,” Chase said. “End of the day, I’m one of the guys that is going to make sure that I am picking him up and making sure he is ready to battle. We are both looking out for each other.”

They are all better together, as evidenced by Sunday’s output. Higgins went through an emotional journey to be part of it, so nobody was surprised to see that smile on his face. You’d better believe he was going to enjoy it.

“It was so fun out there,” Higgins said. “That’s all you can ask for. The game is fun.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/21200853/GettyImages-2253018056-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-22 18:04:34.080371

That's especially true this week, as we have a tripleheader on Christmas Day and two more games on Saturday ahead of the usual Sunday slate. And we only have two weeks of regular-season action remaining, making every bit of news all the more consequential.

Who's hurt? Who's practicing? Who's starting? Who's on the hot seat?

Here's the latest on what's happening around the league entering Week 17:

Ravens HC Harbaugh discusses future

The 2025 season has been challenging for the Baltmore Ravens and head coach John Harbaugh, with the team's latest setback coming in a narrow 28-24 Week 16 home loss to the Patriots.

On Monday, Harbaugh addressed questions regarding his job security for the first time this year with Baltimore (7-8) on the verge of missing the postseason. The longtime coach was open and honest about his outlook on the future, noting that he's only focused on the present and finishing each season strong.

""There’s no such thing as, like, ‘your job’ or ‘my job.' We have responsibilities, we’re given opportunities to steward those responsibilities when you’re given a job to do that, until you’re not,"" Harbaugh told reporters. ""I try to do the job, not try to keep the job. Because there’s no such thing as having a job — just doing a job.

""And so my focus is on always — it has been for the last 18 years here and the last 41 years in coaching — it’s been to try to do the best job I can today and fight as hard as I can, so the guys have the best chance to be successful today. And anything after today, I’m not thinking about, because it’s not given for us to think about. We don’t have control over that, except for the job we do today. If we do a good enough job today, then the opportunity to do that job or a different job will be there tomorrow. And that’s what you hope for.""

The Ravens are 179-112 in the regular season, with a 13-11 playoff record, since Harbaugh took the job in 2008. Harbaugh's Ravens will have the final two games to keep up with the first-place Steelers (9-6) in the NFC North. If they fall short, the questions will likely linger with the 2012 Super Bowl champion and former AP NFL Coach of the Year under contract through the 2028 season.

Latest on Lamar Jackson's back injury

The Ravens' playoff hopes are on thin ice, and they might not have their quarterback available when their season is on the line against the Packers on Saturday. Lamar Jackson will undergo an MRI on Monday after suffering a back injury that forced him to miss the second half of Baltimore's loss to New England, but he's hopeful he can play in Week 17.

""Yeah, that's the goal,"" Jackson told reporters. ""We're going to do a little [MRI] scan [Monday] and then see what it shows.""

Ravens head coach John Harbaugh later said that Jackson was dealing with ""a bruise of some kind.""

""I don't know how serious it'll be,"" Harbaugh said. ""We'll have to find out over the next couple of days.""

The Ravens must win each of their final two games and for the Steelers to lose at the Browns in Week 17 in order to make the postseason. At 7-8, winning the AFC North is the only way for Baltimore to make the playoffs for a fourth straight year.

Minshew's ACL intact, Chiefs sign QB Buechele

A week after losing star quarterback Patrick Mahomes for the remainder of the 2025 season with an ACL tear, the team feared that Gardner Minshew suffered the same injury that caused him to leave their loss to the Titans early on Sunday, ESPN reported. While Minshew's ACL turned out to be intact, he did suffer an injury all the same, and is expected to miss time, per ESPN. In response, the Chiefs have signed QB Shane Buechele.

Now, third-string Chris Oladokun is possibly in line to start in Thursday's game against the Broncos, as Minshew recovers and Buechele acclimates himself to the Chiefs. The fourth-year quarterback threw his first career pass in Sunday's loss to the Titans.

Buechele has never appeared in an NFL game, as his career in the league to this point has mostly been being waived and re-signed by the Buffalo Bills as part of their practice squad. The 27-year-old – Buechele turns 28 in early January – played quarterback in college for Texas and SMU from 2016 through 2020. His best season came as a junior with SMU, when he lead the American Conference with 34 touchdowns, 307 completions and 302.2 passing yards per game.

Derick Hall's suspension upheld

Seattle Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall had his one-game suspension for unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct upheld on Monday. Hall was suspended without pay for stepping on the leg of Los Angeles Rams guard Kevin Dotson at the end of a play in the Seahawks' 38-37 overtime win on Thursday night.

Hearing officer Ramon Foster, jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFLPA, upheld the suspension that was announced Friday. The NFL said Hall, 24, was in violation of Rule 12, Section 2, Article 8, which prohibits unnecessary roughness and Rule 12, Section 3, Article 1, which applies to unsportsmanlike conduct, including ""any act which is contrary to the generally understood principles of sportsmanship.""

Hall will be eligible to return on Dec. 29, a day after Seattle’s game against the Carolina Panthers.

The third-year pro out of Auburn was selected 37th by the Seahawks in the 2023 NFL draft. He has appeared in 13 games and started three for Seattle this season. He has 29 total tackles and one sack.

Packers monitoring health of both QBs ahead of Ravens matchup

As for who the Ravens' Week 17 opponent, the Packers might also be shorthanded at quarterback for Saturday's game. Jordan Love left Saturday's loss to the Bears early after entering the league's concussion protocol, while backup Malik Willis hurt his throwing shoulder in the fourth quarter. Willis remained in the game, but he was fighting through some pain after the game.

""I'd say he's pretty sore,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur told reporters of Willis on Sunday. ""That's a legitimate deal that he's dealing with, and he's going to be another guy that we'll see where he's at as we progress. That further complicates the other problem.""

Love, meanwhile, will have to spend the week clearing concussion protocol in order to play on Saturday.

""That's a process that takes multiple days to get through,"" LaFleur told reporters.

The Packers fell to 9-5-1 with Saturday's loss, putting their hopes of winning the NFC North in peril. They'll need to win out and for the Bears to lose their final two games in order to win the division. Green Bay also hasn't clinched a playoff spot yet. However, it'll make the playoffs if it wins one of its final two games or if the Lions lose once in the final two weeks.

Jets to start rookie Brady Cook at QB for final two games

The Jets are sticking with Brady Cook at quarterback for the rest of the 2025 regular season, head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters on Monday. With the Jets starting Cook for the final two games, the undrafted rookie could play a big role in the AFC East race as the Jets take on the Patriots and Bills in Weeks 17 and 18, respectively.

Cook has started the last two games for the Jets following Tyrod Taylor's injury. He's thrown for 527 yards, a touchdown and six interceptions over the three games he's played this season.

Commanders sign practice squad QB amid Marcus Mariota uncertainty

The Commanders have signed quarterback Jeff Driskel off the Cardinals' practice squad, the team announced Monday. The move might be an indication that Marcus Mariota won't be able to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys after leaving Saturday's game against the Eagles early with injuries to his throwing hand and quad.

If Mariota can't go, journeyman quarterback Joshua Johnson would be in line to start against the Cowboys.

The Buffalo Bills escaped the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, but the win came with injuries to several veteran contributors signed in the offseason on one-year deals.

Linebacker Shaq Thompson, 31, exited early with a neck injury and safety Jordan Poyer, 34, suffered a hamstring injury late in the fourth quarter. Kicker Matt Prater, 41, missed his first game of the year with a quadriceps injury, and defensive tackle Jordan Phillips, 33, was sidelined with an ankle injury.

With Thompson out, the Browns ran for 160 yards at 5.2 yards per carry despite being without their top two rookie running backs. Quinshon Jenkins was carted off in the second quarter with a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle, and Dylan Sampson was inactive due to a hand injury.

Prater was unavailable after suffering the quad injury in Week 15, prompting the Bills to sign Michael Badgley as a replacement. Badgley missed an extra point and failed to reach the landing zone on one kickoff.

The Bills (11–4) host the Philadelphia Eagles (10–5) at 4:25 p.m. Sunday.

NFL teams have to submit a report on practice participation on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for a Sunday game. There are three levels of practice participation that can be designated: did not participate, limited participation and full participation.

A game status report is due by 4 p.m. Friday for Sunday games.

Here is the Bills vs. Eagles injury report for Week 17:

Buffalo Bills injury update for Week 17

Shaq Thompson, LB, neck

Shaq Thompson started at linebacker but left in the first quarter with a neck injury in the win over the Browns.

Thompson was hurt while making a tackle on tight end Harold Fannin Jr. He was tended to by trainers on the field before walking off under his own power. Thompson went into the blue medical tent and was listed as questionable to return. He stood on the sideline with his helmet on but did not return to the game.

Thompson has 52 tackles, one sack and one forced fumble in 11 games in 2025.

Josh Allen, QB, foot

Josh Allen hurt his right foot while retreating and falling to the ground on a 22-yard sack in the victory against the Browns.

Allen limped off the field and was evaluated by athletic trainers as he sat on the bench late in the second quarter. He walked to the locker room with trainers just prior to halftime with his right cleat off and received X-rays, which were negative. Allen returned to for the second half and did not miss any plays.

""Just tweaked my foot a little bit,"" Allen said in his postgame press conference. ""Just flamed up on me a little bit. Pain subsided, so we're good.""

Allen was asked by CBS sideline report Evan Washburn how his foot felt after the game.

""We're gravy, baby,"" Allen smiled. ""It's all good. Go Bills.""

Jordan Poyer, S, hamstring

Jordan Poyer suffered a hamstring injury while recording a half-sack on Shedeur Sanders late in the fourth quarter against the Browns. He came off the field for the Bills' final two defensive snaps of the game.

Phillips stayed down on the field after a 9-yard run by TreVeyon Henderson in the second quarter. He was able to get to his feet and walk off under his own power. He went into the blue medical tent and the locker room for further evaluation and did not return. Phillips had a boot on his right foot in the locker room after the game.

The 11-year veteran has nine tackles and one sack in 10 games in 2025.

Terrel Bernard, LB, elbow

Terrel Bernard was back in Week 16's victory against the Browns after missing three games with a dislocated elbow.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Jackson is out for the rest of the season.

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Ed Oliver suffered a torn biceps injury which will require surgery and is out indefinitely. He was placed on on injured reserve on Oct. 28 and is eligible to return in Week 13.

Oliver was hurt in the second quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

Oliver is tied for the team lead with three sacks despite only plying in three of the Bills' seven games.

He missed four games earlier this season (Weeks 2-5) with an ankle injury after he got stepped on in practice on Sept. 10.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Oliver could potentially return for the playoffs.

Taylor Rapp, S, knee

He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

Matt Prater, 41, signed to the Bills practice squad, was elevated for Week 1 and made a 32-yard game-winning field goal with no time left to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 41-40 in Week 1. Prater has since been signed to the active roster and is 10-for-11 on field goals and 17-for-17 on extra points through six games.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Bass underwent season-ending surgery in November.

Cameron Johnston, P, foot/ankle

Cameron Johnston suffered left foot and ankle injuries after taking a hit to his left plant leg on a punt in the fourth quarter in the Week 4 win over the Saints. The Bills placed him on injured reserve on Sept. 30 and signed punter Mitch Wishnowsky.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Dorian Strong, CB, neck

Dorian Strong played in four games with one start before suffering a neck injury and being placed on injured reserve on Oct. 4. The rookie sixth-round pick was eligible to return in Week 10.

Damar Hamlin, S, pectoral

Damar Hamlin suffered pectoral injury in practice Oct. 9 and was placed on injured reserve.

He was eligible to return in Week 11, although Bills coach Sean McDermott said it's ""up in the air"" if Hamlin's injury is season-ending.

Hamlin started 14 games in 2024 but has played a reserve role this year with Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp as the starting safeties. He has one tackle in five games.

DeWayne Carter, DT, Achilles

DeWayne Carter suffered a torn Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.

Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, recorded 14 tackles, five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits and a pass defended in 11 games last year.

Chase Lundt, OT, knee

Chase Lundt, a rookie sixth-round pick, was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 19. Lundt has appeared in two games, with three offensive snaps and five special teams snaps, in 2025.

Wande Owens, S, undisclosed

The undrafted rookie was waived Aug. 23 with an injury designation and went unclaimed on waivers.

Philadelphia Eagles injury update for Week 17

Nakobe Dean, LB, hamstring

Nakobe Dean left with a hamstring injury while making a tackle in the first quarter in the win against the Washington Commanders in Week 16. He was initially listed as questionable to return but was later downgraded to out.

He finished 3 of 8 passing for 15 yards before heading to the locker room early in the second quarter.
Reports surfaced after the game that Minshew likely tore his ACL.
• Marcus Harris (Idaho), a rookie cornerback for Tennessee, exited in the second quarter with a knee injury and did not return.
Thompson, an 85-game starter over the past seven years with the Cardinals, started the first 13 games of this season before suffering the injury.","Cam Ward had arguably his best game of the year. Gardner Minshew had one of the most unfortunate days of his career.

Sunday’s matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tennessee Titans pitted former Washington State quarterbacks against each other. The rookie for Tennessee looked sharp, guiding his team to a 26-9 home win over the Chiefs. On the other side, Minshew’s day ended early due to a serious injury.

The veteran quarterback was filling in for star Patrick Mahomes, who tore his ACL last week during a loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. Minshew scrambled on the third play of the game against Tennessee and fell with what appeared to be a noncontact injury. He grabbed at his left knee and hobbled after he got to his feet.

Minshew attempted to stay in the game, but looked uncomfortable. He finished 3 of 8 passing for 15 yards before heading to the locker room early in the second quarter. Reports surfaced after the game that Minshew likely tore his ACL.

A seventh-year pro in his first season with the Chiefs, Minshew was making his 47th career start and first since last season, when he started nine games for Las Vegas before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury.

WSU fans were no doubt eager to see the program legend, a show-stealing phenomenon during the Cougs’ 11-win season in 2018, get his opportunity to reintroduce “Minshew Mania” on the NFL stage and square off with a young QB who also made his name on the Palouse.

After Minshew went down, Ward captured the spotlight. He completed 21 of 28 passes for 228 yards and two touchdowns with no turnovers, picking up his third NFL win with his most efficient passing performance of the season. Ward was Pro Football Focus’ highest-graded player of the game (80.3).

Ward led long scoring drives late in the second quarter and early in the third, capping them with short TD passes, to put Tennessee up 16-6. He connected with Elic Ayomanor for a key 24-yard gain on a third down early in the fourth to set up a rushing touchdown that extended the Titans’ lead to 23-9 and effectively put the game away.

Ward, who became an NFL prospect during his time at WSU (2022-23) before finishing his career at Miami, has shown some promise while toiling through a difficult rookie season. The No. 1 overall draft pick has thrown for 2,866 yards and 13 touchdowns with seven interceptions on a 60.2% completion rate. He’s taken 51 sacks, second most in the league.

Sunday’s matchup was the first NFL game to feature former Cougars starting at QB on both sides since 1992, when a Mark Rypien-led Washington team beat Timm Rosenbach’s Phoenix Cardinals.

• Jaylen Watson (WSU), a starting cornerback for Kansas City, recorded two stops in the run game, but allowed a couple of big receptions.

Watson finished with seven tackles (three solo), assisting on a tackle for loss early in the fourth quarter and making a tackle to limit a run play to 2 yards on that same drive. Moments later, he surrendered a 24-yard reception to Ayomanor, who also caught a 25-yarder on Watson earlier in the game.

For the season, Watson has a career-high 64 tackles, two interceptions and two sacks. The fourth-year pro, a seventh-round draft pick in 2022, has started every game this season.

• Jaden Hicks (WSU) appeared on 17 defensive snaps off the bench for the Chiefs at strong safety, per PFF, and recorded four tackles.

Two of his stops came at the line of scrimmage. The second-year pro allowed two catches for 24 yards.

• Marcus Harris (Idaho), a rookie cornerback for Tennessee, exited in the second quarter with a knee injury and did not return.

A sixth-round draft pick this year, Harris had started the past four games, carving out a key role at the nickel corner position. He played 16 snaps Sunday before the injury, logging one tackle. Harris didn’t allow a catch.

• Kyle Williams (WSU), a rookie receiver for New England, caught a momentum-swinging touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter, helping the Patriots rally to a 28-24 win over Baltimore.

Williams beat his defender off the line on a vertical route and hauled in a high-arching pass just inside the pylon for a 37-yard touchdown, his third scoring catch as a pro.

Williams finished with 46 yards on two catches and totaled 89 yards on three kick returns with a long of 36 yards.

• Christian Elliss (Idaho), an inside linebacker for the Patriots, registered five tackles.

The fifth-year pro made his 11th start in 13 games this season. Elliss ranks second on the team with 81 tackles.

• Daiyan Henley (WSU), an inside linebacker for the Los Angeles Chargers, totaled six tackles (four solo) during their 34-17 win over Dallas.

Henley surrendered four catches on short routes for 40 yards, per PFF.

The third-year pro, an L.A. team captain, leads the Chargers this season with 92 tackles.

• Chau Smith-Wade (WSU), a cornerback for Carolina, came off the bench to play in 50 of 64 defensive snaps at the nickel position during the Panthers’ 23-20 win over Tampa Bay.

Smith-Wade, a fifth-round draft pick in 2024, finished with five tackles (three solo). He gave up three catches for 23 yards, according to a PFF report, but Smith-Wade also appeared to be responsible for Emeka Egbuka getting open for a 40-yard reception in the fourth quarter.

• Kaden Elliss (Idaho), a captain at linebacker for Atlanta, tallied four tackles (one solo) during the Falcons’ 26-19 win over Arizona.

The seventh-year vet has a team-high 98 tackles on the season.

• Ryan Rehkow (Central Valley) averaged 52 yards on four punts for Cincinnati during its 45-21 win over Miami.

The BYU grad, the NFL’s leader in punting average (51.3), placed each of his punts inside the Dolphins’ 20-yard line.

• Jalen Thompson (WSU), a longtime starter at strong safety for Arizona, missed his second game in a row as he recovers from a hamstring injury.

After a frightening hit late in the game, Bryant was immobilized and carted off the field.

His neck was stabilized, leaving teammates and fans anxiously awaiting an update.

After several tense hours of uncertainty, the news that followed brought widespread relief.

ESPN noted that Bryant was discharged from the hospital after suffering a concussion, but he avoided any serious or long-term injury.

Sources told ESPN that the rookie was cleared of neck and neurological injuries after undergoing testing.

Doctors diagnosed a concussion and nothing more.

9NEWS’ Mike Klis added that Bryant had movement in his hands and legs, an enormous relief after a moment that left both sidelines and the entire NFL community shaken.

“You never want to see somebody in that situation, and I feel responsible because I threw it,” Broncos quarterback Bo Nix said after the game.

“You can say it’s part of the game, but you just never want to see it. I really pray he’s OK.”

A Frightening Scene Late Against Jacksonville

Bryant’s injury occurred with just 41 seconds remaining in Denver’s 34-20 loss.

Nix delivered an 11-yard completion over the middle, where Bryant was met by Jaguars cornerback Montaric Brown.

The collision immediately stopped the game.

Bryant stayed down as trainers rushed onto the field, players from both teams took a knee, and his facemask was removed.

He was immobilized on a backboard, carted off the field, and later transported to a local hospital by ambulance.

Officials ruled the hit legal, with referee Shawn Hochuli explaining the contact was not to the head or neck area.

“Obviously very scary,” Broncos tackle Mike McGlinchey said afterward.

Courtland Sutton echoed that sentiment:

“You never want to see one of your brothers go down,” Sutton said.“He plays with great effort and great character. He’s a great dude.”

What Comes Next for Bryant and the Broncos

Now comes the recovery process.

Bryant will enter the NFL’s concussion protocol.

His future availability dependent on how quickly he progresses through the stages.

Head coach Sean Payton said after the game that Bryant had movement in all extremities, a crucial sign that he avoided a serious injury.

Given the circumstances, the Broncos will take a cautious approach, prioritizing Bryant’s health over any short-term availability.

Denver travels to face the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night in four days, so it is almost certain that Bryant will miss that game.

But the main focus remains on Bryant’s long-term well-being.

It was a huge relief that he escaped with only a concussion and avoided any career-altering injury.

After one of the scariest moments of Denver’s season, we can all now take one big sigh of relief.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2253055208_4b30ad.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-22 18:05:08.803272

Whereas linebacker Robert Spillane was already declared out for the game with an ankle injury, four other starters were labeled as questionable.

However, all of them have been cleared for the Patriots’ matchup with the Baltimore Ravens: defensive tackle Christian Barmore (knee), linebacker Harold Landry (knee) and cornerbacks Carlton Davis (hip) and Marcus Jones (knee) all were given the green light ahead of Sunday Night Football.

Crucial players to the Patriots’ defensive operation, all four of them missed practice time this week. Landry, Davis and Jones were all DNPs on Wednesday and Thursday before a return in limited capacity on Friday. Barmore, meanwhile, was limited Wednesday for non-injury related reasons, a full participant on Friday, and eventually absent Friday.

Both Davis and Jones suggested on Friday that they would be good to go for the prime time game in Baltimore.

The Patriots’ inactives, meanwhile, looks as follows.

The only player already ruled out before the contest, the aforementioned Robert Spillane will effectively miss a second straight game due to injury.

The 30-year-old suffered what was originally labeled a foot injury ahead of New England’s loss to the Buffalo Bills last week, but despite being made active for the contest remained on the sideline as an emergency-only option. Now, he is officially on the inactives list in a game for the first time since the 2022 season.

Goff threw a fourth-down pass to St Brown just short of the goal line. The receiver pushed off cornerback Jalen Ramsey to get free, and before the Steelers could bring St Brown to the ground, he threw the quarterback a lateral to set up an apparent score.

Officials huddled for some time on the field before announcing the decision to the dismay of the crowd.

Jaylen Warren had two 45-yard touchdown runs in the fourth quarter and finished with a career-high 143 yards for the Steelers, who had a 230-15 advantage in rushing yards.

The AFC North-leading Steelers (9-6) have won three straight after a midseason slump, surging into the division lead with two games remaining.

Kansas City Chiefs 9-26 Tennessee Titans

Cam Ward threw for 228 yards and two touchdowns, and the Tennessee Titans snapped an 11-game home skid by beating the Kansas City Chiefs 26-9 on Sunday.

The Titans (3-12) improved to 1-7 at home this season with their first win at Nissan Stadium since 3 November 2024. The skid matched the franchise’s worst since moving to Tennessee in 1997.

With two games left, the Chiefs (6-9) are assured of their first losing record since 2012 – their most recent season without Andy Reid as their coach. Kansas City have lost four straight, their longest skid since 2017, and six of seven.

A week after Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL, his backup, Gardner Minshew, was knocked out of the game with a knee injury early in the second quarter.

Ward posted his highest passer rating of this season at 122.3, and he overtook Marcus Mariota for the most yards passing by a rookie for the franchise. He helped the Titans roll up a season-high 377 yards of offense against a Chiefs defense that came in as the NFL’s eighth-stingiest in yards allowed.

The rookie threw a shovel pass to Chig Okonkwo that went seven yards to put the Titans ahead to stay late in the first half. Ward also found fellow rookie Chimere Dike for a 1-yard TD in the third quarter.

Minnesota Vikings 16-13 New York Giants

JJ McCarthy ran for a touchdown before leaving with an injury to his right, throwing hand, and backup quarterback Max Brosmer helped the Minnesota Vikings win their third game in a row, beating the New York Giants 16-13 on Sunday in a matchup of teams eliminated from playoff contention.

McCarthy was injured on a strip sack by Brian Burns in the final minute of the first half, when it appeared the Vikings (7-8) were going to let the clock run out. Instead, Burns forced McCarthy to fumble with a crushing hit and Tyler Nubin returned it 27 yards for a touchdown.

Brosmer led a go-ahead scoring drive in the fourth quarter that ended with Will Reichard making a 30-yard field goal. The rookie completed 7 of 9 passes for 52 yards in his fourth NFL appearance and first since throwing four interceptions 30 November in a 26-0 loss at Seattle.

Before getting hurt, McCarthy completed 9 of 14 passes for 108 yards and had a would-be pick-6 negated by an offside penalty on Abdul Carter. After having his entire rookie year wiped out by a torn meniscus in his right knee, the 2024 No 10 pick has missed time this season because of a concussion and a sprained right ankle.

The Giants (2-13) lost their ninth consecutive game and fifth since Mike Kafka took over as interim coach when Brian Daboll was fired on 10 November. They have not won since 9 October.

Los Angeles Chargers 34-17 Dallas Cowboys

Justin Herbert threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score and the Los Angeles Chargers closed in on a playoff spot with a 34-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.

The Chargers’ fourth consecutive victory gave them a chance later in the day to clinch their second postseason berth in two seasons under coach Jim Harbaugh. LA (11-4) would be in with a loss or tie by either Indianapolis or Houston.

Dak Prescott had TD passes on his first two drives but couldn’t find the end zone again for Dallas, which was eliminated from the playoffs for the second year in a row with Philadelphia’s NFC East-clinching victory at Washington on Saturday.

The Cowboys (6-8-1) have lost three in a row since a three-game winning streak that put them over .500 for the only time in coach Brian Schottenheimer’s first season.

In his third full game with his broken non-throwing (left) hand heavily protected, Herbert led the Chargers to touchdowns on all three drives in the first half. Omarion Hampton scored on a five-yard run in the second half.

Buffalo Bills 23-20 Cleveland Browns

James Cook rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns, Josh Allen played through a foot injury and the Buffalo Bills drew closer to a playoff berth with a 23-20 victory over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.

Ty Johnson also had a rushing score for the Bills (11-4), who have won four straight and five of six.

Allen played the second half despite injuring his right foot during the second quarter.

The reigning NFL MVP was favoring the foot after being sacked by Cleveland’s Myles Garrett and Alex Wright for a 22-yard loss to Buffalo’s one-yard line with 60 seconds remaining in the first half. The half-sack gave Garrett 22 on the season. He needs one more sack in the final two games for the Browns (3-12) to pass Michael Strahan and TJ Watt for the single-season mark.

Allen was 12 of 19 for 130 yards and also rushed for 17 yards on seven carries.

New York Jets 6-29 New Orleans Saints

Chris Olave caught touchdown passes from Tyler Shough and Taysom Hill, Charlie Smyth tied a Saints record with five field goals and New Orleans extended their winning streak to three with a 29-6 victory over the reeling New York Jets on Sunday.

Cameron Jordan had two sacks for New Orleans (5-10), giving him 130 for his career and moving the 15th-year defensive end two ahead of Hall of Famer Rickey Jackson for 17th most in NFL history. Jordan, now with a team-high 8 1/2 sacks this season, has had at least eight sacks in nine seasons.

Shough, drafted 40th overall last spring, passed for 308 yards to eclipse 300 for the first time while improving to 4-3 as a starter. Hill accounted for 116 yards with 42 rushing, 36 receiving and his 38-yard scoring pass to Olave in the final minutes.

Undrafted rookie Brady Cook made his second start with the Jets (3-12), who’ve lost three straight and five of six.

Cook was sacked eight times. He lost a fumble when ex-Jet Nathan Shepherd flattened him and defensive end Chase Young recovered, leading to Smyth’s 50-yard field goal. Cook also was intercepted by rookie safety Jonas Sanker on a fourth-down play in the fourth quarter, leading to Smyth’s final field goal from 39 yards.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20-23 Carolina Panthers

Bryce Young threw for 191 yards and two touchdowns, Lathan Ransom intercepted Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left and the Carolina Panthers beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23-20 on Sunday to take over first place in the NFC South.

The Panthers (8-7) can wrap up with the division title next Sunday with a win over Seattle and a Buccaneers (7-8) loss to Miami. However, if both teams win or both teams lose, the Panthers would need to beat Tampa Bay again on the road in Week 18 to claim their first division title since 2015.

Tetairoa McMillan had six catches for 73 yards and a touchdown as the Panthers once again bounced back with a huge win after a potentially devastating loss to the last-place New Orleans Saints.

Ransom had a huge mistake in that defeat with a late hit on Saints QB Tyler Shough that led to New Orleans’ winning field goal.

But with the Bucs driving for a tying field goal – or a go-ahead touchdown – there was a miscommunication on a second-and-9 pass play between Mayfield and Mike Evans at the Carolina 42 and Ransom got an easy pick to seal the win.

Cincinnati Bengals 45-21 Miami Dolphins

Joe Burrow rebounded from his first time being shut out to throw for 309 yards and four touchdowns as the Cincinnati Bengals routed the Miami Dolphins 45-21 on Sunday.

Miami (6-9) and Cincinnati (5-10) were both eliminated from playoff contention last week, but the teams insisted they were still motivated for the final three games of the season.

It appeared that way in the first half. Cincinnati held a 17-14 halftime lead before blowing the game open with 28 points off four straight Dolphins turnovers.

Burrow carved up Miami’s defense, completing 25 of 32 throws with a 146.5 passer rating before being replaced by veteran Joe Flacco early in the fourth quarter. Two of Burrow’s touchdown passes went to running back Chase Brown, from 9 and 5 yards out. Brown, who finished with 66 yards rushing and 43 receiving, also had a 12-yard touchdown run. All of Brown’s TDs came in the third, making him the first player this season with three scores in a single quarter.

Ja’Marr Chase caught nine passes for 109 yards.

Jacksonville Jaguars 34-20 Denver Broncos

Trevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score, leading the Jacksonville Jaguars to a resounding 34-20 win that snapped the Denver Broncos’ 11-game winning streak Sunday.

The AFC South-leading Jaguars (11-4) won their sixth straight game and handed the Broncos (12-3) their first loss since Week 3. It was also Denver’s first loss at home since 13 October 2024, snapping the Broncos’ 12-game home winning streak.

The Broncos’ lead over the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC West was sliced to a single game. The teams play in Week 18.

After Broncos rookie RJ Harvey pinballed his way for a 38-yard touchdown to tie it at 17 on the opening drive of the second half, it was all Jacksonville.

Lawrence scored on a on-yard keeper, then hit Parker Washington for 63 yards to set up Travis Etienne Jr’s 10-yard TD catch. After Bo Nix fumbled his exchange with running back Jaleel McLaughlin, Lawrence drove Jacksonville on its fifth consecutive score, a 26-yard field goal by Cam Little that made it 34-17 early in the fourth quarter.

Atlanta Falcons 26-19 Arizona Cardinals

Bijan Robinson gained 171 yards from scrimmage and had a touchdown catch, Kirk Cousins threw two TD passes and ran for a score, and the Atlanta Falcons held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals 26-19 on Sunday.

The Falcons (6-9) won for the second straight week, with both coming on the road.

Arizona’s defense made a fourth-down stop at its own 40-yard line with 2:05 left, setting up a chance to tie the game or take the lead, but Atlanta’s CJ Henderson made a diving interception of Jacoby Brissett’s pass with 1:30 remaining to seal it.

Robinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries. The 23-year-old became the third player in franchise history to gain at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Jamal Anderson (1998) and William Andrews (1981 and 1983).

Arizona (3-12) has lost seven straight and 12 of 13 since starting the season 2-0.

Las Vegas Raiders 21-23 Houston Texans

CJ Stroud threw a touchdown pass, Derek Stingley returned an interception for a score and the Houston Texans beat Las Vegas 23-21 on Sunday for their seventh straight victory and the Raiders’ ninth loss in a row.

Houston (10-5) has its longest winning streak since a nine-game run in 2018. The Texans remain a game behind first-place Jacksonville – a winner in Denver on Sunday – in the AFC South. The Raiders are 2-13.

Stingley’s touchdown came in the first quarter, and Ka’imi Fairbairn made three field goals to help the Texans to the win on a day when their offense struggled.

Houston led by two with about eight minutes left when Stroud found a wide-open Dalton Schultz for a 1-yard touchdown strike that made it 23-14. Nick Chubb had a 30-yard run on that drive and a 23-yard pass interference call on Lonnie Johnson Jr against Collins got Houston to the 2 to set up the score.

Rauders rookie Ashton Jeanty cut the lead to 23-21 when he scored on a 51-yard run with about five and a half minutes left. The rookie burst through the line before shedding a defender and waltzing into the end zone.

(AP) — Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Gardner Minshew hurt his left knee Sunday in the second quarter against the Tennessee Titans and was ruled out for the rest of the game.

Chris Oladokun replaced Minshew, who was making his first start this season for the Chiefs with Patrick Mahomes on injured reserve after tearing two knee ligaments last week.

Minshew’s last play came on a safety when Titans defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons tackled Kareem Hunt in the end zone with 13:06 left in the second. Minshew finished 3 of 8 for 15 yards before his injury.

When the Chiefs got the ball back, Oladokun, just signed to the roster, took over.

Oladokun handed off on his first five plays. Oladokun wound up throwing away his first pass attempt before finally connecting with Travis Kelce on a 6-yard completion for his first in the NFL. The Chiefs settled for a 54-yard field goal by Harrison Butker for a 3-2 lead.

His only previous NFL regular-season game came Jan. 5 backing up Carson Wentz for the Chiefs in a 38-0 blowout loss to Denver. Oladokun ran once for 5 yards, was sacked once and had a fumble in that loss.

He started at South Florida and also attended Samford and South Dakota State. Pittsburgh drafted Oladokun in 2022 with a seventh-round pick.

Tests for a potential neck injury came back negative, per ESPN.","LA Chargers running back Kimani Vidal suffered a neck injury during Sunday’s win over Dallas and is now considered day-to-day after an MRI confirmed a neck strain. Although Vidal left the game and did not return, the injury is not considered serious.

Vidal has appeared in 12 games this season and started 10, recording 631 rushing yards and three touchdowns.

Pittsburgh Steelers wideout DK Metcalf was suspended for two games following a sideline altercation with a fan during the team's 29-24 win over the Detroit Lions in Week 16, the league announced on Monday.

As a result, Metcalf will miss the final two games of the regular season. He is expected to appeal the suspension.

The incident occurred in the second quarter of the contest on Sunday at Ford Field. While the Lions' offense was on the field, Metcalf approached a fan wearing a blue wig and sitting in the front row. After exchanging words with the fan, Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at the fan's head. It was unclear whether the punch connected.

While the incident was captured on the broadcast, it was not seen by officials.

Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is considered day-to-day with a serious contusion in his back, according to head coach John Harbaugh.

""It doesn't look like it's more than that,"" Harbaugh said. ""He's in there getting treatment now.""

Jackson went down late after an awkward slide in the second quarter of Sunday’s 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots. Jackson was 7-10 for 101 yards and rushed for 7 before he went down.

Jackson was replaced by backup quarterback Tyler “Snoop” Huntley. Huntley went 9-10 for 65 yards against the Patriots.

Jackson has battled injuries throughout the season, most notably a hamstring injury, which caused him to miss three games. Jackson’s explosiveness has also been limited. He ran for a career low of 340 yards so far this season.

After Sunday’s loss and Pittsburgh win against the Lions, the Ravens have little margin for error if they want to make the playoffs. The Ravens are 7-8 and are one game behind the Steelers in the AFC North. The Ravens face the Green Packers and the Steelers the next two weeks.

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Gardner Minshew did not tear his ACL, as initially feared in Sunday’s 26-9 loss to the Tennessee Titans, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. Despite the good news for Minshew, he is still expected to miss time.

The Chiefs are now down to their third quarterback after starting quarterback Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers. Chris Oladokun took over for Minshew after he went down.

The Chiefs are also signing quarterback Shane Buechele off the Bills’ practice squad.

The Indianapolis Colts have activated veteran defensive tackle DeForest Buckner from the injured reserve list. This activation comes just before the Colts’ Week 16 Monday Night Football matchup with the San Francisco 49ers.

Buckner has been out with a neck injury since Week 9, and since then, the Colts have fallen out of the playoff picture, currently sitting in eighth place in the AFC at 8-6. The Colts need a win to keep pace, especially since Jacksonville and Houston won on Sunday and remain ahead of them in the AFC South.

The NFL will investigate Pittsburgh Steelers’ wide receiver D.K. Metcalf’s sideline interaction with a fan during Sunday’s game, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network.

During the contest, Metcalf confronted, and may have thrown a punch at a fan on the sideline. The league will look into exactly what happened, and could punish Metcalf for his actions.

That punishment could come as early as Monday evening, per Rapoport. Given the nature of the confrontation, Metcalf could be looking at a possible suspension.

Baltimore Ravens star Lamar Jackson’s status is “up in the air” for Week 17, per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.

Jackson had to leave Sunday’s game due to a back injury and was unable to return. Whether he can play in Week 17 is unclear right now.

It’s been a frustrating, injury-riddled year for Jackson, who missed time with a hamstring issue earlier in the year.

Denver Broncos wideout Pat Bryant was released from the hospital late Sunday night with a concussion. Bryant sustained the injury in the final minute of the team’s 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.

Bryant took a big hit in the final minute of the game. He was placed on a backboard, taken off the field on a cart and then taken to a local hospital to be evaluated. Tests for a potential neck injury came back negative, per ESPN.

The Broncos are set to play the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas Day.

Lane made his presence felt almost immediately before the injury. On the opening kickoff, Eagles returner Will Shipley coughed up the football, and Washington recovered deep in Philadelphia territory to set up an early field goal. While reports gave conflicting accounts on the specific recovery scrum, Lane was in the mix on special teams, an area where he has been a bright spot for head coach Dan Quinn.

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury.","Normally there's no love lost between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears, but that wasn't the case for the visitors in Week 16.

The Packers lost Jordan Love in the second quarter, when the quarterback exited the pivotal contest with a concussion.

With first place in the NFC North on the line, Green Bay had to turn to Malik Willis in relief of Love. Chicago prevailed in overtime, 22-16, and Green Bay has to hold its breath down the stretch.

There are just two games left in the regular season and no timetable for Love's return to action. It could be a big blow to a team that came into the year with Super Bowl aspirations, especially after losing Micah Parsons for the season with a torn ACL in Week 15.

Here's what to know about the Packers quarterback.

What happened to Jordan Love?

Love suffered a concussion in the second quarter of the Packers' Week 16 contest against the Bears.

Austin Booker delivered the hit on Love with 8:16 remaining in the first half. The defensive lineman lowered his head, connecting with a helmet-to-helmet hit on the quarterback, who also appeared to lower his head in preparation for the collision.

The hit prompted a 15-yard penalty on Chicago for roughing the passer, but the trade-off was Green Bay losing their starting quarterback for the game.

Love remained on the ground after the play with his eyes closed and his helmet dislodged.

Trainers quickly tended to Love, who ran off the field under his own power and into the blue medical tent. A short time later, the quarterback was taken to the locker room.

Jordan Love injury updates

Love was ruled out of Week 16 with a concussion.

He was initially listed as questionable to return, but failed to gain clearance for a return to play. Love completed 8 of 13 passes for 77 yards before leaving the game.

The Packers had a 3-0 lead over the Bears when he exited.

How long is Jordan Love out?

Love doesn't have a timetable for a return to play.

The quarterback is at the mercy of the league's concussion protocol and will have to clear all five steps before getting back into game action.

Head coach Matt LaFleur didn't have an update after the contest, leaving Love's status uncertain moving forward. Despite playing on Saturday, they won't have the added benefit of extra rest heading into Week 17, when they'll play another Saturday game.

It's not easy to clear the protocol and return to play in the same week. Without a timetable, there's a risk that Love's absence could potentially extend into the postseason.

Green Bay is clinging to the final playoff spot in the NFC, but remain in a good spot with two games to go.

What is concussion protocol in the NFL?

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury. It's a five-step process that a player has to clear before they can return to play. Those steps are, as defined by the NFL:

Symptom limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

Before a player enters the protocol, they are evaluated on the sideline. The tests are conducted by the team's physician and unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant. The evaluation includes observing any ""no-go"" symptoms, which are things like loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia and more, in addition to history of concussions, other signs/symptoms and video review.

At that point, a neurological exam is conducted and the player is escorted to the locker room if the sideline evaluation leaves any doubt.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/21/USAT/87871094007-jordan-love-122125.jpg?crop=2993,1684,x472,y175&width=2993&height=1684&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-21 10:59:41.347517

On the first drive of the second half, Mariota pulled up after running toward the sideline and is now questionable to return.

On a third-down play, Mariota escaped the pocket and threw the ball away after trying to buy some extra time. Eagles defensive lineman Jordan Davis was in pursuit when Mariota finished the play awkwardly. As Washington sent the punt unit out, Mariota was in clear discomfort on the sideline.

During the Eagles' ensuing possession, backup quarterback Josh Johnson warmed up while Mariota jogged off the field and toward the locker room.

The Commanders reported that Mariota was evaluated for a concussion during a brief stint in the injury tent. While Mariota cleared the concussion protocol, he is still being evaluated for a right hand injury.

Before exiting the game, Mariota completed seven of his 14 passing attempts for 95 yards. He only had one rushing attempt, which lost a yard.

With star quarterback Jayden Daniels sidelined for most of the season, Mariota has now started eight games. Entering Saturday, Mariota had completed 62.0% of his passes for 1,600 yards, 10 touchdowns and seven interceptions while adding 298 yards and a score on the ground.

Johnson, 39, replaced the injured Mariota, and it marks his first real action of the 2025 season. Johnson, who has played for an NFL record 14 teams, registered appearances in two games, but he didn't attempt a pass in either one.

Johnson hasn't taken meaningful snaps since the 2021 season when he started a game for the Baltimore Ravens. In 47 career games (and nine starts), Johnson has completed 58.1% of his throws for 2,297 yards, 13 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.

In a season where health has often dictated outcomes across the NFL, Buffalo’s updated injury report represents one of its most encouraging developments in weeks.

Tight end Dalton Kincaid headlines the group of returning contributors. After missing practice on Wednesday and Thursday due to a lingering knee issue, Kincaid was a full participant on Friday, signaling he’s ready to go. His availability restores a critical element to Buffalo’s offense, especially in the middle of the field where his route-running and hands have been sorely missed.

Buffalo stabilizes special teams and fortifies both trenches

Punter Mitch Wishnowsky will also suit up despite being limited earlier in the week with a right knee injury. That news brought relief to Bills decision-makers, particularly after Buffalo had to add a substitute placekicker to the practice squad with Matt Prater sidelined. Wishnowsky’s return is notable, as he’s already the third different punter the team has used this season.

Buffalo’s final injury report also cleared several defensive and offensive starters.

Bears defensive end Austin Booker was flagged for roughing the passer on the play that injured Love.

Packers players were divided on whether the hit was a dirty play or just part of the game.

CHICAGO – Depending which Green Bay Packers player you talked to, the helmet-to-helmet hit that knocked quarterback Jordan Love out of the game with a concussion was either dirty or part of the game.

With 8 minutes, 15 seconds left in the Chicago Bears’ 22-16 overtime victory, defensive end Austin Booker was flagged for a roughing-the-passer penalty after the front of his helmet hit the front of Love’s helmet as he sacked him for a 7-yard loss. Booker had been called for a roughing-the-passer penalty against Love on the third play of the game, but that one did not involve a hit to the head.

Most of the players on the field didn’t see the second hit in real time because they were involved in the play, but some of them saw the replay later.

“I felt like it was cheap,” left guard Aaron Banks said.

Banks said he thought Booker should have been ejected from the game.

“That’s bull[expletive],” he said. “But he’ll get what’s coming to him.”

Banks was presumably talking about a large fine for the two penalties.

The big question for the NFL will be whether he lowered his helmet and tried to use it as part of the tackle. The video showed that he did duck his head some, but Love also lowered his head, which caused the contact to be direct to his forehead.

Love is in the NFL’s concussion protocol, so he was off limits to reporters.

Coach Matt LaFleur did not address whether he thought the hit was intentional.

The game started out with an unnecessary-roughness penalty on linebacker D’Marco Jackson, who jumped on top of a scrum and grabbed kick returner Bo Melton around the neck. There was lots of pushing and shoving throughout the game.

Running back Emanuel Wilson said contact happens and there are times there is no intent to injury somebody, but he said the hit Booker put on Love wasn’t ordinary.

“It’s a physical game,” Wilson said. “Defensive players are going to try to knock people’s heads off. I didn’t see the first penalty. but I just know that second hit was unacceptable.”

Safety Javon Bullard said he didn’t know if there was intent behind Booker’s two penalties but he said the rules are clear on hitting quarterbacks.

“I know the rules and it’s unfortunate for him [Love], but I don’t think he was intentionally trying to hurt nobody,” Bullard said.

Left tackle Rasheed Walker didn’t say it was dirty, but he said the right penalty was called.

“He hit him head-to-head and he put his full body weight on him,” Walker said. “He was playing hard.”","https://www.packersnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/21/PMJS/87867582007-mjs-packers-19-3.jpg?crop=5236,2947,x0,y564&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-21 11:00:07.885264

The Lions announced on Saturday that they have put the talented defensive back on the injured reserve, ahead of the team's Week 16 matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Ford Field in Detroit.

Here's the update from the Lions via a social media post on X, formerly Twitter:

“Lions announce roster moves:

Placed S Kerby Joseph on Reserve/Injured. Activated OL Christian Mahogany from Reserve/Injured. Elevated OL Kingsley Eguakun and TE Giovanni Ricci from the Practice Squad to the Active/Inactive list.”

The Steelers game will be Joseph's ninth missed game in a row because of a knee issue. He last saw action on the field in Week 6's road game against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.

Detroit appeared to have held on to the hope that he could still make it back to the field for the Steelers game, as they did not put him on the injured reserve last week. But it's now clear that Joseph will spend at least the rest of the regular season on the sidelines.

In the six games he's played in the 2025 season, the 25-year-old Joseph recorded three interceptions, four passes defended and 19 combined tackles for the Lions, who continue to miss the NFL's leader in defensive picks in 2024. Last season, Kerby amassed nine interceptions in 17 games. He turned one of those INTs into a touchdown while adding 83 combined tackles and a quarterback hit.

After wrapping up their practice week Saturday afternoon, the Niners ruled out both key starters as Pearsall is battling a right knee injury while Green has been working through a neck issue.

Pearsall, who did not practice any of the three days this week, will not travel with the team to Indianapolis as he continues rehabilitation in the Bay Area.

""Ricky will stay back,"" coach Kyle Shanahan said. ""He was close but not close enough.""

Green's week was a bit more up and down. He was listed as a limited participant in each of the three practices but wore a blue no-contact jersey on Friday before shedding it on Saturday.

""His neck has been bothering him since the [Titans] game and it just didn't get any better,"" Shanahan said. ""So, we have to shut him down for this week.""

Like Green, Pearsall suffered his injury in last week's win against the Tennessee Titans. Pearsall came off with a low ankle sprain following a hip-drop tackle on San Francisco's opening offensive snap. Titans safety Kevin Winston Jr. was fined $23,186 for the tackle on Saturday.

Pearsall returned and played the rest of the way until limping off with what Shanahan has called an ""irritation"" of the posterior cruciate ligament injury that kept him out for six games earlier this season.

Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson are expected to pick up most of the slack opposite wideout Jauan Jennings in Pearsall's absence. Bourne needs 1 receiving yard to trigger a $500,000 bonus for reaching 500 receiving yards on the season.

Darrell Luter Jr. is the likely replacement for Green. He started against Jacksonville in Week 4, also replacing Green in that game.

Elsewhere on the injury front, the Niners list defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos as questionable. He is on injured reserve with a hamstring strain but practiced twice this week and Shanahan said the team will decide on whether to activate him on Monday.

Rookie linebacker Nick Martin landed on injured reserve Saturday with a concussion, which could open a spot on the 53-man roster for Gross-Matos.

They are 4-10 and sit third in the NFC East. Moreover, they have been officially eliminated from playoff contention. While many attribute the struggles to the team’s overall performance, some fans have placed the blame on quarterback Jayden Daniels.

However, the former second overall pick dislocated his left elbow during the Commanders’ 31-0 loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 14. As if things were not bad enough, the injury added to the mounting physical toll he has endured this season.

Jayden Daniels’ Injury Details

The injury against the Vikings was not the only one Daniels suffered this season. He sustained a knee sprain in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers. Another injury followed in Week 7 when the Commanders faced the Dallas Cowboys.

In Week 9, Daniels dislocated his elbow in a game against the Seattle Seahawks. Even after that setback, Washington initially intended for him to play the final five games of the season. But he was ruled out ahead of the Week 15 matchup against the New York Giants.

Now, the team does not expect him to play in the remaining games. As reported by Ian Rapoport on X, league sources indicated the Commanders have decided to shut down the rookie quarterback for the final three contests, shifting his focus to supporting Marcus Mariota.

What Is the Update on Daniels’ Injury?

The NFL insider later provided an update on Tuesday that included Daniels’ own perspective.

Rapoport wrote on X, “Speaking today, Jayden Daniels told reporters, ‘I don’t want to miss games at all. I’ve been frustrated this whole season, missing games. I want to be out there to help my teammates as much possible. It’s been a frustrating year.'”

Although Daniels will not appear in games, he is expected to remain active in practice. Head coach Dan Quinn said the decision was a “part medical and part team” call, aimed at allowing Daniels to recover while participating in limited work and enter the offseason as healthy as possible.

“I’ll be out there practicing whatever they need me to do,” Daniels said, responding to the proposal. “If I gotta do scout team, I’ll have fun with that and give the best looks.”

While the optimism is encouraging, Commanders fans will not see the promising quarterback take the field again this season. Based on his current performance, Daniels ranks 26th in PFSN’s Quarterback Impact metric with a score of 71.7.

Washington Commanders’ Stats and Insights for Week 16

Team: The Washington Commanders snapped an eight-game losing streak with a 29-21 win over the New York Giants. It was the second time this season that Washington scored more than 27 points after having seven games over 27 points last season.

QB: Marcus Mariota’s PFSN Quarterback Impact (QBi) grade over the last four games has been a C or C+, which has ranked him between 11th and 19th for the week.

Offense: The Commanders are tied for the third-best percentage for touchdowns per red zone trip. They have found the end zone in 66.7% of the time when they get into the red zone.

Defense: Washington has allowed opponents to gain 4.7 yards per rush this season. It is the sixth highest in the league.

Another was Love's frustrating day against the Broncos defense. The 27-year-old quarterback completed 24-of-40 passes for 276 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.

The Broncos were keyed in on the Packers quarterback from the start. Early in the first quarter, safety Talanoa Hufanga took things a step too far in an incident involving Love, which resulted in a fine for Hufanga.

On the Packers' first offensive drive, Love scrambled to convert a fourth-and-1 with 9:41 remaining in the first quarter.

Hufanga ran him out of bounds, but as he returned to the field, the Broncos defender pushed Love's head against the ground. No flag was thrown on the play.

On Saturday, just hours before kickoff of the Bears-Packers game, the NFL announced in its weekly gameday accountability report that Hufanga had been fined $11,593 for the incident, citing ""unnecessary roughness.""

Hufanga will have the opportunity to appeal the fine, but based on the replay, the evidence is hard to ignore. He may not be able to get away without a punishment, like Broncos teammate Zach Allen did following a separate incident with Love.

The Packers played most of the game without Love, who left with a concussion during the second quarter.

Love was dropping back to pass when he was hit in the backfield by Chicago defensive end Austin Booker. Love was lowering his head as Booker made the tackle, and the two players made helmet-to-helmet contact.

The Packers quarterback lay on his back on the field as he was attended to by trainers before he went to the blue medical tent on the sideline. He was then taken back to the locker room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.

Love was replaced on the drive by Malik Willis, who led Green Bay to a field goal on the possession. Love had completed 8 of 13 passes for 77 yards before exiting.

Willis finished the game 9 of 11 for 121 yards and one touchdown. He also ran 10 times for 44 yards.

The Bears trailed 16-6 with under three minutes to go in the fourth quarter but forced the extra period with two late scores before Caleb Williams found D.J. Moore on a 46-yard pass for the game-winning touchdown.

Per NFL’s Next Gen Stats, Chicago’s win probability dipped to as low as 0.5% in the fourth quarter before they rallied in the final minutes.

Green Bay took a 6-0 lead into halftime before the Bears finally got on the board with a field goal on their first drive of the second half. Late in the third quarter, the Packers scored the first touchdown of the game on a perfect pass from Willis to Romeo Doubs.

The teams then traded field goals on their next three possessions, with the Bears ultimately cutting Green Bay’s lead to 16-9 with one minute and 59 seconds to go. Only having two timeouts left, Chicago called an onside kick after its last field goal, and the Bears recovered it after Doubs couldn’t corral the ball.

Williams then led an eight-play, 53-yard touchdown drive capped by a 6-yard touchdown pass to Jahdae Walker on fourth down.

In overtime, the Packers had the ball first but couldn’t convert on a 4th and 1 from inside Chicago territory after Willis fumbled the snap. Four plays later, Williams connected with Moore for the winning score.

Saturday’s game was a key one for both sides. The win solidified the Bears’ hold on first place in the NFC North, as they improved to 11-4. Green Bay fell to 9-5-1 with the loss, with the 8-6 Detroit Lions hot on their tail for the final playoff spot in the conference.

Chicago will travel to play the 10-4 San Francisco 49ers in Week 17, while the Packers will host the 7-7 Baltimore Ravens.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251220-jordan-love-rc-958p-03bfd9.jpg",N,,2025-12-21 02:57:48.381558

Bears

What did the Bears prove with the win? If the Bears have proven one thing this season, it's that they're a resilient group. The Bears have six wins after trailing in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter, the most such wins in a season since the 1970 merger. Saturday's win gives them a 96% chance to make the postseason for the first time in five years. Josh Blackwell recovered an onside kick after the Bears made it a one-score affair ahead of the two-minute warning, and that gave Chicago one last opportunity for its offense to come alive after a stagnant three quarters. Undrafted rookie Jahdae Walker came through in the biggest moment of the game with a late touchdown to send the game into overtime, and that's where Caleb Williams finished it with a 46-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore.

Most surprising performance: Without receivers Rome Odunze (foot) and Luther Burden III (ankle), Walker was given an opportunity and proved how important it is to stay ready. Walker's first career catch went for a first down, and it was his touchdown late in the fourth quarter that forced overtime. Walker is the only rookie undrafted free agent on the Bears' 53-man roster. His performance highlights how vital the Bears' depth is on offense.

Troubling trend: The Bears were their own worst enemy at times with 10 penalties for 105 yards. It was the first time since 2000 that the Bears had two roughing-the-passer penalties and two unnecessary roughness penalties in the same game, according to ESPN Research. Late in the fourth, Jaquan Brisker dove onto Malik Willis after the quarterback slid, giving the Packers 15 yards to move into Chicago territory for a field goal that made it 16-6 with 5:03 left. -- Courtney Cronin

Next game: vs. 49ers (Sunday, Dec. 28, 8:20 p.m. ET p.m. ET)

Packers

How deflating was this loss for the Packers? Not only did the Packers lose a game they controlled until the final minutes of the fourth quarter, they don't know if they'll have starting quarterback Jordan Love for the all-important final two games of the regular season. Love left in the first half because of a concussion, and his status going forward is unknown. While Willis filled in admirably for Love -- until a fumbled snap in overtime --- it wasn't enough as the Packers melted down in the late stages of the fourth quarter. At 9-5-1, the Packers trail the Bears (11-4) in the NFC North, and the season series ends in a split.

Turning point: If Warren Brinson got a clean sack on Williams with 3:11 left in regulation, the game might have been over. It was third-and-20 from the Packers' 46-yard line when the rookie defensive lineman sacked Williams. But he grabbed the quarterback's facemask and the ensuing penalty gave the Bears a fresh set of downs, which led to a field goal that cut the Packers' lead to 16-9 with 1:59 to play. The Bears then recovered the ensuing onside kick and scored a tying touchdown to force overtime, where they finished the game.

Most surprising performance: Only six teams were better at scoring touchdowns from inside the red zone than the Packers entering Week 16. Their touchdown percentage inside the 20 was at 64.7%. Yet they failed on all five trips inside the Bears' 20-yard line Saturday. The first four of them were inside the Bears' 9-yard line. The Packers managed a pair of field goals sandwiched around a turnover on downs on a failed fourth-and-1 from the Bears' 7 and Josh Jacobs' fumble on first-and-goal from the 4. -- Rob Demovsky

Next game: vs. Ravens (Saturday, Dec. 27, 8 p.m. ET)

Philadelphia 29, Washington 18

Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap

Eagles

What is the significance of this win? The Eagles clinched the NFC East, becoming the first team to win the division in back-to-back seasons since 2004. It hasn't been the easiest road for the defending champs, but they've beaten up on lesser opponents over the past couple of weeks and appear closer to establishing an offensive identity. A big part of that is a commitment to the ground game, with Saquon Barkley having 84 rush yards after contact, his most in a game since 2019. With the ground game beginning to click and the defense continuing to dominate, Philadelphia looks to be in pretty good form with the playoffs fast approaching.

Turning point: Eagles defensive back Cooper DeJean intercepted Josh Johnson's pass late in the third quarter, setting up a Barkley touchdown run that pushed the lead to double digits. Johnson entered the game in the second half for an injured Marcus Mariota and made a critical miscue when he threw across the field on third-and-long. DeJean swooped in for the interception, and the Eagles reached the end zone seven plays later.

Stat to know: Dallas Goedert's third-quarter score was his 10th receiving TD of the season, tying Pete Retzlaff (1965) for the most by a tight end in Eagles history. Goedert, who is scheduled to be a free agent at the end of the season, had never had more than five receiving TDs in a season. -- Tim McManus

Next game: at Bills (Dec. 28, 4:25 p.m. ET)

Commanders

What else could go wrong? Washington was playing a strong game vs. the Eagles when yet another injury doomed the Commanders. With 14:18 left in the third quarter, quarterback Marcus Mariota injured his passing hand with Washington leading 10-7, and he did not return. The loss -- at least until late in the fourth quarter -- showed that though the Commanders still care about winning, they just don't have the firepower on either side of the ball to beat the Eagles. Washington has had 13 starters miss at least one game this season, and nine have missed at least seven -- eight more than all of last season. Washington also had two offensive linemen exit early because of undisclosed injuries: reserve tackle Brandon Coleman and starting right guard Sam Cosmi.

Biggest hole in the game plan: Washington's pass defense consistently allowed key plays when it needed a stop, partly because of the unit's lack of pressure, a weeks-long issue that won't be resolved this season. At times, the four-man rushes left running lanes for quarterback Jalen Hurts, who took advantage of man coverage for good runs. The Commanders were also called for illegal contact and defensive pass interference on a key Eagles touchdown drive.

QB performance: Washington couldn't muster any offense once Mariota exited, with the result still in doubt. Josh Johnson, who hasn't played since August, threw an interception that changed the game, passing across the field off his back foot with no zip. In his first three series, Washington gained one first down. If Mariota can't play on a short week, Washington will need to either elevate Sam Bradford off the practice squad or sign another quarterback -- or both. -- John Keim

Next game: vs. Cowboys (Thursday, 1 p.m. ET)

Seattle 38, L.A. Rams 37

Seahawks

What are the playoff implications of the Seahawks' win? They secured their postseason berth. Now, it's a matter of whether they can hang on to their one-game lead in the NFC West and the conference's No. 1 seed, which they'd be assured of by winning their final two games at Carolina and San Francisco. The first NFC team to 12 wins, Seattle still has to hold off the Rams and 49ers to win the division. Los Angeles finishes with winnable games against the Falcons and Cardinals, and the 49ers already have one win over Seattle. This could come down to the season finale at Levi's Stadium.

Biggest hole in the game plan: Despite not having to worry about Rams wide receiver Davante Adams (knee and hamstring injury), the Seahawks' defense gave up 225 yards and two touchdowns to Puka Nacua. Los Angeles gashed Mike Macdonald's unit in a way you rarely see, racking up 581 yards with a ton of damage on explosive passing plays. The Seahawks got the stops when they needed them, and they did so despite losing Coby Bryant, Nick Emmanwori and Riq Woolen to injuries in the fourth quarter.

Best quote from the locker room: In addition to a lousy day by their defense, the Seahawks overcame two interceptions by Sam Darnold, who then threw a pair of touchdown passes late in the win. ""Just shows a true competitor,"" Jaxon Smith-Njigba said of the quarterback. ""A lot of guys would get down on themselves and give up, lay down, but that's not what we do, that's not what he is. That goes around to the whole team. Excited to have a leader in Sam."" -- Brady Henderson

Next game: at Panthers (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)

Rams

What does the loss to the Seahawks mean for the Rams' NFC West chances? The Rams entered the game with a 62% chance to win the NFC West, but those odds dropped to 25% after the OT loss (independent of other games), according to ESPN Analytics. The 10-4 Rams fell to the No. 5 seed in the NFC, and they could drop to No. 6 if the 49ers win Monday night. The Rams had a win probability of 97% in the fourth quarter, and had they won, ESPN Analytics would have given them a 91% chance to win the NFC West. Instead, the Rams no longer control their own destiny in the division race.

Trend to watch: Puka Nacua has 573 receiving yards in his past three games. It's the most in a three-game span since Josh Gordon had 649 for the Browns in 2013. With Davante Adams injured, Matthew Stafford relied even more on Nacua, whose 225 receiving yards are the most by a Rams player since Isaac Bruce in 1997. -- Sarah Barshop",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1221%2Fr1592158_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 02:57:52.808907

Love was ruled out of Saturday's 22-16 overtime loss to the Chicago Bears because of a concussion after he took a helmet-to-helmet hit from defensive end Austin Booker in the second quarter. Love was taken out of the game after Booker committed his second roughing-the-passer penalty of the first half.

LaFleur had no update on Love after the game but tried to explain how his team led for the entire game until the Bears tied the score with 1:35 left in regulation.

""We knew they were a team that was going to fight to the end,"" LaFleur said. ""It was a playoff-type atmosphere, which we expected, but I was really, really proud of the way our guys competed, the way they battled. And we just gotta -- it's tough. It's always tough in this league to have to rebound and get it together, but that's exactly what we have to do and that's exactly what we will do to get ready for a tough Baltimore team.""

Malik Willis finished the game in relief of Love and while he completed 9-of-11 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown pass to Romeo Doubs that gave the Packers a 10-point, second-half lead, he also lost a fumble on a botched snap on the first possession of overtime.

The Packers were still in control and looked like they might have ended the Bears' hopes when rookie Warren Brinson sacked Caleb Williams on third-and-20 from the Packers' 46-yard line with 3:11 left in regulation. But Brinson was called for a facemask, and things began to unravel. The Bears kicked a field goal on that drive to cut the Packers' lead to 16-9 with 1:59 to play.

""Everybody makes a mistake once in a while on the field,"" Brinson said. ""It was just, my hand was a little too high and I grabbed his facemask.""

The Packers might have survived that mistake, but then Doubs fumbled an onside kick, giving the Bears the ball back when a Doubs recovery might have ended it.

""S---, I missed it,"" said Doubs, who suffered a wrist injury on that play. ""That's just this game, bro. I rep this s--- all week, and yeah, bro, somebody gotta be responsible, and I'm willing to take on 1000% of it.""

Packers cornerbacks Nate Hobbs and Keisean Nixon then miscommunicated on a fourth-down play that allowed Caleb Williams to hit Jahdae Walker for a 6-yard touchdown that tied the score with 24 seconds left.

After Willis fumbled a snap on the first possession of overtime -- he said he sped up the snap count because the play clock was running down and it threw off center Sean Rhyan -- Williams ended it with a 46-yard touchdown pass to D.J. Moore, who beat Nixon in single coverage after the Packers blitz.

That's how the Packers fell to 9-5-1 and lost the chance to sweep the Bears (11-4).

It puts even more pressure on the Packers heading into their final two games -- home next Saturday against the Ravens and at the Vikings to close the season.

They likely won't know until much later in the week whether they'll have Love back for the next game.

Love has not had a reported concussion during his NFL career. He was evaluated for a concussion earlier this season against the Giants in Week 10, but instead suffered a left-shoulder injury. He returned to finish that game, and the only action he has missed since then was late in a blowout win over the Vikings in Week 11.

Earlier this year, he underwent surgery for a broken left thumb late in training camp but returned for the start of the regular season.

This is the second time that Love has not finished a game against the Bears. He left last year's regular-season finale because of a right elbow injury but returned for the playoffs the following week. Earlier last season, he could not finish the Week 8 game against the Jaguars because of a groin injury. He returned the following week.

He has missed two games since he became the Packers' full-time starter in 2023. After starting every game in his first season, he missed Weeks 2 and 3 last season because of the knee injury he suffered on the final drive of the season opener against the Eagles in Brazil.

LaFleur was noncommittal when asked whether he thought Booker's hit on Love was dirty, saying: ""That's football. I gotta see it to -- I mean I saw it live, so I gotta go see it again. But stuff happens.""

However, Packers left guard Aaron Banks took issue with the hit, especially because it was second penalty of the game.

""What's the flag they called on that, roughing the passer?"" Banks said. ""I just don't know, guys get kicked out of games for taunting, but if you hit a quarterback late in the head, you know what I'm saying? That should get the same treatment for something as simple as taunting. I think that has to be re-evaluated. I think that's ridiculous.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1221%2Fr1592186_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 02:57:59.210646

Personnel clarity will drive both scripts once inactives post. If Watson is active, Green Bay’s perimeter speed and vertical stress return, pairing with play-action to challenge Chicago’s safeties; if he’s held, intermediate timing and distribution become central.

Backfield decisions will dictate early-down efficiency and third-down distances. On Chicago’s side, Odunze and Burden III being out tightens the route depth, likely elevating DJ Moore and the tight ends in quick-game and play-action concepts; Swift’s availability shapes the run-pass balance and screen timing.

Edmunds’ activation from the injured reserve boosts second-level matchup flexibility and zone integrity, aiding run fits and tight end coverage.

Jordan Love Injury Update

Packers QB Jordan Love left Saturday's game against the Bengals after taking a big hit in the second quarter.

He was taken to the back to be evaluated for a concussion, and he was later ruled out for the rest of the game.

Green Bay has a massive matchup against the Ravens next Saturday, and given the usual recovery timeline from concussions this season, Love will be up against it to be cleared for that game.

Malik Willis took over at quarterback for the Packers after Love left the game.

Willis led the Packers to a 2-0 record with Love sidelined last season.

Love dropped back for a pass with the Packers up 3-0 in the second quarter when Chicago defensive end Austin Booker broke free on the pass rush. Booker connected helmet-to-helmet on the sack, dropping Love hard to the turf.

Love remained on the turf for minutes, grabbing at his helmet before being checked by the athletic staff and escorted into the blue medical tent for evaluation. Booker was flagged for roughing the passer for the contact to Love's head.

Q4 4:00 - Packers 16, Bears 6

On second-and-10, Olamide Zaccheaus dropped a ball that hit him in the chest and would have been a big gain.

One play later, Caleb Williams takes off and slides down for a gain of what appeared to be 10 yards. After review, he is ruled to be down a bit short of the line to gain.

Going for it on fourth-and-1, Williams takes off again and this time gains 12 yards.

Q4 5:03 - Packers 16, Bears 6

Chicago finally gets off the field but Green Bay burned over five minutes of clock and pushed its lead back to two possessions with just under six minutes to go after Brandon McManus drills a 28-yarder.

I've said this too many times tonight but here we are again: Caleb Williams and company need to score quickly.

Q4 10:52 - Packers 13, Bears 6

Chicago faces a critical third-and-9 from the Green Bay 23-yard line but the play was doomed from the outset.

The Packers sent heat and Caleb Williams immediately launched the ball away, drawing an intentional grounding penalty, making it an even longer field goal attempt for Cairo Santos.

Despite the swirling winds, Santos drills a 51-yarder to make it a one-possession game with a lot of time remaining.

Malik Willis is going to get paid this offseason and it’s probably not going to be by the Packers.

Willis has done enough in his fill-in stints over the last two seasons to at least compete for a starting job somewhere else.

Quite the deal general manager Brian Gutekunst struck when he traded a seventh-round pick for the failed Titans QB on the eve of the 2024 season.

Q3 4:15 - Packers 6, Bears 3

Does this sound familiar?

Kyle Monangai starts the Bears drive with a chunk gain before the offense stalls. On third-and-18 from Chicago's 17-yard line, Caleb Williams throw behind DJ Moore, who makes the grab but is brought down well shy of the line to gain.

The Bears punt and will need to lean of their defense again.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/6ptrP89bUOBC_gT16fTU3FcLU_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-20 22:58:57.681047

Jordan Love injury update

The Packers have officially ruled Love out for the remainder of Saturday's game because of a concussion. He had originally been deemed ""questionable"" to return but the team announced he would not return after halftime.

Love completed 8 of 13 passes for 77 yards before leaving the game. Green Bay was leading Chicago 3-0 when he exited.

Who is the Packers backup QB?

Malik Willis is the Packers' backup quarterback and checked into the game to replace Love after he was injured.

Willis, 26, is a four-year pro who is in his second season with the Packers. He was a third-round pick by the Tennessee Titans in the 2022 NFL Draft out of Liberty and has completed 63.4% of his career passes for 913 yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions.

Willis went 2-0 in two starts in relief of Love last season with the Packers and has a career record of 3-2 as a starter. The 6-1, 225-pound signal-caller is well-known for his mobility and has 301 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 55 career carries.

Packers QB depth chart

The Packers have three quarterbacks currently in their organization. They are as follows:

Jordan Love

Malik Willis

Clayton Tune (practice squad)

Tune was not elevated for Saturday's game, so the Packers do not have another quarterback available behind Willis against the Bears.

Fox Sports' Erin Andrews reported Packers coach Matt LaFleur told her the team's emergency QB would likely be starting running Josh Jacobs if Willis needs to leave the game for any reason.

Jordan Love injury

Love's injury occurred on the third play of the team's third possession in the game at the 8:21 mark in the second quarter.

On first down at their own 17-yard line, Love was met by defensive end Austin Booker as he drilled the Packers QB helmet to helmet.

Before leaving the game, Love completed 8 of 13 passes for 77 yards and a 78.0 rating.

He was hurt on the team's third possession.

Who is Malik Willis?

Willis has served as the Packers' backup quarterback for the last two seasons. He made two spot starts last season when Love was out early in the 2024 season. He is 2-0 as a starter and also came in for Love on other occassions in 2024.

One of those situations came against the Bears in the team's regular season finale last year.

The 26-year-old Willis is a mobile threat.

Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap

Eagles

What is the significance of this win? The Eagles clinched the NFC East, becoming the first team to win the division in back-to-back seasons since 2004. It hasn't been the easiest road for the defending champs, but they've beaten up on lesser opponents over the past couple of weeks and appear closer to establishing an offensive identity. A big part of that is a commitment to the ground game, with Saquon Barkleyhaving 84 rush yards after contact, his most in a game since 2019. With the ground game beginning to click and the defense continuing to dominate, Philadelphia looks to be in pretty good form with the playoffs fast approaching.

Turning point: Eagles defensive back Cooper DeJean intercepted Josh Johnson's pass late in the third quarter, setting up a Barkley touchdown run that pushed the lead to double digits. Johnson entered the game in the second half for an injured Marcus Mariota and made a critical miscue when he threw across the field on third-and-long. DeJean swooped in for the interception, and the Eagles reached the end zone seven plays later.

Stat to know:Dallas Goedert's third-quarter score was his 10th receiving TD of the season, tying Pete Retzlaff (1965) for the most by a tight end in Eagles history. Goedert, who is scheduled to be a free agent at the end of the season, had never had more than five receiving TDs in a season.-- Tim McManus

Next game: at Bills (Dec. 28, 4:25 p.m. ET)

Commanders

What else could go wrong? Washington was playing a strong game vs. the Eagles when yet another injury doomed the Commanders. With 14:18 left in the third quarter, quarterback Marcus Mariota injured his passing hand with Washington leading 10-7, and he did not return. The loss -- at least until late in the fourth quarter -- showed that though the Commanders still care about winning, they just don't have the firepower on either side of the ball to beat the Eagles. Washington has had 13 starters miss at least one game this season, and nine have missed at least seven -- eight more than all of last season. Washington also had two offensive linemen exit early because of undisclosed injuries: reserve tackle Brandon Coleman and starting right guard Sam Cosmi.

Biggest hole in the game plan: Washington's pass defense consistently allowed key plays when it needed a stop, partly because of the unit's lack of pressure, a weeks-long issue that won't be resolved this season. At times, the four-man rushes left running lanes for quarterback Jalen Hurts, whotook advantage of man coverage for good runs. The Commanders were also called for illegal contact and defensive pass interference on a key Eagles touchdown drive.

QB performance: Washington couldn't muster any offense once Mariota exited, with the result still in doubt. Josh Johnson, who hasn't played since August, threw an interception that changed the game, passing across the field off his back foot with no zip. In his first three series, Washington gained one first down. If Mariota can't play on a short week, Washington will need to either elevate Sam Bradford off the practice squad or sign another quarterback -- or both.-- John Keim

Next game: vs. Cowboys (Thursday, 1 p.m. ET)

Seattle 38, L.A. Rams 37

Catch up on the action: Box score | Recap

Seahawks

What are the playoff implications of the Seahawks' win? They secured their postseason berth. Now, it's a matter of whether they can hang on to their one-game lead in the NFC West and the conference's No. 1 seed, which they'd be assured of by winning their final two games at Carolina and San Francisco. The first NFC team to 12 wins, Seattle still has to hold off the Rams and 49ers to win the division. Los Angeles finishes with winnable games against the Falcons and Cardinals, and the 49ers already have one win over Seattle. This could come down to the season finale at Levi's Stadium.

Biggest hole in the game plan: Despite not having to worry about Rams wide receiver Davante Adams(knee and hamstring injury), the Seahawks' defense gave up 225 yards and two touchdowns to Puka Nacua. Los Angeles gashed Mike Macdonald's unit in a way you rarely see, racking up 581 yards with a ton of damage on explosive passing plays. The Seahawks got the stops when they needed them, and they did so despite losing Coby Bryant, Nick Emmanwori and Riq Woolen to injuries in the fourth quarter.

Best quote from the locker room: In addition to a lousy day by their defense, the Seahawks overcame two interceptions by Sam Darnold, who then threw a pair of touchdown passes late in the win. ""Just shows a true competitor,"" Jaxon Smith-Njigba said of the quarterback. ""A lot of guys would get down on themselves and give up, lay down, but that's not what we do, that's not what he is. That goes around to the whole team. Excited to have a leader in Sam."" -- Brady Henderson

Next game: at Panthers (Sunday, 1 p.m. ET)

Rams

What does the loss to the Seahawks mean for the Rams' NFC West chances? The Rams entered the game with a 62% chance to win the NFC West, but those odds dropped to 25% after the OT loss (independent of other games), according to ESPN Analytics. The 10-4 Rams fell to the No. 5 seed in the NFC, and they could drop to No. 6 if the 49ers win Monday night. The Rams had a win probability of 97% in the fourth quarter, and had they won, ESPN Analytics would have given them a 91% chance to win the NFC West. Instead, the Rams no longer control their own destiny in the division race.

Trend to watch:Puka Nacua has 573 receiving yards in his past three games. It's the most in a three-game span since Josh Gordon had 649 for the Browns in 2013. With Davante Adams injured,Matthew Staffordrelied even more on Nacua, whose 225 receiving yards are the most by a Rams player since Isaac Bruce in 1997. -- Sarah Barshop",https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2025/1221/r1592108_1296x729_16-9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-20 22:59:35.766536

The 49ers signed Bourne after Week 1, which coincided with the toe injury that cost Purdy eight games.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Ricky Pearsall, who aggravated a knee injury Sunday, has been ruled out of Monday’s game against the Indianapolis Colts.

The San Francisco 49ers receiver originally hurt his posterior cruciate ligament in Week 4 on a diving attempt out of bounds. He reinjured it when he fell on his knee while making a third-down catch in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s win over the Tennessee Titans. Pearsall finished with 96 receiving yards to lead all pass catchers.

Kyle Shanahan said Pearsall came close to playing versus the Colts. But he didn’t practice this week and was limited to sprinting on a side field during Friday’s session.

“He was close, but not close enough,” Shanahan said.

Monday’s game will be the seventh Pearsall has missed this season. Kendrick Bourne likely will step in as the starter opposite Jauan Jennings, with Demarcus Robinson becoming the team’s No. 3 option at the position.

With 499 yards, Bourne leads the team’s wideouts in receiving yards and needs just one more yard to trigger a $500,000 bonus.

Shanahan joked this week that Bourne is to blame for the 1-yard shortage. He called a screen pass late in Sunday’s game that was blocked to go for 7 yards, but Bourne spun at the end of the play and picked up only 6.

Bourne agreed he should have plowed straight ahead.

“At the end, it was really just an Oklahoma drill — I’m supposed to go through ’em,” Bourne said with a chuckle. “The whole team was laughing at me. I blew it, brah. I blew it.”

Bourne also said his chemistry with quarterback Brock Purdy has improved in recent weeks. The 49ers signed Bourne after Week 1, which coincided with the toe injury that cost Purdy eight games. The bulk of Bourne’s output this season — 465 yards — has come with Mac Jones, an ex-New England Patriots teammate, at quarterback.

But Bourne said Purdy has become sharper and more confident as the toe has improved, and with that, their connection has improved.

“His foot — during the times he played — it was tough,” Bourne said. “You could tell he was struggling. So with him being healthy, I’ve noticed that (now) he’s spinning the ball, he’s really throwing it well. He’s throwing it where he wants it to go. So I think that’s helped our chemistry.”

Meanwhile, starting cornerback Renardo Green was also ruled out after the neck injury he suffered didn’t improve. Darrell Luter Jr. likely will start in his place.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/20171811/GettyImages-2251917821-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-20 21:59:40.884074

Saturday Night 8:20 PM EST Game

RB Josh Jacobs, Green Bay | Knee | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Josh Jacobs has not practiced all week due to the knee injury that has lingered for several weeks. When the injury first occurred, there was concern for a possible PCL sprain, but Green Bay downplayed it as a knee contusion.

Since Week 11, Jacobs has been clearly limited, flashing effectiveness at times but noticeably hindered in others. It's possible the cumulative effect of the injury has caught up to him. Jacobs is expected to sit out Saturday.

RB D'Andre Swift, Chicago | Groin | Questionable | Projecting Active

D'Andre Swift is another running back who has been battling injuries for much of the season. Swift was added to the injury report with a groin injury but practiced all week, albeit in a limited capacity.

We've seen this pattern before with Swift and the Chicago Bears, and based on that history, he should be active Saturday night.

WR Christian Watson, Green Bay | Chest | Questionable | Projecting Active

After initial concerns of an SC joint sprain, Green Bay has offered little detail regarding Christian Watson's ""chest"" injury, only revealing that he briefly visited a local Denver hospital.

The fact that Watson was cleared to return to practice this quickly suggests that any clavicle or rib injury he sustained was minor and that his internal organs—most importantly, his lungs—were unaffected. He should play Saturday, although he carries a slightly elevated risk of re-injury if he fully sells out on a dive for a pass, similar to the play in which he was originally injured.

Commanders QB depth chart The Commanders have four quarterbacks in their organization, and just three entered Saturday's game healthy.","Washington Commanders quarterback Marcus Mariota was injured in the third quarter of the team's Week 16 game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Mariota was hurt after firing a third-down incompletion to Treylon Burks. It wasn't immediately clear what Mariota injured, but he headed to the sideline under his own power and quickly went into the blue medical tent.

Shortly thereafter, Mariota was seen exiting the tent. He jogged to the locker room with the Commanders' medical staff in tow and a towel draped over his right hand.

Marcus Mariota injury update

The Commanders announced Mariota had cleared concussion protocol after being evaluated but that he was questionable to return to Saturday's game because of a hand injury.

Washington is already without starting quarterback Jayden Daniels (elbow) for the remainder of the season. If Mariota can't return to action, the Commanders will need to rely on their third-string quarterback to lead them moving forward against the Eagles.

Who is the Commanders' backup QB?

Josh Johnson is the Commanders' backup quarterback behind Mariota. The 39-year-old has played for 14 different NFL teams over his NFL career but last started for the Baltimore Ravens during the 2021 NFL season.

Johnson has a career record of 1-8 as a starter and has completed 58.1% of his career passes for 2,297 yards, 13 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.

Commanders QB depth chart

The Commanders have four quarterbacks in their organization, and just three entered Saturday's game healthy. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

The Detroit Lions placed Joseph on injured reserve Saturday, Dec. 20, nearly 10 weeks after he played in his last game.

Joseph, the NFL's interception leader in 2024, has battled knee problems all season. He injured his knee in training camp, suffered a bone bruise in the same spot in a Week 4 win over the Cleveland Browns and is dealing with a cartilage issue that has made it too painful to play.

Joseph will miss at least four more games on IR − the Lions (8-6) have three games left in the regular season; he would be eligible but seems unlikely to return for the divisional round of the playoffs − and is expected to pursue non-surgical options to help his knee this offseason, such as stem-cell therapy.

The Lions activated left guard Christian Mahogany off IR to take Joseph's spot on the 53-man roster.

Mahogany broke a bone in his left leg in a Nov. 2 loss to the Minnesota Vikings and has missed the past six weeks. Lions coach Dan Campbell said Mahogany ""looked pretty good"" in practice this week.

Mahogany's return comes at a welcome time for a Lions team that has started seven different combinations on its offensive line this year and still is managing injuries in the group.

Starting center Graham Glasgow is questionable to play Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers with a knee injury, and team elevated center Kingsley Eguakun and tight end Giovanni Ricci from the practice squad to the gameday roster.

Eguakun has played three offensive snaps in his career, but took some first-team reps at center this week and could start against the Steelers.

Left tackle Taylor Decker also has been playing through a shoulder injury all season, and Trystan Colon, who started the past two weeks at left guard and has been the Lions' backup center most of the season, is questionable to play with a thumb/wrist injury.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/14/PDTF/86155433007-20250913-detroit-lions-vs-chicago-bears-54.JPG?crop=2047,1152,x0,y106&width=2047&height=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-20 19:00:07.684797

Dean has had a tough go with regard to injuries, but every time he’s healthy, he’s been hugely impactful. He was able to take the starting job back from rookie Jihaad Campbell, who had been playing pretty well for his experience level, earlier in the season.

Campbell went a whole game without snaps just a few weeks ago, but DC Vic Fangio admitted that probably wasn’t ideal, and had been making a bigger effort to get the rookie on the field more in the weeks since. Now, with Dean back on the sideline, Campbell will get some useful reps down the stretch.

As Jefferson began walking off the field, he showed the fans inside Arrowhead Stadium the double bird.

After the game, Jefferson apologized for the gesture saying, ""I’m classier than that, I was just caught up in the moment. Emotions get high. I won’t sit here and act like I’m a perfect man. I messed up when I did that. I have kids at home, and there’s kids out there watching the game too.”

As for the hit itself, Jefferson said he was just “trying to make a football play.”

“It was like a bang-bang moment,"" he said. “You have to go with what the officials called in the moment.”

The Chargers were up by three points at the time, and held on to pick up the win with one final stop after Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes went down with a knee injury. Jefferson finished with five total tackles. The 33-year-old is up to 37 total tackles and four interceptions this season, his second with the Chargers.

Jacobs is dealing with knee and ankle injuries, while Watson is battling a chest/shoulder injury he suffered last week.

With just hours to go before kickoff, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports that Watson ""should be good to go"" as long as he doesn't suffer a setback in warm-ups.

As for Jacobs, Rapoport didn't have any semblance of confirmation for the star rusher but did note that Jacobs wants to play and typically that means he's going to play.

During the week, both players said they expected to play.

“I’ll probably just have something in my pads for game day just to be cautious,"" Watson said. ""Honestly, it’s feeling pretty good for everything considered, so I think it’ll be all right for the game.""

""Josh Jacobs, walking with a significant limp in locker room and wearing a stimulation bracelet around his injured knee, makes it clear he intends to play in Chicago,"" USA TODAY's Ryan Wood reported during the week.

We will get final confirmation on Jacobs' and Watson's statuses by around 6:50 p.m. ET when the Bears and Packers put out their inactives lists.

But, for now, we fully expect both Jacobs and Watson to go.

Now, let's look at what you need to know for the last 15 games on the slate. We have last-minute nuggets from our NFL analysts on matchups from Saturday through Monday.

First, analytics writer Seth Walder breaks down three stat trends that could be pivotal this weekend. Then, fantasy writer Eric Moody highlights five players who are rostered in fewer than 50% of ESPN leagues as of Saturday and could be started in a jam. That's followed by NFL analyst Ben Solak's three potential surprises, NFL analyst Matt Bowen's key matchup to watch and sports betting analyst Pamela Maldonado's favorite bet for Week 15. We also asked our NFL Nation reporters to answer questions about interesting QB situations around the league.

Can the Packers generate a pass rush without Micah Parsons? Could quarterbacks J.J. McCarthy and Tyler Shough have big fantasy performances? Will the Eagles get upset by the Commanders? Can Bears rookie running back Kyle Monangai put together a huge day? Which bet stands out in Patriots-Ravens? And what has a full week of preparation looked like for Colts quarterback Philip Rivers? We dig into all of it.

Walder: Three key stat trends that could determine Week 16 winners

Will the Packers generate a pass rush without edge rusher Micah Parsons against the Bears?

There's no question the Packers will feel the effect of losing Parsons for the rest of the season to a torn ACL, but the sheer degree of the team's on-off splits with him is wild. With Parsons on the field this season, the Packers recorded a 43.9% pass rush win rate, which would be rank around third in the NFL. Without him? That number drops to 23.4%, which would rank 32nd. Their EPA allowed per dropback increased from 0.06 to 0.15. And opponents' pass rate over expectation against them increased from minus-10% to plus-2%, per NFL Next Gen Stats.

All of this is to say that Green Bay will need to find some pass rush against suddenly hard-to-sack Bears quarterback Caleb Williams. If edge rusher Lukas Van Ness can play after being limited in practice this week with a foot injury, that would help a lot. He has the highest pass rush win rate (12.7%) among all non-Parsons Packers with at least 100 pass rushes, but even his rate is basically half of Parsons' number (24.6%).

Can the Steelers stop Detroit's play-action?

The Lions, as usual, are one of the heaviest play-action teams. They run it on 30% of dropbacks, the fourth-highest rate in the league. And it makes sense since play-action is an offensive advantage that, on average, improves efficiency. But that might not be the case against the Steelers.

Pittsburgh is one of the rare teams with a defense that actually performs better against play-action (minus-0.10 EPA allowed per dropback, third best) than without it (plus-0.07, 20th). If Pittsburgh can derail one of Detroit's favorite offensive levers, that would be a huge edge in a contest between two playoff hopefuls.

How will Titans quarterback Cam Ward fare against the Chiefs' blitz?

The Titans face a suddenly winnable game against the Gardner Minshew-led Chiefs following Kansas City's elimination from playoff contention and Patrick Mahomes' torn left ACL. But the Chiefs present one issue for the Titans that has nothing to do with who is playing quarterback.

Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo's defense blitzes 35% of the time, the third-highest rate in the league. And that has been a particular weakness for Ward. While he currently ranks last in the NFL with a 31.2 QBR, that number drops to 13.7 when facing the blitz. Even with Ward's subtle improvements over the past two weeks (a 46.9 QBR from Week 11 on), he still has just a 9.5 QBR against the blitz. If the Titans want to get the better of the down-and-out Chiefs, Ward might need to connect on plays when Kansas City brings extra heat.

Moody: Five fantasy sleepers you need to pick up -- and can start this week

J.J. McCarthy, QB, Minnesota Vikings (34.3% rostered)

McCarthy has played well recently, scoring at least 20 fantasy points in two consecutive games. He benefits from elite pass catchers in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, and he adds value with his rushing ability. McCarthy now faces a Giants defense that has given up the second-most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks. New York has also allowed the most rushing attempts and rushing yards to the position.

Darren Waller, TE, Miami Dolphins (29.1% rostered)

Waller finished with a season high in targets (eight) and fantasy points (25.6) on Monday against the Steelers. Even though starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has been benched after a league-high 15 interceptions, rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers can still take advantage of a favorable matchup for Waller. The Bengals' defense has given up the most fantasy points per game to tight ends this season.

Schefter to McAfee: Tua benching the first step in Miami moving on

Adam Schefter joins Pat McAfee to break down the Dolphins' options after benching Tua Tagovailoa.

Michael Carter, RB, Arizona Cardinals (24.7% rostered)

Carter should be the Cardinals' lead back against the Falcons with Bam Knight on injured reserve after an ankle injury in Week 15. Carter stepped in once Knight left the game against Houston, finishing with 18 touches and 13.4 fantasy points. It was an impressive outing against an elite defense. The Falcons are a middle-of-the-road defense against running backs, making Carter a solid option for managers in deeper formats.

Tyler Shough, QB, New Orleans Saints (8.8% rostered)

Shough is a strong option thanks to his recent fantasy production and rushing upside. In the past three games, the rookie has completed 70% of his passes and scored at least 17 fantasy points in each outing. Shough also averaged 35.5 rushing yards per game during that span, scoring two rushing touchdowns. He should find success against a Jets defense that allowed Jacksonville's Trevor Lawrence to score 44.3 fantasy points in Week 15.

Jalen Coker, WR, Carolina Panthers (5.5% rostered)

Coker has seen at least four targets in five consecutive games and scored at least 11 fantasy points in three of them. The second-year receiver is trending up at the perfect time for managers in deeper formats. The Buccaneers have been eviscerated by quarterbacks since Week 12, allowing 1,098 passing yards and eight touchdowns. Atlanta quarterback Kirk Cousins just posted 26.9 fantasy points against their leaky secondary in Week 15. Coker is in a favorable spot catching passes from Bryce Young this week.

Solak: Don't be surprised if ...

Bears running back Kyle Monangai leads the league in rushing this week. D'Andre Swift is questionable for Saturday's game, and the Packers' defense will not just be lacking Parsons, but also elite run defending safety Evan Williams. On top of that, Chicago has two receivers confirmed out for this game (Luther Burden III and Rome Odunze), so it will likely skew extremely run heavy. Monangai could get the lion's share of the carries, putting the rookie in line for his third 100-yard game this season.

The Commanders upset the Eagles. Philadelphia's offense looked healed against the Raiders, while the Commanders' passing defense is one of the worst in the league (29th in passing yards allowed per game). But Washington coordinator Kliff Kingsbury has had offensive success against Philly coordinator Vic Fangio's defense. The Commanders have also continued to play hard in a lost season under coach Dan Quinn. Divisional upsets in December are always live, and the Eagles are not a trustworthy squad.

Shough wins Offensive Rookie of the Year. He was once an enormous underdog for this award at 200-1 -- now he's fifth in odds at 14-1. Shough gets an enormously depleted Jets secondary Sunday, and with a floundering offense on the other side, he might have enough drives and short fields to put up 30-plus points and 300-plus yards. The momentum is building.

Bowen: Key matchup to watch

Chicago's running game versatility vs. the Green Bay defense

The Bears rushed for 90 yards in the second half of the Week 14 matchup against the Packers. Swift and Monangai delivered plenty of body punches on a mixture of zone, power and misdirection run plays. And coach Ben Johnson's usage of the tight ends -- mostly off pre-snap movement -- gave the Bears both numbers and blocking angles at the point of attack. Look for Chicago to use heavy 12 personnel (one running back, two tight ends, two wide receivers) on Saturday night against Green Bay.

How important is a Bears victory vs. the Packers on Saturday?

Kimberley A. Martin, Louis Riddick, Peter Schrager and Domonique Foxworth discuss how important a Bears win would be over the Packers.

Maldonado: My favorite bet for Week 16

New England Patriots +2.5 at Baltimore Ravens

The Patriots are more reliable than the Ravens in terms of play volume and efficiency. New England consistently runs more offensive snaps, which shrinks variance and limits separation from its opponents. Meanwhile, Baltimore's 44% red zone touchdown rate is second lowest in the league, capping its ability to pull away against opponents who control possession even if it can move the ball. I like the Patriots inside the +2.5 points, but I could also see them winning outright.

NFL Nation: QB questions

What has Philip Rivers' first full week of preparation looked like for the Colts?

Rivers has taken the overwhelming majority of the first-team reps, and the goal this week is to make the offense a bit more aggressive than it was in Rivers' first game last Sunday. Rivers threw for 120 yards against the Seahawks, making it tough for the Colts to match Seattle score for score. ""That game was the plan that we had,"" he said. ""I don't feel any real limitations pushing the ball down the field. Am I going to throw it 60 yards? No, but I can't name many times I ever did that anyway."" -- Stephen Holder, Colts reporter

Where do things stand on Tyler Shough starting for the Saints next season?

Shough has proved his case lately. He ran for two touchdowns in a win against Tampa Bay and then engineered two comeback drives against Carolina last week. He has been able to do that even though injuries have the Saints now using fourth-team receivers and running backs. With the Saints falling down the draft order due to their recent wins, it would make sense to use their draft pick to build around Shough next year. -- Katherine Terrell, Saints reporter

What was the most interesting thing you heard from Bo Nix's four-touchdown day against Green Bay?

Broncos coach Sean Payton has put his QB under center more over the past four games than earlier in the season, with Nix's three highest totals for the year coming over that span. And it has cleaned up Nix's footwork and pumped up the efficiency of the Broncos' run game a bit. Broncos offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said this week, ""I think his footwork has gotten a lot better."" Nix has had three of his four games this season with at least 295 passing yards over those past four games, including the four-touchdown game against the Packers. -- Jeff Legwold, Broncos reporter

Da’Shawn Hand Hit on Patrick Mahomes Could Contribute to Travis Kelce’s Retirement Following the Season Then there is the career of tight end Travis Kelce to consider.","The NFL announced 22 fines for players around the league in accordance with their on-field behavior in Week 15, though noticeably absent from the list was Da’Shawn Hand of the Los Angeles Chargers who knocked Patrick Mahomes out for the season and dashed the Kansas City Chiefs’ playoff hopes in the process.

Hand, an eight-year veteran defensive lineman and league journeyman, went low with his hit on Mahomes during the Chiefs’ final drive on Sunday, December 14 at Arrowhead Stadium.

“After trying to extend a play to his right, [Mahomes] threw the ball away just before his left leg was twisted awkwardly, as he planted his foot and Chargers defensive lineman Da’Shawn Hand brought him down,” NFL.com’s Around the NFL Staff wrote following the game.

Mahomes left the field, with the team announcing shortly afterward that the QB had torn the ACL and LCL in his left knee and would miss the remainder of the game and the year.

In the meantime, backup quarterback Gardner Minshew entered the contest with the Chiefs trailing by three points and needing at least a field goal to potentially force overtime and keep their postseason chances alive. A few plays after he came in, Minshew threw an interception that sealed Kansas City’s fate.

The league could have punished Hand retroactively, likely via a fine, if the Office of Gameday Accountability had determined the hit on Mahomes was illegal. The referees did not throw a flag on the play, and the NFL ultimately deemed that Hand’s hit was clean, even though the result of it was catastrophic for Mahomes as well as the Chiefs.

Patrick Mahomes Could Miss Multiple Games Next Season With Knee Injury

Hand’s play on Mahomes also potentially changed the course of Kansas City’s franchise history in multiple ways.

A victory for the Chiefs last weekend and Mahomes’ continued health could have resulted in the team extending its playoff streak to 11 years. Kansas City’s streaks of seven consecutive AFC title game appearances also ended when Mahomes’ season did, as did the Chiefs’ streak of three straight Super Bowl appearances, which included wins following the 2022 and 2023 campaigns.

Mahomes could miss the beginning of next season because of the extra complications an LCL tear adds to a standard ACL injury, which might end up impacting the team’s record and playoff contention next year.

Da’Shawn Hand Hit on Patrick Mahomes Could Contribute to Travis Kelce’s Retirement Following the Season

Then there is the career of tight end Travis Kelce to consider. Kelce has three games remaining this season before his contract expires.

At 36 years old, Kelce has played 13 campaigns in the league. He has 10 Pro Bowl appearances, seven All-Pro selections, three championship rings and a surefire Hall of Fame statistical resumé.

Kelce has avoided talking about his potential retirement twice this week, once on his “New Heights” podcast and again during a media session on Friday.

However, the disappointing end to the 2025 season and the deflating injury to Mahomes could influence Kelce’s decision, as he has several lucrative media and business opportunities awaiting him in retirement from football.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2237018278-e1766266179971.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-20 20:00:19.083254

Isak, 26, made a significant impact off the bench as he broke the deadlock just 11 minutes after being brought on at the start of the second half.

However, the £125million summer signing was unable to celebrate his second Premier League goal for the club after being caught by a sliding challenge from defender Micky van de Ven.

Isak had to be helped from the field by medical staff with head coach Arne Slot admitting they face an anxious wait to discover how long he will be sidelined with a suspected lower leg injury.

“I don’t have any news on him but if a player scores, gets injured and doesn’t come back on the pitch or doesn’t try to come back, it’s usually not a good thing,” Slot said. “I cannot say anything more than that. That is just a gut feeling and nothing more than that. Nothing medical to say about it.

“I haven’t spoken to him about it yet but it’s a good thing he scored — a good goal assisted by Florian Wirtz.

“Let’s not be too negative yet. We don’t know yet. Let’s hope Alex is back with us soon but it is difficult to say.”

Victory came at a cost with right-back Conor Bradley taken off at half-time after being hurt in a collision with Djed Spence during the opening 45 minutes.

Florian Wirtz limped off late on but Liverpool are hopeful the Germany international was only suffering from cramp.

Dominik Szoboszlai collected a fifth yellow card of the season which means he will be suspended for the visit of Wolverhampton Wanderers to Anfield on December 27.

Having come off the bench to replace Isak as he made his comeback from injury after two months out, Jeremie Frimpong was subsequently subbed off in stoppage time.

Slot explained that was a tactical switch with Federico Chiesa introduced as Liverpool clung on to win against nine men following red cards for Xavi Simons and Cristian Romero.

“With Jeremie there is no problem at all,” Slot added. “I didn’t want to go down to 10 men for 30 seconds. This is the only country where players have to go off for 30 seconds if they’re injured. I adapted to that.

“I knew there wasn’t long to play and thought we struggled a lot. Playing 10 v 10 for half a minute with him being on the floor, I just went with Federico so no problem with him.

“With Alex and Conor, we have to wait. You could see our bench today but we are not the only team in this period picking up injuries because we play so many games.”

Liverpool appeared comfortable when Hugo Ekitike headed them 2-0 up but after Richarlison pulled one back in the 83rd minute panic set in. Even after Romero’s red card in stoppage time, the visitors failed to control proceedings and endured a nervy finale.

Slot said: “It wasn’t perfect, especially the last 10 minutes, but we pick up points and are developing in a way I want to see.

”I thought against nine men we would be able to keep them away from our goal but it looked as though we were down to nine and they had 11, which led to attack, after attack, after attack.“",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/20153848/GettyImages-2252231960-scaled-e1766263152182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-20 19:00:48.084374

Halftime update: Commanders 10, Eagles 7

This time, it was the Eagles' special teams that struggled, at least in the first half.

Will Shipley fumbled away the opening kickoff, setting the Commanders up at the Eagles' 26. The Eagles held Washington to a field goal.

Then after Jalen Hurts hit DeVonta Smith for a 6-yard TD, the Eagles missed a chance to extend their lead when Jake Elliott missed a 43-yard field goal. Shipley later made another mistake by taking the ball out of the end zone after the Commanders scored as the Eagles started their final drive of the first half at the 19 instead of the 35.

The Eagles set up for a 57-yard field goal in the final seconds. But Elliott missed that one. He got a break when Washington was ruled offsides. That gave Elliott a chance from 52, but he missed that as well.

The Eagles' offense was moving the ball as Hurts went 12-for-17 for 112 yards. while Saquon Barkley had 40 yards on 9 carries, while A.J. Brown had 8 catches for 86 yards.

Commanders 10, Eagles 7: Jacory Croskey-Merritt scores from 1

A Jake Elliott missed field goal, his fourth in five games, ended up leading to a Commanders touchdown. The key play was Marcus Mariota's 40-yard pass on the first play, from the Eagles' 33 down to the Eagles' 27. Washington got the ball down to the 1, where Croskey-Merritt converted on second down. That gave the Commanders a 10-7 lead with 3:40 left in the first half.

Eagles 7, Commanders 3: Jalen Hurts throws TD to DeVonta Smith

The Eagles finally got the offense going on their second drive. The Eagles marched down the field, getting four plays of 14 yards or more, including a 16-yard pass from Hurts to A.J. Brown down to the Washington 2.

A false start penalty on a tush push ended up pushing the Eagles back to the 6. That's where Hurts hit DeVonta Smith for the TD and a 7-3 lead with 2:37 left in the first quarter.

Commanders 3, Eagles 0: Will Shipley fumble on kickoff is costly

So much for the Eagles getting off to a strong start. Will Shipley fumbled away the opening kickoff and the Commanders recovered at the Eagles' 26. Washington ended up with a first down at the Eagles' 5, then settled for a 20-yard field goal instead of going for it on 4th-and-goal from the 3.

It was a curious decision considering the Commanders are out of playoff contention. Still, the Eagles must feel good to only be down a field goal with 11:39 left in the first quarter.

Dover, Delaware native Jordan Magee key LB for Commanders

Delaware native Jordan Magee, the Commanders' fifth-round pick in 2024, is having a strong second season in Washington. Magee has gotten into 14 games, starting 5. He has 41 tackles on the season.

Eagles inactives: Cameron Latu, Lane Carter, Jalen Carter not playing

Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson is missing his fifth straight game with a foot injury while defensive tackle Jalen Carter is missing his third with an injury to both shoulders. It's not known if either will be able to return next week against the Buffalo Bills.

The Eagles' other inactives were QB Sam Howell (emergency QB), RB AJ Dillon, DE Josh Uche, CB Mac McWilliams and TE Cameron Latu. Latu, a key special teams player, was on the injury report this week with a stinger. He was listed as questionable for the game.

Eagles give 2 practice-squad elevations, including EJ Jenkins

The Eagles elevated TE E.J. Jenkins and DB Brandon Johnson from the practice squad for the game against Commanders. Jenkins had an elevation against Minnesota on Oct. 19. It's the first elevation of Johnson's career. He was signed as an undrafted free agent out of Oregon last spring, waived, then re-signed to the practice squad.

Eagles vs. Commanders prediction

Eagles 30, Commanders 13: The Eagles can clinch the NFC East and the playoff berth that goes with it with a win. Considering that many of their veterans are either banged up or can use the rest, it's safe to assume the Eagles will pour everything into this game, then start relaxing over the final two (at Buffalo on Dec. 28 and home for the Commanders on Jan. 4) to gear up for the postseason. – Martin Frank

Eagles injury updates

The Eagles listed RT Lane Johnson (foot) and DT Jalen Carter (shoulders) as OUT. They listed TE Cameron Latu (stinger) as QUESTIONABLE.

Weather forecast for Eagles vs Commanders

The Eagles should face decent weather conditions, at least compared to their last game. A high temperature of 46 degrees is expected in Landover, Maryland. It should still be 41 degrees at 5 p.m., with light winds of 6 mph out of the southwest. The temps should drop only a few degrees during the game, and the winds shouldn't be a factor.

Quarterbacks Geno Smith Injury: Back and shoulder injury Analysis: Smith is on track to return in week 16 after missing week 15 with an injury to his throwing shoulder and his back.
Having practiced in full all week, Geno is likely all but over his injuries.
An injury to the throwing shoulder can linger and impact throwing power and accuracy, easily aggravating it with either a bad hit or overuse in a game.
Barkley's injury is undoubtedly a neuropraxia, or a very mild nerve disruption that is likely completely, or near completely, gone now.","Week 16 is the point of no return in fantasy football, and one bad injury decision can end your season. Saquon Barkley’s nerve scare, Kamara’s continued absence, risky returns like Drake London, and multiple concussion and knee situations are creating massive lineup traps that casual injury reports won’t catch. Below is a medical-driven breakdown of every key injury, explaining what actually impacts performance, re-injury risk, and snap counts, so you can make the right calls and survive the fantasy playoffs.

Quarterbacks

Geno Smith

Injury: Back and shoulder injury

Analysis: Smith is on track to return in week 16 after missing week 15 with an injury to his throwing shoulder and his back. The Raiders struggled mightily without Geno, and his return will be welcomed. Having practiced in full all week, Geno is likely all but over his injuries. Acute back injuries typically respond well to treatment, and I would not expect the back injury to significantly limit his ability. An injury to the throwing shoulder can linger and impact throwing power and accuracy, easily aggravating it with either a bad hit or overuse in a game. Fantasy managers who have made it to round two of the playoffs are not relying on Geno; however, his return bodes well for Brock Bowers.

Running Backs

Saquon Barkley

Injury: Stinger

Analysis: Saquon suffered a stinger on Sunday which knocked him out for a few plays, but ultimately finished the game without appearing to suffer any performance deficits. A stinger is an irritation to the nerves as they exit the neck and will have a wide range of impact. Nerve injuries have three different levels, each with a very sciencey name.

Neuropraxia: Mild injury to the myelin sheath that surrounds the nerve. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, and burning that lasts for minutes to a few days. This is what most stingers are, and likely where Barkley's injury falls. No prolonged deficits is expected

Axontmeosis: The nerve itself is injured, but not completely severed. Symptoms include weakness or paralysis, sensory loss, and pain. Recovery happens but extremely slowly (1mm/day). If this ever happens to a football player, their season is likely over.

Neurotmesis: Complete severance of the nerve: Symptoms include complete paralysis and sensory loss. This would be career-ending.

Barkley's injury is undoubtedly a neuropraxia, or a very mild nerve disruption that is likely completely, or near completely, gone now. This will not affect his production in week 16 but it should be noted that the area of the nerve that was affected, as well as the entire nerve distal to the affected area, will be at a higher risk for injury.",https://fantasyinjuryteam.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Drake-London-full-pic-3.webp,N,,2025-12-20 19:00:56.900374

""Good enough to go,"" Harrison said Friday after practice. ""We'll see Sunday.""

Of Harrison's work for the week prior to Friday's practice, coach Jonathan Gannon said ""I thought he looked pretty good.""

The heel injury wasn't a problem running, but any deceleration was an issue, Harrison said. Harrison also missed two games with appendicitis and left the game against the Colts with a concussion.

""It's been tough,"" Harrison said. ""The whole year has been tough, honestly. What we wanted it to be going into the year and where it is now, it's not what we expected. The whole year has been tough, but you keep going one day at a time and stick to your process.""

This season, Harrison has 40 receptions for 594 yards and four touchdowns in 10 games.

In Harrison's absences, Michael Wilson has shined as the top wide receiver, making 41 catches for 499 yards and three touchdowns in those four games. And tight end Trey McBride has been dominant of late and is coming off a game in Houston in which he tied his career high in catches (12) and set a career high in yards (134), along with two touchdowns.

Now the Atlanta defense will likely have to contend with Harrison as well. Harrison had six catches for 69 yards in the Tampa game in Week 13 before the heel injury. That was post-appendix surgery, and Harrison acknowledged he was anxious to get back on the field after an unprecedented sidelining for him.

TBA

Who are the Packers' inactives?

TBA

Will Tremaine Edmunds play vs. Packers?

The Bears could welcome back a key part of their defense in linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, who spent the last four weeks on injured reserve with a groin injury. Chicago is expected to activate Edmunds off IR before Saturday night's game, per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, so the Bears could have a dominant linebacker trio in Edmunds, T.J. Edwards and D'Marco Jackson against the Packers.

Will D'Andre Swift play in Week 16?

Chicago will likely lean on their 1-2 punch at running back with D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai, and it sounds like Swift will be good to go. Swift was listed on the injury report with a groin injury and is officially questionable for Week 16. ESPN's Jeremy Fowler said the expectation is Swift will play on Saturday night, which is great news for the NFL's second-best rushing attack.

Will Cole Kmet play vs. Packers?

With the Bears down two of their top receivers, the tight ends could see plenty of action in the passing game. While rookie Colston Loveland is expected to be a top target, veteran Cole Kmet has also proven a solid option as a receiver. Kmet suffered an ankle/knee injury last week, and he's officially questionable for Saturday night. It sounds like Kmet should be good to go, which would be huge for this offense as Kmet's been a solid blocker, as well.

Bears rule out Rome Odunze, Luther Burden III in Week 16

Chicago will be without top wide receivers Rome Odunze and rookie Luther Burden III against Green Bay. Odunze reaggravated his foot injury during warmups last week against the Cleveland Browns. Meanwhile, Burden suffered an ankle injury in the second half against Cleveland.

The Chicago Bears enter their Week 16 game against the Green Bay Packers with running back D'Andre Swift listed as questionable.

Swift popped up on the injury report this week with a groin issue and was only able to log limited practices before drawing a questionable tag.

However, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, Swift is indeed expected to suit up against the Packers on Saturday.

""Bears RB D'Andre Swift (questionable, groin) is expected to play today vs. Green Bay, per source,"" Fowler reported.

Not much of a surprise here, as it likely would've taken an act of God to keep Swift off the field for such an important game.

Swift is in the midst of what could be a career-best year in 2025.

The veteran running back enters Week 16 with 935 rushing yards, which is just 114 yards shy of his career-high. Swift needs two more rushing touchdowns and three more total scores to break his personal best marks in those areas.

Making those stats more impressive is the fact that Swift has ceded more and more touches to rookie back Kyle Monangai as the season has progressed.

Chicago and Green Bay will kick off from Lambeau Field at 8:20 p.m. ET on Saturday night. The winner will sit in first place in the NFC North.

Adding a player who can consistently win one-on-one is vital if the worst pass defense in the NFL is to turn things around in 2026.","BIGGEST WISH: Offensive line help

Regardless of whether it’s Jacoby Brissett or Kyler Murray under center in 2026, the offensive line needs aid. The long-term plan at right tackle remains a concern. Jonah Williams is a pending free agent and hasn’t stayed healthy (15 games in two seasons). Kelvin Beachum is also a free agent and has struggled. The interior has been a mess. The running back injuries haven’t helped, but the run-blocking struggles have been a main driver in the Cardinals being such a pass-heavy unit.

BIGGEST WISH: Pass catchers

With Kyle Pitts in the last year of his rookie deal, Atlanta has a massive choice to make: Pay the inconsistent TE, who has come on strong of late, or find a replacement. Regardless of that decision, the Falcons must find more weapons in the passing game. It can't be just Drake London moving forward. Atlanta needs a consistent No. 2 receiver. Despite playing in just nine games thus far, London leads the team with 810 receiving yards. Darnell Mooney is the No. 2 wideout with 364 yards. Adding additional pass catchers who can burn defenses that roll coverage to London is a must for Michael Penix Jr. to take the next step when he returns next season.

BIGGEST WISH: Defense

The league's worst defense needs help at all three levels. Cincinnati ranks dead last in the NFL in points, yards and yards per play allowed. It doesn't matter how explosive the offense is -- no team can win consistently with that type of play on D. With Trey Hendrickson and Joseph Ossai both heading to the open market, the pass rush needs help. Outside of DJ Turner II, the secondary needs upgrading. Geno Stone has been a disaster at safety and is likely gone in free agency. Cincy also needs its two rookie linebackers, Demetrius Knight Jr. and Barrett Carter, to improve immensely in the offseason. With a good chunk of cap space and a potential top-10 pick, the Bengals have to completely overhaul the defense this offseason.

BIGGEST WISH: Offensive line

Cleveland has another massive quarterback decision this offseason -- what else is new? Yet, it won’t matter if the offensive line remains a disaster. The Browns have the worst pass-blocking unit in football this season, and the much-maligned line opens precious few holes in the ground game. Injuries have exacerbated the problems. Cleveland has a hoard of O-linemen on expiring contracts ( Joel Bitonio , Jack Conklin , Wyatt Teller , Cam Robinson and Teven Jenkins ). General manager Andrew Berry needs to completely overhaul this unit in the offseason, or it won’t make a difference who is under center.

BIGGEST WISH: Running back

Patrick Mahomes' injury will garner all the attention this offseason, but the needs are clear for a Chiefs team that won't be participating in the playoffs for the first time since the 2014 campaign. Edge rusher is a pivotal need on defense. However, if we're handing out wishes, adding a playmaking running back shoots to the top of my list. Whether or not Mahomes is ready for the start of next season, the run game in K.C. must be better. Kareem Hunt can get 3 yards, but the 30-year-old isn't consistently gashing defenses. Isiah Pacheco has hit a wall, and seventh-round rookie Brashard Smith has accumulated just 95 ground yards over 14 games. The Chiefs haven't had a 1,000-yard rusher since Hunt's rookie year in 2017. A true dual-threat back would be big for Andy Reid's squad, especially if Mahomes misses time.

BIGGEST WISH: Quarterback

No quarterback could thrive behind this sieve offensive line that the Raiders have rolled out in 2025. Upgrading the blocking is a massive need in 2026. But finding a franchise QB takes precedence on this wish list. Geno Smith clearly isn’t the long-term answer, as a 35-year-old struggling his way through a turnover-plagued season. Drafting a signal-caller in Round 1 is the best way to breathe some fresh air into an organization living in the basement of the AFC West.

BIGGEST WISH: Resolution to the QB situation

Tua Tagovailoa's struggles have come to a head. The Miami quarterback was benched after more than a month of subpar play. The decision came 17 months after he signed a $212.4 million extension. It's a mess in Miami. Tua is owed $54 million guaranteed next year. Even with a post-June 1 release, he'd account for $67.4 million in dead money in 2026, per Over The Cap. We've seen teams take that nasty medicine in recent seasons (SEE: Denver's release of Russell Wilson and Atlanta's trade of Matt Ryan), but it's still a big pill to swallow, particularly for a cap-strapped team. It's difficult to imagine Miami turning back to Tagovailoa after a benching, but what are the franchise's other options? Seventh-rounder Quinn Ewers is getting his shot to make an impression. In a perfect world for the Dolphins, he pulls a Brock Purdy. Short of that, there aren't many pretty options. The free-agent pool is shallow. The Fins could draft a rookie and carry Tua as a Kirk Cousins-esque backup. There is no seamless option for the most pressing question in South Beach heading into 2026.

BIGGEST WISH: J.J. McCarthy and Justin Jefferson find chemistry

Oh, I could put down Cornerback or talk about the need for O-line depth, but the reality is that if McCarthy doesn't progress, none of those other discussions will mean bupkis. After missing his entire rookie campaign with a knee injury, it's been a roller-coaster second season for the former No. 10 overall pick. He'll go long stretches looking like a backup, then flash elite throws to close out games. Injuries have slowed the progress under Kevin O'Connell, and McCarthy has shown improvement in the past few weeks. Those strides need to be longer in Year 3. The signal-caller must find a changeup on his passes; touch is not a strength of his game. And if Santa could send a chemistry package for him and Jefferson, that would be amazing. The star receiver has made things work in past seasons with the likes of Nick Mullens and Josh Dobbs, so it's head-scratching seeing him unable to find a groove with McCarthy. That must change in the new year.

BIGGEST WISH: Pass rusher

Tyler Shough's stretch run has sparked the Saints, but the rebuilding club still has plenty of holes to fill. Another pass catcher alongside Chris Olave -- who's in line for an extension this offseason -- and interior O-line aid are certainly needs. Those additions would significantly help Shough's development. However, for me, adding a dynamic front-line defender tops the list. New Orleans has generated 29 sacks this season, tied for ninth-fewest in the league. 36-year-old Cam Jordan leads the team with 6.5 sacks. Adding a weapon to pair with Chase Young and Carl Granderson would boost an average defense heading into 2026.

BIGGEST WISH: Coaching stability

Since Tom Coughlin resigned in January 2016, Big Blue has endured one disaster after another. First, it was Ben McAdoo and his oversized suit going 13-15. Pat Shurmur bumbled his way to 9-23. Joe Judge was in over his head, finishing 10-23. Brian Daboll at least won a playoff game before bottoming out, ending his run this year with a 20-40-1 record. The Giants have been rudderless for a decade. New York has to nail this hire. The next coaching staff must be able to get the best out of quarterback Jaxson Dart while turning around a moribund defense. Another swing-and-miss on the coaching hire, and we’ll be right back here in two years writing a similar blurb.

BIGGEST WISH: Quarterback

The rebuilding Jets have holes aplenty, but the same need that has persisted for generations remains: quarterback. Justin Fields proved he’s not the answer. Tyrod Taylor is no more than a veteran backup. Brady Cook ... no need to pile on the undrafted rookie. Big-name stand-ins like Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers disappointed. High picks like Zach Wilson , Sam Darnold and Mark Sanchez flamed out. The singular wish of every Jets fan for the past half-century has been to have a consistent, stable quarterback situation. The yearning continues. Regardless of where the team lands in the final draft order, the Jets, after their midseason trades, have the ammo to move up for a QB. Aaron Glenn and Darren Mougey need to succeed where so many others have failed with this long-suffering franchise.

BIGGEST WISH: Weapons for Cam Ward

Getting the right coach in the building is an important step, but adding playmakers around Ward is paramount for the young QB to thrive in Year 2. Chimere Dike and Elic Ayomanor have shown flashes as rookies, but the Titans lack a true No. 1 threat. At this point, we can’t presume Calvin Ridley will be that guy. Rookie tight end Gunnar Helm has also displayed upside and rapport with Ward, but with Chigoziem Okonkwo an impending free agent, another TE could be an option. Getting Ward a go-to target will go a long way toward the No. 1 overall pick smoothing out some of the rough patches that have plagued him during an up-and-down debut season.

BIGGEST WISH: Young defenders

Washington's old defense has looked its age for the bulk of the season, ranking 31st in yards allowed and yards per play through 14 games, as well as 26th in points surrendered. The Commanders don't do much well on D, ranking in the bottom five against the run and pass. Adam Peters needs to overhaul the unit with young, fresh playmakers at all three levels. The biggest need is on the edge, where a 36-year-old Von Miller leads the team with seven sacks. A coverage linebacker and youth in the secondary are also on the wish list.

BIGGEST WISH: Edge rusher

I know, I know, I know. Dallas isn't officially eliminated from the postseason. Yet with less than a 1% shot at overtaking Philly for the division, I think we're in the clear. Entering Week 16, Next Gen Stats put the Cowboys in the playoffs 80 times in 10,000 simulations (0.8%). Their faint hopes could be dashed before they even take the field on Sunday, if the Eagles beat the Commanders on Saturday evening. If you want to hang on that slim shot, feel free to stop reading. For everyone else ...

The Cowboys' defense needs help all over the field. Safety is a concern, and Donovan Wilson is set to hit free agency. Corner Trevon Diggs, who hasn't played since Week 6, is a cut candidate. Dallas could use a coverage linebacker. However, an edge rusher remains the most significant need. James Houston leads the Cowboys with 5.5 sacks. The team has just 29 total sacks through 14 games. Adding a player who can consistently win one-on-one is vital if the worst pass defense in the NFL is to turn things around in 2026.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/oowfjs80hpoj90l6seus,N,,2025-12-20 14:59:32.999043

Oh, and side note: he put up 10/16/3 rushing against them in the NFC Championship last season.
Philly also gives up the second-most rushing YPG (23.5) to QBs, so you could do considerably worse at QB than Mariota this week.
Jacobs is at 4.71 YPC on zone runs, which are 62% of his runs, so it’s a solid matchup.
This is a little scary, since D'ANDRE SWIFT (groin) was limited all week and is still questionable.","D.C. gives up the most receiving YPG (98.1) and fifth-most receptions per game (7.4) to slot receivers, and it’s also a strong schematic matchup for DEVONTA SMITH, who averages 2.08 YPRR and .21 TPRR on 210 routes against Cover 3 (27.1%) and Cover 1 (23.1%), which they use half the time. Not everyone can eat in the passing game for Philly (most likely), and he posted only 10/80 in two games against them last year, but DeVonta is DUE.

D.C uses Cover 3 (27.1%) and Cover 1 (23.1%) at a 50.2% clip, and DALLAS GOEDERT averages a weak 1.49 YPRR and .20 TPRR on 180 routes against those coverages. However, he got them for 7/85 in last postseason, and D.C. gives up the sixth-most receiving YPG (64.6) and the third-most receiving TDs per game (.6) to TEs, along with the third-most schedule-adjusted FPG to TEs the last five weeks (+7.2) and the most to TEs split out (+4.6). The matchup is too appealing to ignore.

There’s a lame expected total of 44.5, but it’s hard to argue with the positive matchups for his top three receivers, and it’s also a solid schematic matchup for JALEN HURTS, who averages 7.93 YPA with a 4.3% CPOE and 18/139 rushing on 225 dropbacks against Cover 3 (27.1%) and Cover 1 (23.1%), which they use half the time. Washington also gives up the fifth-most passing YPG (259.9) and the second-most passing TDs per game (2.0) to QBs. Oh, and side note: he put up 10/16/3 rushing against them in the NFC Championship last season.

No RT Lane Johnson is a buzz kill, but SAQUON BARKLEY is on a mini roll, and this matchup is borderline elite, since D.C. gives up 12th-most adjusted YBC/ATT (2.22), the sixth-most rushing YPG (109.5), and the eighth-most receiving YPG (35.9) to RBs. Barkley got them for 15/118/3 rushing in this matchup last January, and Tyrone Tracy dropped 25 FP against them last week with 15/70/1 rushing and 3/27/1 receiving.

Philly gives up the 13th-most receiving YPG (107.4) and the seventh-most YPR (14.19) to outside receivers, and they use Cover 3 (28.9%) and Cover 6 (21.2%) at a 50.1% clip, and TERRY MCLAURIN averages a massive 4.28 YPRR and .28 TPRR on 67 routes against those coverages. They could always get stud Quinyon Mitchell on him, but based on alignment numbers, McLaurin should see more of Adoree' Jackson, who is improved but still roastable. McLaurin usually plays well in division games, and he got them for 3/51/1 last postseason.

Philly allows the eight-fewest passing YPG (210.4) and the fewest passing TDs per game (.9), and they have limited QBs to 1 or fewer TD passes in nine of their last 10 games. However, they also use Cover 3 (28.9%) and Cover 6 (21.2%) at a 50.1% clip, and MARCUS MARIOTA averages a strong 9.24 YPA with a 6.9% CPOE and 5/45/1 rushing on 96 dropbacks against those coverages. Philly also gives up the second-most rushing YPG (23.5) to QBs, so you could do considerably worse at QB than Mariota this week.

With good matchups for Dallas Goedert and DeVonta Smith, someone is going to be the odd man out, but it’s a good schematic and individual matchup for A.J. BROWN, who has hit 11.9+ FP in five straight with 10+ targets in four straight before last week, when they attempted 15 passes. He averages 2.97 YPRR and .32 TPRR on 183 routes against Cover 3 (27.1%) and Cover 1 (23.1%), which they use 50.2% of the time. They have been better against the pass and give up the 13th-fewest schedule-adjusted FPG to outside WRs the last five weeks, so a dud game wouldn’t surprise me, but he’s been too hot to sit and the matchup very good schematically and individually.

The Eagles use Cover 3 (28.9%) and Cover 6 (21.2%) at a 50.1% clip, and DEEBO SAMUEL averages a solid 1.76 YPRR and .24 TPRR on 152 routes against those coverages. However, Philly gives up the third-fewest receiving YPG (48.5) and the fourth-fewest receptions per game (5.3) to slot receivers, and he’ll see a lot of stallion Cooper DeJean, so there’s a little more downside than usual for Deebo.

With DT Jalen Carter out, it’s actually a good spot for Washington's running game, and they have a top-10 grade in our OL/DL matchup report, since they block up 1.98 YBC/ATT and Philly gives up 1.98. They give up the 16th-most rushing YPG (97.2) and the 15th-most rushing TDs per game (.7) to RBs, so they’re basically a middling matchup and better than that when Carter is out. But with CHRIS RODRIGUEZ expected back, it’s likely a hot-hand situation with JACORY CROSKEY-MERRITT, and JEREMY MCNICHOLS caps both their upside with most of the passing game work, leading the backfield in route share last week at 42%.

He was cruising again last week until Christian Watson went down, but it looks like JORDAN LOVE will have Watson, and it’s a strong schematic matchup for him, since he averages 8.15 YPA with a 6.2% CPOE and 8/58 rushing on 184 dropbacks against Cover 3 (28.7%) and Cover 2 (22.7%), which they use at a 51.4% clip. Love got them for 234/3 passing two weeks ago, so if Chicago can put up a fight on offense and forced Love to drop back 30+ times, he should be in solid shape

The Packers block up 1.83 YBC/ATT (24th-most) and the Bears give up 2.67 (4th-most), so it’s a solid matchup from an OL/DL standpoint. Over the last five weeks, the Bears face 37% of their carries on man/gap runs and give up 5.41 YPC (7th-worst), and JOSH JACOBS is at 5.01 YPC on those runs (9th best). Jacobs is at 4.71 YPC on zone runs, which are 62% of his runs, so it’s a solid matchup. But the Bears have given up 19.4+ FP to a RB just once this season, and Jacobs’ injury status is what’s shaky, first and foremost. If he ends up being inactive, then you can confidently start backup EMANUEL WILSON and expect 15+ touches.

Chicago gives up the 12th-fewest receiving YPG (92.5) to outside receivers, but they run Cover 3 (28.7%) and Cover 2 (22.7%) at a 51.4% clip, and CHRISTIAN WATSON averages a strong 2.42 YPRR and .23 TPRR on 62 routes against those coverages. They’ve also given up the 8th-most schedule-adjusted FPG to outside receivers, and Watson crushed them for 4/89/2 receiving in this matchup two weeks ago. Of course, you can’t view him like we did going into last week, since he was completely healthy and now has dealt with a shoulder injury.

Chicago gives up the seventh-fewest receptions per game (6.6) to outside receivers aligned, but they use Cover 3 (28.7%) and Cover 2 (22.7%) at a 51.4% clip, and ROMEO DOUBS averages a solid 1.86 YPRR and .18 TPRR on 135 routes against those coverages. Of course, he was catch-less (2 targets) against the Bears in Week 13, and rookie MATTHEW GOLDEN is back in the mix while Christian Watson is expected to play.

TE LUKE MUSGRAVE has shown some signs of life lately, but his body of work is too poor to count on him so late in the season, and the Bears are now giving up the 12th-fewest schedule-adjusted FPG to TEs the last five weeks.

Green Bay gives up the seventh-fewest passing YPG (208.6) and the fewest rushing YPG (10.6) to QBs, so it’s a less-than-ideal matchup and spot for CALEB WILLIAMS, who won’t have his two of his top targets in WRs Rome Odunze and Luther Burden. It’s not hopeless, at least, since the Packers use the third-highest rate of zone coverage (79.1%), and Caleb is improved against zone and averages a workable 7.04 YPA with a .4% CPOE and 23/188 rushing on 379 dropbacks against the coverage. Of course, it’s still a sub-optimal matchup and spot, and Williams posted a weak 186/2 passing, 1 INT, and 4/15 rushing in this matchup two weeks ago.

Green Bay allows the 15th-most adjusted YBC/ATT (2.17), the 12th-fewest rushing YPG (87.6), and the eighth-fewest receiving YPG (25.9) to RBs, and they’re still a bottom-12 matchup by schedule-adjusted FPG the last five weeks. This is a little scary, since D'ANDRE SWIFT (groin) was limited all week and is still questionable. If he’s active, it’s not a terrible spot in terms of the OL/DL matchup, since the Bears get 2.56 YBC/ATT, and the Packers allow 2.17. Obviously, if Swift is out, KYLE MONANGAI would likely have a bell cow role with 20+ touches in this run-heavy offense.

Green Bay gives up the eighth-most receiving YPG (112.9) and the 14th-fewest YPRR (1.89) to outside receivers, so it’s not a bad or good matchup. But over the last five weeks, they have given up the 8th-most schedule-adjusted FPG to outside WRs (+3.0), and with Luther Burden and Rome Odunze out, D.J. MOORE will be needed. That’s great if you don’t have strong options and need Moore, but it’s not an ideal schematic matchup, since they use the third-highest rate of zone coverage (79.1%), and he averages a poor 1.52 YPRR and a weak .17 TPRR on 302 routes against zone. To that point, Moore put up four fewer receiving yards than I did in the first matchup two weeks ago (1 catch for -4) and I was on my ass on the couch.

Veteran OLAMIDE ZACCHEAUS should be a factor stepping in for Luther Burden mainly, but Green Bay has been tough inside all year. They’ve slipped up a little, but still give up the 16th-fewest (or most) schedule-adjusted FPG to the slot.",https://static.fantasypts.com/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-20 14:59:40.182504

No decisions have been made on the future of Kevin Stefanski, the two-time NFL Coach of the Year.","It feels like ages ago that the Cardinals started 2-0. Since then, they've lost 11 out of 12 games as the offense was increasingly decimated by injuries, including a foot sprain that has sidelined quarterback Kyler Murray since Week 5 and countless hits to receivers and running backs.

Owner Michael Bidwill has been supportive of coach Jonathan Gannon, who overachieved with a rebuilding roster in his first two seasons, jumping from 4-13 to 8-9 last season. His young staff, including offensive coordinator Drew Petzing and defensive coordinator Nick Rallis, has continued to grow into their roles on the job. And Gannon and general manager Monti Ossenfort have yet to pick their own QB, taking on Murray -- with a contract that fully guarantees him $36.8 million next season, plus another $19.5 million if he's on the roster March 15 -- when they were hired in 2023.

With potentially a new QB, can the Cardinals make a leap back toward contention next season in a division in which the other three teams are all currently competing for the NFC's No. 1 seed? If Bidwill decides the answer is yes, the sense is he'll stay the course. Putting all the factors together and noting the overwhelming number of injuries this year, one wouldn't expect a change in Arizona.

The Falcons got a positive jolt last on Thursday night of Week 15 when they stunned the Buccaneers. But the season remains a resounding disappointment thanks to a 5-9 record, a season-ending ACL injury to quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and no shot at the playoffs.

Owner Arthur Blank has shown patience in the past, but is it running out with a franchise that hasn't made the playoffs in eight years? He plans to evaluate the futures of coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot as the season draws to a close, as most owners do following trying campaigns.

A strong finish certainly wouldn't hurt their cause, and if Kirk Cousins finishes strong, it would justify a part of the QB decisions made last year. But people familiar with Blank's thinking expect potential changes in some form to the football operation regardless. Nothing is decided and won't be until after the season.

Coach Zac Taylor has two years left on his contract, and all indications are that Taylor should return. Burrow's injuries -- including a severe turf toe injury that required surgery in September, costing him nine games -- have been a driving force in the team's struggles. Bengals owner Mike Brown believes in Taylor, who led Cincinnati to Super Bowl LVI during the 2021 season and the AFC title game the year after, and historically has not wanted to pay coaches not to coach.

Assuming Taylor is back, the biggest question is whether he'll make a defensive coordinator change for the second consecutive year. The unit has been one of the NFL's worst this season under Al Golden, as injuries to star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson and first-round pick Shemar Stewart crippled the pass rush. But when Taylor was asked about the defense recently, he indicated beefing up the D-line to make the entire unit better was the priority, rather than wholesale changes. And there does seems to be an argument, as Cincy's defense from Weeks 11-15 gave up six fewer points per game and allowed nearly 70 fewer passing yards per game compared to the first 10 weeks. The Bengals also rank sixth in the NFL in takeaways since Week 11. Progress.

No decisions have been made on the future of Kevin Stefanski, the two-time NFL Coach of the Year. The Browns know Stefanski can coach, and he has maintained a consistent approach amid the adversity of a transition year with a young roster. But the hard reality is the Browns are 6-25 over the past two seasons, putting everything up for evaluation.

The organization has already undergone a major change this year: chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta, who presided over football matters for 10 seasons remotely from his San Diego home, left the organization last month to become the Colorado Rockies' president of baseball operations. A Harvard graduate who appeared in the book Moneyball, which was later adapted into the movie of the same title, DePodesta influenced the hires of fellow Ivy Leaguers as head coach (Stefanski) and general manager (Andrew Berry). He also built out one of the NFL's most robust data and analytics staffs -- infrastructure that will largely remain in place, though it's unclear if his old role will continue to exist.

The Browns' rookie class has been one of the NFL's best, and it'll look even better if quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders can develop into a long-term option. How Stefanski and his staff continue to bring along Sanders will be part of the evaluation over the final three games as Cleveland approaches a QB crossroads. Deshaun Watson is (finally) entering the final year of his $230 million fully guaranteed contract in 2026. And the team has significant draft capital -- including two first-round picks -- to potentially target another QB in April.

Does owner Jimmy Haslam believe Stefanski is the right coach to bring a young team and young quarterback(s) into the next phase of the Browns' build? If not, Haslam might opt to move on, and Stefanski would immediately become a top candidate elsewhere.

Legendary coach Andy Reid isn't getting fired, and people who know Reid well say he has given no indications he'll walk away at age 67. For the first time in years, he'll finally have a full offseason to recharge. As one person close to him said: ""Coach Reid ain't going out like this.""

But after seven consecutive AFC championship game appearances, five Super Bowls and three rings, the Chiefs find themselves in the unfamiliar position of playing out the string. Patrick Mahomes will spend the offseason rehabbing from ACL and LCL surgery, one that challenges whether he'll be ready to start the season. Travis Kelce could retire, though no decision has been made. Another roster reboot, as GM Brett Veach has executed adeptly in the past, could be afoot.

One situation to watch: Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy chose not to sign an extension in the offseason and is set to become a free agent. Nagy will be a top head coaching candidate and could well land a job. If he doesn't, Nagy could become a hot candidate for a play-calling job elsewhere. That would mean Reid needs a new OC, with several of his former assistants -- including Eric Bieniemy and perhaps Giants interim HC Mike Kafka -- among potential candidates.

The Raiders are 2-12. Two coordinators (OC Chip Kelly and special teams coordinator Tom McMahon) have been fired. Veteran quarterback Geno Smith, acquired for a third-round pick, has thrown 14 interceptions. No. 6 overall pick Ashton Jeanty has rushed 200 times for only 700 yards, with little running room. Superstar pass rusher Maxx Crosby, who signed a contract extension last March, appeared to hit a breaking point in last week's shutout loss to the Eagles.

It all has the fate of 74-year-old coach Pete Carroll very much in doubt. No stranger to making changes, mercurial owner Mark Davis will weigh the feedback he gets from all sides of his building as he considers the possibility of another. Meanwhile, Carroll is intent on convincing the owner he should return.

Legendary quarterback Tom Brady and his business partner Egon Durban have wielded significant influence since becoming Raiders minority owners last year. Brady is close with former Michigan teammate and current GM John Spytek, with both serving as the sounding board for one another. While Spytek was Brady's GM target last year, Brady's prime target for head coach was Ben Johnson, who took the Bears job instead. Expect Brady -- who has spent little time in the Raiders building as he balances his broadcasting duties on Fox and other business interests -- to increase his presence as the decision closes in.

Davis is his own man, though. And all the voices around him report to him. He has won three titles in four years with the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces and believes he can replicate that success with the Raiders. Whatever Davis wants to do ultimately is what will happen, and it's not yet clear what that will be.

When Miami parted ways with GM Chris Grier in October after a 2-7 start, the message publicly and privately was clear: Coach Mike McDaniel would finish the season, with hopes of the team responding and showing McDaniel is the right man for the job.

The Dolphins face major organizational decisions on several other fronts: Do they bite the bullet and release Tagovailoa, who is due $54 million fully guaranteed next season (and would count over $99 million in dead cap over two years)? Do they go into a deeper rebuild by trading other assets in the coming months? And who will take over as GM to navigate it all?

First, owner Stephen Ross must decide the fate of McDaniel, who still has a winning record (34-31) and two playoff appearances in four seasons. Ross has long been a believer in McDaniel, and last year extended his contract through 2028.

To be sure, this 6-8 season has been a disappointment. After going 14-3 last season, the Vikings have experienced a mess of injuries -- including to quarterback J.J. McCarthy, whose development was a priority after he missed his entire rookie season because of meniscus surgery. (McCarthy has played better in recent weeks and now is 4-4 as the starter.)

Aaron Glenn's first season as head coach has been filled with adversity: An 0-7 start. Trading two of the franchise's best players (Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams). Benching quarterback Justin Fields. A 3-11 record that has them in the running for the No. 1 pick.

At 4-10, the Saints are long out of the playoff chase. However, there's a case to be made that not only has Kellen Moore's first season been a success, but that New Orleans is also the hottest team in the division, with wins over the Bucs and Panthers in a five-day span.

This was never going to be a championship season in New Orleans, and Moore's work has impressed people around the league. He'll be back in 2026 with a roster that will continue to evolve as he builds the program.

That doesn't mean there won't be changes. After a brutal first half of the season on defense, Quinn took over play-calling duties from his longtime assistant Joe Whitt Jr., who seems unlikely to return as defensive coordinator.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/udgynpnb8dbfgognvncc,N,,2025-12-20 12:59:38.783746
