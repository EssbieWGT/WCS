Totally generational bro, for real. Those would be some seriously generational trivia answers. I don't know if I've ever heard of anything as generational as that.

Looking for the top NFL players to watch this season? Redditors have compiled a comprehensive list of the best players in the league for 2024. Here are some of the standout athletes across various positions:

Quarterbacks

Lamar Jackson (Baltimore Ravens) - #1

""Being completely objective for a second, I think Lamar Jackson has the highest ceiling of any football player I've ever seen.""

""Lamar is number 1. All is right with the world.""

Josh Allen (Buffalo Bills) - #3

""I know some people will argue about Lamar/Allen and who deserves #1 (like the MVP race), but both are definitely deserving about being top 2.""

Joe Burrow (Cincinnati Bengals) - #5

""The breakdowns of Joe and Ja'Marr in this post are poetry, though.""

Jared Goff (Detroit Lions) - #65

""Baker over Goff is the big surprise for this section. I agree they’re both in that range of 5-10 for QB where ranking of the group is debatable.""

Wide Receivers

Ja'Marr Chase (Cincinnati Bengals) - #4

""Holy shit, that long TD against the panthers - Chase is so damn good""

Justin Jefferson (Minnesota Vikings) - #10

""There's a lot of elite players, but then there's a handful at the very top above the elite. Justin Jefferson is definitely in that conversation""

""He holds the record for receiving yards in each of his first five seasons—yes, every one of them. He is the fastest WR to ever reach 5000 yards.""

Puka Nacua (Los Angeles Rams) - #69

""Puka, Goff, and Verse. Today is a big day for my heart.""

Running Backs

Saquon Barkley (New York Giants) - #2

Derrick Henry (Tennessee Titans) - #9

""I just want to shoutout /u/broccolibolibush42 for the fantastic write-up of King Henry. Very entertaining and you did him proud.""

Defensive Players

Patrick Surtain (Denver Broncos) - #6

""As someone that was a Surtain truther based wholly on my uneducated impressions, it is nice to see the numbers showing what an absolute beast he is.""

Myles Garrett (Cleveland Browns) - #7

Xavier McKinney (Green Bay Packers) - #t-29

""NFC North Gandhi* over here trying to prevent a Lions-Packers bloodbath in the comment section with that 'T-29th' for McKinney and Joseph.""

Jalen Carter (Philadelphia Eagles) - #25

""Carter was ranked the #5 interior defender of the 2024 season per PFF... Carter is two. That’s showing up.""

Vita Vea (Tampa Bay Buccaneers) - #67

""I knew nothing about Vita Vea until the Bucs/Chiefs superbowl, and apparently him returning was a big deal. It was, in fact, a big deal. He's an actual Balrog.""

Offensive Linemen

Lane Johnson (Philadelphia Eagles) - #8

""Pave the Lane""

Trey Smith (Kansas City Chiefs) - #70

Tight Ends

George Kittle (San Francisco 49ers) - #21

""Thank god the voters had some sense and voted Kittle over Bowers. Better rate stats across the board and a much better blocker.""

Historical Significance: Redditors emphasize the unprecedented nature of the comeback:

""I think single handedly the most absurd comeback in NFL history and likely will never ever be topped again, in the effing SB no less. Tom Brady went on a freaking rampage in 2 quarters.""

Falcons' Play-Calling Blunders: The Falcons' decisions in the final quarter contributed significantly to their collapse:

""Proceeds to throw on first down, get sacked, hold, and then lose 30 yards of yardage just to punt. Absolute masterclass""

""Shanahan totally lost in his own genious. Run the ball three times. Take it to the two minute warning. Kick the field goal. Go to Disney World.""

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — Every coach in the NFL talks about how hard it is to win games.

Mike Vrabel hopes the New England Patriots' 26-20 comeback victory over the struggling Cincinnati Bengals was a reminder to his team that even after becoming the NFL’s first team to 10 wins this season, it will need to bring its best every week to keep stacking victories.

“I think that they found a way to win,” Vrabel said. “We’ll have to kind of keep that fine balance of understanding that wins are important, but improving at this time of the year is what’s most important.”

That is especially true for a team that will likely head into a “Monday Night Football” matchup with the New York Giants without two starters on an offense line that has been one of the most stable in the league.

Left guard Jared Wilson limped off in the first series of Sunday’s win with an ankle injury, and rookie left tackle Will Campbell was carted off in the third quarter with a knee injury.

It marked the biggest shakeup this season for the starting group of Campbell, Wilson, center Garrett Bradbury, right guard Mike Onwenu and right tackle Moses Morgan that has started 11 of 12 games. The lone deviation from that quintet was in Week 4 when Ben Brown started in place of Wilson, who was inactive with ankle and knee injuries.

Vrabel said Monday that Campbell’s injury would require him to miss some games.

“He won’t be out there this week. It’s going to be a couple weeks,” Vrabel said. “We’ll have to make a decision here on the roster to see how long that will be and go from there. But it’s nothing that’s going to, hopefully, put him out for the entire season.”

The coach was a little more optimistic about the prospects for Wilson, saying his status would be dependent upon how he responds to rehab and practice.

Vederian Lowe replaced Campbell on Sunday, with Brown again taking Wilson’s spot. If Wilson and Campbell remain out for an extended period, the good news is both Brown and Lowe have ample starting experience. Lowe started 13 games at left tackle last season and Brown logged 10 starts at center in 2024 after David Andrews went on injured reserve.

What’s working

Last season, Maye struggled to find people to throw the ball to. This season, he continues to have his pick of capable pass catchers.

Following tight end Hunter Henry’s seven-catch, 115-yard performance Sunday, the Patriots have had four straight games with a 100-yard receiver. Henry joined wide receiver DeMario Douglas (100 yards vs. Atlanta on Nov. 2), receiver Mack Hollins (106 at Tampa Bay on Nov. 9) and receiver Stefon Diggs (105 vs. the New York Jets on Nov. 13. It's the first time the team has had a 100-yard receiver in four straight games since the 2018 season.

What needs help

The Patriots twice failed to score touchdowns with the ball on the 1-yard line.

Leading 17-13 in the third quarter, they had a touchdown pass to Henry nullified by an offensive pass interference call on Hollins. Two plays later, on fourth down, Rhamondre Stevenson was stopped on a run short of the goal line.

Ahead 20-13 in the fourth, Maye’s third-down quarterback sneak attempt on the goal line was stuffed, forcing them to settle for a field goal.

Stock up

Cornerback Marcus Jones, fresh off winning AFC defensive player of the month in October, returned a second-quarter interception 33 yards for a touchdown. It marked the second pick-6 of his career and second against Cincinnati. He also had an INT that he returned 69 yards for a TD against the Bengals as a rookie in 2022.

Stock down

With defensive tackle Milton Williams sitting out for the first time this season and Khyiris Tonga leaving early in the first quarter with a chest injury, the Patriots — who came in allowing an NFL-low 84.7 yards rushing per game — gave up 107 to Bengals running back Chase Brown. It was the most yards allowed by New England to a running back this season.

Injuries

Further testing was planned to reveal the severity of the injuries to Wilson and Campbell. But the extent of Tonga’s chest injury and an ankle injury to special teamer Brendan Schooler are also ones to watch heading into Monday.

Key number

4 — The Patriots have had streaks of at least nine straight wins in a season four times in team history. In addition to this season, they had a 12-game winning streak in 2003, a 16-game streak in 2007 and a 10-game streak in 2015.

Next steps

New England returns home to host the New York Giants next Monday night in its final game before its bye.

Share your views and thoughts on tonight's game at live@theathletic.com

The ""MVP!"" chants were loud and present at SoFi Stadium as Matthew Stafford was putting on the full display of what has turned his 17th NFL season into his best yet. He was lofting deep passes to Davante Adams, converting a 3rd-and-19 to Puka Nacua and tossing a no-look touchdown pass to Colby Parkinson as Todd Bowles' Buccaneers had zero answers for him, much like the rest of the NFL this season.

Stafford is up to 30 touchdowns and two interceptions, and over the past eight games, he's tossed 25 touchdowns without a single pick. He's now one of four quarterbacks to start a season with a touchdown-to-interception ratio this strong, joining a class of Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.

For as long as Stafford can be this dialed in before the snap and after, the Rams will absorb the personnel losses they're seeing around him. He took the field down three original starters in wide receiver Tutu Atwell, tight end Tyler Higbee and right tackle Rob Havenstein. But with Adams and Nacua at his disposal, everything is working for Stafford as he plays in a special kind of unison with what Sean McVay is dialing up for him.

Much of this Rams season to date has been about whether the offense and defense could be prolific enough to make up for a disastrous special teams unit. That was especially true with the field goals, as Joshua Karty missed more kicks than anyone else prior to his benching.

But not only have the Rams solidified their protection as well as their snaps with Jake McQuaide over the past few games, but they might have found a kicker, too. Harrison Mevis is now 13-for-13 on extra points, and he got to try his first two field goal attempts and knocked those through from 40 and 52 yards.

Mevis has always had a strong leg, dating back to when he set a Southeastern Conference record with a 61-yard game-winner at Missouri. But if he can add a steadiness to the operation in addition to the potential to hit from distance, he'll make this Rams team that much harder to keep from scoring with how Matthew Stafford is playing.

This week was supposed to be a major challenge for the Rams defensive backfield. They were facing Baker Mayfield, Emeka Egbuka and Chris Godwin with a group that was now down its top two players, with cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon and safety Quentin Lake on injured reserve. But all it meant was that someone other than Lake could be the star on the back end.

Cobie Durant ripped a pass out of a receivers hands and returned it 50 yards for a touchdown. Emmanuel Forbes Jr. added his second interception in three games in addition to five pass deflections. And with Kobie Turner and Jared Verse winning in the pass rush, the group held Mayfield to his worst game of the season, as he finished 9-of-19 for 41 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions before leaving the game with a shoulder injury.

The 103 yards the secondary allowed to Mayfield and Teddy Bridgewater combined are their fewest in a game this season.

The challenges will still come in communication and alignment for younger and newer defenders as the season trudges on without Lake, who is targeting a return for the postseason. But Witherspoon could be back in the next month, which would open Durant up to slide inside and allow the Rams to continue to get playmakers on the field in their dime looks.

Above are the updated standings for the NFC West. With tonight's win, the Los Angeles Rams improve to 9-2 and are atop the NFC standings as the No. 1 seed. They are one game up on the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC West and a game ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears for the NFC's No. 1 seed.

The Rams also lead the NFC West in point differential with 127.

Above are the latest NFC South standings with Tampa Bay Buccaneers are currently tied atop the NFC South with the Carolina Panthers at 6-5.

The Panthers still have a game to play against the San Francisco 49ers on “Monday Night Football.” With a win, the Panthers could lead the NFC South.

Tampa Bay still has two games remaining against Carolina, which likely will determine the NFC South champion. The Buccaneers lead the division in point differential at -25. All four teams in the NFC South have a negative point differential.

After Baker Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury, Teddy Bridgewater was tasked with guiding the Bucs offense in the second half and it was a difficult watch.

The veteran completed 8-of-15 passes for just 62 yards and he was sacked twice while being pressured often. He also rushed once for six yards. The offense did not look good all night but looked especially clunky with Bridgewater at the helm.

It remains to be seen if Mayfield will miss time with his injury.

Colby Parkinson was the only player on the Rams offense to find the end zone tonight aside from Davante Adams.

The tight end is a quality route runner at his size and can be dynamic after the catch. He caught all four of his targets for 41 yards, including a 5-yard touchdown courtesy of Matthew Stafford in the first half.

With the attention Adams and Puka Nacua draw, Parkinson and the rest of the Rams offense will have opportunities to make plays.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/OsCJSFXZCwdz_yhAnMm04XKaU_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-11-24 06:01:16.771704

After Sunday's 23-10 win over the New York Jets, Jackson said knee and ankle injuries haven't affected his play, even though he's mired in one of the biggest slumps of his decorated eight-year career.

""I feel like we just need to execute a lot better,"" said Jackson, who finished Sunday with 12-of-23 passing for 153 yards. ""We get in great field position, but we're not pulling points on the board. That has nothing to do with an injury.""

Jackson has been held under 200 yards passing for three straight games for the first time in five years. He has also gone back-to-back games without a touchdown pass for the first time in six years.

During this rut, the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player was sidelined for one practice two weeks ago because of knee soreness and was absent from one practice last week because of an ankle injury. Jackson acknowledged last week that he might continue to miss one practice a week for body maintenance.

One of the biggest changes in Jackson's games has been a decrease in his rushing. Jackson, who holds the record for most rushing yards by a quarterback, is averaging a career-low 29.6 yards rushing per game.

""I'm out there so I feel like I should still be able to do what I do,"" said Jackson, who ran 11 yards on seven rushing attempts.

Jackson, who entered Sunday with the NFL's highest career passer rating at 102.8, has produced a 62.8 rating over the past three games. In wins over the Vikings, Browns and Jets, Jackson has completed 57.1% of his passes (44-of-77) for 522 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.

Ravens coach John Harbaugh said he has the ""utmost confidence"" in Jackson.

""He's our guy, he's our quarterback and Lamar's doing what he needs to do,"" Harbaugh said. ""He is winning football games and it's not always pretty. The pretty games will be there. They'll be there for Lamar Jackson, you can bet on that. But I'm proud of him right now. I'm really proud of him, the way he's fighting to win football games.""

The Ravens (6-5) have won five straight games to go from last place in the AFC North to a tie atop the division with the Pittsburgh Steelers. But it has been defense, which has held the past six opponents under 20 points, that has carried Baltimore.

Left tackle Ronnie Stanley has talked with Jackson about how their execution needs to improve on offense to achieve their Super Bowl aspirations.

Despite sustaining the injury in Week 11, Rodgers refused to rule himself out for Week 12. The quarterback was even able to put in two limited practices during the week, receiving a ""questionable"" designation ahead of Sunday's game.

And they seemed well on their way, taking a 21-point lead in the first half. But the Eagles couldn't hold the lead as the offense sputtered in the second half, injuries mounted on defense, and the Cowboys came back.

They scored three straight touchdowns, then won the game on a last-second 42-yard field goal by Brandon Aubrey.

The Eagles fell to 8-3 on the season.

The Delaware News Journal provided live coverage of the Eagles game against the Cowboys. Here is how their loss unfolded:

Eagles 21, Cowboys 21: Dak Prescott TD erases Birds' big lead

The Cowboys overcame a 21-0 deficit and tied the game on Dak Prescott's 7-yard run with 11:40 left in the fourth quarter. The Eagles' depleted secondary, down Adoree Jackson and Reed Blankenship, couldn't stop Dallas. Prescott hit George Pickens for a 43-yard reception down to the Eagles' 11 with Cooper DeJean in coverage. DeJean was playing on the outside after Jackson left with a concussion in the third quarter.

Prescott scored two plays later.

Eagles 21, Cowboys 14: Adoree Jackson, Reed Blankenship hurt

The Cowboys pulled closer as the Eagles offense sputtered, and three defenders left a third-quarter drive with injuries. Cornerback Adoree Jackson (concussion) and defensive tackle Moro Ojomo (undisclosed) left on successive plays. Later in the drive, safety Reed Blankenship was hurt.

The Cowboys took advantage of Cooper DeJean moving to the outside, and also Kelee Ringo coming into the game after Blankenship was hurt. They scored on Dak Prescott's 4-yard pass to Brevyn Spann-Ford with 2:02 left in the third.

Halftime update: Eagles 21, Cowboys 7

The Eagles offense broke out in a big way, at least early on. That was particularly true of wide receiver A.J. Brown, who had 5 catches for 67 yards and a touchdown in the first quarter.

Not to be overlooked, DeVonta Smith had an incredible backwards flip catch that went for 42 yards setting up another touchdown.

But the Eagles also got some help by some careless play by the Cowboys to take a 21-7 lead into halftime. The Cowboys lost a fumble, threw an interception into the end zone, and were called for a roughing the kicker penalty on an Eagles punt.

The Eagles took advantage of most of that. Jalen Hurts was 13-for-19 for 164 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 2 more, one on a tush push.

The Cowboys, however, outgained the Eagles 211-195 and got on the board with 21 seconds left on George Pickens' 1-yard TD.

Eagles 21, Cowboys 0: Reed Blankenship INT on Dak Prescott in end zone

The Cowboys have been their own worst enemy. They lost a fumble, they were called for roughing the kicker on a punt. And now, with their best chance to get back in the game, Eagles' safety Reed Blankenship made a diving interception in the end zone.

The Cowboys faced a 2nd-and-goal from the 1 when Tyler Guyton was called for a false start, pushing Dallas back to the 6. That's when Prescott tried for CeeDee Lamb in the end zone. But Blankenship dove and picked it off, giving the Eagles the ball at their 20.

Eagles 21, Cowboys 0: DeVonta Smith's incredible backwards flip

The Eagles extended their lead, helped in large part by an incredible backwards flip reception by DeVonta Smith. On 3rd-and-13 from the 47, Jalen Hurts threw deep for Smith, who caught the ball falling backwards, then flipped over. He held onto the ball for a 42-yard reception to the Cowboys' 11.

Smith then went 10 yards on a jet sweep down to the 1. Hurts then finished the job with a tush push TD for a 21-0 lead with 11:32 left in the second quarter.

Eagles 14, Cowboys 0: Jalen Hurts scores, A.J. Brown big factor

A.J. Brown must be happy now, even though he had a 7-yard TD taken off the board after a replay ruled he was out of bounds. No big deal. Jalen Hurts ran a QB draw for the touchdown, giving the Eagles a 14-0 lead with 57 seconds left in the first quarter. So far, Brown has 5 catches for 67 yards.

The Eagles got a break when the Cowboys' Ryan Flournoy was called for roughing the kicker as Braden Mann punted. That gave the Eagles a first down, and they took advantage.

Eagles 7, Cowboys 0: Jalen Hurts goes to A.J. Brown for TD

The Eagles took advantage after they stopped the Cowboys on 4th-and-3 from midfield to get a quick touchdown drive. And it was Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown, the subject of controversy the past two weeks, who hooked up. Hurts went to Brown on the first two plays, connecting for 6 and 10 yards. Then they capped the drive with a 15-yard touchdown with 8:41 left in the first quarter.

This came after the Cowboys tried going for it on 4th down from midfield. Was that a sign of disrespect for the Eagles offense?

Eagles inactives: Lane Johnson is out, Cam Jurgens in

As expected, star right tackle Lane Johnson is sitting out with a Lisfranc injury. He's being replaced in the starting lineup by Fred Johnson. Lane Johnson could miss a few more games. But he did not go on IR.

But center Cam Jurgens is playing after he was cleared out of the NFL's concussion protocol. Still, Jurgens will have a brace on his knee after missing two games on Oct. 26 and Nov. 10. He returned vs the Lions on Nov. 16, but left in the fourth quarter with the concussion.

Brett Toth took Jurgens' place while he's been out.

The Eagles' other inactives are QB Sam Howell, CB Mac McWilliams, RB A.J. Dillon and DT Ty Robinson.

Lane Johnson not placed on IR. When will he return?

Interestingly, the Eagles did not place right tackle Lane Johnson on injured reserve, a sign that they expect him back within the four-game minimum that he would have to miss by going on IR. Johnson suffered a Lisfranc injury in the Nov. 16 game against the Lions. Reports indicated Johnson would miss 4-6 weeks. If he needed surgery, he'd be out for the season.

Johnson thus does not need surgery. If he had gone on IR, he wouldn't be eligible to return until Dec. 14 when the Eagles host the Las Vegas Raiders. So either that day or the Dec. 8 game against the Chargers in Los Angeles would seem to be the timetable.

Eagles vs. Cowboys prediction

Eagles 24, Cowboys 19: As much as the Eagles' offense could use a breakout game, the determining factor could be Carter's revenge game. Carter was infamously ejected for spitting on Cowboys QB Dak Prescott before the first snap on Sept. 4. Needless to say, the Eagles missed him. As well as the defense has played in the last two games, Carter has been the linchpin. No doubt, Carter is looking forward to getting within spitting distance of Prescott ... without actually spitting on him. – Martin Frank

Eagles injury updates

The Eagles originally listed C Cam Jurgens (concussion) as QUESTIONABLE, but then cleared him to play on Nov. 22. The Eagles also listed G/C Willie Lampkin (knee/ankle) and T Myles Hinton (back) as QUESTIONABLE. But both are still on IR and have yet to be activated.

Cowboys injury updates

The Cowboys listed T Hakeem Adeniji (illness) and DE Jadeveon Clowney (shoulder/neck) as QUESTIONABLE. Everyone else has been cleared to play.

Weather forecast for Eagles vs Cowboys

Normally, this would be a good day to have the roof opened at AT&T Stadium, with late fall temperatures expected in the upper-60s under partly cloudy skies at game time. But the retractable roof will likely be closed as the game goes along. While there's just a 5% chance for rain when the game starts, it increases to 70% by the end. And those are expected to be heavy rains.

Patriots left guard Jared Wilson suffered an ankle injury early in the contest and also did not return. Veteran right tackle Morgan Moses was hindered by an illness, which prompted him to go to the locker room but he returned one series later.

“I appreciate you guys all talking about injuries this week,” said a sarcastic Vrabel, referencing the questions he faced regarding New England’s continuity on the offensive line.

It's their third loss in four games, as they continue to play without some of their top offensive contributors.

Buccaneers all-time leading receiver Mike Evans is among those playmakers who have been out of action. Evans suffered a broken collarbone in the team's loss to the Detroit Lions on ""Monday Night Football"" in Week 7 and has been out since the injury required surgery.

Baker Mayfield has had to rely on tertiary options as Evans' absence has been a significant blow to the Bucs, and he'll remain out for tonight's ""Sunday Night Football"" clash against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 12.

Like many teams around the NFL, Tampa Bay is dealing with many injuries across its roster. Chris Godwin and Bucky Irving have also missed multiple games but Tampa Bay has remained in the thick of the playoff picture.

When will Evans be able to return to the field? Here's the latest on the Buccaneers' veteran:

When will Mike Evans return?

Evans' injury will keep him off the field for most of the season, but there is a possibility of a return in December.

According to multiple reports, Evans underwent surgery to repair the clavicle fracture, which the NFL Network described as a ""clean break."" This suggests that, with no setbacks, he could return in about two months.

If the eight-week timeline from the injury holds, Evans might be able to return in Week 15, when the Buccaneers host the Falcons on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Dec. 11, or in Week 16, when they play on the road against the Panthers on Dec. 21.

Evans was placed on injured reserve (IR) and has not yet been designated to return. Once the Buccaneers open his practice window, they will have 21 days to activate him.

The Buccaneers remain in first place in the NFC South entering Week 11 but the Carolina Panthers are right on their heels at 6-5. Tampa Bay can certainly stand to benefit if Evans can return during their playoff push as the season progresses.

Buccaneers WR depth chart

Here's a look at who the Buccaneers will have at wide receiver while Evans remains sidelined:

Mike Evans (injured)

Emeka Egbuka

Chris Godwin (injured)

Tez Johnson

Ryan Miller

Kameron Johnson

Sterling Shepard

Dennis Houston (practice squad)

Garrett Greene (practice squad)

Jalen McMillan (IR)

Jaden Smith (IR)

Godwin reaggravated his fibula injury and missed Week 8, and has remained out since. Without the pair of vets, Egbuka, the team's first-round pick in this year's draft, has led the receivers and is among the league leaders in multiple categories.

McMillan remains sidelined with a neck injury, which has forced the 10-year veteran Shepard alongside rookie seventh-rounder Tez Johson into action.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/19/USAT/87346264007-2242274598.jpg?crop=5859,3296,x130,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-24 06:01:57.098471

They have been without Bucky Irving, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin for extended periods of time, but never Baker Mayfield. The engine that powers the Tampa offense, Mayfield has been one of the only things keeping Tampa's ship afloat.

That is potentially going to be put to the test on ""Sunday Night Football,"" as Mayfield entered and exited the blue medical tent in the first half. Now, the starting quarterback will be out for the remainder of the game, and potentially beyond, depending on the results of forthcoming tests.

Here's the latest on the Buccaneers quarterback:

Baker Mayfield injury update

Mayfield suffered a left (non-throwing) shoulder sprain in Week 12 and will receive an MRI on Nov. 24, according to head coach Todd Bowles.

Bowles added that Mayfield hurt the shoulder initially earlier in the game, but reaggravated it at the end of the first half.

""Teddy [Bridgewater] will play if he's out for some time, obviously we'll bring up Connor [Bazelak] from [the practice squad] and then we'll go from there,"" Bowles said. ""Very confident in what Teddy can do with a full week of practice, taking every snap and every play, we think he'll be fine.""

Mayfield was ruled out for the remainder of ""Sunday Night Football"" in Week 12. He was spotted on the sidelines with his left arm in a sling in the second half.

Teddy Bridgewater replaced Mayfield to begin the second half, who was listed as doubtful to return with a shoulder injury, the Buccaneers announced.

His discomfort was on full display at the end of the first half.

The quarterback heaved up a pass, hoping for a last-second score, but his pass was intercepted. While Emmanuel Forbes Jr. tried to run it back for a Rams' touchdown, Mayfield was down and in plenty of pain. He ultimately walked off, but the shoulder issue is clearly bothering him and will be something to watch in the second half.

Mayfield returned to the game and didn't miss a play for the Buccaneers' offense after the initial medical tent visit.

The team said that Mayfield was being evaluated for a left shoulder injury.

The passer was seen favoring his left arm and slammed his helmet down before entering the medical tent.

NBC's Melissa Stark also noted that the independent doctor was evaluating the hit to Mayfield's head, checking for a possible concussion.

Baker Mayfield

Teddy Bridgewater

The Bucs only carry two quarterbacks on their active roster, leaving the veteran Bridgewater as the backup. Mayfield's toughness is one of his best attributes, meaning there isn't normally much risk for the starter leaving the contest.

Whatever is ailing Mayfield, it's typically something he'll battle through in order to remain in the game.

Campbell was seen walking out of Paycor Stadium with a black brace covering his leg and knee.

The injury occurred on a 4-yard run to the left side, with Campbell pulling to that side and ultimately having his leg landed on at the end of the play. Patriots players kneeled around Campbell, who had a towel draped over his head as he was carted off.

He was officially ruled out in the fourth quarter, and coach Mike Vrabel didn't have an update on him after the game.

In addition to Campbell, starting left guard Jared Wilson was carted off with an ankle injury in the first quarter -- a second blow to a Patriots team that had mostly been fortunate health-wise up to this point in the season. Wilson was seen departing the stadium with a boot on his right foot and the aid of a crutch.

Players were hoping for the best on both injuries but acknowledged the situation looked ominous.

Asked what advice he might give to Campbell after recovering from a knee injury sustained last October, receiver Stefon Diggs said: ""I hope he's back. I hope it's not as bad as we think.""

Quarterback Drake Maye's emotion was evident when asked about Campbell and Wilson.

""Shoot, I love those guys,"" Maye said. ""They're going to be all right; I think that's the big thing about those guys -- they're going to work hard and be back. They've done such a good job for us this year. Will and Jared, they mean a lot to me. I've gotten to know them in different ways. It hurts. It's disappointing, man. That's this game. That's life. They'll bounce back and help us down the road.""

Veteran starting center Garrett Bradbury added, ""It's definitely the worst part of the game. There's a lot of experience in the O-line room, and there are things we can do, put our arms around them and get them right -- whether it's certain rehab things. Hopefully they lean on us. I know the [athletic] trainers are going to do a great job and get them back out there as soon as they can.""

New England started the same offensive linemen in 10 of its first 11 games, with Maye recently referring to the unit as the ""heartbeat of the team.""

Four-year veterans Vederian Lowe (tackle) and Ben Brown (guard) were the in-game replacements for Campbell and Wilson.

Campbell and Wilson were making history of sorts this season in New England. According to Elias and ESPN Research, since 2000, they were only the second rookie tandem to open a season as starters at left tackle and left guard (joining the 2016 Baltimore Ravens with Ronnie Stanley and Alex Lewis).

Those weren't the only injuries for the Patriots on Sunday.

All-Pro special teamer Brenden Schooler injured his ankle in the first half and was ruled out of the game. Also, defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga -- who was bumped up to the starting lineup this week after Milton Williams landed on injured reserve with a high ankle sprain -- injured his chest in the game.

Stewart","The Indianapolis Colts (8-3) face an important test when they host AFC South foe Houston Texans (6-5) in NFL Week 13 action. The Colts are coming off a dispiriting overtime loss while the Texans have ridden their league-best defense back into playoff contention.

Colts quarterback Daniel Jones (leg) didn't appear to be 100% by the end of their loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, and wide receiver/special teams ace Ashton Dulin (hamstring) left the game early.

Houston has won three straight games with backup quarterback Davis Mills at the helm, but C.J. Stroud (concussion) could be in line to return. Here's a look at both team's injury issues.

Indianapolis Colts injuries

Daniel Jones, QB

Daniel Jones completed 19-of-31 passes for 181 yards and a pair of first-half touchdowns, and did not get sacked. He also had 3 carries for 16 yards, but he appeared to labor through a 13-yard run in the second half. Jones was on the injury report during the week but there was no thought of keeping him out of the game. He said his leg injury didn’t have an impact on him during the game.

Ashton Dulin, WR/ST

Ashton Dulin, backup receiver and key special teams performer, had one catch for 48 yards that set up a second-quarter touchdown. Dulin also had a 40-yard kickoff return and a tackle. However, he left the game with a hamstring issue.

Jaylon Carlies, LB

Jaylon Carlies (ankle) has not played this season and is in the window to return from injured reserve.

Anthony Richardson, QB

Anthony Richardson (eye) has one completion this season and is eligible to return from injured reserve.

The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback exited the Week 11 matchup vs. the Cincinnati Bengals with a wrist injury, leading to Mason Rudolph filling in for the injured passer.

Rodgers practiced on a limited basis this past week, but will he suit up on Sunday? Not this week – Rodgers is officially out on Sunday with the wrist injury.

On Nov. 21, head coach Mike Tomlin left the door open for Rodgers potentially starting against the Chicago Bears, the long-time rival of the former Green Bay Packer QB.

Still, the open door didn't mean that the future Hall of Famer would play. Here's what to know about Rodgers' availability for Sunday:

Is Aaron Rodgers playing today?

No, Aaron Rodgers will not play in Week 12 vs. the Bears, Mike Tomlin confirmed to CBS' Evan Washburn.

Rodgers was listed as a limited participant in the Friday, Nov. 22 practice and he was officially listed as ""questionable"" for Sunday's matchup. Reports indicate that Rodgers was angling to play on Sunday.

On Friday, head coach Mike Tomlin left the door open for Rodgers to potentially see the field on Sunday.

""I thought I saw a solid effort, but it's Friday, so we still got some time,"" Tomlin said. ... ""We'll see where the weekend leads us.""

NFL Media added that Rodgers would come down to a ""medical decision.""

Aaron Rodgers injury update

NFL Media's Tom Pelissero reports Rodgers has been pushing to play and can potentially play through the injury. However, there is concern that there may be further aggravation and/or damage to the left wrist should Rodgers play.

There is a possibility that the injury may require surgery if any further damage is done.

The Steelers QB injured his left wrist in Week 11 vs. the Cincinnati Bengals. He would miss the entirety of the second half, with Mason Rudolph filling in relief.

Steelers QB depth chart

Below is a look at the pecking order in Pittsburgh's quarterback room.

Aaron Rodgers

Mason Rudolph

Will Howard

Howard was a sixth-round pick by the Steelers out of Ohio State. The rookie hasn't yet played a regular-season snap for the team but completed 73% of his passes for 4,010 yards, 35 touchdowns and 10 interceptions while leading the Buckeyes to a national championship in 2025.

The Steelers also have four-year veteran Skylar Thompson on their injured reserve list. He has a 1-2 career record and has completed 58.7% of his passes for 721 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions.

This time, Rashan Gary gets to J.J. McCarthy and, though he doesn't get the sack, a hurried sidearm throw ends up in the arms of Isaiah McDuffie, who has played an outstanding game.

The Vikings have run nine plays for minus-21 yards and an interception in the second half.

2:30 pm CT November 23, 2025

The Packers immediately go back to Emanuel Wilson and he delivers with runs of 12, six and eight yards to end the quarter. Two more carries by Wilson produce 14 yards. However, a carry by Chris Brooks goes nowhere and Wilson fails to get the first down on third down. The Packers opt to play for the field goal to go up by two touchdowns.

Consecutive sacks for Packers from Micah Parsons and Devonte Wyatt

Emmett Prosser

It's not often you see three straight negative plays in the NFL but the Packers accomplish the feat by stopping Aaron Jones for a 1-yard loss before back-to-back sacks by Micah Parsons and Devonte Wyatt. The two tackles for loss are for minus-11 yards and the Vikings have to punt from the 1-yard line. The Packers will start from their own 45.

2:01 pm CT November 23, 2025

Vikings stop Packers on third-and-1

Emmett Prosser

On third-and-1 from the Packers' 39, a handoff to Emanuel Wilson is destroyed in the backfield for a 3-yard loss by former Packer Eric Wilson. That forces a 50-yard punt from Whelan and the Vikings start from their own 13.

Micah Parsons makes his presence felt as the pocket suddenly collapses while J.J. McCarthy is looking short and Parsons gets a sack. On third-and-12, a short throw to T.J. Hockenson forces another punt. A 56-yard punt and no return gives the Packers the ball at their own 8-yard line.

1:44 pm CT November 23, 2025

Fumble helps Packers score easy touchdown after punt

Emmett Prosser

After a pair of first downs, the Packers are forced to punt and, when attempting to pin the Vikings in poor field position, Daniel Whelan's 43-yard kick is muffed by Myles Price.

1:18 pm CT November 23, 2025

Will Reichard hits 59-yard field goal to cut Packers' lead to 10-6

Emmett Prosser

A 19-yard pass on third-and-4 gets the ball back into Packers territory at the 40, but an incompletion and a sack by Isaiah McDuffie for a 7-yard loss takes them out of field goal range. On third-and-long, J.J. McCarthy hits Aaron Jones on a 6-yard route with 15 seconds left and the Vikings send the field goal unit out. Will Reichard nails the 59-yard field goal 10 seconds before the half.

Packers stop Vikings in red zone on pair of short yardage plays

Emmett Prosser

After a 7-yard completion to Justin Jefferson, Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon runs into Devonte Wyatt on the sidelines and appears to be shaken up. Jordan Mason caries for four yards and a first down before the quarter ends.

The Vikings continue to put Mason to work, first with a carry of five yards and then he breaks loose for 22 yards and a first down at the Green Bay 38. Two more carries by Mason net 12 yards and another first down before he's replaced by Aaron Jones.

A fake to Jones and then a short throw from McCarthy to Josh Oliver picks up four and then Jones picks up five to set up third-and-1. A direct snap to T.J. Hockenson is stopped by the Packers, making it fourth-and-1, but the Packers stuff a fourth-down run, with Kingsley Enagbare leading the charge. The Packers take over on downs.

12:37 pm CT November 23, 2025

Jordan Love sacked on third-and-long, forcing Packers to punt

Emmett Prosser

On third-and-10 from the Packers' 19, Love throws off his back foot under pressure and finds Dontayvion Wicks over the middle for a first down after a 15-yard gain. However, after two incompletions and a 5-yard penalty, the Packers have a third-and-15 from the 28. Love is sacked for a 4-yard loss and the Packers have to punt. Daniel Whelan's punt travels 61 yards and, after an 11-yard return, the Vikings start from the 24 with 1:03 left in the quarter.

12:27 pm CT November 23, 2025

Packers hold on third-and-long despite completion

Emmett Prosser

After a 6-yard pass to Aaron Jones on second-and-7, Jordan Mason replaces Jones and picks up two yards and a first down. However, J.J. McCarthy struggles with the snap on first down and loses three yards. A draw play to Jones gets four yards, setting up a third-and-9 at the 40. McCarthy can't find anyone open downfield and checks down to T.J. Hockenson short of the first down after a big hit from Isaiah McDuffie. After a 52-yard punt, the Packers will start deep in their own territory.

12:18 pm CT November 23, 2025

Pass interference penalty leads to Emanuel Wilson TD; Packers lead, 7-3

Emmett Prosser

Two throws by Jordan Love, to Emanuel Wilson and Christian Watson, pick up a total of 19 yards and a first down at the Packers' 49. After a 4-yard run by Wilson, Love throws deep for Luke Musgrave and he draws a pass interference flag, setting up a first down at the 23 after a 24-yard penalty.

On second-and-6 from the 19, a short throw to Dontayvion Wicks gains 18 yards after a nice run after the catch and gives the Packers first-and -goal at the 1. Wilson is stopped initially but gets in after first contact and the Packers lead, 7-3, after the extra point by Brandon McManus.

12:09 pm CT November 23, 2025

J.J McCarthy then hooks up with Justin Jefferson for 15 yards and another first down. However, two short throws are blown up by the Packers defense, forcing a third-and-10 and another short throw to Aaron Jones forces a 52-yard field-goal try by Will Reichard. The kick is good and the Vikings lead, 3-0

11:34 am CT November 23, 2025

Josh Jacobs inactive vs Vikings

Ryan Wood

With two NFC North games in five days, the second a pivotal matchup at Detroit on Thanksgiving, the Green Bay Packers are being cautious with running back Josh Jacobs.

The star tailback is inactive against the Minnesota Vikings. Jacobs left early in last week's game at the New York Giants with a bone bruise in his knee and a contusion on his thigh above his knee, and he was listed questionable on the injury report this week.

It's the first time since Jacobs signed as a free agent before last season that he will be inactive in a game. He had scored a touchdown in 18 of his past 19 games, including six straight, before that streak ended last week against the Giants. Now his touchdown drought will extend to two straight games.

Jacobs is dealing with tenderness in his knee, but he is expected to go through pre-game warmups before deciding whether he will play, according to ESPN and NFL Media.

Jacobs didn't suffer any structural damage in his knee, but he has been battling soreness. With another key divisional game against the Detroit Lions coming up on Thanksgiving, the team will have to make sure Jacobs is healthy for the home stretch of the regular season.

Earlier in the week, Jacobs was considered to be day-to-day. The veteran running back did not practice on Wednesday, but he got limited sessions in on Thursday and Friday. The Packers officially listed Jacobs as questionable on the final injury report of the week.

Green Bay has leaned on Jacobs in the running game all season, and he's turned 169 carries into 648 yards and 11 touchdowns. When Jacobs is going, it takes pressure off a passing attack that has dealt with some key injuries to its receivers and tight ends.

If Jacobs can't go against the Vikings, backup Emmanuel Wilson will get the call. A third-year player, Wilson posted 40 yards and a touchdown after Jacobs exited the game last week.

The Chiefs' offense continues to rank among the league-leaders in numerous categories, but their execution is critical moments must improve.
Even advanced metrics such as EPA, which stands for ""Expected Points Added,"" rank the Chiefs' offense as the second-best in the NFL.
Clearly, the opening drive of the second half has served as a tone-setter for the Chiefs' offense – for better or for worse.
The Colts' offense leads the NFL in numerous offensive categories, and it all begins with tailback Jonathan Taylor.","The Kansas City Chiefs will look to get back on track this weekend with a marquee showdown against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.

Here are some quick thoughts on the game.

1. Here's a look at the final injury report for both teams.

The Chiefs will be without tailback Isiah Pacheco (knee) on Sunday, marking his third game in a row away from the field. Pacheco returned to practice this week, however, and appears to be at least moving in the right direction.

Kansas City also listed offensive guard Kingsley Suamataia (concussion protocol) and wide receiver Xavier Worthy (ankle) as ""Questionable"" for the game.

As for the Colts, cornerback (and former Chief) Charvarius Ward is listed as ""Questionable"" for the game, although he appears set to make his return after missing the last several games due to concussion protocol.

Additionally, while he isn't carrying an injury designation, one thing that may be worth keeping an eye on is the status of quarterback Daniel Jones, who was limited in practice on Thursday due to a calf injury, but returned to log a full practice on Friday. Regardless, his ability to function will be something to watch.

It's also worth noting that Indianapolis will be without defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, who is currently on Injured Reserve due to a neck injury. Buckner ranks second on the Colts in total pressures (with 33), and his absence is significant.

2. The Chiefs' offense continues to rank among the league-leaders in numerous categories, but their execution is critical moments must improve.

Kansas City remains a top-10 offensive unit in terms of scoring offense (25.4), total offense (364.2), third-down conversion rate (41.3%), successful play rate (53.6%), passing yards (2,625) and total touchdowns (30) this year. Even advanced metrics such as EPA, which stands for ""Expected Points Added,"" rank the Chiefs' offense as the second-best in the NFL.

So, what's the issue? Well, a consistent theme in the Chiefs' five losses this season – all of which have been by one score, and three by just a field goal each – has been a lack of execution in critical moments and, as a result, too many missed opportunities.

The Chiefs had numerous chances to close out last week's game against Denver, for example. Kansas City had a pair of drives late in the fourth quarter – first with the lead, and later in a tie game – but punted on both possessions. It was a disappointing result, but it also demonstrates how thin the margin has been in these games. Kansas City has been right there in all of its losses, but moving forward – and beginning this week – the Chiefs have to find a way to execute in those critical moments.

Another area to watch – and one that's not quite as obvious – is the Chiefs' opening drive of the third quarter. Kansas City has found the end zone on its first drive of the second half in all five of its wins this season. Conversely, the Chiefs have scored just once (in the opener against the Chargers) to begin the third quarter in their five losses.

Clearly, the opening drive of the second half has served as a tone-setter for the Chiefs' offense – for better or for worse. A touchdown on the opening series of the third quarter this week would be a great sign for Kansas City's offense against Indianapolis.

3. The Colts' offense leads the NFL in numerous offensive categories, and it all begins with tailback Jonathan Taylor.

Indianapolis' offense, a year after ranking 17th in scoring, is maybe the surprise of the entire season thus far. In fact, the Colts – through 10 games – are up there with some of the greatest offenses in NFL history. Indianapolis leads the NFL in point differential (+115), scoring offense (32.1), total offense (396.9), yards-per-play (6.4), first downs-per-game (23.7), and three-and-out percentage (13.1%). The Colts are also averaging 3.2 points-per-drive, which is the best for any team since the 2007 New England Patriots.

That collective performance has been nothing short of remarkable, and at the core of the Colts' offensive success has been tailback Jonathan Taylor, who's putting together an MVP-caliber season.

Taylor leads the NFL in rushing yards (1,139) and rushing touchdowns (15) while ranking second in runs of double-digit yardage (28) and forced missed tackles (48). The number that really explains Taylor's season, however, is his ridiculous, league-leading 891 yards after contact. For context, only the Bills' James Cook has more total rushing yards than Taylor does just after contact this year.

It's easier said than done, but the path to a Chiefs' victory on Sunday begins with at least limiting Taylor's damage, and for what it's worth, it has been done before. In the Colts' two losses this season, Taylor was held to a combined 121 rushing yards and just 3.9 yards-per-carry. The Chiefs have generally been very good against opposing running backs this year, yielding just one 100-yard rusher all season, and they'll need to be at their absolute best on Sunday.

4. Creating pressure on Colts' quarterback Daniel Jones is critical.

If the first step to slowing down the Colts' historic offense is stopping Taylor, the second is creating pressure on Daniel Jones, who's in the midst of a terrific season.

Jones leads the NFL in passing yards-per-game (265.9), he's third in completion percentage (69.9%) and he's fourth in yards-per-attempt (8.34). The veteran passer has also been excellent on third down, ranking in the top 10 in completion percentage (2nd), passer rating (5th), passing yards-per-attempt (6th) and total first downs (7th) among all quarterbacks.

He also has weapons everywhere, notably in wide receiver Michael Pittman, wide receiver Alec Pierce and rookie tight end Tyler Warren. Those three form the only trio of teammates across the league with 550+ receiving yards each.

So, how can the Chiefs prevent Jones and the Colts' passing game from having another brilliant outing on Sunday? The answer is by creating pressure.

In Jones' four games this season in which he has faced a pressure rate under 30%, he's 4-0 with seven passing touchdowns and zero interceptions. In his six games facing a pressure rate of 30% or higher, however, he's 4-2 with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions. Creating pressure is obviously key on Sunday.

Additionally, Jones – due in large part to pressure – has thrown four interceptions and committed six fumbles (three lost) over his last two games. A takeaway or two on Sunday could go a long way toward a Chiefs' victory.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chiefs/lffitysrhk3wytyox7qo,N,,2025-11-23 07:03:00.739963

Skattebo, who had emerged as a fan favorite as a rookie this year, suffered a season-ending ankle injury during the Giants’ loss to the Eagles in Week 8.

He described the gruesome details on the show.

“I broke my fibula, the outside bone,” Skattebo said. “And I tore the ligament that goes from here [pointing to the top of his foot] to my ankle. And then, since the bone broke, a full dislocation of the ankle. It was like 90 degrees. There’s a tendon that holds your two bones together at the ankle, that also tore.

“So they put, it’s called a tightrope, they put it inside. They drill a hole in your bones and they put it in there and it holds your bones together. But it’s really hard to do again — that won’t tear.”

He also explained why his injury was better than a potential worst-case scenario.

“The worst is if the cartilage in your ankle is bad, that’s why it is a little bit longer [recovery],” Skattebo said.

Skattebo recorded 617 scrimmage yards and seven total touchdowns before his injury, helping briefly breathe life into the Giants’ season alongside rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart.

Skattebo has stayed busy while rehabbing, recently attending “Monday Night Raw” at Madison Square Garden and playfully participating in a skit with Dominik Mysterio.

Also in the show with N3on, Skattebo made a bold prediction for next season.

Sunday 1:00 PM EST Games

QB Aaron Rodgers, Pittsburgh | Wrist | Questionable | Projecting Active

Aaron Rodgers was unable to finish Week 11’s matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals due to a wrist injury. Early concern centered around the possibility of a fracture, and subsequent reports confirmed that Rodgers did, in fact, suffer one. However, the specifics of the injury suggest it’s not severe enough to automatically rule him out for Sunday.

Rodgers’ wrist fracture is on his left, non-throwing arm. Even so, injuries to a quarterback’s non-throwing hand can still lead to missed time due to ball-security concerns. Early indications suggest that Rodgers’ fracture is not located near the wrist joint or hand bones, as an injury in those areas would make gripping the football difficult, especially this soon after the incident. While I cannot confirm the exact location of the fracture, everything currently available points toward Rodgers being able to start in Week 12.

RB Rhamondre Stevenson, New England | Toe | Questionable | Expected to Play

Rhamondre Stevenson has missed the last three weeks with a toe injury, but after practicing all week, including a full session on Friday, he appears on track to return on Sunday.

While Stevenson managers likely have another running back option, Treyveon Henderson managers are wondering how much work will remain for him. Historical data on toe injuries in NFL running backs is limited, but what we do know suggests players often need a ramp-up period before returning to their previous level of production.

Stevenson was averaging nearly 16 touches per game with a 67% snap share prior to the injury, but there is evidence that snap share can decline significantly in a player’s first game back from a toe issue. I expect Henderson to remain heavily involved, and I’d be cautious about starting Stevenson in his first week back.

RB Ken Walker III, Seattle | Glute | Questionable | Expected to Play

Ken Walker III was a late addition to the injury report this week after being limited on Friday with a glute injury. The team did not clarify whether it was a muscle strain or a more common glute contusion, though I lean toward the latter given that head coach Mike MacDonald told reporters on Friday that Walker “should be fine.”

I expect Walker to play and continue operating in a timeshare with Zach Charbonnet.

RB Josh Jacobs, Green Bay | Knee | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Jurgens entered the weekend listed as questionable but the Eagles on Saturday announced they removed that status. That means that Jurgens is good to go.

The only Eagles player who was ruled out was Lane Johnson (foot), who is expected to be out for about a month with a Lisfranc sprain, although it's notable he was not placed on IR Saturday. That seems to signal a potential return within four weeks.

The Eagles on Saturday also announced that WR DeVonta Smith is traveling separately from the team for personal reasons but has no game status. That means he is gong to play.

Jurgens returned to action last week after missing two games with a knee injury. But then he had to leave in the second half after suffering that concussion. Jurgens this week was listed only with the concussion and not the knee. Veteran Brett Toth will be available if Jurgens is unable to get through this game.

Stroud has now missed three games with a concussion, after missing a pair of 2023 games after suffering one.
Then again, Kafka has been working with Dart since he was drafted and the Giants should know what that relationship is like.
If the Giants don’t win some games, Kafka won’t have a shot to keep the job.","There is part of me that is bummed Jaxson Dart is not playing on Sunday. He is the Giants’ best quarterback, and as much fun as Winston he is not as good as Dart. He also is not the team’s future.

There is, though, a bigger part of me that is thrilled that the NFL’s concussion protocol is working and that Dart won’t be on the field taking hits until he is 100% ready to do so.

For years, even as concussions have become a bigger and bigger focus and the NFL has taken them more seriously, I have wondered how NFL players consistently get a concussion one week and magically clear the protocol by the following Friday and never miss a game.

This is a brain injury we’re talking about.

Brian Roberts — a baseball player for the Baltimore Orioles — suffered two concussions in seven months and missed more than a year after suffering the second one in 2011. Anthony Rizzo of the New York Yankees suffered a concussion in a May 2023 collision at first base. That went undiagnosed until the Yankees shut him down in September with post-concussion syndrome.

I have never understood how guys playing NFL football, playing perhaps the most violent sport of them all, return from these things in seven days or less.

Houston Texans’ quarterback C.J. Stroud has now missed three games with a concussion, after missing a pair of 2023 games after suffering one. Tua Tagovailoa of the Miami Dolphins suffered three concussion in two years, spent considerable time on IR after the last one, and there are still many who fear for his long-term safety.

I’m fine with Dart missing this week. Maybe next week, too, if there are questions about his long-term well-being.

Mike Kafka’s audition impacted?

Dart being out of the lineup likely impacts the Giants ability to pull off an upset of the Detroit Lions on Sunday at Ford Field.

Put that aside for a minute, though. Does Dart’s absence for a second straight game hurt the Giants’ ability to determine if interim head coach Mike Kafka deserved the full-time job? If he succeeds with Jameis Winston at quarterback, could Dart’s absence actually help Kafka? Does it not make any difference since interim head coaches only earn the full-time job about 25% of the time?

Maybe it hurts because the decision about the next coach has to be largely about what is best for Dart’s development and the Giants’ ability to maximize his talent. Then again, Kafka has been working with Dart since he was drafted and the Giants should know what that relationship is like.

Maybe it helps. If Kafka can get decent offense out of a team without Dart, Malik Nabers, Cam Skattebo and sometimes Darius Slayton, what can he do with a full complement of players?

Maybe it doesn’t matter. Odds are heavily against Kafka earning the full-time job, regardless of who is or is not playing. If the Giants don’t win some games, Kafka won’t have a shot to keep the job.

RB3 incoming?

Giants fans have been clamoring for the team to add a running back to the 53-man roster. The Giants have been carrying just two backs since Cam Skattebo was injured, and also went with just two backs when Tyrone Tracy missed a pair of games with a shoulder injury.

Calls have been made again and again for Dante ‘Turbo’ Miller to be elevated from the practice squad.

Well, it looks like Giants fans are finally going to get a third running back. Just not the one they wanted. Eric Gray, on the Reserve/Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list all season with a knee injury, seems likely to be added to the roster on Saturday.

That will give the Giants protection at running back, but isn’t likely to excite anyone.

Lost in the news about Dart on Friday was the fact that a couple of the beat reporters who were at the practice facility on Friday mentioned seeing linebacker Micah McFadden in the locker room for the first time since he went on IR after a Week 1 foot injury.

Could McFadden play again this year?

Per Dan Duggan, McFadden admitted to a torn Lisfranc and is hopeful of being able to play before the season is over. That, though, does not mean it will happen.",https://platform.bigblueview.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/11/gettyimages-2245879360.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-11-23 07:03:48.718060
