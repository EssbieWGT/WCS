Chukwuma played one snap against the Panthers -- as an extra offensive lineman at the goal line -- but he has played 79 offensive snaps this season and started against the New Orleans Saints, allowing one pressure and no sacks. Wirfs had missed that game with an oblique injury, and he missed the first three weeks of the regular season after undergoing offseason knee surgery.

Prescott was sacked six times, a season high, and hurried 11 times by the Commanders.
Asked if Prescott would play against the Giants, Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer hedged slightly.
""Lot of pride, and I think that's another reason I want to play,"" he said.
""Again, we want to win,"" Schottenheimer said.","LANDOVER, Md. -- The Dallas Cowboys will miss the playoffs, but after Thursday's 30-23 win against the Washington Commanders, quarterback Dak Prescott reiterated he wants to play in next week's season finale at the New York Giants.

""I'll have some fight back,"" Prescott said. ""It depends on how it comes, what's the purpose, what's the reason. Obviously, I understand being approached about it, but the conversations we've already had about it are for me to play.""

Prescott was sacked six times, a season high, and hurried 11 times by the Commanders. For the first time this season, he failed to complete 60% of his passes, hitting 19 of 37 attempts for 307 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran four times for 24 yards.

Asked if Prescott would play against the Giants, Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer hedged slightly.

""It's Christmas,"" Schottenheimer said. ""I'm going to enjoy Christmas, man. I'm going to have some eggnog. I'll deal with that when I get looking back to the film, but definitely some eggnog. And we're playing to win.""

With a victory against the Giants, the Cowboys would avoid posting a losing record in back-to-back campaigns for the first time since they suffered three straight 5-11 seasons from 2000 to 2002.

Prescott said there is a ""big difference"" between finishing 8-8-1 or 7-9-1.

""Lot of pride, and I think that's another reason I want to play,"" he said. ""In a season [of] me being healthy, I've never had, in all of my life, career, a season under .500. So that tie is going to come into play really well. So it's a huge difference. It's one of those things that, I mean, yeah, it's just pride. It's pride, honestly.""

Prescott went 8-8 as the starter in 2019. The two times he has played fewer than nine games, the Cowboys have gone 6-10 (2020) and 7-10 (2024). This will be the third season in which Prescott has started the majority of games and the Cowboys have not made the playoffs (2017, 2019).

Prescott said any conversations he has had with Schottenheimer since the Cowboys were eliminated from the postseason have been with the idea he would start.

""I love this game,"" Prescott said. ""I love any opportunity that I get to play it. So with that being said, yeah, if I get to go out there, I'm going to give my best. I'm going to prepare the same way. I'm going to be the same player.

""I understand the reasons why maybe not [to play], and if I'm approached with that, I'll handle it then.""

The downside is substantial if Prescott were to suffer an injury. He is set to count more than $74 million against the cap, although the Cowboys will restructure his deal to gain some cap space, with a $40 million base salary.

Schottenheimer said he did not like that Prescott was hit as much as he was by Washington.

""Again, we want to win,"" Schottenheimer said. ""We play to win. Eight-eight-and-one. Do the math; sounds way better than the alternative. But again, the other thing is, right now we're 4-1 in the division [NFC East]. This is a pretty good division. Historically, it's been one of the best in football, and you can see how physical the games are just by watching today's game.""

Prescott has won 14 straight games against the Giants, although the Cowboys needed a 64-yard field goal to force overtime in a Week 2 triumph. He has not lost to New York since 2016, his rookie season. He believes momentum can carry over to 2026 with victories.

""Winning helps everything,"" Prescott said. ""Just finishing off with a win, two of them, would be great for us.""

After Thursday's contest, Prescott wore a sweatshirt that read ""Wake up happy"" on the front.

""I'll wake up happy, for sure,"" he said, ""but I'll probably wake up a little sore too.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1210%2Fr1587837_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 14:03:02.968358

Lamar Jackson is listed as doubtful for Saturday's game against the Green Bay Packers with the back injury that sidelined him for the second half of last week's loss to the New England Patriots.

The Ravens announced Jackson's status on Thursday, listing him as doubtful after he didn't participate in practice for a third straight session since suffering the injury. Jackson's status leaves Tyler Huntley in position to make his second start of the season against Green Bay.

Ravens' outside shot at making playoffs

The Ravens enter Saturday's game as a long shot to make the playoffs at 7-8. But they have a chance. They need to win their last two games against the Packers and Steelers. They also need the 9-6 Steelers to lose their last two games against the Browns and them in order to overtake Pittsburgh for the AFC North title. The Ravens don't have a path to earning a wild-card bid.

If the Steelers beat the Browns on Sunday, the Ravens will be eliminated from the playoffs, and their season finale against Pittsburgh would be irrelevant. So the Ravens will obviously go into Saturday's game with everything to play for.

Beating a motivated Packers team that has an outside shot of winning the NFC North won't be easy if Jackson can't go. But the Packers are dealing with their own quarterback concerns.

Jordan Love, Malik Willis questionable for Packers

Jordan Love remains in concussion protocol with a concussion sustained in last week's loss to the Chicago Bears. The Packers listed him as questionable on Thursday. He'll need to pass protocol to be cleared to play against Baltimore.

His backup, Malik Willis, is also questionable with an undisclosed illness and a right shoulder injury. Willis returned to practice in a limited capacity on Thursday after missing Wednesday's session with the illness.

If neither quarterback can play, the Packers will likely be left to elevate Clayton Tune off the practice squad to start against the Ravens. Tune is a third-year pro who's thrown 23 NFL passes, just two of them since the 2023 season. He hasn't played in 2025.

The 9-5-1 Packers are in position to clinch a playoff berth and have an outside shot of overtaking the 11-4 Chicago Bears for the NFC North title if they win out and the Bears lose their remaining two games against the San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions. The Packers will close their season against the Minnesota Vikings after facing the Ravens.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RcduiUNMYdvVYEwjL8XzWQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f4682d30-e1df-11f0-b6e7-027064924168,N,,2025-12-26 16:02:49.638672

Vikings center Ryan Kelly was placed on the injured reserve on Wednesday after suffering a concussion on Sunday.

According to ESPN, the placement on injured reserve could no only end Kelly’s season, but also his career.

“So much respect for Ryan as a player,” Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell said.

“And the way he took the amount of time he did and was fighting to get back on the field and felt ready to go.

“We were holding back a little bit beyond that. And then, when he returned to the field, the impact he’s had on our offense over these last few games have been massive.”

Kelly has six documented concussions in his 10-year NFL career.

However, three of those have come this season.

He was concussed in Weeks 2 and 4, and spent a long time on injured reserve before returning in Week 12.

However, Kelly was concussed once again this past week.

He started wearing the safer Guardian Cap over his helmet when he returned from IR, but still suffered another concussion.

“The Broncos placed starting C Luke Wattenberg on IR today with a shoulder injury,” NFL Network’s Mike Garofolo wrote on X.
“The Broncos have placed center Luke Wattenberg on injured reserve with a shoulder injury, team announces,” The Denver Post’s Luca Evans wrote on X on Thursday, December 25.
“A massive loss to the offensive line as Alex Forsyth will be the next man up for the Broncos,” Sleeper Broncos wrote on X.
“Center Luke Wattenberg has been placed on IR,” Broncos.com’s Alec DiLalla wrote on X.","The Denver Broncos suffered their first loss in 11 games with a Week 16 home defeat at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The franchise caught a different kind of “L” just hours before their Christmas Day game against the Kansas City Chiefs when they announced center Luke Wattenberg was headed to the injured reserve with a shoulder injury, meaning he would miss at least 2 postseason games if he comes back this season.

That means Wattenberg could return for either the AFC Championship Game or the Super Bowl if the Broncos somehow get the No. 1 seed in the AFC Playoffs.

“The Broncos placed starting C Luke Wattenberg on IR today with a shoulder injury,” NFL Network’s Mike Garofolo wrote on X. “He’s out through the first two playoff games with an injury that’s still being evaluated to determine if he can return later in the postseason.”

Wattenberg signed a 4-year, $48 million contract extension on November 25 that made him one of the Top 10 highest paid players at his position in the NFL.

Alex Forsyth was set to start in Wattenberg’s place moving forward.

“The Broncos have placed center Luke Wattenberg on injured reserve with a shoulder injury, team announces,” The Denver Post’s Luca Evans wrote on X on Thursday, December 25. “Big blow at this point in the year. A lot on reserve Alex Forsyth’s shoulders. Started 4 games there last year. Calvin Throckmorton signed to 53-man as backup.”

“Per wire, Broncos placed starting center Luke Wattenberg on IR with shoulder injury,” Denver 9News reporter Mike Klis wrote on X. “A potential big blow. Alex Forsyth is up.”

Wattenberg Became One of NFL’s Elite in 2025

Wattenberg was a fifth round pick in the 2022 NFL draft out of the University of Washington and became the full-time starter for the first time in 2024, when he started all 13 games he played in but missed 4 games with an ankle injury

In 2025, he’d started all 15 games so far this season for the 12-3 Broncos before being placed on injured reserve. In his second year as the starter, the 6-foot-5, 300-pound Wattenberg has established himself as one of the NFL’s best at his position and has a 70.9 overall grade from Pro Football Focus this season.

“A massive loss to the offensive line as Alex Forsyth will be the next man up for the Broncos,” Sleeper Broncos wrote on X.

“Center Luke Wattenberg has been placed on IR,” Broncos.com’s Alec DiLalla wrote on X. “Had played all 1,005 of the Broncos’ offensive snaps to start the season.”

Forsyth Most Known for Mistake Against Chiefs

Forsyth is best known for making a mistake that cost the Broncos a win over the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium in Week 10 of the 2024 regular season.

Broncos quarterback Bo Nix drove the Broncos down the field in the final moments of the game to set up what could have been a 35-yard, game-winning field goal by Will Lutz as time expired. Instead, Chiefs linebacker Leo Chenal flew in for the game-winning field goal block to seal a 16-14 win.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1430899296-e1766702121839.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-26 16:02:55.992693

Lamar Jackson has officially been listed as doubtful for Saturday with a back injury. He hasn't practiced all week and suffered the injury during last week's loss to the New England Patriots, leaving the game at halftime after an awkward slide in the second quarter. He was termed day-to-day earlier this week, but now appears likely to miss the Packers game.

Baltimore needs a win, or else the Pittsburgh Steelers will clinch the AFC North title with two games left to play.

The Ravens' opponent, meanwhile, has its own QB issues to sort out. Will it be Jordan Love or Malik Willis starting Saturday night? Or neither? That question is up in the air for now, as both quarterbacks are questionable ahead of Saturday's game as of Thursday.

[NFL injury updates live]

Love remains in concussion protocol with a concussion sustained in last week's loss to the Chicago Bears. The Packers listed him as questionable on Thursday. He'll need to pass concussion protocol to be cleared to play against Baltimore.

His backup, Willis, is also questionable with an undisclosed illness and a right shoulder injury. Willis returned to practice in a limited capacity on Thursday after missing Wednesday's session with the illness.

If neither quarterback can play, the Packers will likely be left to elevate Clayton Tune off the practice squad. Tune is a third-year pro who's thrown 23 NFL passes and has thrown just two passes since the 2023 season. He hasn't played in 2025.

Other notable Week 17 injuries:

The San Francisco 49ers got good news this week when it was reported that All-Pro tight end George Kittle avoided a high-ankle sprain during Monday night's win over the Indianapolis Colts. Kittle is reportedly dealing with a ""mid-to-low ankle sprain,"" which still leaves his status in doubt ahead of their Week 17 matchup with the Bears. But he's reportedly avoided the high-ankle sprain diagnosis that frequently comes with multi-week absences.

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen said that he “will be playing, planning on playing” against the Philadelphia Eagles this weekend. That came after he went down with a foot injury in last week's game, and the injury kept him out of Tuesday’s walk-through. “I mean, [it’s] still sore,” Allen said, via ESPN. “Walk-through today, so really not practice in general. So yeah … feeling good.”

TreVeyon Henderson and Kayshon Boutte remain in concussion protocol after both were injured during Sunday night's win over the Baltimore Ravens. Should Henderson be unable to go, running back Rhamondre Stevenson, who picked up 78 yards and a touchdown when he entered the game, will handle the workload.

The Colts are ""hopeful"" that Sauce Gardner will return this weekend against the Jaguars. The cornerback has missed three straight games due to a calf injury.

The 26-year-old has been absent since August after suffering a knee injury that required surgery. There had been some hope that he could return sooner, but Germany head coach Julian Naglesmann confirmed last month that he had suffered “a small relapse” on his road to recovery.

Havertz made his return to full training with the Arsenal squad ahead of their Carabao Cup quarter-final clash with Crystal Palace and Arteta said post-match that the forward was not far off being in contention for the game.

“Quite close,” Arteta said of Havertz’s return.

“I think it will be a matter of days if not weeks. Let’s see in the next stage how he responds to that.

“He’s a player that we’ve missed a lot. A player that brings the team into a different dimension. So, really happy to have him back soon.”

If it is a matter of days, then Havertz could return in Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Brighton & Hove Albion on December 27. Arteta’s side then play Aston Villa on December 30, before travelling to Bournemouth on January 3.

There may be a bit more of a wait for Gabriel to return though. The Brazilian centre-back has been out since November with a thigh problem, but Arteta confirmed that he has not yet returned to training.

“We have to wait and see again,” Arteta said. “He hasn’t trained yet. He’s stable in his rehab. But hopefully we get him back as soon as possible because we know the situation that we have in the backline.”

Patrick Mahomes is among the latest stars to suffer season-ending injuries this campaign.

The 2024 NFL playoffs saw record-breaking overall viewership as the Philadelphia Eagles took down the Kansas City Chiefs, who were eyeing a three-peat.

But this year’s NFL playoffs will likely find it tough to get close to the same returns due to the number of injuries to star players.

Last weekend, Mahomes and Green Bay Packers pass rusher Micah Parsons each tore an ACL.

While the Mahomes injury is a brutal hit to the Chiefs and their future, they are out of the playoffs.

The Packers took a bigger hit with Parsons’ injury as they have Super Bowl aspirations.

Green Bay already lost tight end Tucker Kraft to a season-ending knee injury last month.

The NFL has a $1.5 billion-plus injury curse, as Mahomes, Parsons, Malik Nabers, Nick Bosa, Daniel Jones, Tyreek Hill, Michael Penix, Marshon Lattimore, and Zach Ertz, among others, have gone down with season-ending injuries at some points this season.

Roger Goodell‘s league will continue, and the NFL has been on a roll in terms of TV.

But the injuries to the top players and the absence of star quarterbacks could hurt media partners CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN, Prime Video, and Netflix for the upcoming playoffs.

Besides the loss of Mahomes, the NFL will be without top quarterbacks Joe Burrow and Jayden Daniels in the playoffs.

Burrow’s Bengals and Daniels’ Commanders are eliminated.

Washington also shut Daniels down for the season due to elbow injuries.

The two-time MVP Lamar Jackson and his Baltimore Ravens are also on the fence.

Sports TV ratings expert Douglas Pucci sees a ratings decline in the 2025 NFL playoffs, per Front Office Sports.

But Pucci is intrigued that Los Angeles and Chicago, the US’s second and third-biggest TV markets, are set to make the playoffs.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/12/crop-15650039_6dfbd8.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-12-26 06:00:22.812225

Without Johnson, the Nuggets will have to ask more of their wing rotation and lose some more size and versatility at the forward spot.
However, their defense was already on shaky ground without Braun and Gordon and losing Johnson will make them even weaker on that end of the floor.
Braun and Gordon are both nearing their timetables for re-evaluation, but will still need time to ramp up to game shape once eventually cleared.","The Denver Nuggets sit third in the Western Conference at 21-8, but their depth will be put to the test once again after seeing starting forward Cam Johnson suffer a knee injury.

Johnson sustained a bone bruise in his right knee in a loss to the Mavs on Tuesday and while an MRI revealed no structural damage, he will be re-evaluated in 4-6 weeks with the injury, the team announced on Thursday. Johnson is averaging 11.7 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game on 46.1/42.9/81.0 shooting splits in 28 starts this season.

With Johnson out, the Nuggets are now down three starters. Aaron Gordon remains sidelined with a hamstring strain and Christian Braun is still a week away from his re-evaluation after spraining his ankle earlier this season.

Despite the absences of Gordon and Braun, the Nuggets have managed to stay near the top of the Western Conference thanks to the sensational play of Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray, as well as getting strong contributions from their bench after bolstering their depth this offseason. With Johnson out, that depth will be put under even greater stress, as will Jokić and Murray to continue producing the majority of Denver's offensive production.

Without Johnson, the Nuggets will have to ask more of their wing rotation and lose some more size and versatility at the forward spot. Johnson has played more power forward than small forward this season due to Gordon's extended absence, and the likes of Peyton Watson and Spencer Jones may see more time at the four -- with Zeke Nnaji and Hunter Tyson also options there from deeper down the bench.

Everything in Denver starts with their two stars, and as long as Murray and Jokić are healthy, the offense will operate at an elite level. However, their defense was already on shaky ground without Braun and Gordon and losing Johnson will make them even weaker on that end of the floor. Braun and Gordon are both nearing their timetables for re-evaluation, but will still need time to ramp up to game shape once eventually cleared.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/25/bac3456c-e0cb-4b3c-915b-3c58993dcd26/thumbnail/1200x675/4ee52b546a24c67a4474e3831ae11449/cam-johnson.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 01:58:27.075141

“You feel for the player anytime something like that comes up,” Raiders offensive coordinator Greg Olson said.

Up next ■ Who: Raiders vs Giants ■ When: 1:05 p.m. Sunday ■ Where: Allegiant Stadium ■ TV: CBS ■ Radio: KRLV-AM (920), KOMP-FM (92.3) ■ Line: Pick 'em; total 41½","With an eye focused on the future, the Raiders are protecting one of their most important assets over the final two weeks of the season.

The club on Wednesday put star tight end Brock Bowers on the season-ending injured reserve list. Bowers has been dealing with a knee injury since the opening week of the season, and while he went on to play 11 more games and post a team-high 64 catches, 680 yards receiving and seven touchdowns, managing the situation was a week-to-week proposition.

“You feel for the player anytime something like that comes up,” Raiders offensive coordinator Greg Olson said. “It’s hard on everybody, but certainly more hard on the players. So you just feel for the player.”

In addition, the club put safety Jeremy Chinn on IR with a back injury.

In corresponding moves, the Raiders signed safety Terrell Edmunds and wide receiver Shedrick Jackson to the active roster. Both had been on the club’s practice squad.

In addition, they signed long snapper Luke Elkin and tackle Joshua Miles to the practice squad.

Focused on the future

With the Raiders (2-13) long out of playoff contention, it made little sense to expose Bowers or Chinn to potential harm in the last two games.

Bowers is far more important to the club than a meaningless win or two down the stretch. As is Chinn, who is under contract through the 2026 season and expected to be an important cog in next year’s defense.

Chinn started all 15 games for the Raiders and had 114 tackles.

“In terms of tackling, he’s a solid tackler, and he’s an impact tackler,” Raiders defensive coordinator Patrick Graham said. “You feel him out there on the field. You can hear it out there on the field. So that’s a big loss.”

Not to be lost is the Raiders are within reach of securing the first pick in the 2026 draft. All they have to do is lose their last two games, and they could have their choice between Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and Oregon’s Dante Moore, who are projected to be the top two quarterback prospects if they declare for the draft.

The New York Giants, who are also 2-13, are tied with the Raiders for the worst record in the league. However, the Giants hold the tiebreaker advantage over the Raiders by virtue of the strength-of-schedule metric.

It is unlikely the Giants would draft either of those quarterbacks since they turned to rookie Jaxson Dart to be their starter earlier this season.

The order could change Sunday when the Raiders host the Giants at Allegiant Stadium. A Raiders loss would move them into the top spot.

Second straight Pro Bowl

After being selected with the 13th pick in last year’s draft, Bowers has been one of the NFL’s dominant tight ends. Despite the knee injury, which ultimately sidelined him for three games and limited him in a handful of others, Bowers still led the Raiders in all pertinent receiving categories while earning Pro Bowl honors for the second year in a row.

“What a warrior he is, to be honest with you,” Olson said. “It’s one thing to play injured, but when you still play well when you’re injured, that tells you something about the person.

“So, yeah, we were fortunate to have him. It was certainly a letdown when we found out the news this week, because you didn’t see it in this play.”

With Bowers done for the season, it opens the door for third-year tight end Michael Mayer to be a bigger part of the offense. Mayer was a dominant player at Notre Dame and was expected to be a productive NFL tight end.

However, the presence of Bowers has meant a more confined role for Mayer, especially in the passing game, where Mayer has 23 catches for 192 yards and a touchdown.

On Thursday, the Green Bay Packers shared their practice report. Concerningly, both starting quarterback Jordan Love and backup quarterback Malik Willis appeared on it.

Jordan Love is listed as being limited in practice on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The issue is a shoulder/concussion issue. This comes after Love was knocked out of the Packers’ overtime loss to the Chicago Bears on December 20th with a concussion. Working through the NFL’s concussion protocol, Love is considered questionable for this Saturday’s game.

Previously, offensive coordinator Adam Stenavich had been positive regarding Love’s status. Stenavich shared that Love looked good and the team was hopeful that he’d be able to play in the game.

For his part, Malik Willis was limited on Tuesday and Thursday. He did not participate at all on Wednesday. This comes as Willis is battling his own shoulder issue, as well as an illness. That illness is likely the issue that forced him to completely miss practice on Wednesday.

Notably, Packers wide receiver Christian Watson recently shared that it was Jordan Love who has been taking first team reps. Clayton Tune, a practice squad quarterback, has been leading the scout team.

Jordan Love has played in and started the first 15 games this season for the Packers. In that time, he’s completing 66.3% of his passes for 3,381 yards and 23 touchdowns. In his three years as the full time starter, it’s his highest completion percentage. Love also has 199 rushing yards.

The Green Bay Packers are currently in the hunt to make the playoffs. That means that, if the season ended before Week 17 games kicked off, the Packers would be a playoff team. That only becomes more secure with a win over the Ravens. With a win, Green Bay’s playoff probability goes from 95% to better than 99%. However, with a loss, it would drop to 88%. At that point, anything is possible.

Baltimore, likewise, has injury concerns at quarterback with Lamar Jackson battling his own injury concerns. That will likely become the story of the game as a result with the Ravens also fighting for a playoff spot.

Green Bay will play host to Baltimore on Saturday, December 27th. Kickoff is scheduled for 8:00 p.m. EST.",https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2025/12/25162212/Jordan-Love-Malik-Willis-Packers.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 06:00:31.721751

Biggest NFL Week 17 Injuries:

Amon-Ra St. Brown Injury Update

Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown went down with an apparent knee injury late in the Lions' loss to the Vikings on Christmas Day.

St. Brown came down awkwardly attempting to make a catch, with his leg seemingly getting caught underneath him as he fell to the ground.

He was questionable for the game due to a knee injury, but it is unclear whether he aggravated that injury or if this is a new issue.

With the Lions eliminated from the playoffs, it would not be a surprise if St. Brown's season is over even if the knee injury ends up being minor.

Javonte Williams Injury Update

Cowboys RB Javonte Williams suffered a shoulder injury against the Commanders on Christmas Day.

Williams rushed 13 times for 54 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game.

Malik Davis worked as the lead back with Williams sidelined, going over 100 yards on his 20 attempts.

With the Cowboys out of playoff contention, they could choose to shut down Williams even if his shoulder injury is not serious.

Jake Ferguson Injury Update

Cowboys TE Jake Ferguson did not play in the second half on Thursday because of a calf injury.

Ferguson only caught 1 pass before leaving, but it was a six-yard touchdown.

Both Brevyn Spann-Ford and Luke Schoonmaker saw targets with Ferguson sidelined.

Remigio was a full participant in practice Monday but had not practiced the past two days because of a knee injury. He joins the IR list alongside Rashee Rice and Tyquan Thornton, who were put there Wednesday because they were still in the concussion protocol.

The Chiefs, who already are eliminated from playoff contention, also put top cornerbacks Trent McDuffie and Jaylen Watson on injured reserve this week. McDuffie has been dealing with a knee injury and Watson with a groin problem.

In a flurry of moves, the Chiefs signed linebacker Cole Christiansen, cornerback Melvin Smith and defensive ends Ethan Downs and Tyreke Smith to the active roster. Defensive back Nazeeh Johnson was activated from the IR, and wide receiver Jason Brownlee and offensive lineman Matt Waletzko were promoted from the practice squad.

Last season, Luka Dončić suffered a left calf strain against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Dec. 25, which ended up being the last game he played with Dallas before the Mavericks traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers.

This year, Anthony Davis, the key player the Mavericks acquired in the Dončić trade, had to exit Dallas’ game against the Golden State Warriors early in the second quarter with what the team described as “right groin spasms.”

Davis was trying to run the floor on a fast break when he came up limping and headed for the Mavericks’ bench at the 8:50 mark in the second quarter. A Mavericks trainer examined Davis, who then headed to the team’s locker room during a stoppage in play and never returned to the floor. The Mavericks ruled him out shortly after halftime. Davis’ afternoon ended after he scored three points in 11 minutes.

Mavericks coach Jason Kidd did not have an update on Davis’ status when asked after the game.

“Obviously, it’s really unfortunate for us,” Dallas rookie Cooper Flagg said. “I feel like we’re a better team on the court when he’s playing at his best. Obviously, tough but we got (to have) next man up mentality and fill the hole the best we can.”

The 32-year-old forward has already been sidelined for 16 games this season, primarily due to a left calf strain he suffered in October. Before Thursday’s game, the Mavericks had a 8-7 record when Davis played and a 4-12 record when he sat.

Davis has been able to play in only 27 of a possible 67 games since the Mavericks acquired him from the Lakers in February. He missed six weeks last season while he recovered from a left adductor strain.

But the same eight would have been non-participants in Foxborough based on the team’s projection. That sidelined group includes wide receivers Mack Hollins and Kayshon Boutte, tight end C.J. Dippre, guard Jared Wilson, defensive tackle Khyris Tonga, linebackers Harold Landry III and Robert Spillane, as well as cornerback Carlton Davis III.

Here’s the second injury report leading up to Sunday’s 1 p.m. ET visit with the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium.

Friday’s practice will provide a clearer picture for the Patriots. As will the game designations that follow. But the early forecast points toward Boutte and Wilson not being available for the AFC East rematch in East Rutherford while working through the NFL’s concussion protocol. The starting left guard played all 74 snaps in last weekend’s matchup M&T Bank Stadium, while starting wide receiver landed hard in the fourth quarter after a no-call for defensive pass interference.

On the other side of the ball, Tonga suffered a foot injury during the 28-24 win. The three-phase defensive tackle appears in line to miss time. And more time is in line to be missed by Spillane. The linebacker, captain and tackle leader has not taken the field for back-to-back Sundays because of an ankle injury.

It seems as though J.J. McCarthy will have to win the job, but the question is what type of veteran Minnesota will pursue.

Apart from McCarthy’s rollercoaster performances, the Vikings also need to worry about his inability to stay healthy. The second-year quarterback has suffered three different injuries that have kept him from being on the field.

With Minnesota out of the playoffs and the offseason nearing, NFL insider Dianna Russini shared what the Vikings could be leaning toward when it comes to the quarterback position.

“I think there’s still belief there,” Russini told Yahoo! Sports’ Andrew Siciliano on the December 24 video of “Inside Coverage” about where the Vikings stand on McCarthy. “How could you not after what we just saw last weekend as well and what he’s able to do? So I don’t have concerns over whether or not JJ McCarthy is going to be a Viking next year.

“I don’t think that’s a conversation that’s being had. I’m more curious about how much of the confidence they had in him at the start of the year still exists now, especially when they were built to make a deep run. They said no to Aaron Rodgers because they believed that much in JJ, right? Because they knew what this roster was.”

Vikings Appear Positive About J.J. McCarthy

After clearing concussion protocol, McCarthy started to build some momentum with a stretch of encouraging performances. That progress was interrupted in Week 16 against the New York Giants, when McCarthy sustained what was described as a very small hairline fracture in the right hand. As a result, he will miss the Week 17 game against the Detroit Lions.

Even with a rocky first year in the starting role that included several injury setbacks, Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah appears to be backing their young quarterback. McCarthy’s play, in the view of the front office, has provided enough positives to feel good about the direction moving forward.

“There’s just been growth moments,” Adofo-Mensah said during the December 23 edition of “X’s and O’s with Kevin O’Connell.” “I try and make sure that my dialogue with him is incredibly positive because, if you think about this world, you got the external world who’s always going to be negative, and then you’ve got coaching, who are going to be positive, but they’re also going to coach them.

“I try and always make sure I’m highlighting, ‘Hey man, this is a great thing that I’m seeing you’re doing.‘ Things like playing really up in the pocket. A lot of young quarterbacks, when they get pressure in their face, they’re trying to bail out the back. He’s very good about getting up in the pocket either to make scrambles or make good decisions.”

Vikings GM Gives Interesting J.J. McCarthy Take

Adofo-Mensah also leaned on an unusual comparison when discussing McCarthy, a sign the organization appears comfortable viewing the young quarterback as a long-term cornerstone.

“You’re seeing the plays where, quarterback position to me, to a person who’s maybe not an expert, just kind of an evaluator and kind of a big picture thinker about it,“ Adofo-Mensah added. “It’s about being Clark Kent [and] Superman. How many times are you going to put the cape on, but sometimes you just need to keep the glasses on and be that guy and kind of do those things? That’s the balance these have because the great ones are wired to want to put the cape on all the time.

“I think that we’re seeing him put the cape on a couple times, three times, four times a game, but also do the Clark Kent things, the boring things that really just metriculate offensive football down the field. So those are the things that I’m really excited to see. And then just the preparation, showing up a week of practice, getting the game plan, doing all those great things. Being there for his team is really exciting to see.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jj-mccarthy-minnesota-vikings.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-25 21:59:47.514502

Only six total players are listed, although this does not include players on injured reserve such as Tory Horton and Elijah Arroyo.
The first is Charles Cross, who was injured two weeks ago against the Colts and was designated with a 2-4 week injury.

Trevin Wallace and Tershawn Wharton are the real question marks here, as both didn’t practice with a shoulder and hamstring injury respectively.","The Seattle Seahawks will not be practicing today because of the holiday, but we did get a Christmas Eve injury report attached to the practice last night. Expect an estimated report later today, but we’ll likely not learn much more than what they gave yesterday. Let’s take a look.

Seattle Seahawks

Really clean, especially given how many key players went down late in that Thursday Night tilt and how late we are into the season in general. Only six total players are listed, although this does not include players on injured reserve such as Tory Horton and Elijah Arroyo. We didn’t get much of an update yesterday on those players, so we remain in a holding pattern there.

A.J. Barner, Abraham Lucas, Jarran Reed, and Cody White showed up with an assortment of afflictions, but none were considered serious enough to hold them out of practice to any extent. Full Participation for all four of them. It would be highly unlikely for any of them to miss this game, or be held up in any significant way given they’re fully practicing on Wednesday.

Two players get the dreaded Did Not Participate tag, and they’re both players that I suspect most Seahawks fans were fully prepared to not have this weekend. The first is Charles Cross, who was injured two weeks ago against the Colts and was designated with a 2-4 week injury. This Sunday will be exactly two weeks since the injury, so it was never overly likely he’d be ready.

With Josh Jones playing effectively last week against the Rams, it makes sense to take it easy and allow Cross to come back without getting rushed. Particularly with the nature of hamstring injuries, which can linger on and relapse in the blink of an eye. While we don’t yet know for sure, I’d go forward assuming Cross misses at least one more game.

Then, you have Coby Bryant, the one player who came out of that Rams-Seahawks game on the Seahawks side that looks like he will miss time beyond just the end of that game. His knee injury currently has him not practicing, and while Coach Macdonald did say he didn’t think it would end his season, he wouldn’t go much further than that.

Carolina Panthers

On the flip side, the Panthers also bring a long list of injured players who are fully participating in practice, which makes their availability extremely likely. Claudin Cherelus, Ikem Ekwonu, Jaycee Horn, Cam Jackson, Cam Mays, and David Moore all seem like they’re going to be ready to go.

There is a caveat here, where the Panthers have very little at stake this weekend due to how things have gone with them and Tampa Bay in the divisional race. I do wonder if a player like Ikem Ekwonu, someone they can not afford to lose, might be left out for part or all of the game to protect him for a de facto playoff game the following week.

Tetairoa McMillan did not practice, but it’s designated as a rest day, and he did play last week, so there’s every reason to believe he’s ready to go. Robert Hunt, with his biceps injury, is limited, but you can probably cross him off since he’s just coming off injured reserve and it’s already been indicated he’s going to need a week or two of practice first.

Trevin Wallace and Tershawn Wharton are the real question marks here, as both didn’t practice with a shoulder and hamstring injury respectively. Wallace starts at linebacker and has been serviceable, while Wharton has been a part of the defensive line rotation but has missed the last month with the hammy.

If they can’t go, and neither did last week, Wallace probably gets replaced by Claudin Cherelus, and Wharton gives his snaps to Bobby Brown III and LaBryan Ray. Cherelus recorded eight tackles last week in the Tampa Bay victory, and Brown and Ray had two apiece.

It’s the first report of the week, so it’s important to understand that the worst-case scenario is usually presented before things improve drastically during the week. However, both teams are probably feeling pretty good with the scenario presented in this report, so we’ll see how much better things can get.","https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,x_0,y_469,w_2868,h_1613/c_fill,w_1440,ar_1440:810,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_seahawks/01kd9qqmpwj30a7f4sqs.jpg",N,,2025-12-25 23:59:02.583765

,,2025-12-25 22:50:05+00:00,The Denver Post,Broncos place starting center Luke Wattenberg on injured reserve with shoulder injury,Luca Evans,,,,,https://www.denverpost.com/2025/12/25/broncos-luke-wattenberg-injured-reserve/,"On Thursday, the organization placed starting center Luke Wattenberg on injured reserve, a major blow to the offensive front as Denver marches into the playoffs.
Wattenberg has started all 15 games for the Broncos as the man in the middle this season, but landed on this week’s injury report with a sudden shoulder injury and wasn’t present at Tuesday’s walkthrough.

With a roster spot open and help needed at center, Denver also promoted veteran Calvin Throckmorton from their practice squad to the 53-man on Thursday.","Looking for good health in their holiday stocking, these Broncos have instead received a resounding heap of coal.

On Thursday, the organization placed starting center Luke Wattenberg on injured reserve, a major blow to the offensive front as Denver marches into the playoffs. Wattenberg has started all 15 games for the Broncos as the man in the middle this season, but landed on this week’s injury report with a sudden shoulder injury and wasn’t present at Tuesday’s walkthrough.

The IR placement means Wattenberg will miss a minimum of four games, making him ineligible to return until at least the AFC conference championship game — if the Broncos advance that far — on Jan. 25.

Wattenberg signed a four-year, $48 million extension with the Broncos in late November for his efforts snapping quarterback Bo Nix the ball for the last two seasons in Denver. He’s allowed just 13 pressures in 1,006 pass-blocking snaps this year (according to Pro Football Focus), and improved as a run-blocker after an offseason emphasis with assistant offensive-line coach Chris Morgan.

“Good, young player, and it’s important to keep those guys in your building,” head coach Sean Payton told reporters after Wattenberg’s extension. “I’ve been in the position where you are trying to draft a center and it’s one of those unique positions. If you say in the draft, ‘We’re going to draft a center that we feel like can start Year 1,’ that becomes difficult.”

In Wattenberg’s stead the Broncos will turn to backup center Alex Forsyth, a seventh-round pick by Denver in 2023. Forsyth started four games last season when Wattenberg landed on injured reserve with an ankle injury. The Oregon product had some demons to exercise at Arrowhead Stadium on Thursday, after the Chiefs targeted him on a game-winning field goal block in Kansas City’s 16-14 win over the Broncos in November 2024.

Forsyth started Thursday night’s game at center against the Chiefs, and largely kept quarterback Bo Nix clean through the first half on a foggy night in Arrowhead.

With a roster spot open and help needed at center, Denver also promoted veteran Calvin Throckmorton from their practice squad to the 53-man on Thursday.

Additional reinforcements

With tight end Nate Adkins’ knee banged up again, the Broncos signed 41-year-old veteran Marcedes Lewis back to their active roster on Christmas Day. Lewis was originally picked up in late October for some blocking help when Adkins originally went down, and has lingered on Denver’s practice squad even after running out of elevations.

He was relied on for plenty more than veteran savvy Thursday with Adkins sidelined, rotating in on heavy-personnel run packages against Kansas City. Lewis played 25% of the Broncos’ offensive snaps in four previous games activated, and has become a key figure to the Broncos’ late-season push.

Denver waived running back Cody Schrader in a corresponding move, after claiming him off waivers from the Houston Texans a week ago.

The Broncos also elevated veteran Michael Bandy from the practice squad for the third time this season and pulled up linebacker Levelle Bailey, with rookie receiver Pat Bryant (concussion) and starting ILB Dre Greenlaw (hamstring) ruled out against Kansas City.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TDP-L-BRONCOS-TEXANSAO2_9111x.jpg?w=1024&h=672,N,,2025-12-25 21:59:55.209950

Others questionable include tackle Zach Tom (back/knee), center Sean Rhyan (knee/illness), receiver Christian Watson (shoulder/illness), safety Evan Williams (knee), and cornerback Bo Melton (illness)

Green Bay has ruled out linebacker Kristian Welch (ankle) and guard John Williams (back), who's designated to return from the physically unable to perform list.

The Ravens listed starting quarterback Lamar Jackson doubtful with a back injury that held him out of practice this week. Tyler Huntley would start in Jackson's place if he can't play Saturday.

Love was listed as limited this week after sustaining a concussion on Austin Booker's helmet-to-helmet hit in the second quarter of last Saturday's 22-16 overtime loss to the Chicago Bears.

Per NFL rules, Love was unable to speak to the media this week due to being in the concussion protocol. However, both Head Coach Matt LaFleur and Watson said this week Love was making progress.

""He's looked really good,"" Watson said. ""From everything that I've talked to him about, he feels like he's in a good spot. Obviously, he's gotta clear everything. I think he's just approaching it like a normal week in terms of how he's going about everything and then obviously he'll just let the medical staff take care of the rest.

""But he's looked like J-Love out there, so obviously if he does get the opportunity to play on Saturday, I know he'll be ready to go.""

Stepping in for Love, Willis completed 9-of-11 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown (142.8 passer rating) while scrambling 10 times for 44 yards. He injured his shoulder during a Montez Sweat sack on the final play of regulation but finished the game.

Willis told reporters on Tuesday he expected to be available, if needed, against Baltimore but then missed practice on Wednesday due to an illness that's been going through the locker room. He returned on Thursday in a limited capacity.

If either Love or Willis isn't available, Green Bay could elevate third-year veteran Clayton Tune off the practice squad. A former fifth-round pick by Arizona, Tune signed with the Packers prior to the start of the regular season.

""He's been doing a great job,"" LaFleur said. ""He's been traveling with us on the road. He's gotta pretty good grasp. He's a smart guy. He attacks it the right way. He spends a ton of time with Sean Mannion post-practice trying to get extra reps, trying to work on his fundamentals and techniques.""

In addition to their respective injuries, Watson and Rhyan did not practice Thursday due to illness and are questionable to play. Melton missed all three practices this week for the same reason and is also questionable.

Evan Williams missed the Bears game due to a sprained MCL but practiced this week in a limited capacity. He told reporters on Tuesday he's feeling optimistic. If Williams can't go, Green Bay would turn to Javon Bullard again at deep safety.

Bullard, who's been the Packers' starting nickelback all season, had 10 tackles and pass deflection in Chicago.

""It speaks a lot to him, just his ability,"" LaFleur said. ""There are some similarities between the nickel position and playing safety but to go out there and do it, especially for a young player, I think is pretty remarkable. Bull, one thing you know about him is you're going to get his all every time he goes out on the field.""

The Packers will have tight end Josh Whyle (concussion protocol) available against the Ravens after he was a full participant in practice Thursday. He and Luke Musgrave are currently the only tight ends on Green Bay's 53-man roster.

In addition to Whyle, the Packers didn't issue a game status for the following players who will be available: running back Josh Jacobs (knee), receivers Romeo Doubs (wrist), Dontayvion Wicks (ankle), and Savion Williams (foot), guard Aaron Banks (neck), and defensive linemen Lukas Van Ness (foot), Arron Mosby (ankle), defensive linemen Collin Oliver (hamstring), Jordon Riley (ankle), and Quinton Bohanna (illness).

After working on the field Tuesday and Wednesday, the team took the day off and it will return to the practice field on Friday at Ascension Saint Thomas Sports Park to continue preparations for Sunday's game vs the New Orleans Saints.

-Cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis (Achilles) was limited in practice.

-Running back Julius Chestnut (back) was a full participant.

-Edge Ali Gaye (knee) was a full participant.

-Linebacker Cedric Gray, who missed the Kansas City game with a concussion, was listed as a full participant.

-Guard Kevin Zeitler (groin) was limited in practice.

-The Titans placed receiver Bryce Oliver, edge Femi Oladejo, and edge Ali Gaye on the team's Designated to Return to Practice list last week.

ASHBURN, Va. — Jeff Driskel didn’t have enough time to unpack, let alone to unlearn everything he drilled the past seven weeks.

In the span of 12 hours earlier this week, he went from being a practice squad quarterback standing on the sidelines during the Arizona Cardinals’ Week 16 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, to becoming the Washington Commanders’ impromptu backup for their Christmas Day game against the Cowboys — with only three days to prep.

He received word just minutes before kickoff Sunday, then hopped on a red-eye flight to the D.C. area Monday morning, landing just in time to take a physical and join the Commanders’ morning meetings before taking the field for a walkthrough and then practice.

His locker had yet to receive a nameplate and instead was designated by the two suitcases parked in front.

“It’s way more common than people think,” he said with a grin. “You get used to it.”

Such is the life of the emergency signing, players acquired on short notice to step in for depth or even a starting role and make it all somehow look seamless, as if they had practiced for months, not hours, with teammates whose names they’ve yet to fully learn.

Common? Sure — in the NFL, where injuries are all but guaranteed each weekend.

But easy? Hardly. The trick is making it appear so. Behind the scenes, NFL teams do this weekly, with emergency lists of free agents and practice squad players, and a well-rehearsed operation involving staffers from multiple departments bringing in new players on a moment’s notice.

The Indianapolis Colts did it earlier this month when they signed 44-year-old Philip Rivers out of retirement and elevated him from the practice squad to start his first game in 1,800 days.

In 2023, the Vikings did it after losing starter Kirk Cousins to an Achilles injury. They acquired Joshua Dobbs in a trade with the Cardinals and turned to him five days later, without him taking a single practice rep with the starters.

Washington was home to another emergency addition in 2020, when quarterback Taylor Heinicke, a little-known reserve who was finishing up a mathematics degree while sleeping on his sister’s couch, signed to the practice squad. Much like Dobbs in Minnesota, Heinicke quickly became a cult hero in Washington, throwing for 306 yards and one touchdown and running for another in a wild-card playoff loss to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

A year later, the Commanders signed quarterback Garrett Gilbert off the New England Patriots’ practice squad to start a late-season game in Philadelphia — after he had only one practice with the team.

“When Garrett got here, fresh off the practice squad, the game plan was already in,” receiver Terry McLaurin recounted. “So, he got here and now we’re trying to get on the same page. That was probably the hardest situation I probably experienced, but then we went into the game against a great Philly team and completed deep balls and made it a competitive game.”

Plucking a new guy off the street or off another team’s practice squad is an almost daily occurrence in the NFL. But little about it feels routine to those involved.

Driskel is the latest to experience it in Washington, but hardly the only one.

Thirty Washington players (including those who were already ruled out for Thursday’s game) have missed a combined 139 games because of injuries, forcing the team’s personnel and operations departments to find help in unique ways. They signed a contingency punter (Mitch Wishnowsky) for a few days, later brought in an emergency kicker, picked up a receiver and pass rusher minutes before boarding a flight to Spain, and added a long snapper (Zach Triner) for all of three days.

Driskel arrived with a clear advantage over the others: familiarity.

He spent the 2024 season with the Commanders as their third-string quarterback and was called back this week when Marcus Mariota suffered hand and quad injuries in their loss to the Eagles. With Jayden Daniels, the team’s true starter, shut down for the season, and Sam Hartman having zero regular-season snaps in his career (he signed to the active roster on Wednesday), Washington needed reinforcement for the final two games.

Driskel is well-versed in Kliff Kingsbury’s system and knows the staff and much of the roster.

That wasn’t the case for him two years ago, when the Cleveland Browns signed him off the Cardinals’ practice squad and he started several days later, in the season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals. Cleveland had already punched its ticket to the playoffs, so it opted to rest its starters for the last game and put it on Driskel’s shoulders.

“I was not familiar with that building, so I had to introduce myself to everybody,” he said.

Josh Johnson, who will start his first game in three years on Thursday when the Commanders host the Cowboys, knows the routine probably better than anyone, having been with a record 14 teams in his 17-year pro football career. He was the late bloomer in high school, the non-scholarship quarterback in college, a fifth-round pick and the last QB on the initial depth chart as an NFL rookie. And in most of his years since, he’s been the backup or emergency guy.

“Most of the opportunities that came for me, something happened — something went wrong with the starter or … something happened to the backup,” he said. “And so for me, it’s been a unique experience, but it’s been one that I don’t take for granted.”

But to be thrown in a game just days after arriving is undoubtedly difficult.

In 2021, the Ravens plucked Johnson off the Jets’ practice squad because Lamar Jackson was dealing with an ankle injury. Johnson started 11 days later, throwing for 304 yards, a pair of touchdowns and a pick in a 41-21 loss to the Bengals.

Johnson played the role of emergency QB again the following season with the San Francisco 49ers. He was Brock Purdy’s backup a week after signing, then was tabbed as his replacement in the NFC Championship Game the following month.

“My first time getting in the huddle with the guys was in the NFC Championship,” he recalled.

Which is exactly what he experienced last Saturday, when he came off the bench for the Commanders in the second half of their loss to the Eagles. Despite being with the team for eight months, the third quarter of that game was the first time he had been in a huddle with McLaurin and the first time Washington’s starters heard his cadence. Third-string quarterbacks don’t get first-team practice reps during the season.

“There’s not too much I can say or dictate or whatever, because we were in the fourth quarter of the game, the end of the game, and everybody was already in the flow,” Johnson said of his 22 snaps against the Eagles. “I’m trying to get up to speed to them. So this week, I’m just trying to go through the process and be as intentional with everything as possible so we can go out there and play fast and play well.”

Stepping in as the emergency quarterback may be among the tougher tasks in the NFL. But being the new guy on short notice certainly isn’t limited to that position.

Washington, like every club, has a deep list of emergency replacements — free agents and practice squad players — that is updated continuously throughout the season and serves as its guide when players are lost to injury or illness.

Timing matters, though. A lot.

Injuries suffered during Sunday night, and especially Monday night, games can often make it more challenging for a team to arrange a workout and visit with a potential signing before other teams in need. And if he does come in for a workout, the later kickoff dictates a later arrival, later physical and later start for the player to get into a new routine.

Few, if any players, had less time to prepare than Matthew Wright, the journeyman kicker who agreed to fly to Kansas City ahead of Washington’s Monday night meeting with the Chiefs in Week 8.

The Commanders’ starter at the time, Matt Gay, informed the team days earlier that he was dealing with a back issue, which gave Washington enough time to find a contingency plan if he was unable to play.

Wright has built a career on being an emergency replacement. He spent a brief period in San Francisco when Commanders general manager Adam Peters was its assistant general manager, and spent time in Detroit when Commanders assistant GM Lance Newmark was the Lions’ director of player personnel. He also had experience kicking at Arrowhead Stadium, one of the most notoriously difficult places to kick because of the weather and noise.

Knowing Wright could be a contingency option, the Commanders’ equipment managers made sure to bring the right helmet, pads, kicking cleats and a uniform in case he signed, according to team sources familiar with the operation. Wright flew to Kansas City that Sunday night, and on Monday morning, the day of the game, he underwent a physical and signed a practice squad contract at the team hotel. He was immediately elevated and on the field in a Commanders uniform hours later — but only for kickoffs and a single extra-point attempt, which he made. Washington didn’t attempt any field goals.

“If you’re going to come here and get a win, you’re not going to do it with a bunch of field goals,” Quinn said after Washington’s 28-7 loss that night. “I knew that and we knew that. That was not a reflection on the situation.”

Wright was released the following day.

The logistics of bringing in a replacement player or a new guy for depth has become almost an everyday occurrence in the NFL. In Washington, the process is a multi-department collaboration, with the player personnel and football operations departments leading the way.

Usually, it’s a fairly standard ordeal — except when it’s not.

Like when Washington was trounced by the Detroit Lions in a Sunday game that ended around 7:30 p.m. ET, and was on a plane to Madrid the next evening.

The Commanders wanted to sign defensive end DeMarcus Walker, whom they worked out earlier, and receiver River Cracraft, who was with the team for a brief period during the preseason, to their practice squad for depth after injuries ravaged both positions.

In the weeks leading up to the international game, Washington’s personnel and football operations departments made it a stipulation that they would consider only players with valid passports so they could travel with the team for its week-long stay in Spain.

Walker had one, because he was expecting a workout with the Indianapolis Colts and they had requested two forms of identification to get him on the payroll. He happened to grab his passport as one, and then plans changed.

Cracraft had his, too — but little else.

He was in California when his agent called around 5 a.m. PT that Monday to share the news. The Commanders called shortly after and told him he had a flight at 7 a.m., leaving no time to pack a suitcase. So Cracraft grabbed a book bag and raced out the door, making his flight (and its connections). He arrived in time to take a physical and sign his contract in the hangar at Dulles International Airport before hopping on another flight with the team to Madrid.

Knowing Cracraft would be arriving with very few of his belongings, co-equipment manager Justin Brooks brought additional sweats and team gear to get him through the week. And to help him get up to speed with the offense, receivers coach Bobby Engram and offensive assistant Andre Coleman often worked early and stayed late until Cracraft got comfortable.

“I just feel like that’s pretty rare, especially for a guy like me, being in the league for as long as I’ve been and having been in different rooms now,” Cracraft, 31, said. “For them to invest in a guy that comes in Week 11 … you just don’t expect a lot of attention. So to get it was like, wow.”

But there are few ways to make the emergency lifestyle an easy one in the NFL. Over a seven-day span, Cracraft spent more than a full 24 hours in the air, with trips to D.C., Spain, California and back to D.C. again.

“It’s a sleepless one,” Johnson said. “… It’s very challenging. There’s so much unknown. To me, you have to find a balance of accepting what it is and still going out there and trying to perform to the best of my ability. That’s just the nature of the situation. … You got to roll with it, or you can go home.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/24133843/GettyImages-2172177421-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-25 18:00:14.216795

Will they have their top receiver available on Christmas?

Amon-Ra St. Brown is dealing with a knee injury that has left him ""questionable"" for the Lions' short-week tilt with the Minnesota Vikings.

St. Brown leads the Lions in targets (144), receptions (98), receiving yards (1,194) and receiving touchdowns (11) and was just named to his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl. If without him, Detroit would need other playmakers to step up against a Minnesota defense that has allowed just 13 points per game over its three-game winning streak.

Here's what to know about St. Brown's status for the Lions' Christmas game against the Vikings.

Is Amon-Ra St. Brown playing today?

The Lions have not yet announced whether St. Brown will play in the team's Christmas game against the Vikings. The 26-year-old receiver is officially listed as ""questionable"" for the contest because of a knee injury.

The good news for Lions fans? NFL Media's Ian Rapoport reports St. Brown ""seems to be in a good position to play"" in the Thursday afternoon game.

The Lions will have until 3 p.m. ET – 90 minutes before their game against the Vikings kicks off – to determine St. Brown's status for the contest.

Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update

St. Brown suffered a knee injury in the Lions' Week 16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played 72 of 74 offensive snaps during the contest but was listed on the injury report Monday because of the malady.

St. Brown was a non-participant in Detroit's Monday practice estimation. He was upgraded to limited at Tuesday's walk-through, at which point Lions coach Dan Campbell seemed encouraged by St. Brown's progress.

""It’s positive news, but he’s a little irritated,"" Campbell told reporters of St. Brown's injury at a Tuesday news conference. ""There’s a little irritation, so short week, we’ll see. But I would say it’s still positive news.""

St. Brown remained a limited participant at Wednesday's practice, but the Lions officially listed him as ""questionable"" for Thursday's game.

St. Brown hasn't yet missed a start for the Lions during the 2025 NFL season. The lone game in which he failed to play at least 77% of the team's offensive snaps came in Week 13, when he suffered an ankle injury after playing just four snaps on Thanksgiving against the Green Bay Packers.

St. Brown was able to return from that ankle injury just a week later. He logged six catches for 92 yards during his team's ""Thursday Night Football"" win over the Dallas Cowboys.

St. Brown didn't appear on the Lions' injury report in either Week 15 or 16 before popping up on it again ahead of Detroit's Christmas Day game against Minnesota.

Lions WR depth chart

The Lions have six receivers on their depth chart, including St. Brown. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Amon-Ra St. Brown

Jameson Williams

Isaac TeSlaa

Kalif Raymond

Tom Kennedy

Dominic Lovett

If St. Brown can't play, Williams would serve as the team's No. 1 receiver, while TeSlaa and Raymond would see an uptick in action. Lovett, who hasn't dressed since Week 14, would likely be active in his place, unless the Lions call up either Jackson Meeks or Malik Cunningham from the practice squad to play ahead of him.

If St. Brown does play, he and Williams will get a bulk of the targets in Detroit's passing game. Meanwhile, TeSlaa will be utilized more as a red-zone weapon and Raymond as a quality change-of-pace option.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/25/USAT/87912246007-amon-ra-st-brown-lions-122425.jpg?crop=2604,1465,x720,y44&width=2604&height=1465&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-25 14:01:24.694272

Vikings center Ryan Kelly was placed on injured reserve Wednesday after he was concussed during a collision with Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.

ESPN described the transaction as not only ending the 32-year-old’s season, but “possibly his career” as well.

“So much respect for Ryan as a player,” Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell told reporters, “and the way he took the amount of time he did and was fighting to get back on the field and felt ready to go. We were holding back a little bit beyond that. And then, when he returned to the field, the impact he’s had on our offense over these last few games have been massive.”

Kelly, who according to ESPN has six documented concussions during his 10-year professional career, was concussed during Weeks 2 and 4 and was on injured reserve for roughly two months before returning in Week 12.

He switched his helmet and began wearing a Guardian Cap, a padded covering that goes over a helmet, when he came back.

A first-round pick by the Colts out of Alabama in 2016, Kelly spent nine seasons in Indianapolis, earning Pro Bowl nods in 2019, ’20, ’21 and ’23.

He joined the Vikings this year on a two-year, $18 million contract and has earned $77.35 million during his career, according to Spotrac.

• DE Landon Jackson (IR, season over): Jackson is a third-round rookie who appeared in 3 games before suffering a torn MCL and PCL.
• DT DeWayne Carter (IR, season over): Carter was a rotational defensive lineman for the Bills in 2024.
• S Taylor Rapp (IR, season likely over): Rapp is a starting safety.
He landed on IR with a calf injury, but the Bills opened his 21-day practice window last week.","Wednesday notes:

• Josh Allen has a foot injury, though he will almost certainly play. Allen runs with reckless abandon and is often the punisher during his runs as opposed to the punishee. We'll see if this injury affects how he runs.

• Joey Bosa played through his hamstring injury last weekend, so the expectation is that he'll do so again against the Eagles.

• Dalton Kincaid (523 receiving yards) and Dawson Knox (363) rank second and third on the team in receiving yards. Neither practiced on Wednesday.

• Jordan Poyer is still starting in the NFL at 34 years of age. He has 70 tackles and an INT in 10 games this season.

• Matt Prater became the Bills' kicker after Tyler Bass suffered an injury during training camp (see below). He did not play last week, and Michael Badgley was called up from the practice squad. Badgley had a bad game against the Browns, and the Bills also worked out some kickers this week. That's an area of concern.

• Jordan Phillips, if you'll recall, was guilty of several cheap shots against the Eagles in their 2023 matchup, and he also shoved a fan. Bad guy, bad player. Doesn't matter if he's able to play or not.

Notable players on IR, PUP, suspension, etc.

• DT Ed Oliver (IR, eligible to return at any time): Oliver is a very good player who had 9.5 sacks in 2023, 3 in 2024, and 3 in 3 games in 2025 before suffering a torn biceps injury. He could return at some point this season, but it won't be in time for this matchup.

• DE Michael Hoecht (IR, season over): The Bills signed Hoecht to decent money this offseason (3 years, $21 million), and he had 2 sacks in 2 games before tearing his Achillles. His season is over.

• DE Landon Jackson (IR, season over): Jackson is a third-round rookie who appeared in 3 games before suffering a torn MCL and PCL. His season is over.

• DT DeWayne Carter (IR, season over): Carter was a rotational defensive lineman for the Bills in 2024. He tore an Achilles in August, ending his season.

• CB Darius Slay (DNR): After the Steelers waived Slay, the Bills claimed him on waivers, but he did not report to the team.

• S Taylor Rapp (IR, season likely over): Rapp is a starting safety. He played in six games, before having surgery on a nagging knee that he had tried to play through. His season is probably over.

• S Damar Hamlin (IR, season likely over): Hamlin was a starter for the Bills in 2024, but he had a smaller role on the 2025 team. He suffered a pectoral injury, and his season is likely over.

• CB Dorian Strong (IR, season over): Strong is a sixth-round rookie who played in four games this season (1 start), before he suffered a career-threatening neck injury.

• WR Curtis Samuel (IR, eligible to come off of IR at any time): Samuel has a stat line of 7-81-1 in 6 games this season. He landed on IR with knee and elbow injuries. He is eligible to come off of IR this week.

• WR Mecole Hardman (IR): Hardman is a three-time Super Bowl champ with the Chiefs who signed with the Bills this season. He has only played in one game, but he had a 61-yard kick return in that game. He landed on IR with a calf injury, but the Bills opened his 21-day practice window last week.

• K Tyler Bass (IR): Bass is a good kicker who has been over 80% every year of his career. He had surgery to correct a hip injury that persisted throughout training camp. The Bills' kicker this season had been Matt Prater, who is 18 of 20 on field goals, and 43 of 46 on PATs.

Strnad is poised to start across from Alex Singleton while Greenlaw is sidelined, and Alex Forsyth is listed as the backup center behind Wattenberg on Denver's depth chart.

Following an appeals hearing, the NFL upheld the Pittsburgh Steelers receiver’s two-game suspension for “initiating a physical confrontation with a fan.” Metcalf will miss the Steelers’ Week 17 and Week 18 games.
The impact on the Steelers’ season remains to be seen.
If both games go against the Steelers, Metcalf would also miss a potential play-in game in Week 18 against the Ravens.
“I called him that, and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,” Kennedy told the Free Press.","PITTSBURGH — DK Metcalf’s regular season is over. Following an appeals hearing, the NFL upheld the Pittsburgh Steelers receiver’s two-game suspension for “initiating a physical confrontation with a fan.”

Metcalf will miss the Steelers’ Week 17 and Week 18 games. He’s eligible to return in the postseason, if the Steelers qualify.

The impact on the Steelers’ season remains to be seen. The 9-6 Steelers are, in the words of coach Mike Tomlin, “on the doorstep” of clinching the AFC North. They can do so as early as Saturday night if the Green Bay Packers beat the Baltimore Ravens. In that case, the Steelers would likely rest their starters anyway for the final two weeks of the season. Should the Ravens win, the Steelers can still wrap up the division by beating the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. If both games go against the Steelers, Metcalf would also miss a potential play-in game in Week 18 against the Ravens.

Since Metcalf is suspended without pay, he will forfeit more than $555,000 in salary from the two games that he will miss for what the NFL termed “conduct detrimental” to the league. According to multiple reports, it will also have an impact on future guarantees. The four-year, $132-million extension Metcalf signed in March was supposed to guarantee him $25 million in 2026. He also previously had $20 million in injury-protected guarantees in 2027. Both guarantees will automatically be voided due to a clause in his contract. However, unless Metcalf is released by the Steelers before the end of the deal, he can still earn the entire value of his contract.

Metcalf was suspended for an altercation that occurred during the second quarter of the Steelers’ 29-24 victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday. The CBS broadcast captured Metcalf exchanging words with a fan wearing a blue wig who was leaning over the railing in the stands behind the Steelers’ sideline. Metcalf grabbed the fan by his collar and then appeared to either push him away or take a swing at his head.

“He did explain to me why he did what he did, and I certainly don’t condone the behavior, but I support DK,” Tomlin said during his weekly news conference Tuesday. “I really don’t have a lot to add other than what I just told you.”

The fan, Ryan Kennedy, told The Detroit Free Press on Sunday that he called Metcalf by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, and Metcalf took offense. (On Metcalf’s verified X page, his display name is DeKaylin Metcalf. Shortly after he was traded to the Steelers, he told the team’s radio play-by-play broadcaster, Rob King, that he prefers DeKaylin, but goes by DK because it’s easier to pronounce.)

“I called him that, and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,” Kennedy told the Free Press. “I’m a little shocked.”

Later Sunday night, two former players — longtime Bengals receiver Chad Johnson and former Steelers linebacker James Harrison — said on their respective podcasts that they had spoken to Metcalf, and that Metcalf said the fan used slurs in reference to Metcalf and his mother. In a statement shared with The Athletic by Head Murphy Law, Kennedy “denies using the ‘N-word,’ the ‘C-word,’ or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur.”

Asked on Tuesday if Metcalf relayed a similar message to Tomlin, the coach declined to comment on their conversation. “I won’t discuss what he and I discussed,” Tomlin said.

On Monday, NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported that Metcalf “had a history with the Lions fan he confronted Sunday — Metcalf reported the same fan to Seahawks security last season while playing for Seattle.” A Seahawks spokesperson confirmed to The Athletic that Metcalf reported a fan to security during a game in Detroit last year, but could not confirm it was Kennedy.

One of Kennedy’s attorneys, Shawn Head, told The Athletic via email that Metcalf “complained to security last season because he did not like what he heard from the stands. I understand that complaint was investigated, and that Mr. Kennedy was not found to have violated any Ford Field policies.”

On Tuesday night, a Lions spokesperson confirmed to The Athletic a report from Pelissero that the league will not take action against Kennedy. However, on Wednesday, an NFL spokesperson said the league was still reviewing Kennedy’s actions and “will be in touch” with the Lions to determine if he violated the guest code of conduct.

Joe Keels, Metcalf’s agent, did not respond to several messages seeking comment.

Metcalf’s emotions have bubbled over on the field several times in his career, including in 2021 against the Packers and 2023 against the San Francisco 49ers, when he was ejected following altercations with opponents. However, Tomlin said Metcalf’s attitude in practice settings and during game weeks has been positive.

“He’s been great,” Tomlin said. “He cares. He works hard. He’s a heck of a guy. He’s a good teammate, and that’s why he’s easy to support.”

The wide receiver position has been one of the Steelers’ thinnest throughout this season. In addition to Metcalf’s absence, Calvin Austin III, who is listed as the WR2 on the depth chart, left Sunday’s win over the Lions with a hamstring injury. His status for Sunday’s game is unclear. Depth receiver Ben Skowronek has been playing special teams with a cast on his hand, but he hasn’t played in traditional offensive situations since the injury (although he has blocked for the tush push).

Without Metcalf (and potentially Austin), the Steelers will be counting upon mid-season additions Adam Thielen and Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Scotty Miller will also likely see an uptick in usage. Metcalf’s absence will likely thrust second-year receiver Roman Wilson back into action; he’s been a healthy scratch the last three games.

The Steelers acquired Metcalf this offseason in a blockbuster trade with the Seahawks and then signed him to a four-year, $132-million extension. He has tallied 59 receptions for 850 yards and six receiving touchdowns. He also has one rushing touchdown.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/22164728/AP25356041915883-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-25 04:59:11.099622

Lamar Jackson is dealing with a back injury that knocked him out of the Ravens' ""Sunday Night Football"" loss in Week 16. The Ravens will be hoping he can return to action in Week 17, as a loss would eliminate them from playoff contention.

Jackson was unable to practice on Tuesday before Ravens coach John Harbaugh provided an update on his status Wednesday.

Here's what to know about Jackson's injury and whether he will be able to play in Week 17.

Is Lamar Jackson playing Week 17?

Harbaugh told reporters Dec. 24 its currently ""undetermined"" whether Jackson will play in Week 17 against the Packers.

Jackson was listed as a non-participant at Ravens practice both Tuesday and Wednesday. Harbaugh referred to the 28-year-old quarterback as ""day-to-day"" when discussing his injury.

""We'll see where he's at tomorrow and as we go forward,"" Harbaugh said.

The 63-year-old coach also clarified Jackson would not necessarily need to practice in order to be active for Saturday's game.

""He could play without that practice for sure,"" Harbaugh said. ""He's played a lot of football, won a lot of games for us. If he's ready to go, he will go. If he can go, he will go. You can bet on that.""

The Ravens need to beat the Packers when they meet Saturday to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.

Lamar Jackson injury update

Jackson is dealing with a serious back contusion that knocked him out of his team's ""Sunday Night Football"" loss to the New England Patriots.

Jackson left the game late in the first half after taking a knee to the back while sliding following a three-yard gain. The veteran quarterback remained in the game for one play – a handoff to Keaton Mitchell that lost 5 yards – before the Ravens called a timeout and brought him to the sideline.

Jackson was originally deemed ""questionable"" to return because of the back ailment before being ruled out in the fourth quarter. Baltimore blew an 11-point fourth-quarter lead in the 28-24 loss.

Harbaugh was mum about Jackson's status moving forward when announcing the quarterback was dealing with ""a bruise of some kind"" after the game.

""I don't know how serious it will be,"" Harbaugh said. ""We'll have to find out the next couple of days.""

Who is the Ravens backup QB?

Tyler Huntley is the Ravens' backup quarterback and would be trusted as the team's starter if Jackson can't go. The 27-year-old completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards in relief of Jackson against the Patriots and won his lone start filling in for Jackson earlier in the season.

Huntley has completed 76.6% of his passes for 319 yards and one touchdown in his limited action with the Ravens this season. He has a career record of 6-9 in 15 starts and has completed 65.7% of his career passes for 3,105 yards, 12 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.

Ravens QB depth chart

The Ravens have three quarterbacks currently in their organization. They are as follows:

Lamar Jackson

Tyler Huntley

Cooper Rush

Rush began the season as the Ravens' backup before losing the job to Huntley. The long-time Dallas Cowboys quarterback went 0-2 in two starts in place of Jackson earlier in the season and has completed 65.4% of his passes for 303 yards and four interceptions.

Rush, 32, figures to back up Huntley is Jackson is unable to play Saturday.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/24/USAT/87910833007-lamar-jackson-ravens-12242025.jpg?crop=5458,3071,x0,y181&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-25 04:59:14.185999

Las Vegas Raiders star Maxx Crosby spoke honestly about the player's perspective entering the showdown.

""Yeah, I don’t give a sh-- about the pick, to be honest,"" he said Tuesday. ""I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world. That's what I focus on every day. Being a great leader, being an influence. Being that guy on a consistent basis for my team.""

Amen. Hallelujah, amen.

Fans can root for a loss if it's in best interests of the long-term success of the franchise. The time, money and emotional support spent on a favorite team grants fanatics that leniency, if they so choose. The front office and coaching staff can have their preferences.

But the players? The players whose careers could end on a single snap? Players who put their bodies through rigors few can fathom? Players who spend every waking moment searching for an edge that can lead to victory? They play to win.

Crosby understands well the dichotomy.

""That's their job. That's the front office, the coaches, they do that,"" he continued. ""That's got nothing to do with me. I've learned my lesson in the past. You can't control everything. That's not my job description. My job is to be the best in the world at what I do. And that's wrecking the game.""

The five-time Pro Bowler is right not to worry about the draft. Even securing the No. 1 slot guarantees nothing for the future.

He was a full participant on Wednesday and expects to play against the Bills.

Carter, 24, has missed the last three games after having a procedure on both shoulders. Despite missing a total of five games this year, Carter was named to the Pro Bowl on Tuesday.

Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni on Wednesday was asked if Carter’s conditioning level will be a concern upon his return.

“One thing he’s done as he’s been out, these guys that are out, they work hard on their fitness so that when they get back, they weight what they’re supposed to way, they’re in good condition, they’re ready to play,” Sirianni said. “He’s worked hard at that as well as rehabbing himself. I thought he had a good day yesterday. We’ll see how it goes going forward.”

While Carter was at practice, several key Eagles were not: Lane Johnson (foot), Landon Dickerson (illness) and A.J. Brown (teeth). Brown missed practice after having his wisdom teeth removed.

Here's the full injury report from Wednesday:

Did not participate: WR AJ Brown (teeth), LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring), G Landon Dickerson (illness), T Lane Johnson (foot)

NFL

Full: LB Zack Baun (hand), LB Jihaad Campbell (back/ankle), DT Jalen Carter (shoulders), T Fred Johnson (calf), TE Cameron Latu (stinger), WR DeVonta Smith (illness), T Cameron Williams (shoulder)

Johnson has missed the last five games with a Lisfranc sprain in his foot. While there was a report from ESPN saying he would be back this week, he has not practiced the first two days of the week. Fred Johnson is now in line to start his sixth consecutive game at right tackle.

Dickerson has been dealing with a calf injury for a few weeks and has been given rest days in recent weeks on Thursday. He was no longer listed with that calf injury to begin this week. But for the most part, the Eagles have been trying to get Dickerson as healthy as possible for game days.

Here’s how the offensive line looked on Wednesday (from left to right): Jordan Mailata, Brett Toth, Cam Jurgens, Tyler Steen, Fred Johnson

Linebacker Nakobe Dean (hamstring) was a spectator at practice for the second straight day on Wednesday with an injury he suffered in the first half against the Commanders. DC Vic Fangio said on Tuesday that Dean would be “iffy” for the Bills game. If Dean can’t play, rookie Jihaad Campbell would start in his place.

Here’s the first injury report ahead of Sunday’s 1 p.m. ET kickoff at MetLife Stadium.

At running back, wide receiver and along the interior offensive line, a series of signings have been made since three members of New England’s active roster entered the NFL’s concussion protocol. Sunday night’s 28-24 win at M&T Bank Stadium spanned double-digit visits to the blue medical tent. And also several visits to the locker room.

Meanwhile, Spillane was inactive for the matchup due to an ankle injury that has kept him out for back-to-back games. Barring a “Christmas miracle,” Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel told reporters that the linebacker, captain and tackle leader wouldn’t be practicing this week.

While two starters in concussion protocol were absent for the Patriots, Henderson practiced in a red non-contact jersey. The No. 38 overall pick out of Ohio State was among seven partial participants on Wednesday after being ruled out last weekend.

The Patriots also opened the week by opening the 21-day window for Williams.

Handling a career-high 60.98 percent of the defensive snaps prior to landing on injured reserve in November, his campaign has spanned 11 starts, 27 tackles and 3.5 sacks.

With Nolen and Williams heading to injured reserve, it was announced Monday, the Cardinals have 22 players on injured reserve, and coming out of Sunday's 26-19 loss to the Falcons, the Cardinals have used a league-high 80 players this season.

""That's a lot of guys,"" coach Jonathan Gannon said Monday.

On Sunday, Gannon said Arizona has ""had a lot of attrition,"" and admitted that ""it's hard.""

Since running back James Conner went down in Week 3, Arizona has been dealing with a cascade of injuries, and they haven't discriminated -- starters, backups, third string, fourth string, rookies, veterans. Even the punter, Blake Gillikin, is on injured reserve. Last week, Gannon said the team's health and how it's handled will be something he'll reevaluate in the offseason.

""They know it's part of the game,"" Gannon said. ""Yes, we've had more this year than since we've been here. That's a fact. But you got to step in and assume roles and play good football.""

Three Week 1 offensive starters are on injured reserve, followed by almost complete depth charts at receiver and running back and two of four of Arizona's top tight ends. When the Cardinals took the field Sunday against the Falcons, only four offensive starters from Arizona's first snap of Week 1 remained.

The Cardinals' defense has been, generally, spared from losing players for the whole season. Starling Thomas V, who was a starting cornerback last season, was lost for the season to an ACL injury during training camp, and safety Joey Blount was put on IR after suffering a neck injury in Week 1. The biggest defensive name on injured reserve is linebacker Mack Wilson Sr., and he's joined by rotational linemen L.J. Collier and Bilal Nichols.

Having so many players go down has taken its toll on the rest of the roster. It's, linebacker Zaven Collins said, ""hard to deal with. It's hard to watch.""

""It's tough because we already are down guys, so it's tough to see the guys that you know put in the work with go down,"" quarterback Jacoby Brissett said. ""It's very unfortunate and you can't prevent it. That's the sorry part about it, but you see the amount of respect when one of our guys goes down and you see everybody on the team going up to those guys -- however today happened. You see the love that we have for each other, and you try to pick up the play and try to build a little bit more because you know that person that went down wishes they were out there.""

During Sunday's game, a young player asked veteran offensive lineman Kelvin Beachum what he thought about all the injuries.

He answered as an older player would: ""It's a war of attrition. It's the National Football League. It's part of it.""

Any time a player is lost to injury a team must reshuffle its lineup. And the Cardinals have had to do that weekly, changing the team's dynamic significantly from Week 1 to this week, but also from week to week, especially on offense.

They're down their starting quarterback, top three running backs, three of their top five receivers, two of their top four tight ends, and two offensive linemen who have started this season.

That has led to Arizona not being able to do certain things with the current roster that it might have been able to do with the Week 1 lineup, Beachum said.

""It's difficult because guys are getting put in roles that maybe they wouldn't have been in prior to the season or after camp, but you got to be adaptable and adjustable,"" wide receiver Michael Wilson said. ""I can speak from our receiver coach because I'm with him every day, but I think he's done a phenomenal, phenomenal job of staying positive.

""Last week we were playing with three receivers, two guys that were on the practice squad for a lot of the year and myself, and we're still able to function and compete at a high level. And so it's tough, but I think [Gannon] and [general manager] Monti [Ossenfort] do a great job of bringing guys in the building that can be flexible and adaptable.""

During a meeting Saturday night, the Cardinals talked about taking advantage of opportunities when they arise, Brissett said. Then it came to fruition Sunday when Froholdt went down and Jon Gaines II slid from guard to center and rookie Hayden Conner entered the game at guard. Brissett said they didn't miss a beat.

Gannon said that while it's hard to see players go down and get carted off, as happened with Williams and Nolen on Sunday, everyone on the field has to ""refocus"" and keep playing.

""Obviously, they feel bad for their teammate,"" Gannon said. ""They feel down that they're not going to be out there, but you have to go play football.""

Every team deals with injuries. But that's not an excuse for how the year has panned out, Beachum said.

""Nobody cares,"" Beachum said. ""There's no team in the National Football League that hasn't had to deal with injuries of some type.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1223%2Fr1593085_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-24 22:01:02.369673

Defensive tackle Jalen Carter returned to practice for the first time since the November 28 game against the Chicago Bears. He's missed the past three games with injuries to both shoulders. Despite the layoff, the Pro Bowl starter was a full participant in Wednesday's practice.

The Eagles will be off on Thursday for the Christmas holiday, so the injury report will be an estimation. The team reconvenes at the NovaCare Complex for a final practice on Friday before Saturday's departure to Buffalo.

Tackle Lane Johnson suffered a foot injury in the November 16 win over the Detroit Lions that has caused him to miss the past five contests. He has yet to return to practice, not participating on Wednesday.

Linebacker Nakobe Dean exited Saturday's win over the Commanders with a hamstring injury. He did not practice on Wednesday. Defensive Coordinator Vic Fangio said on Tuesday that Dean is ""iffy for this week.""

If Dean is unable to play, Jihaad Campbell would start alongside Pro Bowl linebacker Zack Baun.

""He did fine,"" Defensive Coordinator Vic Fangio said of the first-round pick's development. ""Obviously, when we had to move him to OLB there when we ran out of guys for a few weeks, it kind of slowed his development or progress as an ILB. It'd be good to get him back there and focused on that.""

Wide receiver A.J. Brown did not practice on Wednesday after having a procedure on his wisdom teeth.

Guard Landon Dickerson missed Wednesday's practice due to an illness.

Tight end Cameron Latu missed the Commanders game with a stinger. He was a full participant on Wednesday.

QB Josh Allen limited, but 'will be playing' Sunday

Bills quarterback Josh Allen finished Sunday's win over the Browns with a foot injury. The Bills held a walkthrough on Wednesday, but if it was a full practice, the reigning league MVP would have been limited.

Allen addressed reporters on Tuesday and admitted that the foot is sore, but ""it feels good. Ready to go."" When directly asked if he's playing Sunday against the Eagles, Allen confidently said, ""Yes, I will be playing.""

Allen had an X-ray on the foot at halftime of Sunday's game, but did not miss any snaps.

Seven Bills would not have practiced on Wednesday. Buffalo shifted its schedule, so the Bills will not practice on Thursday, so the report will be an estimation as well.

It remains to be seen whether Allen will have two of his top targets at tight end as both Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox would not have practiced on Wednesday due to knee injuries.

Starting defensive tackle DaQuan Jones has been battling a calf injury. He would not have practiced on Wednesday.

Defensive end Joey Bosa (hamstring) and safety Jordan Poyer (ankle) also would have been sidelined on Wednesday.

Dallas Cowboys at Washington Commanders (+8.5) (Thursday)

Commanders: Nick Bellore (concussion), Jayden Daniels (left elbow), Marcus Mariota (right hand/quad), Daron Payne (back), Laremy Tunsil (oblique) OUT

Washington is down to Josh Johnson as its starting quarterback. It will be without important pieces on the offensive and defensive lines.

Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings (+7.5) (Thursday)

Lions: Avonte Maddox (back/illness), Giovanni Manu (knee) OUT; Marcus Davenport (shoulder), Taylor Decker (shoulder/rest), Khalil Dorsey (illness), Tom Kennedy (abdomen), Christian Mahogany (fibula), Alim McNeill (abdomen), David Montgomery (illness), Al-Quadin Muhammad (knee), Amik Robertson (hand), Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee) QUESTIONABLE

Vikings: T.J. Hockenson (shoulder), Ryan Kelly (concussion), Jordan Mason (ankle), J.J. McCarthy (right hand) OUT; Brian O'Neill (heel) QUESTIONABLE

The Lions seemingly have half their roster listed as questionable here, including two important offensive linemen, their top wide receiver and an important running back. They're also banged up on all levels of the defense.

Minnesota's offense is extremely banged up heading into this game. Max Brosmer is starting in McCarthy's place and he could be without two starting offensively linemen, in addition to two of his key weapons.

Denver Broncos at Kansas City Chiefs (+13.5) (Thursday)

Broncos: Karene Reid (hamstring), Nate Adkins (knee), Pat Bryant (concussion), Dre Greenlaw (hamstring), Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) OUT

Chiefs: Jake Briningstool (hamstring) OUT; Jaylon Moore (knee), Derrick Nnadi (illness), Nikko Remigio (knee), George Karlaftis (illness), Nick Bolton (illness) QUESTIONABLE

The Broncos will be without one of their rotational receivers as well as one of their premier linebackers but should remain heavily favored in large part due to Kansas City's volume of injuries.

Kansas City placed by Rashee Rice, Tyquan Thornton, Trent McDuffie and Jaylen Watson all on injured reserve. The Chiefs are depleted all over the place and appear to have an illness sweeping through the defensive side of their locker room.

Bowers, 23, suffered a PCL injury and bone bruise in his left knee in Las Vegas' season-opening win over the New England Patriots. He played through the injury in the team's next three games before missing three games to try to recover from the injury. In his first game back from that absence, he registered 12 catches for 127 yards and three touchdowns.

Overall, Bowers finishes the season with 64 receptions for 780 yards and seven touchdowns -- all team highs, but the first two categories significantly down from a historic 112-catch, 1,194-yard debut season. Bowers' 112 receptions were a rookie record, and his 1,194 yards were a rookie tight end record.

The Raiders finish the season with games against the New York Giants and against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Week 17 matchup in New York is an important one, as both teams sport 2-13 records, tied for the worst in the NFL. The loser of that game will take over the top spot in the NFL Draft order.

Rice, 25, appeared in just 11 games. After being suspended the first six games of the season, he returned and provided an immediate spark to the offense, accruing 53 catches for 571 yards and five touchdowns. However, he reported concussion symptoms after Week 15 and was inactive in Week 16. Now, with Kansas City's playoff hopes extinguished and Patrick Mahomes (ACL) done for the season, the Chiefs have shut down Rice as well.

So you can do as much as you want, but then you get on the side, you get into doing football things, it's a little different than what you've been doing.
""Because I go out there and I'm like, damn, this feels good, it sounds good, it looks good.
""I mean, I love football,"" Hunt said.
""I like to play football, and I ain't played football in a minute, so I think I would have thought about playing no matter what.","Hunt laughed and said of his upcoming trip to the mall, "" It's not really shopping, I'm just touching up, you know what I mean? That's all, just a little brush up, make sure I got everything I need. That's it.""

By starting the clock Wednesday, they could conceivably activate him from injured reserve at any time. But he shook off the idea that it would be very soon, since he still had to get into football shape after 14 weeks of rest and rehab, and Wednesday was about easing back in.

""We're really excited,"" Panthers head coach Dave Canales said earlier this week. ""He's making progress. That's a real possibility for this week, to see if we can get him out there in a capacity to do some individual drills, to start leaning on people. He's worked his way into that area.""

""In the standpoint of like anxiety, I'm fine; I think it's like riding a bike,"" he said. ""Once you get out there and you play, you play. I'm not really worried about that part of it, I don't think.

""I just got to get in shape, you know what I mean? Doing football is its own thing, right? So you can do as much as you want, but then you get on the side, you get into doing football things, it's a little different than what you've been doing. So, some more reps of that, and then, we'll see how it goes from there.""

""I didn't think it wasn't possible,"" he admitted. ""I just kind of I told myself from the get-go, like that's who I am. I ain't going to, I guess, soak in the pain or whatever it is. It is what it is.

""We don't know. We'll see how it goes,"" he said when asked if a potential playoff game was a more realistic expectation. ""This is literally my first day after. I know my body. I know my body does react, and it goes quick, so I can be ready if I do it the right way, I probably could be ready by whenever.

""I think seeing the guys playing well, doing good, just seeing that and feeling the crowd out there just kind of energized me in general,"" he said. ""Because I go out there and I'm like, damn, this feels good, it sounds good, it looks good. I want to play, so that just that, that keeps me motivated.

""I was just taking it one day at a time, you know, and if, if it came about, it came about, and you know, we'll see how the future goes.""

""I mean, I love football,"" Hunt said. ""I like to play football, and I ain't played football in a minute, so I think I would have thought about playing no matter what. Because I love the game of football and I want to play and I like the feeling of what it does, but it'll probably be a little different conversation than what it is now. . . .

""It's been fun, man. This fan base and everybody in this building is looking for something great and looking to build something great, and I think that this year is just another step of what we're trying to hit and take the program. So it's been fun to watch and tell myself that I'm a part of it even if I'm not physically playing, I think I do a lot of different things in this building to help uplift different people and bring who I am to the building still. So I feel like I'm a part of still in that certain way, but excited to try to win some games and be a part of the actual physicality and stuff like that.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/p5qe2miierxu8xlcdqn9,N,,2025-12-24 20:00:51.051398

Jackson, who suffered a back contusion on Sunday night against the Patriots, hasn’t practiced on Tuesday or Wednesday. If he’s unable to play, Snoop Huntley will get the start.

A loss would eliminate the Ravens from postseason contention. And it would potentially spark significant changes in Baltimore.

Earlier this week, coach John Harbaugh was asked about his job security, after 18 years with the team. Until his situation is clarified for 2026, it will be a hot spot for a possible coaching change once the regular season ends — whether the decision is voluntary, involuntary, or mutual.

Separately, a strange vibe continues to linger between Jackson and the Ravens. It’s a natural byproduct of Jackson not having an agent, especially after the difficult negotiations that culminated in a five-year deal after he asked to be traded (and while he was available to any team under the non-exclusive franchise tag), his more recent desire for a new deal following the latest shifts in the market, and the disclosure of unusual details regarding the team’s difficulty in communicating with Jackson, via the 61-page ruling in the collusion case filed after he didn’t get a fully-guaranteed contract.

Most recently, Jackson’s back injury was initially described as a “bruise.” Intentional or not, Jackson may not have appreciated the implication that it’s an injury that shouldn’t keep him from playing.

On Tuesday, Mike Preston of the Baltimore Sun suggested that it’s time for the Ravens to explore the possibility of trading Jackson. Jackson has two years left on his contract; based on his 2027 cap number, the franchise tag for 2028 would cost the Ravens $89 million in cash and cap space. If they don’t trade him in the next two years, he’ll be able to walk away in free agency.

Some think Jackson would like to play in Miami. With $99 million in cap charges to be absorbed in 2026 and 2027, as a result of the ill-advised Tua Tagovailoa contract, it will be virtually impossible for the Dolphins to make that move. Preston also pointed to the Raiders as a possible destination for Jackson.

Regardless, the current situation in Baltimore is feeling less and less sustainable, in more ways that one. It could result in a new coach, a new starting quarterback, or both.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8dba952/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3322+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F73%2F648faae64200965f387a8c741cab%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2253269563,N,,2025-12-24 17:02:43.837251

There's no bigger question for the Packers and its fan base heading into the team's home finale on Dec. 27 than that one.

Love was knocked out of the team's 22-16 overtime loss to the Chicago Bears on Dec. 20 with a concussion after a helmet-to-helmet hit in the second quarter. He's progressing through the concussion protocol steps needed to return, but his status still isn't clear for the Week 17 game.

Here's what we know about whether the Packers' QB1 will play on Saturday night:

Buy Packers tickets on StubHub

Is Jordan Love playing this week?

Packers head coach Matt LaFleur gave an honest answer on Wednesday, Dec. 24, three days before the Packers' next game as to whether Love will be on the field.

“Who knows?” LaFleur said. “I really don’t know.""

LaFleur initially stated that he anticipated knowing Love's status a day before the game but quickly retracted that statement, noting there's a lot of variables at play.

""It’s just a very delicate issue,"" LaFleur noted. ""We’ve seen it with certain guys, they come in, they feel great one day, and then the next day they don’t. So it really is kind of a moving target.”

What is the NFL concussion protocol?

Love must follow and pass a five-step process before being cleared to fully practice or participate in an NFL game. It's the same protocol for any player who suffers a concussion in a game.

Here are the five steps:

Symptom limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

The NFL notes that since each player and each concussion is unique, there is no set timeframe for return to play.

A player's current concussive injury, plus past exposures and medical history, family history and future risk in managing a player's care are all considered by team medical staff, the NFL states.

After Love goes through the five-step process and is cleared for full participation by the Packers' club physician, he must be seen and separately cleared by an Independent Neurological Consultant. Only after Love is cleared by the INC can he return to an NFL game.

Jordan Love injury update

Love remains in concussion protocol ahead of the Packers' game against the Ravens.

But Love took part in a walk-through with the team on Tuesday, Dec. 23, and was a limited participant in practice on Wednesday, Dec. 24.

While Love returned to practice on Dec. 24, backup quarterback Malik Willis did not practice due to an illness. He is also battling a banged up shoulder, an injury he received late in regulation against the Bears. Willis, however, has said that he intends to play on Saturday if needed.

Here's the Packers' QB depth chart as the statuses of the team's top two quarterbacks remains fluid midway through the week.

The health of linebacker T.J. Watt is once again on everyone's mind.

Coach Mike Tomlin had no update on Watt during his weekly press conference, after Watt missed the last two games due to a lung issue. He did say he is 'hopeful' that he will be back at practice this week. And his hopes can true as Watt was on the field on Wednesday in a limited capacity..

""No new update on T.J.,"" said Tomlin. ""I'm sure he's been in the building, but I'll gain further information about his potential participation at the early portions of the week and where that might lead.

""I'll let him speak in terms of his medical. I think for me, to talk about injury is one thing. To talk about medical is something else.

""So, that's one of the reasons why I've been a little bit hesitant, besides my lack of expertise on the subject matter.""

Also on the injury front, Tomlin talked about the status of multiple players, some like cornerback James Pierre, who has missed time recently, to those who were injured against the Lions.

""James Pierre worked out (Tuesday),"" said Tomlin. ""We'll see where that leads us. I'm sure he'll be limited and we'll follow his progress throughout the week.

""(Isaac) Seumalo, no update there.

""Nick Herbig is looking optimistic in terms of game availability. He will be limited in the early portions of the week.

""Some in-game things that happened. Brandin Echols with his groin. I don't know where that is. Certainly hopeful. We are certainly thin in the secondary, but that's life this time of year. We'll see where his participation might pick up as we push through the week and thus his availability.

""Jaylen Warren should be limited at the early portions of the week.

""Spencer Anderson, likewise, but we're optimistic that both guys will be available to us.

The move comes with two weeks to go and the Raiders (2-13) eliminated from the playoff race long ago.

Bowers, 23, suffered a PCL injury and bone bruise in his left knee in Las Vegas' season-opening win over the New England Patriots. He played through the injury in the team's next three games before missing three games to try to recover from the injury. In his first game back from that absence, he registered 12 catches for 127 yards and three touchdowns.

Overall, Bowers finishes the season with 64 receptions for 780 yards and seven touchdowns -- all team highs, but the first two categories significantly down from a historic 112-catch, 1,194-yard debut season. Bowers' 112 receptions were a rookie record, and his 1,194 yards were a rookie tight end record.

The Raiders finish the season with games against the New York Giants and against the Kansas City Chiefs.

Fantasy Football Injuries to Know

Quarterback

Jordan Love (QB – GB)

Love suffered a dirty helmet-to-helmet hit during Sunday’s game against Chicago, midway through the second quarter. Lying motionless for several moments, he was escorted off the field to the injury tent before being removed to the locker room, where it was confirmed that he sustained a concussion. Malik Willis came in for relief duty and played admirably well (9-of-11 passing for 121 yards and a touchdown, also rushing for 44 yards on scrambles) – and this has been a theme over the last few years.

Fantasy Impact: At this point, we should be well accustomed to the NFL’s concussion protocol and understand that it typically takes a whole week for players to return to action. Love is likely to miss Week 17 against Baltimore in a must-have matchup for both teams. Fantasy managers can view Malik Willis as an upside QB2 pivot option, in the event that they are dealing with injury situations or a rough matchup on paper for their starting option. We would also advise managers to keep an eye on Willis’s health status, who appeared to injure his shoulder against the Bears but was able to play through the pain. Willis *should* be able to go, but monitor practice reports and statuses accordingly.

Marcus Mariota (QB – WAS)

Washington’s quarterback situation is quickly turning into a “last man standing” situation. Mariota was thrust back into starting duties after the Commanders opted to shut down Jayden Daniels for the remainder of the season, but he injured both his right hand (needing stitches after it was stepped on by another player) and a pulled quadriceps muscle. To complicate matters further, Washington has a short week of rest and takes on Dallas during Thursday Night Football.

Fantasy Impact: Journeyman Josh Johnson would presumably draw the start against the Cowboys if Mariota is unable to play, in a game where both teams have been eliminated from playoff contention. Although the Cowboys secondary is still horrible, we’d advise looking elsewhere for help on the waiver wire in your championship matchup.

Gardner Minshew (QB – KC)

Minshew drew his first start of the year in Week 16 after Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL the week prior, and didn’t last long before he was knocked out of action. Taken off the field with a knee injury, the initial fears were that he had also sustained a torn ACL, but tests taken afterwards thankfully ruled that out. Instead, he was diagnosed with a “non-displaced tibial plateau fracture,” and Kansas City placed Minshew on IR, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: South Dakota State product Chris Oladokun (drafted in the seventh round during 2022) will start for Kansas City in Week 17 at home against Denver. Though he played relatively well against Tennessee in spot duties last week, it would be absolute madness to consider playing him in a championship game against one of the NFL’s toughest opponents. His presence under center caps the upside of Travis Kelce, Xavier Worthy, and the Chiefs’ running backs.

J.J. McCarthy (QB – MIN)

I would hate to place the “injury-prone” label upon McCarthy this early in his career, but he certainly does have a difficult time staying on the field. During Sunday’s victory over the hapless New York Giants, McCarthy was knocked out of action after sustaining an injury to his hand, forcing backup Max Brosmer into action. Reports state that X-rays taken were negative and ruled out a broken bone, but McCarthy is set to undergo additional testing to see the extent of the damage. Head coach Kevin O’Connell labeled JJMC as “day to day”, and he was a non-participant in Monday’s estimated practice report.

Fantasy Impact: Considering that the injury is to McCarthy’s throwing hand and that the Vikings are playing on a short week against Detroit, it is difficult to envision a scenario where he manages to take the field against the Lions. Backup Max Brosmer is the assumed starter in a matchup best left avoided. In his lone start this season against Seattle, Brosmer threw four interceptions and looked utterly lost under center.

Running Back

Jordan Mason (RB – MIN)

Sunday’s game against New York was a house of horrors for Minnesota, with both Mason and Aaron Jones departing the Vikings’ first possession due to ankle injuries. Though Jones was able to return and play for the remainder of the game, Mason was ruled out shortly afterwards and missed the rest of the contest. The severity of his injury hasn’t been released, but Minnesota did list him as a non-participant in their estimated injury report released on Monday.

Fantasy Impact: Whenever Mason or Jones miss action, the other option typically sees a boost in value, propelling them to mid-RB2 territory. Jones will be heavily relied upon for Minnesota against Detroit, in a matchup where most analysts expect the Lions to throttle the Purple People Eaters. With Max Brosmer under center, Jones will be featured as long as he can remain standing.

Quinshon Judkins (RB – CLE)

Judkins sustained a dislocated right ankle and fractured fibula in the first quarter of Cleveland’s loss against Buffalo, ending his 2025 season. The Browns stated that he is set to undergo surgery on Tuesday and will face a four to five-month recovery timeline, with the hopes that he returns to the practice field for spring drills during the offseason. Fellow rookies Dylan Sampson and Raheim Sanders will split backfield duties, with Sanders operating as the early-down option and Sampson functioning as the pass-catching and third-down back.

Fantasy Impact: Sampson would be the preferred add in the Browns’ backfield, given his prolific usage as a checkdown option for quarterback Shadeur Sanders. We don’t have much faith that the team will have success moving the ball downfield on Pittsburgh, but fantasy managers who are in desperate need of an add at the position in PPR formats could stream Sampson as a FLEX option in a pinch.

Kimani Vidal (RB – LAC)

Midway through the fourth quarter, Vidal was removed from Sunday’s contest against Dallas with a neck strain, after rushing the ball five times for 11 yards. Playing the clear second-fiddle behind Omarion Hampton against the Cowboys, Vidal has been ceding snaps to the rookie ever since his return. Currently described as “day to day” by the Chargers, Hassan Haskins would pick up a spot start if Vidal isn’t able to play Week 17 against Houston.

Fantasy Impact: Make no mistake, this is now Hampton’s backfield, and any backup option is only coming in for spot snaps while he takes a breather. Both Vidal and Haskins are best left avoided, and would only produce value if Hampton suffered an injury, or was tackled just short of the goal line for the possibility of a vultured touchdown.

Wide Receiver

Ryan Flournoy (WR – DAL)

This is an upsetting addition to the list, since Flournoy was carving out a nice role for himself behind CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens in Dallas. After catching two passes for 18 yards and a touchdown against Los Angeles, Flournoy was targeted in the head by Denzel Perryman, who was subsequently suspended two games for his dirty hit. Thankfully, Flournoy didn’t sustain a concussion, and he is only nursing a knee injury at this point. Nick Harris of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram indicated that Flournoy is going to attempt to play on Thursday on the road against Washington, and the team listed him as a limited participant during Monday’s estimated report.

Fantasy Impact: If Flournoy can take the field, he is an interesting flier to start against a Washington Commanders team that allows the second-most yards per game on defense. Despite being knocked out of the playoffs, Dallas is playing for pride. Flournoy is a FLEX option in deeper formats if he can get out there, and if he misses time, his targets would likely be allocated towards tight end Jake Ferguson.

Calvin Austin (WR – PIT)

Austin’s inclusion here with a hamstring injury coincides with the league suspending hothead D.K. Metcalf after he inexplicably punched a fan on the sidelines. Their absences will leave Pittsburgh short of receiving options for Week 17 on the road against Cleveland, with the Steelers needing to string together victories to remain in playoff contention.

Fantasy Impact: The absence of both Austin and Metcalf would thrust veterans Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Adam Thielen into larger roles, against a defense that is easier to beat through the air than in the running game. Neither is a recommended starting option for your championship week, but MVS always carries the shot of a long touchdown reception for managers desperate enough.

Pat Bryant (WR – DEN)

In the final minute of Denver’s 34-20 loss against Jacksonville, Bryant was rocked with a big hit and carted off the field. Before the injury, he had caught five passes on eight targets for 42 yards, operating as the 1B option behind Courtland Sutton. Bryant was taken to a local hospital for further evaluation for a concussion and was eventually released on Monday after all other tests came back negative. Placed into the league’s five-step protocol, it will be nearly impossible for him to take the field on Thursday against Kansas City.

Fantasy Impact: Bryant’s expected absence opens up additional targets for Troy Franklin and Marvin Mims Jr. , as Denver attempts to fend off the Los Angeles Chargers for the AFC West title. Franklin would be the player I would recommend targeting in his absence, given his connection with quarterback Bo Nix and his prior success this season. Franklin slides into the WR3 conversation, with Mims being an upside FLEX.

Tight End

George Kittle (TE – SF)

Kittle was in the midst of a breakout game against Indianapolis on Monday Night Football, racking up seven receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown through the third quarter. Unfortunately, Kittle walked off the field gingerly with an ankle issue and was forced to miss the entire fourth quarter. Thankfully, San Francisco was able to stave off the Colts without him, but it is concerning that he couldn’t power through the injury. Head coach Kyle Shanahan stated on Monday that it was too early to know the severity of his injury.

Fantasy Impact: Jake Tonges would slide in as the receiving threat at tight end, should Kittle remain sidelined. San Francisco has already clinched a spot in the playoffs, though the team is jockeying with Los Angeles and Seattle for the NFC West lead and a higher seed. Tonges managed to have a string of good games earlier this year (especially Weeks 4-6) when Kittle was out of action, catching multiple touchdowns as a target for Brock Purdy. Given the lack of depth at tight end, he would be a low-end TE1 streamer if needed.",https://cdn.fantasypros.com/wp-content/images/jordan_love_packers_18-1-1/1470x650.jpg,N,,2025-12-24 15:01:56.554524

Palace manager Oliver Glasner said Richards was a doubt to face Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday but explained the injury did not appear serious and was hopeful he would be able to return in the new year.

The defender appeared to sustain the problem as he jumped to challenge for a header in the 75th minute at the Emirates. He received treatment on the pitch, with his boot and sock removed from his right foot, and the lower half of his body was covered in a sheet as he was carried off the pitch.

“He had a knock on his foot, (someone) stamped on his foot and it had to be stitched,” Glasner told a post-match press conference. “The doctor told me it doesn’t look so bad. I’m always hopeful and we have to be hopeful.

“I don’t know if he will be OK for the Tottenham game but I’m still hoping he will be back for the Fulham game (on January 1) because we have 16 outfield players and we can’t afford to miss someone else.“

Glasner added to Sky Sports: “(Without him) we struggled a little bit with (defending) tall players. He’s one of our best headers and we had to take him off and Will Hughes comes on because we didn’t have a tall player or tall defender on the bench.”

Tuesday’s cup tie finished in a 1-1 draw and was sent to penalties after Marc Guehi’s 95th-minute equaliser cancelled out Maxence Lacroix’s own goal. Both sides’ first seven penalties were successfully dispatched, but after William Saliba converted Arsenal’s eighth, Lacroix’s effort was saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga.

Richards, 25, has featured 24 times in all competitions for Palace this season and has started all 17 of his side’s Premier League games.

His injury comes ahead of a busy period of fixtures for Palace, who play Tottenham, Fulham, Newcastle United and Aston Villa over the course of the next two weeks.

The defender has been capped 35 times by the U.S. since his senior debut in 2020 and is a regular starter under Mauricio Pochettino.

The U.S.’s World Cup preparations were dealt a blow last week when midfielder Tyler Adams suffered a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury during Bournemouth’s draw against Manchester United. He could be sidelined for up to three months and faces a race to be fit for Pochettino’s side’s next pair of matches, international friendlies against Belgium and Portugal on March 28 and March 31.

‘A sigh of relief for the U.S.’

Analysis from U.S. Soccer Editor Avi Creditor

On the shortlist of players the U.S. could ill afford to have get hurt entering the World Cup, Richards is high on it, so Glasner’s relatively positive prognosis should emit a big sigh of relief from Mauricio Pochettino and all U.S. supporters. Richards has emerged as a leader in the player pool on and off the field, and he is both the Americans’ most adept defender and most dangerous target on the end of set pieces. The cupboard beyond Richards as it relates to true centre-backs is quite bare, and the thought of a World Cup without him would be a daunting one.

Despite being 38, Tim Ream remains entrenched in Pochettino’s plans, but Miles Robinson and Mark McKenzie would become far more important in the player pool in the event of a longer-term situation, as would Celtic’s Auston Trusty. A wild card beyond them is uncapped 19-year-old Noahkai Banks, who has become a fixture for Augsburg in the Bundesliga and could still find himself thrown a high-intensity audition in March in friendlies against Belgium and Portugal — the last two matches before Pochettino is expected to announce his final World Cup squad.

Another wild card in the mix in the back is midfielder Tanner Tessmann, who has been given a runout at centre-back by Lyon and has proven versatile. With both Richards and, to a greater extent, Tyler Adams sidelined (Adams should be back within three months), Tessmann’s ability to provide cover in midfield and in the back should cement his World Cup prospects.

From a personal standpoint, this not proving to be serious would be quite a boon for Richards. A leg injury forced him to miss the 2022 World Cup, where he was poised to play a role for Gregg Berhalter in Qatar. Still just 25, this wouldn’t be his last shot at playing in a World Cup, but missing one on home soil and in his prime after already missing out on another would be a brutally tough pill to swallow. Fortunately, it doesn’t look like this will put that participation in jeopardy.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/23164325/GettyImages-2252658446-scaled-e1766526238107.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-24 18:02:58.709770

Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka announced before practice that the following players would not participate:

Thomas is, of course, the Giants’ star left tackle and best offensive lineman. He suffered a hamstring injury early in the Giants’ 16-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday and played just 20 snaps. Thomas has played exceptionally well this season after returning from a Lisfranc injury. If he is compromised at all, it would seem prudent to shut him down. Marcus Mbow would likely play left tackle in Thomas’s place.

Kafka wasn’t ready to commit one way or the other with Thomas.

“ We’ll just kind of see how it feels. He’s got a couple days here to see how it looks,” Kafka said.

Harris, a sixth-round pick of the team in the 2025 NFL Draft, played in 14 games during his rookie season, with five starts.

He's the only player McCoy officially ruled out for Sunday's game vs the Saints.

""Unfortunately, he'll be done for the year,"" McCoy said of Harris. ""It's tough, because he has worked so hard and what he has done for this football team. The way he has worked, the way he has played, he has gotten better every week. … He has a really bright future.""

McCoy said ""hopefully (Harris) can rest for a while and everything settles down.""

""And obviously they'll reevaluate it as time goes on to see how he is feeling,"" McCoy said regarding potential surgery, ""and kind of go from there.""

The Titans placed receiver Bryce Oliver, edge Femi Oladejo, and edge Ali Gaye on the team's Designated to Return to Practice list last week.

This designation opened up a three-week window for all three players to practice with the team, and they will not count against the team's 53-man roster until being activated from Injured Reserve.

None of the players were activated for this past Sunday's game, but all three players were spotted at Tuesday's walkthrough practice.

McCoy on Wednesday did not commit to any of them playing again this season, however.

""Just like we have been saying from the first day they got back out there,"" McCoy said. ""With all three of those guys, if they are ready and they can be themselves, and it's the right thing to do, we'll bring them up and let them play.

""But if they are not really where we need them to be, then they won't play. Honestly, with each of them, it's day to day, kind of see where we're at, push them through things. They are picking it up daily and doing a little more.""

Harris and running back Julius Chestnut were the only two players not spotted on the field during the open portion of Tuesday's walkthrough, but both players were in the locker room during media availability.

Playoff races are heating up with two weeks left, teams are starting to think about the future, and fantasy league championships are upon us. So with all that in mind, insiders Jeremy Fowler and Dan Graziano have been calling sources around the NFL for the latest news and buzz on key situations heading into Week 17.

This week, we asked around on Joe Burrow and his Bengals outlook. Could the star quarterback want out of Cincinnati? Should we read into his recent comments? And which other QBs could theoretically be looking at changes this offseason?

Jeremy and Dan also poked around on the Jaguars, who are in the middle of a six-game win streak and are in the AFC 1-seed mix.

Burrow's situation | New QB1s next season

Jaguars' legitimacy | Pro Bowl reaction

More notes on Week 17

What are you hearing on Joe Burrow? Could he actually want out of Cincinnati?

Graziano: I think it's unlikely he wants out. People have been trying to get him out of Cincinnati since before the Bengals even drafted him, and he has never expressed any desire to not be there. Theories about what was bothering him at that news conference a couple of weeks ago are wide-ranging, with some believing he was going through something difficult off the field, and others believing he's sick of the way the Bengals operate. We don't know for sure, but I don't get the sense the Bengals are worried he's going to force his way out.

Fowler: Same, Dan. My sense is the Bengals have not received any indication that Burrow wants out of Cincinnati. One team source believed that Burrow was simply having a ""bad day"" two weeks ago at that initial news conference that sparked the consternation, saying, ""I truly think he wants to be here,"" and that he has been great in game prep. Assuming the Bengals will run it back with coach Zac Taylor, whose contract runs through the 2027 season, then all signs point to Burrow staying with the franchise next season.

But it feels like a crucial year for both the direction of the franchise and Burrow's place within it. Would Burrow like to see improvements to the roster and the overall strength of the team? Most likely. But even then, league executives I've spoken to see no chance Cincinnati ever considers trading him. He's under contract for four more seasons.

Graziano: That's the thing, right? He has been vocal in the past about decisions he'd like to see the team make, most prominently last year when he openly lobbied for new deals for Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Trey Hendrickson. I don't think he's shy about expressing these sentiments in private, either, and if there are things he'd like the front office to do better, I'm confident the front office knows about them. A big part of the issue with Burrow at this point is whether he can stay healthy, but other than that weird Week 15 no-show against the Ravens, the Bengals have been an awfully good offense when Burrow has been healthy. They need to fix the other side of the ball.

Fowler: Correct. The question is really pretty simple: Can the defense improve its personnel over the next four to five months? If it struggles mightily for another year, I could see Burrow being more forceful. There's simply not enough talent on that side to make a run at the AFC North. A few draft picks -- defensive end Myles Murphy and cornersDJ Turnerand Dax Hill-- look like keepers. But that's not enough. The Bengals will need to get creative in free agency and the draft to properly support Burrow and the offense.

What's the over/under on new QB1s in 2026?

Fowler: Let's set the line at six. The list of possibilities include the Jets,Dolphins,Browns,Vikings,Colts, Raiders,Cardinals,Falcons, Saints andSteelers. Several of these teams could keep their current starter, most notably the Colts, who are aiming to retain Daniel Jones. The Vikings must decide on whether to bring in competition for J.J. McCarthy, and the Steelers will await Aaron Rodgers' plans. Multiple teams could stick with their rookies, too;Tyler Shough in New Orleans is making a compelling case.

The most fascinating situation has to be Miami, which must decide whether to pay Tua Tagovailoa $54 million to walk away (assuming no trade) and start a cost-effective option in his place.

Graziano: Miami has a problem. The $99 million dead money hit that would result from releasing Tagovailoa would be tough to manage, even if spread over two years. Denver has been just fine absorbing the $80 million dead money charge for Russell Wilson over the past two years, but part of that is because it has an elite defense and an elite offensive line and was able to find a rookie QB in Bo Nixto start right away and keep the team competitive. I'm not sure the Dolphins are in position to have any of those things in 2026.

I've brought this up a few times, and I'm still not sure how likely it is that there's a change here, but the Ravens have to do something with Lamar Jackson's contract or move on. He has two years left at $51.25 million per year in base salary, but none of his remaining money is guaranteed -- and the cap hit for next year balloons to $74.5 million. The Ravens need to extend him to get that cap hit down, or else they need to trade him, which obviously would open up yet another QB1 position for next season. Jackson has a no-trade clause, so he'd have some say in this if the Ravens decided to explore options.

They wouldn't be replacing him with a better player, because there really aren't any better players. But given that Jackson and coach John Harbaugh have won a total of three playoff games together since Jackson was drafted in 2018, it might be worth it for the Ravens to examine whether a new extension in excess of $60 million per year is the best way for them to build their team moving forward.

Fowler: Good call, Dan. It's clearly a situation Baltimore must handle with care. From that lens, it's worth noting that Jackson isn't exactly having his best ""contract year."" At the very least, his play is below his normal MVP standards. He has sat out three games and could sit out a fourth with his latest injury, a back contusion. Baltimore probably will miss the playoffs for the second time in his career. Such contract decisions are easier for the front office when the player and team are peaking at season's end, not declining.

Like with the coaching carousel, one or two surprises will surface at some point. Last offseason featured 10 quarterback changes. Yes, 10! And that's with only one rookie starter in Week 1 of 2025 (the Titans' Cam Ward). The veteran market was booming, and there were six new starters via either free agency or the draft. Derek Carr'sretirementand Geno Smith's move to Las Vegas via trade was not in the forecast a year ago.

Perhaps Kansas City should be on the list, with an asterisk?Patrick Mahomes faces a lengthy recovery from his torn ACL, and given the team's struggles this season, the Chiefs might need steady reinforcements for Week 1. Joe Flacco is the kind of QB who would make some sense. (Also: At one point I started to wonder whether Philadelphia would be looking at a change eventually, but Jalen Hurts is weathering that storm.)

Graziano: Kansas City is very much worth watching, because if nothing else, it is going to need quarterbacks to operate its offseason program. Even if Mahomes is back in time for the regular season, there are going to be a lot of practice reps, training camp reps and preseason game reps to go around. Do the Chiefs bring in a veteran who can start if Mahomes isn't ready right away? Do they draft a developmental QB with upside and offer him a chance at a full offseason of first-team reps to accelerate that development? Do they do some combination of both? The Chiefs' QB moves this offseason could give us some clue about Mahomes' recovery timetable.

What are people around the NFL saying about the Jaguars? Are they buying this run?

Graziano: To some extent, yes. Multiple people have texted me since Sunday to say Liam Coen should be Coach of the Year because of the team's 11-4 record and the apparent improvement in Trevor Lawrence's play. First-year defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile is also getting a lot of praise around the league for the way his unit has performed. And the trade deadline acquisition of Jakobi Meyers has been a difference-maker and allowed them to evolve an offense that's averaging 33 points since the start of November.

I think there is some skepticism -- as there would be with any contender new on the scene -- about how the Jaguars will perform in playoff games. But Lawrence does have a playoff win on his résumé, and the versatility of the Jaguars' offense combined with how tough they are up front on defense definitely has the attention of other teams.

Fowler:I've heard people say Coen is right there with Ben Johnson and Mike Vrabel in first-year coaches at their respective spots who are vying for Coach of the Year. The job Coen has done with the roster and especially with Lawrence has been impressive. From footwork to decisiveness, Lawrence looks like a different quarterback, and Coen deserves credit for that.

Keep in mind, this was an attractive job during the carousel. If GM Trent Baalke wasn't in the picture early in the process, I think Jacksonville luring Johnson was a possibility. Jacksonville realized that it had a good job on paper and had to pivot off Baalke to get a prime candidate, making Coen an offer he couldn't refuse. So from a talent standpoint, Coen was not walking into a rebuild. But what he has done with that talent on the roster is commendable.

Graziano:It wasn't a rebuild, but it's still a team that won only four games last season. And I think what's most impressive about Coen's performance is the methodical way he has gone about it. Lawrence was not playing this well early in the season, and Coen would have told you he was still learning the new offense and building chemistry with his receivers in that new scheme.

Brian Thomas Jr. struggled to find his spot in all of it, and No. 2 pick Travis Hunterwasinjured, as was tight end Brenton Strange. So the Jags leaned into their run game early behindTravis Etienne Jr.and got by for a while with a defense that was generating turnovers at a high level. The 4-1 start bought them time for Lawrence to get more comfortable in the offense, and Coen has been steady and consistent through the hot start, the midseason lull and the current six-game win streak. I would say people around the league are absolutely taking all of this seriously.

Fowler: How Jacksonville structures its future will be interesting in light of Meyers' three-year, $60 million extension signed last week. He has been lights-out since joining the team at the trade deadline. But Jacksonville has multiple standouts it could choose to pay, including Etienne, pass rusher Travon Walkerand linebacker Devin Lloyd. Those players have performed well but were not selected by first-year general manager James Gladstone. Either way, Jacksonville's pass-catching nucleus will be loaded with Meyers, Thomas, Hunter, Strange and Parker Washington.

What is one thing you've heard about the Pro Bowl rosters?

Fowler: Heavy chatter around the Eagles and the snubbing of defensive tackle Jordan Davis. TeammateJalen Cartergot the Pro Bowl nod among NFC defensive tackles, but if you ask the Eagles who has been their most dominant force up front this season, it's Davis without debate. And Chargers left tackle Joe Alt making the Pro Bowl off six games raised some questions. It's a weaker tackle pool in the AFC, but Indianapolis'Bernhard Raimann was a surer bet.

Graziano: The Packers thought Jordan Love would have a good chance. He's third in the NFL in QBR. Sam Darnold, who made the NFC roster, is 12th and has more than twice as many interceptions as Love has this season.

Fowler: Cornerback is of interest, because even though the position is loaded with top-shelf stars and the recipients were deserving, a few younger corners made compelling cases -- including a pair of 2023 second-round picks out of the AFC North in Pittsburgh's Joey Porter Jr. and Cincinnati'sDJ Turner II. And it feels as if several teams had too many Pro Bowl players; Dallas and Baltimore have losing records but boast five and six recipients, respectively.

Graziano: Maybe if we'd run the Jaguars' section of this notebook a week or so ago, it might have helped them get someone into the Pro Bowl besides their long-snapper, Ross Matiscik, who is their only representative. In particular, the Jags would have liked to see Josh Hines-Allen get that recognition. Or Devin Lloyd and his five interceptions.

What else are you hearing this week?

Graziano's notes:

It's a good sign for Packers quarterback Jordan Love that he was a limited participant in Tuesday's practice. Love remains in the concussion protocol, which means he still has to clear several steps and continually be monitored for a possible recurrence of symptoms. But being on the field in any capacity in what was effectively a Wednesday practice (because the Packers play on Saturday this week) means he's making progress through the protocol and can't yet be ruled out for Week 17.

Backup Malik Willis, who suffered a shoulder injury in Saturday's overtime loss to the Bears, was also on the practice field and limited. So the Packers opened the week with some encouraging updates on their potential to have one -- if not both -- of their top two QBs for a critical game against the Ravens this Saturday night at Lambeau Field.

Speaking of Willis, he's a very intriguing free agent to watch next spring. He was the 86th pick in the 2022 draft, which means he's playing on the fourth and final year of his rookie deal. He is 26 years old and has now spent basically two full seasons being coached by Matt LaFleur, Adam Stenavich and the Packers' offensive coaching staff, and he has played well when he has had to fill in for Love because of injury. As we discussed above, there are a lot of teams that are going to be in the QB market this offseason. Not all of them will be able to address the position via the draft, and several have their eyes on Willis as a potential solution given what he has been able to do in Green Bay. The Packers like him a lot and could try to keep him, but if he has a chance to go somewhere else and compete for a starting job, that might be tough to do.

The Chargers have a much tougher matchup this Saturday against Houston's fearsome defense than they did Sunday in Dallas. That Cowboys matchup was a breath of fresh air for a Chargers offense that has struggled with consistency while playing without both of its starting tackles and its two top running backs for most of the season. One of those running backs, Omarion Hampton, is back and running well. He told me after the game that Sunday was the best he has felt since his return from anankle injury earlier in the season.

Again, though, this week is going to be tougher for Hampton, Justin Herbert and the whole Chargers offense. They've been all about finding a way in spite of everything they've had to deal with this season. ""As a receiver, I'd love for us to throw the ball 50 times and all of us go for 200,"" Chargers wideoutLadd McConkey told me. ""Like, that would be sick. But that's not the situation we're in right now, and at the end of the day, we're winning football games, so there's not too much to complain about.""

The Cowboys' defense has been extremely permissive all season, and defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' seat could be getting hot even after just one year. As ESPN's Todd Archer pointed out, every time the Cowboys have allowed 400 or more points in a season since Jerry Jones has owned the team, they had either a new coordinator or a new defensive scheme the following season. They've already allowed 454 this season.

There could be a lot of changes on that side of the ball, where cornerback Trevon Diggs is coming off a disappointing season and has no guaranteed money left on his contract. Dallas would save about $12.5 million against its 2026 cap if it cut Diggs and another $21.5 million by releasing defensive tackle Kenny Clark, who was a big part of the return in the Micah Parsons trade but might now be expendable since the team has Quinnen Williams.

Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith is doing it differently every week during Pittsburgh's three-game winning streak. In Week 14 against Baltimore, Aaron Rodgers threw for a season-high 284 yards andDK Metcalfhad 148 of them while the Steelers ran for just 34 yards on 17 carries. In Week 15 against the Dolphins, it was the tight ends who drove the offense. And Sunday against the Lions, running backs Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell combined for 279 scrimmage yards and three touchdowns.

The Steelers would tell you they're encouraged by the week-to-week malleability of the offense but that they need to keep improving. Losing Metcalf to suspension for the final two weeks of the regular season is going to affect a lot of things because Metcalf contributes as a blocker in the run game and is a focal point for opposing defenses in the passing game. Pittsburgh clinches the division with a win in either of its final two games or a Ravens loss Saturday, but it would like the offense to be clicking a bit better once the postseason starts. Playing the final two games without Metcalf is going to make that a challenge.

Fowler's notes:

Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman's name has been heavily circulated in recent weeks. Here's what I know. Yes, the Giants are expected to have interest in him when the carousel kicks off. But the Titans have done their research, too. And so have a few teams that will either have an opening or potentially could have one. No teams have officially requested to speak with Freeman as of the last time I checked, but if Freeman wants to at least explore the possibility of the NFL via conversations with teams, he will have opportunities to do that. Freeman will take the next few weeks to make that decision.

Remember, he has no NFL coaching experience, so if he does partake in interviews, he'll be in a position to discover whether the nuances of the game are something he wants to entertain. I've talked to a few coaches with ties to Freeman who believe he will stay in college. So his name isn't going away, but that's the latest based on what I've heard.

The Commanders are ""trending"" toward starting Josh Johnson for the first time this season. Marcus Mariota hasn't practiced yet because of a hand injury, and recently signedJeff Driskel(off the Cardinals' practice squad) could serve as a No. 2 on game day. The tight Thursday turnaround makes it tough for Mariota in what's becoming a season to forget for Washington.

Vikings QB2 Max Brosmer's debut in Seattle in Week 13 was uninspiring, with four interceptions. But Brosmer has big fans in the Minnesota building because of his mental approach to the game, and he settled down when given another chance, completing 7 of 9 passes for 52 yards to help beat the Giants in relief of the injured J.J. McCarthy. We're not saying Brosmer is the next Brock Purdy, but Minnesota could have something here, and a start Thursday in Detroit will be another big showcase for him. Teams I talked to were impressed with his preseason tape.

The Rams very well could shut down Davante Adams (hamstring) for the final two regular-season games. Coach Sean McVay already declared Adams doubtful for Monday night vs. Atlanta, and a team source told me that it wouldn't be a surprise to see Adams miss Week 18 vs. Arizona, another game the Rams can win without their star receiver. The goal is to ensure Adams is 100 percent for the first week of the playoffs. Technically, he's week-to-week with an injury that hampered him weeks before he aggravated it vs. Detroit on Dec. 14.

49ers tight end George Kittle is dealing with a ""mid-to-low ankle sprain"" suffered Monday night in Indianapolis, per a source. It's unclear yet what that means for Week 17, but I'm told he at least has a chance, depending on how the week goes. Kittle suspected he avoided a high-ankle sprain postgame and that is indeed the case, which is relatively good news. The 49ers are accustomed to playing without Kittle, who missed five games early in the season with a hamstring issue, but it's all systems go for the playoff push now.

Vikings running back Jordan Mason is considered a long shot for Thursday night vs. Detroit, per a source. The Vikings aren't ruling him out yet, but playing on a Thursday night following an ankle injury is tough sledding. The Vikings activated Ty Chandler off injured reserve, which could be good timing for him.

Could one of the greatest left tackles of all time enter free agency in March? Trent Williams is healthy this season, and it's showing. The 49ers think Williams, 37, is having one of his best months in recent memory. But his massive 2026 cap hit of $38.8 million is approaching. That's second on the team behind pass rusher Nick Bosa ($42 million), who is 28 and unlikely to go anywhere. Meanwhile, Williams -- who's a 2027 free agent -- has said he's open to playing until age 40. If that's still the case, the 49ers have a decision to make: Give an elite but aging player a market deal (hint: it's not a small market), stand pat and ride out the cap hit, or entertain a player release or trade. Williams is a fixture in San Francisco, so perhaps it can work something out. But it's not lost on the player that this decision is looming and something most likely must be done. Williams' current contract includes $22.2 million in base salary and a $10 million option bonus due April 1.

Debate about Derrick Henry's usage late in Baltimore's Week 16 loss to New England is nothing new, internally or externally. The Ravens have struggled to find balance on offense. The challenge is clear: The team has a bevy of playmakers who need the ball, but their best option is quite often giving Henry the ball and loading up with blockers and hammering defenses.

I know that getting away from that formula has frustrated some people in the building at times. He's averaging 16.7 carries per game, well below last season's 19.1. Henry's four fumbles haven't helped, to be sure, but the Ravens are still dangerous if they can somehow get in the playoffs. This is largely the same unit that ranked first in total offense in 2024 under coordinator Todd Monken, yet it ranks 18th this year. Henry will be a factor in that push.

Seattle GM John Schneider hasn't won Executive of the Year since taking over the Seahawks' personnel operation in 2010. This feels like his year. Seattle has done a masterful job of roster building without the support of a generational passer. Schneider's Russell Wilson trade in 2022 helped replenish the roster with several impact players. Dealing Geno Smith and DK Metcalf in March were bold moves that paid off. The Sam Darnold acquisition proved to be an upgrade while saving millions compared to what Smith earned in Las Vegas. And Seattle's past three drafts have produced at least five bona fide or emerging stars:Jaxon Smith-Njigba(2023),Devon Witherspoon (2023),Byron Murphy II(2024), Grey Zabel(2025) and Nick Emmanwori (2025).

Schneider also made one of the best hires of the most recent coaching cycles with Mike Macdonald, who can match wits with Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay in the NFC West. It's hard to ignore what Seattle has done. In addition, Schneider's assistant general manager, Nolan Teasley, could garner GM interest during this cycle.

Henderson, 23, left Sunday’s game in the second quarter after he fell over backwards to end a short run. He was checked out on the field by members of the Patriots’ medical staff as well as Vrabel himself, and after a brief stint in. the blue medical tent left the field for the locker room. Originally announced as questionable to return, he was ruled out for the remainder of the contest at the. half.

Boutte, 23, came down hard on a near-reception in the fourth quarter. The third-year receiver, who should have drawn a pass interference flag on the play, tried to haul in a Drake Maye deep pass with cornerback Marlon Humphrey draped all over him. While he did get his hands on it, he failed to compete the catch and in the process of doing so hit his head on the turf. He too was unable to finish the game.

With Lamar Jackson having suffered a variety of injuries this season, Sports Illustrated’s Conor Orr said the Ravens need to take a big-picture view of their quarterback situation.

Orr contended that they should draft a quarterback to back up Jackson and give the organization some flexibility.

""No one is saying that Jackson needs to go, but the sensible among us are saying that Jackson needs a safety net that can one day grow into his replacement on a structured rookie contract,"" Orr wrote.

Orr believes the 2026 draft is the right time to do it.

""Baltimore would have the 14th pick based on current standings, in a quarterback class that serves as the preamble to a much more anticipated 2027 group, which could mean a shorter line between the Ravens and a promising option at the position,"" Orr wrote. ""If Jackson is healthy next season, the Ravens are going to almost certainly be boxed out from taking a top-tier quarterback in the following draft.""

Jackson, who turns 29 in two weeks, missed three games this season with a hamstring injury. He also missed at least one practice over the past seven weeks, in part because of knee, ankle, and toe injuries.

Jackson suffered a painful back contusion in Sunday's loss to the New England Patriots and was not able to participate in Tuesday’s walk-through practice ahead of this Saturday night's must-win game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.

Injuries limited Jackson to 12 games in both 2021 and 2022, but he did not miss a single game due to injury in 2023 or 2024.

""If you remove illness and rest with a playoff spot already clinched, Jackson has appeared on an NFL injury report 17 times,"" Orr wrote. ""Jackson also has only about 800 fewer carries than Saquon Barkley, who was drafted the same year (1,077 to 1,807). Many of those are kneeldowns in victory formation, but you can add in that Jackson has been sacked 225 times in his career and hit in the pocket 178 times. I have zero —zero —doubt that Jackson's arm talent can help him translate seamlessly into a different phase of his career once his outlier athleticism winnows to the point where it is no longer an advantage. But Baltimore does not know what that looks like yet.

""When taking all of this into consideration, adding in that Jackson's mega-extension will again need to be reworked, the solution seems abundantly clear to me: The Ravens do not need to trade Jackson. They don't need to fire John Harbaugh. But they do need to make 2026 their 'Jordan Love' year and draft a worthy successor to Jackson, which would buttress the Ravens against the kind of collapse we saw this season, give the team a position of strength at the negotiating table and facilitate a situation like Green Bay enjoyed with late-Packer Aaron Rodgers, who won back-to-back MVP awards, in part, after submitting to an offense that more effectively balanced his skill set with a sensible run game.""

Why the Ravens Can Bounce Back Next Season

ESPN’s Ben Solak identified the factors that have contributed to the Ravens being 7-8 and on the brink of elimination from the playoffs. Injuries, an inconsistent offensive line, and a lack of pass rush were among them.

There's no denying it's been a disappointing and frustrating season, but Solak believes the Ravens can bounce back in 2026. He based his opinion in part on what he saw from the Ravens on both sides of the ball in the Patriots game.

""If defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike can come back healthy next season, the Ravens have most of their defensive core intact and under contract – they just need an edge rusher (or two, or three),"" Solak wrote. ""So there's reason to expect the defense to continue excelling next season and for the offense to immediately elevate when Jackson returns to health. You could see that through the cracks in the first half against the Patriots. The defense got stops against one of the league's best offenses.

""Jackson looked spry, and the passing game finally looked explosive again. Running back Derrick Henry had one of his best games of the season, posting a 66.7% success rate on the ground and the fastest average speed (13.81 mph) on rushes in a game this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Had the Ravens finished the job, it would have been a statement win for a team clawing its way back into postseason relevance. Instead, Jackson went down with another injury. Tyler Huntley stepped in admirably, but with Henry sidelined (rather peculiarly) for a potential game-salting drive, the Ravens surrendered their 11-point lead and added another notch on the battered post of games they should have won but oddly lost.

""Had Jackson been healthy, it likely would have ended differently. True of the game Sunday night. True of the season, too.""

Zay Flowers' Second Pro Bowl Nod Significantly Increases His Fifth-Year Option Salary

After becoming the Ravens' first Pro Bowl wide receiver last year, Zay Flowers received his second nod this season.

By making the Pro Bowl again, Flowers' fifth-year option salary rose from $24.4 million to $28 million, per Spotrac.

The Baltimore Banner’s Jonas Shaffer looked at what the development could mean for Flowers' future with the organization.

""Only 12 wide receivers have deals worth more than $28 million annually, but the market at the position moves quickly,"" Shaffer wrote. ""In two years, $28 million for a player of Flowers' caliber could be seen as a bargain. … Even if the Ravens don't pick up Flowers' fifth-year option — teams have a May 1 deadline to decide on their 2023 first-round picks — they could still have a future together. Flowers will be eligible for an extension this offseason.

""The Ravens didn't wait long to secure Kyle Hamilton's future last August, making him the NFL's highest-paid safety after just three seasons in Baltimore. Flowers isn't quite the transcendent talent that Hamilton is. But he ranked 14th among all receivers with at least 80 targets last season in yards per route run (2.3), according to Pro Football Focus, and he ranks seventh this year (2.4), ahead of stars like the Cincinnati Bengals' Ja'Marr Chase and Houston Texans' Nico Collins.""

Ronnie Stanley Named One of Biggest Pro Bowl Snubs

The Ravens had six Pro Bowlers, tied with the Denver Broncos, Seattle Seahawks, and San Francisco 49ers for the most in the league. Baltimore also had three alternates.

One player who didn't make it but probably should have is left tackle Ronnie Stanley. ESPN’s Seth Walder named Stanley one of the biggest Pro Bowl snubs.

Walder made the case for Stanley getting the nod over the Los Angeles Chargers' Joe Alt, who made the roster as the third offensive tackle.

""Don't get me wrong, I love Joe Alt,"" Walder wrote. ""He was on pace to be Protector of the Year if he had stayed healthy. But he played only six games, which is in no way enough to make a Pro Bowl. I'd be open to multiple tackles at this spot, but Stanley ranks fifth in pass block win rate and 13th in run block win rate. Metrics-wise, he looks like the most deserving next man up in the AFC after Dion Dawkins and Garett Bolles.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/ravens/pz90lztfervdgeydlr8v,N,,2025-12-24 12:05:45.535425

The good news is that Judkins should be back on the field for the start of training camp. The bad news, however, is that the Browns may still need …","data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 width=%22280%22 height=%22280%22 viewBox=%220 0 280 280%22><path transform=%22translate(97.3,0)%22 d=%22M44,140.1h42.8V272H54.9c0-0.1,0-103.8,0-103.8H44V140.1z M44,1c28.4,0,42.6,16.2,42.6,42.2v66.1H54.9V43.8 c0-7.2-3.1-11.7-10.6-11.7c-7,0-10.6,4.2-10.6,11.7c0,0,0,228.1,0,228.2H0.2c0-0.5,0-228.8,0-228.8C0.1,16.8,14.8,1,44,1L44,1z%22/><style>path { fill: %23262626 } @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { path { fill: %23EEEFE9 } }</style></svg>",N,,2025-12-24 09:59:58.308970

But one thing is clear: The Patriots have a lengthy injury list heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.","FOXBORO, Mass. — Two days after clinching a playoff berth with a thrilling win Sunday night in Baltimore, coach Mike Vrabel gathered his New England Patriots for an earlier-than-usual session on Tuesday. Before he and his staff took to game-planning for next week, Vrabel wanted to highlight something for the whole team to see.

Vrabel showed the squad a few plays from the end of their win over the Ravens, when Mack Hollins and Kyle Williams were bouncing between three wide receiver positions because of injuries to other players. At one point, Vrabel said, most of the players didn’t realize they had a new right tackle (Thayer Munford), which meant a new jumbo tight end (Ben Brown), which jumbled personnel groupings and formations and caused Williams to change his alignment in the middle of one play.

“So, that’s how quickly things happen,” Vrabel said. “Give all the credit to the players — and the assistant coaches for having them ready and being able to help us win.”

His point held in the bigger picture, too. As the Patriots enter Week 17 with a banged-up roster — nine players suffered injuries Sunday night — there are probably going to be guys who are asked to do a little bit more. Maybe play out of position. Maybe just play more than usual.

Whatever the case, New England has a bunch of injuries heading into a two-game stretch where it’s looking to seal a division title. “Unfinished business” is how Vrabel described the mindset, even after clinching a spot in the postseason.

Fortunately for the Patriots, they’re headed to New York this weekend for the NFL’s favorite get-right game, a Sunday matchup against the Jets. Even with the injuries that have piled up, the Pats should be able to take care of business against a team with Brady Cook at quarterback that got blown out by the New Orleans Saints last weekend. New England is a 13.5-point road favorite, per Bet MGM, even despite the injuries.

Still, with the playoffs on the not-too-distant horizon, the lengthy injury report is worth noting.

There’s a chance the Patriots head into Sunday’s game with only four healthy wide receivers, without three of their usual starting offensive linemen, with only one running back who has played meaningful snaps this season and without two regular cornerbacks.

The bad news? The Pats began the week with three players in the concussion protocol: running back TreVeyon Henderson, wide receiver Kayshon Boutte and left guard Jared Wilson. Additionally, run-stuffing defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga suffered a foot injury Sunday that is expected to keep him out of the Jets game, NFL Network reported. Receiver DeMario Douglas suffered a hamstring injury that could keep him out Sunday, as did defensive lineman Joshua Farmer. Right tackle Morgan Moses suffered a knee injury, but he played through it in the second half when Munford, his backup, suffered a knee injury of his own. They could both be limited this weekend. And cornerback Carlton Davis left the game with an apparent injury, though his status for Sunday is unclear.

The good news? Reinforcements are on the way. The Patriots plan to open defensive tackle Milton Williams’ practice window so he can participate on Wednesday. The team’s highest-paid player is then eligible to be activated off injured reserve at any point over the ensuing 21 days, and playing Sunday against the Jets is a possibility. Plus, while less is known about Will Campbell’s status, the rookie left tackle has earned rave reviews from teammates for the way he has stayed engaged through a knee injury. He’s eligible to open his 21-day practice window next week, meaning he could return for Week 18.

Still, it sets up the Patriots for a tough decision. Should they use players who may not be 100 percent healthy in these final two regular-season games to increase their chances of winning the division and chasing the No. 1 seed? Or should they rest them for the postseason, even if it hurts their chances of earning a home game in the playoffs?

“I think that we’ll figure out where things are later in the week,” Vrabel said of the slew of injuries. “Everybody’s been getting treatment. We got back late (from Baltimore). So today will be a good opportunity just to see a little bit of activity, a walk-through. But (we want to) get guys up, moving around. …

“I tell everybody the same thing,” Vrabel continued. “Just be honest with how you’re feeling. Talk to the doctors. Talk to the trainer. We do an evaluation every day. We do a symptom score. So, I think those are the ones that you want to just try to focus on. The guys that have an ankle or … a knee, they’re going to be OK. Sometimes, any of these things that relate to concussions can react differently, and there’s no pre-described amount of time that they’re going to be out.”

Wednesday will be the team’s first full practice of the week. They’ll likely know more about who can play on Thursday morning after it’s clear how the injuries respond to practice.

**UPDATED AS OF TUESDAY, DECEMBER 23RD AT 5 PM ET**

🏈 AFC East

◆ Buffalo Bills

Josh Allen - QB (foot)

Head coach Sean McDermott labeled Allen day-to-day with a foot injury sustained in Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: Allen picked up the injury in the second quarter and did not miss an offensive snap, indicating he will be out there with no limitations come Sunday. He remains a locked-in QB1 after his worst fantasy outing since his rookie season.

Matt Prater - K (quad)

Prater will not play.

Fantasy Impact: The Bills signed kicker Michael Badgley to kick in Prater’s stead. He is barely on the K1 radar.

◆ Miami Dolphins

Tyreek Hill - WR (knee)

Hill suffered a dislocated knee in the team’s Week 4 win over the Jets. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Hill’s absence likely places additional emphasis on the short-to-intermediate areas of the field, increasing the expected target volume for De’Von Achane, Darren Waller, and Jaylen Waddle.

◆ New England Patriots

TreVeyon Henderson - RB (concussion)

Henderson departed in the second quarter of the team’s Week 16 win over the Ravens with a concussion.

Fantasy Impact: If trends from the league this season remain intact, we tentatively expect Henderson to miss Week 17. Rhamondre Stevenson could be in line for a massive workload against the Jets considering the team is still without Antonio Gibson and Terrell Jennings, demanding legitimate RB1 consideration in a plus matchup.

Kayshon Boutte - WR (concussion)

Boutte sustained a concussion in the team’s Week 16 win over the Ravens.

Fantasy Impact: An absence from Boutte could afford additional opportunities for Mack Hollins and rookie Kyle Williams, the latter of whom has routinely demonstrated big play ability. Neither should be trusted as anything more than a desperation FLEX for fantasy Championships.

Terrell Jennings - RB (concussion)

Jennings will miss the rest of the regular season on injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Jennings is no longer a threat to steal short-yardage carries.

◆ New York Jets

Mason Taylor - TE (neck)

Taylor has been ruled out for Week 16, missing his second consecutive game.

Fantasy Impact: Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell should operate as the clear-cut No. 1 pass catcher.

Tyrod Taylor - QB (groin)

Taylor departed the team’s Week 14 loss to the Dolphins with a groin injury and did not return. Taylor was sidelined on Wednesday and did not play in Week 15. He is competing with quarterback Justin Fields (knee) for the primary backup role.

Fantasy Impact: None.

Justin Fields - QB (knee)

Fields is rehabbing the knee injury while competing for the No. 2 job.

Fantasy Impact: See above.

Garrett Wilson - WR (knee)

Wilson sprained his knee in his return to the active roster in Week 10 and is set to miss “three-to-four weeks.” He was placed on injured reserve and is eligible to return in Week 15. Head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters Monday that he did not have an update on Wilson’s potential return from injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Whelp, Wilson’s return didn’t last long as he is now set to miss another chunk of time with an additional knee injury. The Jets again find themselves bereft of pass-catching talent. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor stands to benefit the most in a fantasy setting, although the Jets continue to be allergic to throwing the football. Head coach Aaron Glenn said last week that he expects Wilson to “return this season.”

Braelon Allen - RB (knee)

Allen suffered a “pretty serious” knee injury on a kickoff return in the second quarter of the team’s Week 4 loss to the Dolphins. He is out indefinitely.

Fantasy Impact: Allen has been a significant contributor in the red zone this season. His absence substantially boosts Breece Hall‘s upside, who is now a locked-in RB1 in Week 5 against the Cowboys. Backup running back Isaiah Davis can be stashed in 12-team leagues as a high-upside contingency option. Hall gained a season-high 155 yards from scrimmage on 18 opportunities in his first game without Allen in Week 5.

Josh Reynolds - WR (hip)

Reynolds was evidently placed on injured reserve in Week 10, after suffering a hip injury during practice in Week 8.

Fantasy Impact: Reynolds’ absence clears the way for new Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to be active on game day.

🏈 AFC North

◆ Baltimore Ravens

Lamar Jackson - QB (back)

Jackson has a “significant contusion” to his back.

Fantasy Impact: Jackson could not finish the team’s Week 16 loss to the Patriots. The Ravens need to win out and get a loss from the Steelers in Week 17 to make the post season, meaning it is likely Jackson plays through the ailment, if at all possible. Fantasy managers will want to monitor his game status on a short week after head coach John Harbaugh labeled him day-to-day. It would be Tyler Huntley under center against the Packers if Jackson can’t go.

Justice Hill - RB (neck)

Hill will not play in Week 13. Head coach John Harbaugh said Monday that Hill could return “in three to four weeks.”

Fantasy Impact: Running back Keaton Mitchell will continue operating as the clear-cut No. 2 in Baltimore.

◆ Cincinnati Bengals

Noah Fant - TE (ankle)

Fant missed Week 16 with an ankle injury.

Fantasy Impact: Fant’s absence could provide additional snaps to Mike Gesicki, although none of the remaining tight ends warrant fantasy consideration with both Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins on the field.

◆ Cleveland Browns

David Njoku - TE (knee)

Njoku aggravated his knee injury in Week 14. He was ruled out for Week 15 and remains sidelined in Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: We expect rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. to continue operating as the team’s No. 1 pass catcher. Start Fannin with confidence after a career game a week ago.

Dylan Sampson - RB (calf)

Sampson was sidelined by the calf injury in Week 15. He has not yet resumed practicing and will miss Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: Fellow rookie RB Quinshon Judkins earned four targets with Sampson out last week, tying his career-high. Judkins totaled minus-four yards on three receptions, though. He is an inefficient receiver.

Quinshon Judkins - RB (ankle, leg)

Judkins suffered a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle in Week 16, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: The Cleveland backfield has been decimated by injury this season, leaving only Trayveon Williams and Raheim Sanders as healthy backs currently on the roster. Neither figures to provide any fantasy utility as the Browns limp their way towards the offseason.

Jerome Ford - RB (shoulder)

The Browns signed running back Trayveon Williams after placing Ford on injured reserve this week.

Fantasy Impact: Williams is unlikely to contribute on game day, now occupying the No. 3 role. We expect No. 2 running back Dylan Sampson (calf/hand) to continue playing through injury.

◆ Pittsburgh Steelers

The Steelers did not experience any fantasy-relevant injuries in their Week 16 win over the Lions, although wide receiver DK Metcalf was suspended for two games following an interaction with a fan.

🏈 AFC South

◆ Houston Texans

Joe Mixon - RB (foot)

Mixon was placed on the Non-Football Injury list ahead of Week 1. He is not expected to play this year.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Nick Chubb is now in a game script-dependent rushing role, while rookie running back Woody Marks operates as the starter.

◆ Indianapolis Colts

Daniel Jones - QB (Achilles)

Jones played through a fracture in his fibula for two-plus games before suffering a torn Achilles in Week 14. His season is done.

Fantasy Impact: The injury comes at the worst possible time for the sliding Colts, who have dropped from the two-seed to the fringes of playoff contention in three short weeks. Making matters worse, Riley Leonard suffered a knee injury in relief duties against the Jaguars. The Colts signed potential Hall of Fame candidate Philip Rivers, who is set to draw another start in Week 16.

Anthony Richardson - QB (eye)

Richardson suffered a “freak accident” ahead of Week 6 in which an elastic band snapped a piece of metal hit him in the eye, fracturing his orbital bone. He was placed on injured reserve. He was medically cleared to resume practicing on Monday, but he is not a candidate to start and has not yet been activated.

Fantasy Impact: Richardson was medically cleared to practice Monday but the team already named veteran Philip Rivers the starter for Week 16.

◆ Jacksonville Jaguars

Bhayshul Tuten - RB (finger)

Tuten underwent successful surgery on his finger Monday and will miss the remainder of the season.

Fantasy Impact: Tuten’s injury leaves Travis Etienne alone in the backfield, although the team signed journeyman DeeJay Dallas on Tuesday. Etienne carries clear league-winning upside in a likely robust role for the remainder of the season. Rookie running back LeQuint Allen can be stashed.

Travis Hunter - WR/CB (knee)

Hunter was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending LCL tear.

Fantasy Impact: See Thomas’ section above.

◆ Tennessee Titans

Calvin Ridley - WR (hamstring)

Ridley reportedly broke his fibula in Week 11 and is out for the season.

Fantasy Impact: It’s a disappointing end to a disappointing season for the veteran receiver. The Titans are left with no standout fantasy options in his absence.

🏈 AFC West

◆ Denver Broncos

Pat Bryant - WR (concussion)

Bryant sustained a concussion that required hospitalization in Week 16 and is expected to be sidelined through Week 17. He was discharged from the hospital Sunday.

Fantasy Impact: Bryant’s vacated snaps should fall on Lil’Jordan Humphrey, although it is likely to result in an increased emphasis on Courtland Sutton and Troy Franklin through the air.

J.K. Dobbins - RB (foot)

Dobbins was ruled out on Friday before being placed on IR on Saturday. The injury requires surgery, likely ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie RJ Harvey is in line to see a noticeable increase to what has been a modest snap rate, although Tyler Badie remained frustratingly involved. Jaleel McLaughlin also saw increased opportunities on early downs.

◆ Kansas City Chiefs

Rashee Rice - WR (concussion)

Rice “reported concussion symptoms on Monday and entered the league’s protocol,” jeopardizing his availability against the Titans. He did not practice on Wednesday and was ruled out for Week 16 Friday. He remained sidelined through Tuesday on a short week.

Fantasy Impact: Chiefs wide receiver Tyquan Thornton is also in the NFL’s concussion protocol. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce could handle a sizable workload in Week 17.

Patrick Mahomes - QB (knee)

Mahomes suffered a season-ending ACL tear with an associated LCL tear in the Chiefs’ Week 15 loss to the Chargers. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Mahomes underwent successful surgery Monday to repair both ligaments, thusly starting an estimated nine-month recovery timetable. Gardner Minshew will start for the Chiefs for the remainder of the season after the team was eliminated from postseason contention in Week 15.

◆ Las Vegas Raiders

The Raiders did not experience any significant injuries in their Week 16 loss to the Texans.

◆ Los Angeles Chargers

Kimani Vidal - RB (neck)

Vidal suffered a neck injury in the team’s Week 16 win over the Cowboys.

Fantasy Impact: NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that Vidal avoided a serious injury but is expected to miss time, likely leaving Omarion Hampton and Hassan Haskins to handle the bulk of the work against the Texans. Hampton can be treated as a boom-bust RB2 in a difficult matchup.

Najee Harris - RB (Achilles)

Harris ruptured the Achilles tendon in his left leg during the Chargers’ Week 3 win over the Broncos. His season is done.

Fantasy Impact: Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal are likely to continue splitting backfield work until the former can work his way back into game shape.

🏈 NFC East

◆ Dallas Cowboys

Javonte Williams - RB (neck)

Williams injured his neck early in the Cowboys’ Week 16 game against the Vikings. Although he missed snaps, including opportunities in the red zone, he did manage to play through it. He was limited on Monday.

Fantasy Impact: Williams is a low-end RB1 against the Commanders.

Ryan Flournoy - WR (knee)

Flournoy was unable to finish the team’s Week 16 loss to the Chargers due to a knee injury. He was listed as limited Monday.

Fantasy Impact: Flournoy’s limited listing is a good sign for his potential availability against the Commanders on a short week, although fantasy managers will want to track his status this week closely.

Miles Sanders - RB (ankle/knee)

Sanders was injured in Week 4 and did not play in Week 5. He was ruled out for Week 6 before being placed on injured reserve, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Javonte Williams continues to operate in a near workhorse role.

◆ New York Giants

Malik Nabers - WR (knee)

Nabers suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 4 win over the Chargers and will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.

Fantasy Impact: The injury could not have come at a worse time for the Giants after they moved to rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart under center. Nabers’ absence will make it difficult to consistently move the football, lowering the upside of all remaining healthy players. Nabers makes for a solid trade target for dynasty managers looking to rebuild this season.

Cam Skattebo - RB (ankle)

Skattebo suffered a gruesome dislocated ankle in the team’s Week 8 loss to the Eagles, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: The backfield in New York should revert to a timeshare headed by veteran Tyrone Tracy in Skattebo’s absence. Devin Singletary remains on hand for change-of-pace duties. Treat Tracy as a low-end RB2 for the remainder of the season.

◆ Philadelphia Eagles

The Eagles emerged from their Week 16 win over the Commanders with a clean bill of health.

◆ Washington Commanders

Marcus Mariota - QB (hand, quad)

Mariota was unable to finish the team’s Week 16 loss to the Eagles with multiple injuries.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Dan Quinn would not rule the veteran backup out for Christmas Day, although he appears to be a true game-time decision. It could be veteran journeyman Josh Johnson against the Cowboys.

Jaylin Lane - WR (ankle)

The team placed Lane on injured reserve, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Minimal. Lane had yet to carve out a significant role on offense.

Jayden Daniels - QB (elbow)

Daniels dislocated the elbow in his left, non-throwing arm in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Seahawks. He was ruled out for the remainder of the season Monday.

Fantasy Impact: Backup quarterback Marcus Mariota will start for the Commanders in the final three weeks of the regular season. He is a borderline QB1/2.

Noah Brown - WR (ribs)

The team placed Brown on injured reserve on Monday, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: None. Brown has not been fantasy-relevant all season.

Zach Ertz - TE (knee)

Ertz suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 14 loss to the Vikings. His season is done.

Fantasy Impact: The hits keep on coming for the Commanders in a lost season. John Bates should step into a significant role for the Commanders down the stretch but likely does not carry enough upside for weekly fantasy consideration.

🏈 NFC North

◆ Chicago Bears

Rome Odunze - WR (foot)

Odunze returned to practice on Wednesday and missing all of Week 14. He was removed from the injury report for Week 15 before missing the game after aggravating the injury in pre-game warmups. He has not yet resumed practicing and was ruled out for Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Ben Johnson told reporters Monday that “all options are on the table” regarding Odunze’s status moving forward. That does not inspire confidence that he will be available in the coming weeks.

Luther Burden - WR (ankle)

Burden injured his ankle in Week 15 and has been unable to practice since. He was ruled out for Week 16 Thursday.

Fantasy Impact: Bears tight end Colston Loveland, and wide receivers DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus should receive notable target share bumps if Odunze and Burden are both sidelined. Tight end Cole Kmet (knee/ankle) was also limited on Wednesday.

◆ Detroit Lions

Amon-Ra St. Brown - WR (knee)

St. Brown was listed as ‘DNP’ Monday but avoided a serious injury.

Fantasy Impact: Likely none. Head coach Dan Campbell said Tuesday that St. Brown has “a little irritation.” We expect him to be good to go as the Lions fight to remain in the playoff race in the NFC.

Brock Wright - TE (neck)

Wright landed hard on his neck in Week 12. He has been placed on injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Backup tight ends Shane Zylstra (knee) and Ross Dwelley form a fantasy-unfriendly duo, who should only be considered in DFS lineups.

Sam LaPorta - TE (back)

LaPorta was added to the Lions’ injury report with a back injury on Wednesday. After being ruled out for Week 11 on Friday, the Lions placed him on injured reserve on Saturday.

Fantasy Impact: The Lions’ pass-catching corps is deep. Removing LaPorta from it could result in one or more extra targets for WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR Jameson Williams and RB Jahmyr Gibbs.

◆ Green Bay Packers

Jordan Love - QB (concussion)

Love is in the league’s concussion protocol after being removed from Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: Love was listed as limited on Tuesday, which is the same designation backup Malik Willis (shoulder) drew. It’ll be a “wait and see” approach for the quarterback situation in Green Bay as the Packers fight to remain in the playoff picture in the NFC.

Josh Jacobs - RB (knee/ankle)

Jacobs reportedly aggravated his knee injury in the team’s Week 15 loss to the Broncos. His knee also reportedly “stiffened” up in Week 14 against the Bears. Aggravations in consecutive games are concerning. He missed Week 16’s first two practices and drew a questionable tag for Saturday’s game against the Bears.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters Monday that Jacobs “would not have practiced” had the team held a regular session. He should continue to see his practice reps managed and could be in line to miss Week 16 against the Bears. No. 2 running back Emanuel Wilson must be rostered.

Tucker Kraft - TE (knee)

Kraft suffered a season-ending torn ACL in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Panthers.

Fantasy Impact: Kraft’s breakout season comes to an end prematurely after the untimely knee injury. Luke Musgrave should be rostered in all formats as he likely enters a featured role for the Packers.

◆ Minnesota Vikings

Aaron Jones - RB (ankle)

Jones continues to play through multiple ailments, although he was listed as a ‘DNP’ on Monday’s estimated practice report.

Fantasy Impact: The Vikings continue to deal with multiple injuries to their backfield. Fantasy managers will want to track his status on a short week closely considering Jordan Mason appears unlikely to play in Week 17.

Jordan Mason - RB (ankle)

Mason is considered a “long shot” to play in Week 17.

Fantasy Impact: The team activated Ty Chandler from injured reserve Tuesday. He could immediately step into meaningful snaps with Aaron Jones also tending to multiple injuries.

Carson Wentz - QB (shoulder)

Wentz will undergo season-ending surgery after playing through a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum.

Fantasy Impact: Second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy is the starter in Minnesota moving forward.

🏈 NFC South

◆ Atlanta Falcons

Michael Penix - QB (knee)

Penix reportedly suffered a knee injury that included a partially torn ACL, a separate sprain and a bone bruise in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Panthers. He will undergo season-ending ACL reconstruction.

Fantasy Impact: That leaves the team in the hands of veteran Kirk Cousins moving forward. Cousins notably completed 21-of-31 passes for only 173 yards with no touchdowns in his only other start this season, which came against an underperforming Dolphins team. The Falcons could be in some trouble the rest of the way.

◆ Carolina Panthers

The Panthers escaped their Week 16 win over the Buccaneers absent any fantasy-relevant injuries.

◆ New Orleans Saints

Devin Neal - RB (hamstring)

Neal departed the team’s Week 15 win over the Panthers with a hamstring injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled him out for Week 16 against the Jets.

Fantasy Impact: The Saints promoted running back Evan Hull to the active roster in November. Running back Audric Estime was promoted to the active roster for last week’s game. Neither player ran efficiently, but Estime was surprisingly used effectively via screen passes and checkdowns. Estime could be the starter this week.

Devaughn Vele - WR (shoulder)

Vele could not finish the team’s Week 15 win over the Panthers due to a shoulder injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled Vele out for Week 16 against the Jets.

Fantasy Impact: Mason Tipton would be next in line for snaps at wide receiver alongside Chris Olave, should Vele be unable to go in Week 16. Olave became quarterback Tyler Shough‘s go-to receiver after Vele left early in Week 15.

Alvin Kamara - RB (ankle/knee)

Kamara remains sidelined by his ankle injury and PCL sprain. He has neither practiced nor played since Week 12 and was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He remains sidelined to begin Week 16 and was ruled out Friday.

Fantasy Impact: See above.

Kendre Miller - RB (ACL)

Miller suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 7 loss to the Bears. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie Devin Neal should step into the primary change-of-pace role for the Saints in Miller’s absence. Lead back Alvin Kamara saw the highest snap rate since Week 2 following Miller’s departure and could be again looking at a workhorse role moving forward.

◆ Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The Buccaneers are now back to full strength following a Week 16 loss to the Panthers.

🏈 NFC West

◆ Arizona Cardinals

Zonovan Knight - RB (ankle)

The Cardinals placed Knight on injured reserve Monday, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Michael Carter and Emari Demercado should split work in the backfield for the rest of the season.

Greg Dortch - WR (chest)

The Cardinals placed Dortch on injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Wide receiver Michael Wilson will continue earning targets voluminously.

Trey Benson - RB (knee)

Benson underwent surgery after injuring his meniscus in Week 4. The Cardinals opened his 21-day practice window in Week 12, but they ultimately decided not to activate him from injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Running back Bam Knight is seemingly the best bet to operate as the Cardinals’ rest-of-season starter.

Kyler Murray - QB (foot)

Murray injured his foot on a fourth-quarter fumble in Week 5. He was placed on injured reserve in Week 10 and will be eligible to return in Week 14 against the Rams, though it could be as the Cardinals’ backup. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Monday that the team will not open his 21-day practice window this week.

Fantasy Impact: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has finished as a QB1 in his last three games. He remains a viable streamer.

James Conner - RB (ankle)

Conner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3.

Fantasy Impact: See: Trey Benson.

Zay Jones - WR (Achilles)

Jones suffered a torn Achilles in the team’s Week 10 loss to the Seahawks, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Jones filled a situational role for the Cardinals but his absence could provide additional run for veteran slot man Greg Dortch.

◆ Los Angeles Rams

Davante Adams - WR (hamstring)

Adams played through the hamstring strain without suffering a reported re-injury in Week 14. He aggravated the injury in the team’s Week 15 win and was unable to finish the game.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Sean McVay told reporters Monday that Adams would “most likely not play” in Week 17 against the Falcons. Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua referred to wide receiver Konata Mumphield as Adams’ ”apprentice.” Mumphield could warrant boom-bust FLEX consideration, though he has no fantasy floor.

Tyler Higbee - TE (ankle)

Higbee was placed on injured reserve after suffering an ankle injury in the team’s Week 11 win over the Seahawks.

Fantasy Impact: Higbee’s absence for much of the game against the Seahawks simply allowed rookie Terrance Ferguson to step into additional snaps as opposed to forcing the team to move away from their league-leading 13-personnel rates. Colby Parkinson should be viewed as the team’s starter. Davis Allen is capable as well. The Panthers struggle to cover opposing tight ends.

◆ San Francisco 49ers

Ricky Pearsall - WR (ankle, knee)

Pearsall injured both his knee and ankle in the team’s Week 15 win. He did not practice at all this week and appears headed for an absence on Monday Night Football.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters on Monday that “there is concern” about Pearsall’s injuries. Missed time could force Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson into increased run.

Brandon Aiyuk - WR (knee)

Head coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open Aiyuk’s 21-day practice window ahead of a Week 11 meeting with the Cardinals. The same was said for Week 12, and now Week 13. Reports then surfaced that Aiyuk and the 49ers are “headed for divorce” after the team voided his 2025 guarantees.

Fantasy Impact: A mostly lost season for Aiyuk appears to be quickly approaching, at least as far as fantasy is concerned.

◆ Seattle Seahawks

Elijah Arroyo - TE (knee)

Arroyo is “out right now” with a knee injury.

Fantasy Impact: The injury allows tight end AJ Barner to assume a full-time role.

Tory Horton - WR (groin, shin)

Horton was added to the injury report Thursday with multiple ailments and did not play in Week 10 against the Cardinals. He was ruled out for Week 11 on Friday and remains sidelined early in Week 12. He was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40a2593/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4299x2418+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff2%2Fc0%2Fad11014f47c9805129f18eebe16e%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D27865152,N,,2025-12-24 01:59:04.899030

On Tuesday, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel stated that star defensive tackle Milton Williams will have his 21-day practice window opened, via team reporter Evan Lazar.

Williams suffered a high ankle sprain in the Week 11 game against the New York Jets and was placed on Injured Reserve after that. He has missed the past four games, and this week was the first week he was eligible to come off IR.

Williams was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 2021 NFL Draft and played the first four seasons with the Eagles.

After winning the Super Bowl, Williams left the Eagles and then landed a four-year, $104 million deal with the Patriots in the 2025 offseason.

Williams got off to a strong start, totaling 14 solo tackles with 3.5 sacks in 11 games before suffering the injury.

The Patriots are hopeful Williams can return before the regular season ends, and the standout DT said he just has to see how the injury feels, according to Mike Reiss of ESPN.

“I’m feeling good. Just have to see how it responds. If all goes well, it will be a good thing for the Patriots,” Williams said on Tuesday.

The Patriots face the New York Jets on the road in Week 17 before finishing the regular season against the Miami Dolphins in Foxborough, and having Williams back would be a huge boost to the defense as New England tries to secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC.",https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Vrabel-1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-24 00:58:52.428314

The 49ers, who already have clinched a spot in the NFC playoffs with an 11-4 record, had four offensive stars and two special-teams players selected to the Pro Bowl.

Running back Christian McCaffrey, fullback Kyle Juszczyk, tight end George Kittle and left tackle Trent Williams join special-teamers Luke Gifford and Jon Weeks as Pro Bowl members of the 49ers.

In addition, 49ers return specialist Skyy Moore was named as a Pro Bowl alternate.

Gifford and Weeks signed with the 49ers as free agents this season as key pieces of the team’s overhaul in the kicking game under first-year special teams coordinator Brant Boyer. Gifford has registered 19 special-teams tackles, which is tied for fourth-most in the NFL. He was selected to his first Pro Bowl. Weeks, a 15-year NFL veteran, is the team’s long-snapper. He earned his second career trip to the Pro Bowl.

McCaffrey went over the 1,000-yard mark in rushing in the 49ers’ 48-27 victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Monday night. He earns his fourth Pro Bowl invitation and his third as a member of the 49ers. McCaffrey also has 92 receptions for 849 yards.

Juszczyk earned his 10th consecutive trip to the Pro Bowl and his ninth straight as a member of the 49ers. Jerry Rice (12) and Leo Nomellini (10) are the only players in 49ers history with more Pro Bowls, as Juszczyk pulled into a tie with Ronnie Lott, who was selected to nine Pro Bowls with the 49ers.

Williams was selected to his 12th career Pro Bowl and his fifth as a member of the 49ers since arriving in the 2020 offseason in a trade from Washington. Williams becomes the fourth offensive lineman in league history with 12 or more Pro Bowls, joining Bruce Matthews (14), Randall McDaniel (12) and Will Shields (12).

""He's in the protocol, and he'll practice per the protocol,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Tuesday.
When asked how he finished the game, Willis said: ""The adrenaline's pumping and, you know, we got to get in.
LaFleur and the offensive coaches also have to continue to monitor running back Josh Jacobs' knee injury.
Green Bay could still win the NFC North if it wins its final two games and the Bears (11-4) lose both.","GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Jordan Love took the first steps toward returning from the concussion he sustained in Saturday's loss to the Chicago Bears when he participated in meetings and a walk-through session while Malik Willis downplayed the severity of his shoulder injury.

It made things look a little less dire for the Green Bay Packers quarterbacks Tuesday.

Love remained in the concussion protocol after getting taken out in the first half of Saturday's loss to the Chicago Bears following a helmet hit from defensive end Austin Booker. But he was able to take part in most of what the Packers did during the first day of preparation for Saturday's game against the Baltimore Ravens.

""He's in the protocol, and he'll practice per the protocol,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Tuesday. ""So, he'll be limited.""

Because it was not a full practice, participation levels were estimated. The Packers are expected to hold a standard in-season practice Wednesday.

Love could not speak to reporters because NFL rules prohibit players in the protocol from speaking to the media, but he was seen walking through the locker room Tuesday and chatting with teammates as usual.

""He's good,"" backup quarterback Willis said. ""He's chillin'.""

Willis also was a limited participant Tuesday after he sustained a right shoulder injury on the final play of regulation against the Bears, when Montez Sweat sacked him and landed on top of him. Willis finished the game in overtime. He did not appear to have any trouble throwing in overtime, but he fumbled a snap and turned the ball over to the Bears to set up their game-winning drive. The Packers did not have a third quarterback available against Chicago.

When asked how he finished the game, Willis said: ""The adrenaline's pumping and, you know, we got to get in. We don't have anybody else, so we've got to keep going. It was fun.""

Willis said he would ""assume that I'm going to be ready"" Saturday regardless of whether that's as a starter or backup.

""We've got to see how they progress throughout the course of the week,"" LaFleur said. ""So, by no means are they in the clear.""

LaFleur and the offensive coaches also have to continue to monitor running back Josh Jacobs' knee injury. Jacobs played against the Bears despite being questionable going into the game. He played 28 snaps on offense but lost a fumble in the second half. He also was on the field for the botched onside kick recovery attempt late in the fourth quarter.

Jacobs' left knee has been an issue for more than a month. He missed one game but has played in the past four straight games. With only two games to go and a playoff spot hanging in the balance, the Packers would have to think long and hard about giving Jacobs a week off just to rest even if he felt like he could play.

""I wish we were in a better position to do that,"" LaFleur said. ""If we feel like it's, you know, this is where the collaboration comes in. I think, with myself, with him and our athletic trainers, in terms of what's best for the short term, as well as trying to weigh in the long term.""

In all, the Packers listed 20 players on their injury report Tuesday.

How long is TreVeyon Henderson out?
Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said today that Henderson has entered concussion protocol following his head injury against Baltimore.
TreVeyon Henderson injury update Henderson suffered a concussion in the second quarter of Sunday night's game during a first-down rush.","The New England Patriots are back at the top of the AFC standings in 2025. A win in prime time over the Baltimore Ravens in Week 16 cements their status as a No. 1 seed contender in the playoffs.

With two weeks to go, it's down to the Patriots, Denver Broncos and Jacksonville Jaguars over who will earn the top seed in the AFC – a sentence few would've expected to read in September.

That's thanks to a resurgent team led on offense by MVP contender Drake Maye at quarterback. In year two with Maye under center, the Patriots' offense is a top-10 scoring unit after finishing 30th in points a year ago.

A lot of that can be attributed to Maye's growth in his first year under a new coaching staff. But some of the Patriots' offseason additions have played a role as well, including rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson.

The Patriots' second-round pick out of Ohio State has been a dynamic threat out of the backfield in his first season. He leads the team in yards from scrimmage and total touchdowns through Week 16.

Unfortunately, he left New England's game against Baltimore on ""Sunday Night Football"" with a concussion. Here's how long he'll be out.

How long is TreVeyon Henderson out?

Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said today that Henderson has entered concussion protocol following his head injury against Baltimore.

The timeline for return once players enter the protocol often differs on a player-by-player basis. More often than not, players miss at least one week but it's not unheard of for a quick turnaround.

Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb suffered a concussion in Week 14 and was back in action a week later for the Cowboys' game against the Vikings. It all depends on how quickly a player can pass through the five-step return-to-participation protocol.

TreVeyon Henderson injury update

Henderson suffered a concussion in the second quarter of Sunday night's game during a first-down rush. Ravens safety Alohi Gilman made the tackle on the play and Henderson fell backward and slammed his head on the turf.

Henderson initially tried to return to the huddle but went to the ground and the Patriots' medical staff came onto the field. He was able to walk off the field under his own power and was evaluated.

New England initially said he was ""questionable"" to return to the game but ruled him out for the rest of the contest after halftime. He had three yards on five carries before leaving the game.

Rhamondre Stevenson led the way with Henderson out and finished the game with eight carries for 51 yards and a touchdown.

Patriots QB depth chart

Henderson has taken on a larger role in the offense over the course of the season. New England does have experienced players at the position to help in the case of Henderson's absence, though. Here's a look at the depth chart:

TreVeyon Henderson (injured - concussion)

Rhamondre Stevenson

D'Ernest Johnson

Jashaun Corbin (injured reserve - designated for return)

Deneric Prince (injured reserve)

Antonio Gibson (injured reserve)

Terrell Jennings (injured resere)

Lan Larison (injured reserve)

Stevenson led the team in rushing in 2022 and 2024 and has the experience to lead the ground attack if needed. Johnson would be the only other healthy running back on the active roster unless Corbin is cleared in time.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/23/USAT/87898492007-usatsi-27869139.jpg?crop=4466,2512,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-23 23:00:22.972911

Fields started for the Jets for the majority of the season before ceding his job to Tyrod Taylor.
While Fields was inactive for the last three games, he was designated last week as the Jets' emergency quarterback.
The IR designation closes the book on Fields' season and leaves him with a 2-7 record as the Jets' starter.
Will Justin Fields return to the Jets in 2026?","The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on injured reserve Tuesday, ending his 2025 season and potentially his tenure with the franchise. Fields missed the last three games with a knee injury that coach Aaron Glenn said did not heal in a timely enough fashion for the signal-caller to return to the field this year.

Fields started for the Jets for the majority of the season before ceding his job to Tyrod Taylor. The latter has been dealing with a pair of injuries of his own, which opened the door for Brady Cook to make back-to-back starts the last two weeks. Cook, an undrafted rookie, projects to remain in the lineup for Sunday's divisional game against the New England Patriots.

While Fields was inactive for the last three games, he was designated last week as the Jets' emergency quarterback.

""We're gonna put Justin on IR,"" Glenn said. ""We tried to see how we can get this to work, but it wasn't getting as better as we would like it. We want to make sure we get a focus on that to make sure we get him better.""

Fields said last week that he underwent an MRI on the injured knee and that the imaging revealed an issue that would keep him out on a ""week-to-week"" basis. The injury occurred in practice ahead of the Dec. 7 loss to the Miami Dolphins.

The IR designation closes the book on Fields' season and leaves him with a 2-7 record as the Jets' starter. It was an up-and-down year for the former first-round pick wherein the lows were tremendously low and the high points were few and far between. Fields threw for fewer than 55 yards in four of his nine starts and in Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills completed just three of his 11 pass attempts in one of the worst games by an NFL quarterback this season.

Although he threw just one interception on the year, Fields was highly inefficient in completing 62.7% of his passes for 1,259 yards. He did make an impact as a ballcarrier, though, rushing for 383 yards and four touchdowns.

Will Justin Fields return to the Jets in 2026?

Fields signed with the Jets last spring on a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million guaranteed. While he remains under contract through 2026, it became clear this season that he is unlikely to be part of the team's long-term plans, and both sides could likely benefit from parting ways at the end of the year.

Adding to the likelihood that Fields and the Jets break up before the 2026 season is the fact that New York will receive an early-first round draft pick and could use it on a quarterback.

“I mean, still sore,” Allen said.","On Sunday against the Browns, Bills quarterback Josh Allen retreated toward his own end zone before falling down near the goal line. Along the way, the 2024 MVP “tweaked” his foot (as he said after the game).

Allen’s added at the time that the foot “just flamed up” on him but the “pain subsided,” so he finished the game. His response as to whether the foot affected him in the second half (“no, I don’t think so”) was not particularly convincing.

As a Week 17 game against the Eagles approaches, there’s a question regarding whether the foot will be a factor. On Tuesday, coach Sean McDermott said Allen might miss practice time due to the “obviously sore” foot.

Allen separately provided a more positive assessment.

“Feels good,” Allen said, via Alaina Getzenberg of ESPN.com. “Feels good. Ready to go.”

Per Getzenberg, Allen walked with a limp after the midweek press conference.

More will be revealed regarding Allen’s status on Wednesday, when the Bills release their first injury report for the week.

“I mean, still sore,” Allen said. “Walk-through today, so really not practice in general. So yeah . . . feeling good.”

As part of a series of movies, the Patriots signed RB Elijah Mitchell to their practice squad. Mitchell's arrival comes after rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson went down with a head injury in Sunday's win over the Baltimore Ravens. Earlier on Tuesday, Pats head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed Henderson is in concussion protocol.

Mitchell, 27, spent his first three NFL seasons (2021-23) with the 49ers. He totaled 1,523 rushing yards and nine touchdowns on 327 carries over 27 games in San Francisco.

In 2024, Mitchell was placed on season-ending injured reserve due to a hamstring injury. He signed a one-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs before the 2025 season and played in only one game before being released on Dec. 20.

There's a good chance the Jets will part ways with Fields in the offseason.
Fields is due to count $23 million on the 2026 cap, including $20 million in salary ($10 million guaranteed).
Fields, 26, missed Week 3 with a concussion but returned to start the next seven games.","FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Justin Fields' first season with the New York Jets -- and, quite possibly, his last -- is officially over.

The former starting quarterback was placed on injured reserve Tuesday, an ignominious cap to a disappointing season.

Fields, who was benched Nov. 17, has been bothered in recent weeks by what the team called knee ""soreness."" He returned to practice last week but told reporters that he still wasn't healthy enough to play. He was inactive for the past three games.

""Man, we tried to see how we can get this to work, but it wasn't getting as better as we would like it,"" coach Aaron Glenn said. ""So, we want to make sure we get a focus on that to make sure we get him better.""

In all likelihood, Fields wouldn't have played anyway.

He reported soreness two weeks after his benching and hasn't played since. He was replaced by Tyrod Taylor, who got hurt in his third start. That led the Jets (3-12) to undrafted rookie Brady Cook, who will make his third start Sunday against the New England Patriots at MetLife Stadium.

There's a good chance the Jets will part ways with Fields in the offseason.

The former Chicago Bears first-round pick signed a two-year, $40 million contract in free agency and was named the starter in the offseason, but he fell short of modest expectations.

Fields went 2-7 as the starter, ranking 28th out of 32 qualified passers in Total QBR (37.3) -- below his career mark (45.3). He passed for only 505 yards in his past five starts, prompting Glenn to bench him.

Glenn declined to comment on whether Fields will need surgery. He also wouldn't address Fields' future, saying he's focused on New England.

""Any player that doesn't have the season that we would like for them to have, it's always disappointing,"" Glenn said. ""I don't want to just focus on Justin with this -- and I know that's the question asked -- but any player that we have high hopes for and the season don't go the way we want to go, we're always disappointed with that.""

Fields is due to count $23 million on the 2026 cap, including $20 million in salary ($10 million guaranteed). There would be $22 million in dead money if the Jets cut him, which can be spread over two years if he's designated as a post-June 1 cut.

The Jets might opt for a complete reset at quarterback, which could mean adding a veteran and a rookie.

Fields raised eyebrows Nov. 26 with a response to a question about whether he would be open to a small package of plays as a Wildcat quarterback -- a way to capitalize on his speed. Fields said there had been discussions about using him in that role, but he told reporters that he had ""mixed feelings"" about it.

He said he wanted to be a team player but expressed concern about the potential for injury, saying he would be prone to soft tissue injuries from going into a game cold. He noted that he was ""still not necessarily as healthy as I want to be right now."" He was listed with a knee injury for one week in October; it didn't cost him any practice time.

Fields, 26, missed Week 3 with a concussion but returned to start the next seven games. Glenn was prepared to bench him in Week 8 -- the same week owner Woody Johnson was publicly critical of Fields -- but the coach stayed with him because Taylor was out with a knee injury that flared up late in the week.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1223%2Fr1593178_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 20:01:46.630246

Glenn, asked if Fields would need surgery on the knee, said: ""I'm going to let the docs hone in on that.
There were high hopes among the Jets and Fields that he would continue his steady progress as an NFL starting QB.
However, Fields' and the Jets' passing offense was up and down.
For the season, Fields' passing line reads 128-of-204 (62.7% accuracy), 1,259 yards, 7 touchdown passes and 1 INT.","Jets head coach Aaron Glenn said the decision to place quarterback Justin Fields on Injured Reserve on Tuesday was due his slow rebound from an early December midweek knee injury.

""We're going to put Justin on IR,"" Glenn told reporters at a late afternoon news conference. ""It wasn't getting better, as we would like it. We want to make sure we get a focus on that, make sure we get him better.""

Fields injured his knee during the practice week before the Jets played host to Miami on Dec. 8 and had been deactivated for the games against the Dolphins, Jaguars and Saints. He was listed as the Jets' emergency third QB for New Orleans but did not play.

Glenn, asked if Fields would need surgery on the knee, said: ""I'm going to let the docs hone in on that. If he does, this would be a great time to get it done so we can get it knocked out and he can get healthy. I don't want to place that on him. I just know we want to make sure he can get this thing healthy.""

The coach declined to respond to a question about anticipating Fields returning to the Green & White next season. ""We'll see how that goes,"" he said. ""We're focused on New England right now.""

Fields came to the Jets as an unrestricted free agent in March after three seasons as the Bears' 11th overall selection in the 2021 draft and last year with the Steelers. There were high hopes among the Jets and Fields that he would continue his steady progress as an NFL starting QB.

He took the offense's reins from his arrival and started nine of the Jets' first 10 games, missing only the Week 3 game at Tampa Bay while he was in the NFL's concussion protocol. Some elements of Fields' game went well. He threw no interceptions in his first seven games and one for the season. His scrambling and running ability were as advertised as he logged 383 yards and four touchdowns on 71 carries for a 5.4 yards/carry average.

However, Fields' and the Jets' passing offense was up and down. He recorded passing games of 218, 226, 283 and 244 yards but only the 244-yard game came in a victory, the 39-38 comeback win at Cincinnati. But he managed a 45-yard passing game against Denver and 54 yards in the 27-20 home win over the Browns. Injuries cut short his starts in Week 2 vs. Buffalo and Week 7 vs. Carolina and Glenn opted to start Tyrod Taylor at Baltimore and in the win over Atlanta in the two games before Fields' practice knee injury.

For the season, Fields' passing line reads 128-of-204 (62.7% accuracy), 1,259 yards, 7 touchdown passes and 1 INT. He was sacked 27 times. His starting record was 2-7.

""This is for any player that doesn't have the season we would like for them to have. It's always disappointing,"" Glenn said. ""I don't want to focus on Justin with this. Any player that we have high hopes for and the season doesn't go the way we wanted to go, we're always disappointed in that.""

Rookie free agent Brady Cook has been announced to make his third consecutive start in the Jets' final MetLife Stadium appearance against the Patriots on Sunday. Taylor battled through groin and knee injuries that kept him sidelined the past two games. He was the Jets' backup quarterback if needed against the Saints but didn't play. Hendon Hooker, the third-round pick of Detroit in the 2023 draft, was signed to the Jets' practice squad last weel.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/qywhdcuaew4wy3jcxxxa,N,,2025-12-23 20:02:21.922276

Max Brosmer will make his second career start on Thursday in place of McCarthy. His first NFL start came in Week 13, where the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0. Brosmer threw for 126 yards and four interceptions in that matchup.

Despite the late-season injury, the Vikings are not placing McCarthy on injured reserve. He missed the second half of Sunday's 16-13 victory against the New York Giants with the hand injury, and completed 9 of 14 passes for 108 yards and one interception.

It's another unfortunate development for McCarthy, who has already missed 23 of 32 career games due to various injuries.

Is J.J. McCarthy, who flashed at times but was largely inconsistent and occasionally awful, the team's starting quarterback in 2026?
After the second-year pro hurt his hand in Sunday's win over the Giants, there's no point in him playing again in 2025.
The problem is that J.J. McCarthy is out.","The Vikings (7-8) added another win to their December total by defeating the New York Giants 16-13 on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. Minnesota moved to 3-0 in December games this season, with all three victories coming against NFC East opponents (31-0 vs. Washington in Week 14 and 34-26 at Dallas on Sunday Night Football and the victory last week).

Tack on the 5-0 record the Vikings earned in December a year ago, and Minnesota is 8-0 in the final month of the calendar year since 2024 – the only team in the NFL with an unblemished record in those games. Going back to the start of Kevin O'Connell's tenure as head coach in 2022, Minnesota owns the third-best record in the NFL in December with a 12-4 mark.

Only the Bills (15-1) and the Los Angeles Rams (13-4) have a better record during that span, but both of those teams dropped a game in December within the past two seasons. Coincidentally, the Bills lost to the Rams 44-42 in Week 14 of the 2024 season. Meanwhile, the Rams perfect December run ended just five days ago when former Viking Sam Darnold led the Seahawks to a 38-37 overtime victory on Thursday Night Football after trailing 30-14 in the fourth quarter.

The Vikings have now won three straight and will have a chance to finish above .500, with two home games remaining. That's all fine and nice, but the win over the Giants also came with QB J.J. McCarthy suffering a throwing-hand injury, [and he is out this week]. McCarthy no doubt has had some bad injury luck in his two NFL seasons, but it calls into question whether his sometimes reckless playing style can make him an unquestioned NFL starter. How the Vikings approach the QB position this offseason will be fascinating. On the one hand, they likely haven't seen enough to know one way or another whether he's the future, but on the other, it would be tough to go into next season without another higher-quality alternative.

The Vikings have a decision to make. Is J.J. McCarthy, who flashed at times but was largely inconsistent and occasionally awful, the team's starting quarterback in 2026? Or do they believe enough in their ability to win now to kick the tires on a Kyler Murray or Tua Tagovailoa?

It's a conversation that is already being had in the Twin Cities, but it's a tomorrow problem. Now, it's about playing out the string and shutting down McCarthy. After the second-year pro hurt his hand in Sunday's win over the Giants, there's no point in him playing again in 2025.

The Vikings still have a shot at finishing above .500, which is not what Minnesota was shooting for coming off a 14-3 season, but it would be a positive in an otherwise frustrating season. The problem is that J.J. McCarthy is out. That won't make it easy to win one remaining game, much less both of them. But playing well late should give the Vikings the belief that they can be a playoff team in 2026, as long as the quarterback play improves.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/yar5prdbalmzix1nybhj,N,,2025-12-23 18:14:02.934174
,,2025-12-23 22:55:33+00:00,NFL.com,"NFL Power Rankings, Week 17: Seahawks reclaim No. 1 spot, while Jaguars hit top 5",Eric Edholm,,,,,https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-power-rankings-week-17-2025-nfl-season,"The Panthers landed the first blow against the Buccaneers on Sunday, but the all-important Week 18 rematch in Tampa looms.
That might be what these very temporary rankings suggest right now, but who knows what this week will bring?
Simply winning the final two games doesn't guarantee a playoff spot, thanks to Pittsburgh's win in Detroit.
Was Sunday their final game as Saints in the Superdome?
That’s what nine straight losses have done to the G-Men, whose season clearly peaked with the Week 6 win over Philadelphia.","This is an interesting playoff race. One that's less about who's getting in and more about how seeding shakes out.

In the AFC, five teams (the Broncos, Patriots, Jaguars, Chargers and Bills) have officially clinched a postseason slot, and we pretty much know who'll get the remaining two bids: the Steelers and Texans, barring something crazy. The NFC also has five teams locked into the playoff field: the Bears, Eagles and three-fourths of the NFC West (sorry, Cardinals).

The Ravens and Lions aren't dead yet, but they're on life support. The one true ""coin toss"" situation is in the NFC South. The Panthers landed the first blow against the Buccaneers on Sunday, but the all-important Week 18 rematch in Tampa looms.

It might feel like things are fairly settled, but that's far from the case. The Broncos and Rams were skating toward the No. 1 seeds in their respective conferences, but last week's losses hurt -- especially for the Rams, who dropped down to the sixth seed. The NFC West race is remarkably fluid, and the 49ers somehow could steal the darned thing, even if the Rams remain fully capable of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in February.

So, are the Seahawks the best team in football? That might be what these very temporary rankings suggest right now, but who knows what this week will bring? It's a fool's errand, but we keep fetching answers.

I couldn't have imagined vaulting the Seahawks into the top spot after a game in which they allowed 581 yards and lost the turnover battle, 3-0, but here we are. Seattle has been here before, and I clearly have served as the team's white knight for various stretches, but I admit I am making this elevation with sincere hesitation. These Seahawks scare me, too, as good as they truly are. Sam Darnold deserves a ton of credit for bouncing back after throwing two bad interceptions on the prime-time stage, and there's undeniable fight/grit to this squad. Even still, the NFC West and the No. 1 seed are not locked up yet, and Nick Emmanwori, Coby Bryant and Riq Woolen all suffered injuries in last Thursday's big win. The 'Hawks can wrap everything up with two more victories, but games against the Panthers and 49ers will be no cakewalk.

Down 11 points in the fourth quarter, on the road, with several key players injured, Drake Maye and the Patriots refused to die. Maye caught fire in the final quarter, leading two long touchdown drives, with Rhamondre Stevenson's TD romp giving the Pats a lead they wouldn't relinquish. The comeback win clinched a playoff berth for New England, moving the team into a dominant position to also claim the AFC East crown in the next two weeks. Losing Offensive Rookie of the Year candidate TreVeyon Henderson (concussion protocol) for any length of time would be a worry, and as mentioned above, that wasn't the only notable health setback the Pats suffered in the game. They're very thin on both lines of scrimmage right now but should eventually get help from players returning from IR, including OT Will Campbell and DT Milton Williams. They'll be warmly welcomed back to a team that has outplayed all expectations and will be a fascinating case study in the postseason.

The Bills survived a tough game at Cleveland. The Browns had two fourth-quarter possessions while facing a three-point deficit, but Sean McDermott's defense got a pair of much-needed stops. Before that, it was a fire drill, as Cleveland ran the ball efficiently and Shedeur Sanders made some wild plays. The Bills' D remains a concern, and they're still going to need more from players not named Josh Allen and James Cook. But let's also give credit where it's due: This is Buffalo's sixth consecutive season with 11 or more victories, the longest active streak in the NFL. It really hasn't been easy at times this year, but there's a mental toughness baked into this roster that can't be dismissed. Unfortunately for Buffalo, New England came back to beat Baltimore on Sunday night, slimming down the Bills' already-lean chances of winning a sixth straight AFC East crown.

The Broncos' celebrated defense had its hands pretty full with the Jaguars for most of a frustrating day, while Bo Nix and the offense never found that fourth-quarter magic we're so used to seeing them summon. In a game that felt like a Divisional Round playoff matchup, Jacksonville took a few early punches and fought back hard. Missed tackles were a problem for Denver's defense. Jags QB Trevor Lawrence took some sacks but also hit some big plays against the blitz. LB Dre Greenlaw's late injury also bears watching. It was a disappointing result all the way around, especially with the top seed in the AFC there for the taking. Now, even the division is in some doubt. This Thursday's Christmas night game in Kansas City looks far easier, with both Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew out, but the Week 18 showdown with the Chargers suddenly looms very large.

What a statement performance from the barnburning Jaguars, who keep one-upping themselves en route to a potentially historic season. First, there was the monumental win (at the time) over the Chiefs. Then the stomping of the Chargers at home. But Sunday's triumph felt different, with Jacksonville going into Denver's den and really seizing control of the game. Trevor Lawrence turned in one of his best performances, and he's been on fire lately with 19 TDs (16 passing, three rushing) in the Jags' six-game win streak, including a whopping 10 in the past two. The defense also served up a reminder against the Broncos that it's better than people realize, coming up with some big stops and heating up the pass rush late. Who says Jacksonville can't make a Super Bowl run in Liam Coen's first year? The AFC is wide open.

With Saturday night's thrilling OT victory over rival Green Bay, Chicago now has 11 wins -- with six of them coming after the Bears trailed in the final two minutes of regulation. They needed a face-mask penalty on third-and-20 and a recovered onside kick, among other things, in order to pull out that miracle against the Packers, which demonstrates both their extraordinary resilience and their propensity to make things harder than they need to be. The reward for those late-game heroics is that the Bears have clinched a playoff spot, they are the overwhelming favorites to win the NFC North, and the No. 1 seed remains possible. Simply beating the 49ers and Lions might not get it done, however, and as Ben Johnson said in the locker room after Saturday's win: ""We need to get better."" If the Bears do, Chicago might not know what to do with itself.

When this 49ers offense is on, it can be an absolute buzzsaw. San Francisco has a punter who hasn’t kicked since November! The Colts are pretty battered defensively, but the 49ers had their way with them all night until Brock Purdy ’s late pick kept the door open for a minute. Otherwise, Purdy was terrific on Monday night, throwing a career-high five TD passes and some absolute beauts. The flip side is that Philip Rivers kind of made mincemeat of San Francisco's defense, at least until Dee Winters ended it with his pick-six. The Niners made sure not to let Jonathan Taylor get going, but Rivers had open receivers from which to choose. If the 49ers can get back to that Panthers game level of performance, I’d like them a bit more. But there’s still a decent pathway toward stealing the NFC West and putting themselves in a very favorable spot. If that happens, I’ll gladly slide them up.

The Rams went from blowing the Seahawks out of their own building midway through the fourth quarter ... to ultimately dropping five slots to the NFC's No. 6 seed. Coughing up a 30-14 lead last Thursday and eventually losing when Seattle TE Eric Saubert caught a two-point conversion in overtime, Sean McVay's team suffered a setback that was simply shocking, especially on a night when it rang up 581 yards of offense and didn't turn the ball over. There certainly were plenty of missteps, including those on special teams that led to the somewhat-stunning firing of coordinator Chase Blackburn. Not that the Rams' special teams have been good on the whole -- they haven't -- but how often do we see Super Bowl contenders axe coaches in late December? Had Los Angeles stopped Seattle's final two-point try, would Blackburn have kept his job? Who knows? But all of a sudden, everything we thought about the Rams and their playoff path -- even with Matthew Stafford offering up another MVP-worthy performance -- has been thrown into the blender.

There have been plenty of times recently where the offense has really labored to put together consistent performances, but Sunday was not one of those days. Justin Herbert was terrific, and the offense survived yet another injury at left tackle, with Jamaree Salyer going down early in the game. Whether the Chargers' ease of execution was more about themselves or about facing Dallas is debatable, but it was good to see, nonetheless. Quentin Johnston was back, Ladd McConkey got back in the end zone, and Herbert played at a playoff-ready level. The defense took a few early shots but really finished well. The next two games are barnburners -- vs. Houston, at Denver -- so there's no rest for the weary, but that's now four straight wins and another move up.

The Texans won their seventh straight game on Sunday, but the close-shave victory over the lowly Raiders induced several rounds of boos from the NRG Stadium crowd. Houston's ballyhooed defense gave the team an early lift with Derek Stingley Jr.'s pick-six, but it also allowed Las Vegas to score 21 points and rip off a surprising number of big plays. Meanwhile, the Texans' offense didn't score a touchdown until midway through the fourth quarter, resurfacing concerns about the shape of that unit. The Jaguars' win in Denver also kept the chances higher that the Texans will have to go on the road if and when they clinch a postseason bid.

It wasn't pretty, but beating Washington iced the NFC East crown for Philadelphia, ending a two-decade run of the division never having back-to-back champs. The Eagles played good defense against the Commanders without Jalen Carter, and the offense has slowly started to regain something of an identity in recent games against lesser opponents. Saquon Barkley found some lanes and helped close it out, while Dallas Goedert caught his 10th TD pass of the season. Sure, Philly needed some help from Washington in this one, but the Super Bowl LIX champions took care of business in the end. Just how viable the Eagles are as Super Bowl LX contenders is ripe for debate, but they're at least trending back in the right direction prior to a tough test and playoff tune-up at Buffalo.

It was nothing short of a demoralizing loss in Chicago. The Packers seemed to be in complete command, up 10 late in the fourth quarter, before eventually falling in overtime. And QB Jordan Love left the game with a concussion, making his status unclear for the final two weeks of the regular season. The division-title dreams aren't completely dashed, but Chicago is now firmly in the captain's chair. It's easy to point to the slew of late-game errors -- the face mask, the onside kick, the bomb TD in OT -- as to why the Packers lost, but they also made their bed early in the game. A 16-6 lead should have been much larger, with the Packers coming up short in the red zone. They were 0-for-5 scoring touchdowns down there, including 0-for-3 in goal-to-go situations. They were stopped on downs on the opening drive at the Chicago 7-yard line and fumbled inside Chicago's 5 in the third quarter. Those shortcomings ended up being just as damaging in the end.

You can make a strong case that Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell are co-MVPs for this team, combining for 279 of the team’s 481 yards and scoring all three touchdowns at Detroit. The Steelers were in trouble just before the half, down 10-3 prior to Gainwell’s miracle TD, and they controlled the next quarter and a half to take a 22-10 lead. Warren ripped off a pair of 45-yard TD runs to put the game away, although Pittsburgh had to hang on for dear life, surviving a missed chip shot by Chris Boswell and two OPI calls negating Detroit touchdowns. After the Ravens blew their Sunday night game, the Steelers moved into a dominant position in the division race, but they'll be without receiver DK Metcalf for the final two games of the regular season, after he was suspended by the league for a testy midgame altercation with a fan. Always something interesting with this team.

In an electric environment at Bank of America Stadium, the Panthers primed their fans for a home playoff game with a stirring win over the rival Buccaneers to take control of the NFC South. Win out, including the Week 18 game at Tampa, and the Panthers will be hosting in Round 1 -- possibly against a Rams team they beat in Charlotte less than a month ago. Bryce Young is starting to earn a reputation as a late-game finisher, logging his 12th game-winning drive over the past three seasons. Young made several big throws and escaped pressure with some timely scrambles, and Tetairoa McMillan had his biggest game in a month. There were also heroes on defense, including Lathan Ransom -- Week 15's goat with a late penalty -- who intercepted Baker Mayfield to ice the game.

The Lions’ season, for all intents and purposes, might have come to an end on a failed fourth-and-goal play -- one of the wilder ones you’ll see -- and it was somewhat fitting for a frustrating campaign in Detroit. Their playoff chances aren’t completely gone, but it’s going to take something miraculous to get them in now. Two more road games remain, and the Lions need to win one just to avoid finishing below .500. They just never caught fire after the bye, and on Sunday, they suffered a second straight loss for the first time in more than three years. Detroit’s run game has stalled, and a beat-up offensive line has something to do with that. The Steelers also had their way with the Lions' defense, which has been competitive but unable to stop the bleeding. It’s a tough finish for a team that had taken the league by storm the past two seasons. It doesn’t appear to be in the cards this time around.

Lamar Jackson left Sunday night's game against the Patriots with a back injury, the Ravens blew an 11-point lead with 10 minutes left and now their playoff hopes are on life support. Simply winning the final two games doesn't guarantee a playoff spot, thanks to Pittsburgh's win in Detroit. Now comes the big-picture question that I've held back on asking until now: Are we sure John Harbaugh will return in 2026? The Ravens will finish this season 3-6 at home -- more losses in Baltimore than they had in the two previous seasons combined. With Jackson's status unknown and Baltimore traditionally struggling without him in the lineup, the Ravens could be headed for a 10-loss campaign. The future of this proud franchise feels like it's hanging in the balance right now.

Even with Philip Rivers ’ late pick-six, he wasn’t the reason the Colts lost Monday night. The defense couldn’t get a stop for the first three and a half quarters, looking helpless against the Niners’ high-powered attack. It hurt that Sauce Gardner remained sidelined, but DeForest Buckner ’s return couldn’t lift this beleaguered unit at all. The D played well at Seattle in Rivers’ debut but otherwise has had a tough run recently. Rivers was making throws and nearly matching the 49ers, score for score, until the late mistake. It’s clear he’s been game-ready, even if the Colts dropped both games, ending all realistic hope for a miracle playoff run. What a strange, fascinating but ultimately disappointing season in Indianapolis.

The Buccaneers might still have the statistical edge to make it into the playoff field over Carolina, but anyone who has seen this team lately is sure to have a different opinion about how the next two weeks will play out. Todd Bowles did his best Lee Elia rant after the botch job against Atlanta, and his team still suffered another crushing loss. Driving for the game-tying field goal or the go-ahead touchdown against the Panthers, Baker Mayfield threw a back-breaking interception to put the Bucs in a win-or-else situation heading into Weeks 17 and 18. Tampa Bay’s defense didn’t allow many yards, but it was way too loose at the ends of both halves, allowing the go-ahead scores to give Carolina the momentum it needed. The Bucs can still take this division by beating the Panthers in the final regular-season game, but a loss at Miami this Sunday could end it early.

The Vikings have now won three straight and will have a chance to finish above .500, with two home games remaining. That’s all fine and nice, but the win over the Giants also came with QB J.J. McCarthy suffering a throwing-hand injury, leaving his availability in doubt -- again. McCarthy undoubtedly has had some bad injury luck in his two NFL seasons, but it calls into question whether his sometimes-reckless playing style can make him an unquestioned NFL starter. How the Vikings approach the QB position this offseason will be fascinating. On the one hand, they likely haven't seen enough to know one way or another whether McCarthy's the future, but on the other, it would be tough to go into next season without another higher-quality alternative.

The defense had a little flourish after the trade-deadline acquisition of Quinnen Williams, but the afterglow is gone following another stinker on that side of the ball. It's fair to point out that the personnel is still quite lacking in multiple spots, but the Cowboys can't be happy with 140 points allowed in their past four games. The temperature's rising around coordinator Matt Eberflus, but if the franchise makes a change, it would introduce Dallas' fourth defensive coordinator in as many years. You saw Brian Schottenheimer's lack of faith in the unit when he opted to go for it on fourth-and-1 from the Chargers' 16-yard line in a seven-point game late in the third quarter. Los Angeles stopped Dallas on the play and then scored the final 10 points of the game.

The Chiefs’ season was already slipping away before Patrick Mahomes ’ torn ACL, but watching them struggle mightily against the Titans after Gardner Minshew suffered his own knee injury was quite revealing. There was a time when the mighty Chiefs could have absorbed losing Mahomes and still managed to beat an opponent near the bottom of the standings, but that time is not now. Say what you will about Kansas City not having something to play for, but it’s hard not to notice that Mahomes -- even with his warts, and as tough as this season has been -- often has covered up the team's other shortcomings. Perhaps this clarity will seep into the offseason plans, because bouncing back next season won’t be any finger snap.

My unsolicited advice to the Falcons: ride Bijan Robinson and be smart with Drake London . The Falcons aren’t going to the playoffs, and it was clear Sunday in London’s return to the field that he didn’t look right. Head coach Raheem Morris chalked it up to the star receiver being rusty, but the Falcons don't gain much by working him full throttle in these final two games. Robinson should be the workhorse down the stretch as he chases an All-Pro bid and keeps adding to his league-leading scrimmage-yards total (2,026). Even with the Falcons being stuffed on two fourth-quarter fourth-and-1s in the win, Robinson is their best chance to play spoiler against the Rams and beat the suddenly competent Saints. Atlanta needs to be competitive down the stretch, with owner Arthur Blank reportedly set to evaluate the futures of Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot after the season went off the tracks quickly.

Amid all the doom and gloom and speculation about Joe Burrow, the quarterback followed up his bad game in a shoutout loss with one of his best performances of the season in a blowout win. Tee Higgins also brightened the mood with his return, kicking off the scoring in Miami. Throw in a big game from Chase Brown and a strong rebound from the Bengals' defense following a tough start, and there were a surprising number of positives coming out of Sunday -- or as many as there could be for a team out of the playoffs. It also helps out Zac Taylor's case as the Bengals weigh what changes to make in the offseason. I suspect they'll be keeping the core in place, hoping for better luck in 2026. Sunday was a reminder it can work, even if the weight of the opponent must be taken into account.

Rookie QB Tyler Shough became the Saints' first 300-yard passer in two calendar years, and he did it while throwing to Chris Olave and a host of backups at receiver, with New Orleans' top three running backs also out. Things were a little sluggish early, but after Taysom Hill converted a fake punt, Shough warmed up and the offense started rolling as Olave tore up the Jets time and time again. The wide receiver's future in New Orleans was once cloudy, but now he projects to being Shough's go-to target next season. Hill also got in on the fun Sunday with a TD pass, and a pair of 36-year-olds, Cameron Jordan and Demario Davis, led a dominant defensive performance against the Jets. All three players are longtime Saints stalwarts whose futures are up in the air. Was Sunday their final game as Saints in the Superdome?

Quinn Ewers' first start wasn't nearly as bad as the final score (45-21) indicated, but a solid first half was followed by two interceptions and a failed fourth-down sneak. On the rare occasions the Bengals pressured Ewers, he struggled; otherwise, he sort of looked the part, albeit against one of the league's worst defenses. Mike McDaniel made the call to bench Tua Tagovailoa and elevate Ewers over QB2 Zach Wilson, and his decision hasn't backfired on him yet. Sadly, the defense was beaten like a drum by Joe Burrow and Co. That's two rough games in a row on that side of the ball after the unit had shown some promise against the Saints and Jets. Draw whatever conclusions you want, but it's hard not to think the competition mattered.

The Commanders came out strong against the Eagles and even appeared primed to pull an upset in the first half, but the game -- just like Washington's season -- crumbled remarkably fast. Every team has dealt with significant injuries this season, but the Commanders' woes have been particularly painful. Marcus Mariota left with a hand injury, and several others were also hurt: Jaylin Lane, Brandon Coleman, Sam Cosmi and Jer'Zhan Newton. Making matters worse, Javon Kinlaw and Quan Martin were both ejected, putting them in line for potential fines/suspensions. At 4-11, that only means so much, but it's tough to see things come so unglued, even after Washington ended the eight-game losing streak in Week 15.

The Cardinals started the season 2-0, but now they're trending toward a top-five draft pick. Seven straight losses (and 12 in the past 13 games) will have that kind of effect on a team. The fact that eight of Arizona's defeats -- including Sunday’s setback to the Falcons, which dropped the Cards to 1-7 at home -- have been by one score is no anodyne for what’s become a pretty miserable campaign. Sunday also added pain in the form of another disappointing performance by Marvin Harrison Jr. in his return to the field, including a TD drop, and an injury to Josh Sweat , who’s been one of the few bright spots on defense. Calais Campbell continues to defy age with a blocked extra point that kept the game tied at halftime, and Michael Carter made plays for a struggling backfield, but the negatives far outweigh the positives in the big picture.

Don’t look now, but that’s three straight multi-TD passing performances from Cam Ward after he’d failed to throw for more than one in any of his first 12 games. Beating the Chiefs deserved celebration for the downtrodden Titans, even if the win came against a team that was a shell of itself after losing both Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew . Jeffery Simmons continues to play hard for the Titans, notching a safety, two pass breakups and a pair of tackles for loss, and the defense followed suit with its best statistical outing since at least Week 1. Winning two of the past three has helped lift the mood in the building, and beating Kansas City had to carry extra weight for GM Mike Borgonzi (with the Chiefs in 2009-2024), even if there are still a lot of holes to plug and the victories have severely damaged the Titans’ chances of landing a top-three draft pick for next April.

Shedeur Sanders was better against the Bills than he was against the Bears one week prior, ripping some confident throws and conjuring up some magic in a game the Browns had legitimate chances to win. But on the flip side, he also turned the ball over twice and was guilty of a grounding penalty deep in Cleveland territory in a one-score game late. He was good but not quite good enough. The Browns are in position to land a top-five draft pick in 2026, and they have the ammunition (also owning the Jaguars' first-rounder) to make a big push for a quarterback. Sanders hasn't yet done enough to assure the team will pass on one. How he finishes the season and whether Myles Garrett breaks the sack record -- he's one full sack away -- are the best reasons to tune into Cleveland in its final two games, which is more watchability than most teams in this range can boast.

Although Brady Cook wasn't terrible, he had another two fourth-quarter turnovers in the Jets' loss to the Saints, turning a 16-6 deficit into a blowout. Cook will start again this Sunday against the Patriots, but it's clear that the Jets will enter the offseason as one of the teams most in need of solving their long-term QB issues. Aaron Glenn made a change at defensive coordinator last week, and it resulted in some better play (for a while, anyway) on that side of the ball. But how the Jets have gone this entire season without an interception -- an NFL-record 15 straight games -- deserves a well-funded study. It's something that feels nigh impossible -- or, at the very least, only capable of happening to the Jets.

It’s now virtually a dead heat for who’ll get the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, with the Giants and Raiders leading the way and the Browns and Jets still in contention. That’s what nine straight losses have done to the G-Men, whose season clearly peaked with the Week 6 win over Philadelphia. Even with six of those defeats coming by one score, including Sunday's 16-13 loss to Minnesota, it’s hard to find much silver lining with the Giants now, as beat up as they are. This Sunday’s game at Las Vegas is essentially both teams’ Draft Super Bowl, and it’s possible that both head coaches in that showdown are in their penultimate contests with their respective clubs. Mike Kafka hasn’t won as an interim coach, and his offense has gone from moderately promising in his first few games to pretty disappointing over the past few.

Pete Carroll might be embattled, and the Raiders might have lost their ninth straight game, but they came out and battled the Texans for four quarters in Houston, nearly pulling out what would have been a shocking win. The most encouraging aspect, regardless of what happens after the season, was seeing Ashton Jeanty break out for his best game of the year, with a 60-yard TD catch to give the Raiders a third-quarter lead and a 51-yard TD run that made it a two-point game with under six minutes remaining. The Raiders couldn't pull it out, but seeing Jeanty thrive was one of the more welcome developments in a lost season.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/vlujuwxlp78rkb15fqz8,N,,2025-12-23 20:02:33.836725

McCarthy will miss Thursday’s game against the Detroit Lions. He injured his right hand late in the first half of Sunday’s game against the New York Giants, and coach Kevin O’Connell ruled him out on Tuesday after testing revealed a small hairline fracture.

“It’s a bummer,” O’Connell said. “It’s been really fun. Although the week-to-week judgment of players and decisions and all these things that are noise, I understand it all. But the most fun part of this, and the most real part of this, is coaching a young player on his journey where we’ve started to see things click for him.”

McCarthy’s status for the Week 18 matchup with the Green Bay Packers is uncertain, but the team does not think he will require surgery, and he will not be placed on injured reserve. O’Connell said his progress will depend on grip strength.

In the short term, undrafted rookie Max Brosmer will start on Christmas Day against the Lions. The longer-term ramifications are more significant.

Minnesota hoped to see McCarthy finish out the season. These final two weeks, versus NFC North foes, were going to offer meaningful data in the calculus of the Vikings’ offseason quarterback decisions. McCarthy had played well in the two games before Sunday. The injury leaves the Vikings with an incomplete sample.

McCarthy’s lack of availability has been one of two primary concerns. He missed his entire rookie season after suffering a torn meniscus during the preseason. In Week 2 this fall, he suffered a high ankle sprain, which forced him to miss five games. And in Week 12, a Packers defender pounded him into the turf, which sent him into the concussion protocol. McCarthy has only played in nine of the 32 regular-season games the Vikings have played since he was drafted with the No. 10 pick in 2024.

McCarthy didn’t inform the coaches and trainers that he was in pain until several plays later. O’Connell said the team pored over the film from the game to identify the culprit. It’s possible that McCarthy smacked his hand on the helmet of Giants defensive tackle Roy Robertson-Harris with 2:57 remaining in the second quarter. However, two plays following that collision, McCarthy scrambled for a 12-yard touchdown and high-fived teammates.

McCarthy fumbled on the next drive and then reported the injury.

“I think the first time he really felt it was when, after that play, (our trainers) evaluated him,” O’Connell said. “I was right there on the sideline. And he had his first real pain, he said he felt, when they were checking certain spots of his hand.”

O’Connell said he wouldn’t have called a screen pass had he known McCarthy’s hand was hurt.

“Even though he didn’t know it at the time,” O’Connell said, “he was unable to do his job. Which would’ve altered my thinking in the moment.”

The other concern in the big picture has been McCarthy’s play. This season, he has thrown for 1,450 yards, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions with a completion rate of 57.3 percent — the lowest of all 33 qualified quarterbacks. For much of the season, O’Connell discussed the need for McCarthy to rework his lower-body mechanics.

Minnesota has won three games in a row to improve to 7-8, but the season has been a significant disappointment. No team spent more on its 2025 roster than the Vikings. O’Connell and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah received offseason extensions, yet the team has not won a playoff game since they took over in 2022.

Questions about McCarthy’s health and consistency are likely to lead to another interesting offseason. The Vikings are likely to pursue a trusted veteran who can provide insurance at the quarterback position. They have plenty of other decisions to make, too, including the potential renewal of defensive coordinator Brian Flores’ contract and potential roster cuts like defensive tackle Javon Hargrave.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/22141927/USATSI_27865127-scaled-e1766431276216.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-23 20:02:41.963105

Metcalf faced disciplinary trouble after appearing to aim a punch at a fan during his team’s 29-24 win over the Detroit Lions.

While Metcalf reportedly plans on appealing the suspension, if the ban stands, the big-bodied pass-catcher will forfeit US$555,556 (AU$833,705) for the two missed games.

Per an NFL release, Metcalf’s act violated the league’s policy that dictates “players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and ... if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable.”

The incident occurred during the second quarter, when Metcalf could be seen getting into an exchange with a Lions fan wearing a blue wig at Detroit’s Ford Field.

The confrontation ended with Metcalf apparently striking the fan with his fist before walking away.

The Detroit supporter did not appear to be hurt and responded to Metcalf’s blow by raising his arms aloft in celebration.

It was not immediately clear what caused the confrontation, which rapidly went viral across social media.

Ryan Kennedy, the Lions fan involved in the altercation with Metcalf, “categorically denies using the ‘N-word,’ the ‘C-word’ or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based language during the incident,” according to a statement released by a Michigan law firm on Tuesday morning (AEDT).

“These allegations are completely false,” the statement released by Shawn Head and Sean Murphy of Head Murphy Law Firm reads.

“There are some things that fans will say to you that will get you out of character, but D.K., come on, man,” former NFL wide receiver Nate Burleson said on CBS.

“I don’t know the details, but you cannot let someone get into your head to the point you want to go over there, talk to them, grab them and then, what it looks like, throw a jab.”

The fan who Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at told The Detroit Free Press that the incident left him “a little shocked”.

“My words don’t matter because it was on camera,” he added.

The fan said they called Metcalf by his government name: DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.

“I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,” the fan said.

“I’m a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me. I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.”

The incident echoed a flashpoint involving Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson earlier this season.

Jackson shoved a Buffalo Bills fan during a week one defeat. Jackson was not punished for that incident, which was initiated by the fan in question who was later ejected and banned from the Bills’ Highmark Stadium.

The Steelers ended up winning Monday’s game 29-24 in dramatic fashion, with Lions quarterback Jared Goff seemingly stealing the victory on the final play of the game.

Goff had linked with Amon Ra St. Brown on a fourth-down pass just short of the goal line and with only a few seconds left, Detroit’s top receiver then threw a lateral to his quarterback who scored.

What would have been the game-winning touchdown was rubbed off the board with the officials announcing offensive pass interference in the lead-up, seeing Pittsburgh get home.

Running back Jaylen Warren had two 45-yard touchdown runs in the win while the Lions combined for just 15 yards all up.

PROMISING UPDATE AFTER SCARY SCENES FOR BRONCOS ROOKIE

Elsewhere, Broncos coach Sean Payton provided an “encouraging” update after rookie receiver Pat Bryant was carted off following a brutal hit in Denver’s 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Byrant took a hard hit from Jacksonville cornerback Montaric Brown on the penultimate play of the game, with players from both teams later surrounding the young playmaker before he was loaded into a cart and taken off the field to an ambulance.

In a promising update, KUSA-TV’s Mike Klis reported that Bryant was taken to a local hospital for concussion-like symptoms not neurological symptoms, while Payton later told reporters the rookie had “movement” in both his hands and legs.

“So as we know more, we’ll let you know,” he added.

It was a sour note to end a tough night for the Broncos, who entered Monday on an 11-game winning streak.

Jacksonville, however, has also been one of the league’s most in-form teams after blowing away the Jets last week, with quarterback Trevor Lawrence playing some of the best football of his career.

Lawrence completed 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards and three touchdowns while adding another score on the ground.

CHIEFS’ BRUTAL INJURY DEJA-VU

The Chiefs may be down another quarterback.

Kansas City is now worried that quarterback Gardner Minshew tore his ACL when he had to exit their 26-9 loss to the Titans in the opening minute of the game, according to multiple reports.

Minshew will undergo further testing, meaning the Chiefs may have lost two quarterbacks to ACL tears in the span of as many games, after Patrick Mahomes’ season was cut short in their Week 15 loss to the Chargers.

Minshew went down on the third play of the game as he scrambled and fell to the ground.

The injury appeared to be a noncontact one, and he quickly grabbed his left knee.

He did attempt to remain in the game.

Minshew was spotted walking back to the Chiefs’ locker room in the second quarter with members of the medical staff, and he was eventually ruled out for the rest of the game at halftime.

He ended his day completing 3-of-8 passes for 15 yards, and third-string QB Chris Oladokun entered the game with 11 minutes left in the half while Minshew was being examined in the second quarter.

Minshew had been starting in place of Mahomes, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL against the Chargers last week. He has since undergone surgery to address the injury.

The Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention in their loss to the Chargers, but the hope of trying to close out the regular season on some sort of positive note may have hit another snag with their backup potentially down for the count.

The Chiefs have two games left on their schedule, with Denver closing out the home portion of their schedule on Christmas Day and a trip to Las Vegas in Week 18 to face the Raiders. Oladokun would be in line to get the starts in those games.

STANDOUT ROOKIE SUFFERS GRUESOME INJURY

Elsewhere, Browns rookie Quinshon Judkins suffered a gruesome injury in the second quarter of Monday’s game against the Bills, an incident that left the young running back in excruciating pain and forced him to be carted off the field.

It has also ended his season early, with Browns coach Kevin Stefanski revealing after the game that Judkins suffered a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle.

Judkins will need surgery, and he will be done for the year.

“Great teammate, runs hard, cares about this game, cares about the right things, so I’m disappointed for him,” Stefanski told reporters after the game. “He’s disappointed, but he’s not somebody I worry about. He’ll bounce back.”

Quarterback Shedeur Sanders told reporters that it was “sad” to see Judkins go down with the injury.

The scene unfolded when Judkins was making a catch behind the line of scrimmage and was tackled by Bills linebacker Matt Milano.

Judkins remained on his back after the play was ruled dead, and team medical staff quickly came out to tend to the injured Brown.

It appeared on the broadcast that his right leg was bending in the wrong way on the tackle, which was so unpleasant to see that CBS broadcaster Ian Eagle said on air the network would not show the replay of the injury.

Trainers put an air cast on Judkins’ leg after he was placed on a cart to be taken off the field.

The injury came just a few plays after Sanders had come back into the game after suffering a pinky finger issue.

Coming into the game, Judkins had 222 carries for 805 yards and seven touchdowns this season.

CHARGERS, BILLS EDGE CLOSER TO PLAYOFF BERTHS IN OTHER GAMES

In other news, Justin Herbert threw two touchdowns and rushed for another as the Los Angeles Chargers moved to the brink of the NFL playoffs with a 34-17 victory over the already-eliminated Dallas Cowboys.

Chargers quarterback Herbert produced a near flawless performance to set up a convincing win against a Cowboys team whose postseason hopes were snuffed out by Philadelphia’s win over Washington on Sunday.

Herbert finished with 300 passing yards from 23-of-29 attempts with no interceptions, and rushed for 42 yards including a third quarter touchdown.

The win left the Chargers with an 11-4 record in the AFC West, all but guaranteeing they will advance to the postseason.

The Chargers could wrap up a playoff berth if the Indianapolis Colts fail to beat the San Francisco 49ers on Tuesday.

In other early action on Monday, the faltering Tampa Bay Buccaneers stumbled to a 23-20 defeat on the road to the Carolina Panthers in a crucial NFC South divisional tussle.

The Panthers vaulted into first place in the division following the win, which leaves them with an 8-7 record with the Bucs second on 7-8.

The loss was another hammer blow for Tampa Bay, who have taken just one win from their last seven games to allow Carolina to edge past them in the divisional standings.

The Buffalo Bills also powered towards the playoffs with a 23-20 win over the Cleveland Browns.

Bills quarterback Josh Allen had a quiet game with just 130 passing yards and no touchdowns from 12 completions.

Instead it was left to the Bills ground game to grind out victory, with running back James Cook rushing for two touchdowns and 117 yards to set up a win, which takes Buffalo to 11-4 for the season.

Buffalo can qualify for the playoffs if either Houston or Indianapolis fail to win their week 16 fixtures.

The Kansas City Chiefs, eliminated from postseason contention last week, endured another miserable afternoon with a lackluster showing in a 26-9 defeat to the Tennessee Titans (3-12) in Nashville.

The Chiefs’ defeat was compounded by an injury to back-up quarterback Gardner Minshew, who exited in the second quarter with what reports said was a possible anterior cruciate ligament tear.

Chiefs starting quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered an identical injury in last week’s loss to the Chargers.
