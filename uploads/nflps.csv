The Patriots didn’t practice today, taking it easy this week before Super Bowl LX preparation ramps up next week. But they released a projected injury report that showed who would have been available if they had practiced. And Maye was listed as limited with a right shoulder injury.

That comes a day after Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said talk of Maye’s shoulder bothering him was probably overblown. Vrabel noted that after 17 regular-season games and three postseason games, no player is 100 percent. But the vast majority of the players on the Patriots’ roster aren’t on the injury report. Maye is, which suggests that there’s at least some reason for concern.

If the Patriots had practiced today, five players would not have practiced at all: OT Morgan Moses and TE Hunter Henry would have sat out to get some rest even though they’re not injured, LB Harold Landry would have missed practice with a knee injury, OT Thayer Munfort would have missed practice with a knee injury and an illness, and LB Robert Spillane would have missed practice with an ankle injury.

Patriots WR Mack Hollins would have been limited with an abdominal injury. Patriots DL Joshua Farmer has a hamstring injury that wouldn’t have been serious enough to limit him at all.

""I think they're going to do a little more research behind all that this offseason, because it did blow up,"" Warner said.","Fred Warner, at least before the 2025 season, was remarkably healthy throughout his NFL career with the 49ers.

Despite the forces potentially, but unlikely, at play both on and off the field.

San Francisco's star linebacker joined NFL wide receivers Amon-Ra and Equanimeous St. Brown on the latest episode of their ""St. Brown Podcast,"" where he was asked about the viral online theory about the electrical substation next to the 49ers' practice facility in Santa Clara being linked to the team's onslaught of injuries over the years.

""There's a lot of mixed reviews about that, I think at the end of the day, when you look at the actual data behind 'Is that real or not?' I think that's false,"" Warner said. ""I'll be the first to tell you, because I train year-round at our facility. And I'm not going to sit here and say a substation is the reason why I got my ankle broke in half, that was a fluke injury, right?

""But before that, I had missed one game. I had one game missed on a fluke [hamstring injury] where I stepped wrong. I had been super healthy for seven-plus years ... The substation may have gave me superpowers, I don't know. I guess if you just overdose on it, you get Hulk strength or something.""

Warner might not subscribe to the theory himself, but he understands why it would spread and take on such a life of its own that even president of football operations/general manager John Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan were asked about it in their end-of-season press conference last week.

""It's because we've had so many injuries, right?"" Warner added. ""We have had a bunch of injuries since I've been here, but a lot of it is because we have an older roster, we train harder than a lot of people in the NFL when it comes to how we practice and do all these other little things. It's just a combination of all that, and it's football at the end of the day, like it's 100 percent injury guarantee rate.""

Maye's injury was only revealed in the lead-up to the Super Bowl. He popped up on the team's Jan. 28 injury report after coach Mike Vrabel had addressed the second-year quarterback's health during a news conference.

How significant is Maye's injury? Here's what to know about the malady and how it will impact the second-year quarterback as he prepares to play in Super Bowl 60.

Drake Maye injury update

The Patriots announced Maye would have been a ""limited"" participant in the team's estimated practice report for Jan. 28 because of an injury to his right shoulder.

New England did not actually have a practice session Wednesday. However, both the Patriots and Seahawks were still required to release an injury report as part of the lead-up to Super Bowl 60.

Maye's limited status also wasn't a major surprise. Vrabel had hinted the 23-year-old quarterback was banged up during a news conference on Jan. 27.

""I think that everybody, including Drake, is not 100% at this part of the year,"" Vrabel told reporters when asked about Maye's injury. ""We'll do everything that we can to help our players be prepared and get ready for this game.""

Vrabel also acknowledged reports of Maye's injury had ""probably"" been blown out of proportion on social media and that the quarterback hadn't suffered any additional injury during the team's 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game.

""No, I wouldn’t say that anybody hurt anything,"" Vrabel said. ""Again, this is a sport where there's gonna be things that come up.""

""We’ll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we’re required to, we understand that,"" Vrabel added. ""But we were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football, so that’s kind of where everybody is at.""

While Vrabel didn't share any concrete updates about the timeline of Maye's shoulder injury, NBC Sports Boston's Phil Perry reported the second-year quarterback had been dealing with the right shoulder injury prior to the AFC championship game. It simply hadn't caused him to miss any practice time.

That changed with Jan. 28's practice report, indicating Maye's shoulder might be a bit worse for wear after the AFC championship game. Either that, or the Patriots are just trying to give him some extra rest to get closer to 100% before the Super Bowl with an extra week off.

Maye doesn't appear to be in imminent danger of missing Super Bowl 60. Nonetheless, his practice status will bear monitoring as he prepares for the biggest game of his young career to date.

Who is the Patriots backup quarterback?

Joshua Dobbs is the Patriots' backup quarterback and would relieve Maye in the event he can't play.

Dobbs, 31, is in his first season with the Patriots. The veteran was a fourth-round pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2017 NFL Draft but has bounced around to nine different teams over his nine-season career to date.

Dobbs established himself as a reliable backup quarterback with the Tennessee Titans and got the first two starts of his career under Vrabel in 2022. The Tennessee product has only posted a 3-12 career record but has completed a respectable 62.8% of his passes for 3,346 yards, 17 touchdowns and 15 interceptions while adding 515 yards and eight touchdowns on 110 carries.

Dobbs majored in aerospace engineering while at Tennessee and earned the nickname ""The Passtronaut"" during the 2023 NFL season, when he made 12 starts for the Arizona Cardinals and Minnesota Vikings and helped keep both teams competitive amid injuries to Kyler Murray and Kirk Cousins.

Patriots QB depth chart

The Patriots have three quarterbacks across their organization. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Drake Maye

Joshua Dobbs

Tommy DeVito

DeVito, like Dobbs, is in his first season with the Patriots. The 27-year-old was claimed off waivers from the New York Giants after the NFL's 53-man roster deadline and served as the team's emergency third quarterback throughout the 2025 NFL season.

DeVito has a 3-5 record across eight career starts, all with the Giants, and has completed 65.3% of his passes for 1,358 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/28/USAT/88404746007-drake-maye-patriots-012826.jpg?crop=3596,2020,x0,y72&width=3200&height=1798&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-28 19:59:25.407345

I know it’s shameful to say.” Coming soon Do you like the selection of Bad Bunny to perform the Super Bowl halftime show?","Traditionally, The Athletic has conducted its annual anonymous player poll much earlier in the NFL calendar. This season, we decided to exercise a bit of patience and hold off until the campaign’s final days.

From early December through the end of the regular season, our beat reporters gathered responses across the NFL on the topics that emerged as front-of-mind during the 2025 season. Among them:

• After a season full of officiating-fueled controversy, is it time for the tush push to be outlawed?

• Is there anything wrong with Tom Brady running a franchise in the same league he covers as a prominent analyst?

• Seemingly, everyone has voiced their opinion on the NFL making Bad Bunny the first Spanish-language performer for Super Bowl halftime. How do players feel about the selection? And if not Bad Bunny, who would they like to see?

• How much has widespread sports betting and fantasy football intruded on players’ lives?

• What player would make the best flag football player? How about the best referee?

Those are just some of the topics we covered in this year’s survey, the results of which will be released in installments over the coming days. Eighty-four players participated — some declined to answer certain questions, and on certain prompts (where noted), respondents were allowed to provide multiple answers. Here’s what they said:

“It’s a dumb rule. Dumbest rule we’ve made in a while, in my opinion.”

“It’s bulls— rugby.”

“I believe we were sold on the change being related to player safety — it just doesn’t make sense to me.”

“Sometimes you go lights-out for a second. You just have to play it off.”

“We don’t mess with brains.”

“Football is about availability more than ability. You’re going to hide whatever you can to be out there. I know it’s shameful to say.”

Coming soon

Do you like the selection of Bad Bunny to perform the Super Bowl halftime show?

Has a fan ever confronted you about fantasy football or betting?

Should Tom Brady be allowed to hold a role as a broadcaster and a team’s minority owner?

We’re going to get some extra rest,” Maye said Tuesday on WEEI about a potential injury.

Patriots quarterback Drake Maye downplayed a potential right shoulder injury coming out of New England’s 10-7 AFC Championship win over the Broncos on Sunday while he prepares for Super Bowl 2026.

He avoided stating whether he may be limited in the buildup to the biggest game of his young career.

“I’m feeling good. We’re going to get some extra rest,” Maye said Tuesday on WEEI about a potential injury. “Really, I don’t think it’s from the game. I think just the build-up of throwing for almost, including training camp, 30 weeks straight of throwing and four days a week, it can add up. But I think we’ve got some extra rest and feeling good and ready to go for the Super Bowl.”

There will always be gamesmanship involved at this point of the year, but Maye’s status is certainly one to keep an eye on before he faces the Seahawks on Feb. 8.

Maye grabbed his right shoulder in the third quarter after being tackled hard to the ground in the third quarter, though he did not miss any time during the game.

“Some bumps and bruises, but, hey, that’s what it takes,” Maye said after the game. “I think a lot of those guys in the locker room are battling through things. At the same time, the best thing about it is another chance at it, another chance to get healthy, two weeks…”

Patriots coach Mike Vrabel danced around the possibility of Maye being injured during a radio hit Tuesday.

“There’s not a player on our team that’s 100 percent healthy,” Vrabel said on WEEI’s “The Greg Hill Show” after being asked about internet speculation on Maye’s status.

He added: “I would imagine we’ll go through the injury report and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in. But nobody’s 100 percent. This’ll be our 21st game.”

If Maye is dealing with anything beyond soreness, he has an extra week to get ready before attempting to lead the Patriots to their seventh Super Bowl win and first without Tom Brady.

The second-year quarterback has not passed well this postseason after a sensational regular season that may earn him NFL MVP honors.

Maye has completed just 43 of 77 passes (55.8 percent) for 533 yards with four passing touchdowns to two interceptions.

He’s fumbled six times and lost three, while also taking 15 sacks.

The Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites at FanDuel over Maye’s squad.

Reading this really weighs on me. I understand the pressure to compete, but toughing out injuries comes with a huge long term cost. Shouldn’t players be putting their health first?

No, you have to take care of your health and set an example for the young people coming up so they don't buy into the whole ""ruin your body for the money"" ploy that sucked you in.

The crisp air, the roar of the crowd, and the ever-present shadow of injuries that can sideline even the most dominant players. While we cheer for touchdowns and game-winning tackles, it's easy to forget the physical toll the NFL takes. This season, like many before it, has seen its share of key players sidelined, impacting team dynamics and, for fans, adding a layer of anxiety to every game.

Looking at the Arizona Cardinals, for instance, the injury report reads like a who's who of players who won't be on the field anytime soon. We're talking about guys like Greg Dortch, a dynamic wide receiver who's been a bright spot, now on injured reserve with a chest issue. Then there's Paris Johnson Jr., their offensive tackle, whose knee injury, while reportedly not impacting his long-term outlook, still keeps him off the field for now. And it doesn't stop there. Marvin Harrison Jr., a highly anticipated talent, is also on injured reserve with a foot problem. Kitan Crawford, Walter Nolen III, Kei'Trel Clark, Garrett Williams, Andre Baccellia, Bam Knight, Bilal Nichols, Trey Benson, Kyler Murray, Will Hernandez, Jonah Williams, Mack Wilson Sr., Simi Fehoko, Zay Jones, Travis Vokolek, Blake Gillikin, Tip Reiman, and James Conner – the list goes on, a stark reminder of the fragility of athletic careers.

It's a complex web, this injury situation. Some players are dealing with what sounds like a temporary setback, listed as 'questionable' or with an 'estimated return date' in the near future, like Evan Brown and Channing Tindall. Others, unfortunately, are facing longer stints on injured reserve, with comments suggesting season-ending issues or even more concerning long-term prognoses. The sheer volume of players on IR, especially for a team like the Cardinals, highlights how quickly a roster can be depleted and how much depth is truly needed in this league.

This isn't just about one team, of course. Every franchise grapples with these challenges. The Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Chicago Bears, Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Dallas Cowboys, and Denver Broncos – all have their own stories of players battling through injuries. It's a constant chess match for coaches and general managers, trying to adapt game plans and find solutions when key pieces are missing. For us as fans, it's a reminder to appreciate the players who are on the field, giving their all, and to hope for the swift and full recovery of those who are currently sidelined. The game is undeniably better when everyone is healthy and competing at their peak.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-28 17:24:23.973113

“Not the best,” Nussmeier said when asked how he evaluated his play last season.","MOBILE, Ala. — Garrett Nussmeier had no plans of shutting down his season after he was benched last November against Alabama. The LSU quarterback said he understood the decision and expected things to “go back to normal” the following week.

But that Tuesday, as Nussmeier went to throw a frontside shallow — a simple 8-yard route — the 23-year-old bent over in pain.

He had reinjured the abdominal injury that had plagued him throughout the season. And though he spent the rest of the week rehabbing, trying to get ready for the next game, Nussmeier came to a realization: I can’t do this.

“At that point, I knew if I can’t throw a frontside shallow, I’m not effective,” Nussemeir said Wednesday, recalling the moment publicly for the first time. “I can’t help my team win. From there, it wasn’t really a decision I was able to make to not play.

“It was forced upon me.”

Months later, Nussmeier admitted he’s still not 100% healthy. He said surgery for the ailment was considered, but as of now, Nussmeier doesn’t believe it will be needed. Instead, the quarterback has focused on re-training “from the ground up.” After playing most of the year hurt, Nussmeier said he picked up “so many” bad habits when adjusting to the injury. His play suffered as a result, creating a fascinating dynamic as he participates in the Senior Bowl this week.

Last fall, Nussmeier entered the college season viewed as one of the nation’s top prospects, with the potential to be the first overall pick in the draft.

This week, he has to show that he’s worthy of being drafted at all.

“Not the best,” Nussmeier said when asked how he evaluated his play last season. “There were things, obviously, that I take full ownership in and the areas that I needed to be better at. … Unfortunately, some new things happened because of what I went through with the injury. (It was) frustrating, for sure.

“I don’t blame anybody for the frustrations. …. I wanted to be the best. I wanted to lead us to a national championship. I wanted to win the Heisman. And those were all the things I dreamed about doing. So not being able to do them, I understand why people were frustrated because I was frustrated myself.”

Despite the lackluster campaign, Nussmeier didn’t sound like someone who regretted passing up the NFL draft last year — when his stock was much higher. He said returning to LSU last year was an “easy choice” and that he took the responsibility of wearing No. 18 seriously. He said even with the injury, he “wouldn’t take any of it back” because he was willing to do whatever it took to play every Saturday. He said he believes the adversity will make him a better player in the long run.

Even now, there are parts of Nussmeier’s injury that remain a mystery. He declined to get into specifics about the injury, though he indicated that he and LSU officials went from believing the ailment was a core injury to an abdomen. He said the injury, which he called ""weird"" and rare, wasn't LSU's fault and praised his medical team for taking great care of him.

As part of his rehab work, Nussmeier said he has focused on using his body to rotate through his passes — something he couldn’t always do last season. The rust has been evident at times. Nussmeier didn’t particularly appear sharp in Tuesday’s practice, his first of the week. His first drop back in team drills, for instance, led to the ball being knocked out of his hand after Illinois defensive end Gabe Jacas won quickly off the edge.

But Nussmeier has entered the week with an open mind. His father, Doug — the Saints’ offensive coordinator — has given him advice on how to navigate this process.

Nussemeier, though, said he’s not out to “prove” anything at the Senior Bowl. He said he just wants to show that he belongs at the next level and show that “Garrett Nussmeier is enough.” He’ll get an opportunity, too, this week as a quarterback for the American team — coached by Saints running backs coach Joel Thomas and other Saints assistants.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/38/e382d6b8-63d8-42e8-ae90-126cb1ffcda8/697a7011e4f6e.preview.jpg?crop=1648%2C865%2C0%2C195&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-28 16:22:59.905272

Maybe he was accurate at SDSU, in a great system and one of the strongest programs at the FCS level. He then moved to a passing deficient Big 10 school and really struggled to throw the ball.

Estimated Reading Time: 5 minutes

The 2024 NFL Draft's quarterback class was historic. Six passers were drafted in the first round, and all were off the board after the first 12 picks. Over the past two years, we’ve seen exactly why that was the case.

Four of the six have won at least one playoff game, three have made it to a conference championship game and one has reached the Super Bowl.

Tiering this quarterback class, rather than ranking each player, feels appropriate since we have just two years of data. The order within those tiers can be debated, but the tier itself is far more important.

TIER 1: Franchise Quarterback

I truly believe that the first three quarterbacks drafted are franchise-altering players. They have all at some point proven their front office right. Their ranking within this tier is all about preference. If there were a re-draft today, you would have a hard time convincing each franchise to change its pick.

Caleb Williams, Chicago Bears

The first overall pick from the 2024 NFL Draft didn’t get off to a flying start in his rookie season after a tumultuous year that led to the firings of both his head coach and offensive coordinator. Now with Ben Johnson at the helm, Williams started to put it all together.

Williams finished his second NFL season with a 76.9 PFF overall grade, highlighted by his 5.4% big-time throw rate — the fourth-highest clip in the NFL this season.

His highlight reel of throws from this season is one of the best you’ll ever see, and they continued to come in clutch situations as the Bears pulled out miraculous come-from-behind victories seemingly all year.

The biggest question for Williams this past season was how he would perform within the structure of the offense. While he had some growing pains, Williams steadily improved his play from the pocket. In his rookie season, he earned a 70.9 PFF passing grade from a clean pocket. In 2025, that jumped to 80.0.

The next hurdle is improving his accuracy. Williams’ 69.4% adjusted completion rate ranked 39th out of 42 eligible quarterbacks, and his 23.9% rate of uncatchable throws placed 41st out of 45 eligible quarterbacks. That played a large part in why the Bears had to muster so many comebacks. They couldn’t build early leads because of the inaccuracies and missed opportunities.

Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders

The second overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft came out guns blazing in his rookie season, leading the Commanders to an appearance in the NFC Championship game for the first time in more than 30 years.

Daniels finished his rookie season with a 90.6 PFF overall grade, tying Russell Wilson for the highest single-season mark by a rookie quarterback in the PFF era (since 2006).

The former Heisman Trophy winner immediately looked like he'd been in the NFL for years, making every throw imaginable and answering every pre-draft concern. Daniels routinely made high-level, anticipatory throws over the middle of the field. When in rhythm and attacking the middle of the field, he ranked third in completions and earned an 84.9 PFF passing grade, the 10th-best mark in the NFL.

It was always going to be hard for Daniels to top that effort. He was so efficient in every aspect that there was bound to be some regression. After two games in 2025, he was injured and missed the next two games. That was the start of a season where he never got into a rhythm while dealing with injury after injury. Daniels appeared in only seven games.

When he was on the field, his performances were up and down. There were flashes of the quarterback we saw last year — two 80.0-plus PFF overall grades — but he didn't display enough consistency and fell back into some bad habits. That led to Daniels' accuracy rate falling to 57.7%, putting him 32nd out of 45 eligible quarterbacks.

Health is the biggest question for Daniels going into year three. When he's at 100% and able to get into a rhythm, he’s one of the most dynamic quarterbacks in the NFL.

Drake Maye, New England Patriots

The third overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft took a bit longer to see the field than his counterparts. Maye’s first NFL start came in Week 6 of the 2024 season, and he finished his rookie campaign with a 70.1 PFF overall grade.

Then, he broke out in 2025. He finished the regular season with the third-highest PFF overall grade among quarterbacks and firmly cemented himself in MVP conversations.

His campaign was highlighted by accuracy and elite efficiency on deep passes. Maye ranked in the top 10 in both adjusted completion rate and accuracy rate, and his 98.6 deep PFF passing grade was good for third best in the NFL.

Although Maye didn't put much poor play on tape this season, his playoff run has been less than stellar. The Patriots will still be playing in Super Bowl 60, but three of Maye’s five lowest-graded games came in the playoffs due to an uptick in turnover-worthy plays and inaccuracy.

Patriots fans aren’t concerned right now as they prepare for another Super Bowl, but it may be some cause for concern when the team faces a more difficult schedule next season.

TIER TWO: High-Quality Starter

A first-round quarterback who can be classified as a high-quality starter is a successful draft pick. Teams have found plenty of success with quarterbacks who might not be the best player on the team but can operate an offense at a high level.

Bo Nix, Denver Broncos

The last of the six quarterbacks selected in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft ended up being the only one to make the playoffs in both seasons. Nix immediately took the reins as the Broncos' starting signal-caller as a rookie and finished with a solid 78.3 PFF overall grade.

Nix appeared to take a step forward in his second season as a passer, earning a 76.1 PFF passing grade — the 12th-highest figure among quarterbacks in 2025.

Denver's top-tier offensive line helped Nix thrive this past season. He was kept clean on 68.2% of his dropbacks — tied for the fifth-highest rate — and finished with the seventh-best PFF passing grade from a clean pocket (89.3).

Consistency remains an area of needed improvement for Nix, who mixes incredible outings with lackluster showings. Nix has recorded 11 games with a sub-60.0 PFF overall grade and 10 games with an 80.0-plus PFF overall grade. There doesn’t seem to be a rhyme or reason for those lower-end games, which could be a cause for concern in the future.

TIER THREE: Unknown

The third tier belongs to the quarterbacks whom we haven’t seen enough of to truly judge their future. There have been flashes of high-level play, but injuries have kept these players out for extended periods of time.

Michael Penix Jr., Atlanta Falcons

The eighth overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft took up until the final three weeks of his rookie season to get his first start, but he showed some real flashes.

In just three games, Penix posted an 87.9 PFF overall grade as a rookie, highlighted by a ridiculous 9.0% big-time throw rate. He showed off his rocket arm every chance he got in those first three starts and gave Falcons fans reason for real excitement going into his second NFL season as the unquestioned starter.

But Penix’s 2025 campaign didn’t go as anticipated. While he definitely had some positive moments, including an 84.4 PFF overall grade in Week 8, inconsistent accuracy plagued his season. Penix logged a 53.1% accuracy rate in 2025, which ranked 43rd out of 45 eligible quarterbacks.

The reason he’s in the unknown tier is his season-ending ACL injury suffered in Week 11. Typically, players can come back from an ACL injury and not lose a step, but this is Penix's third ACL injury and fifth season-ending injury in eight seasons between college and the NFL.

J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings

The 10th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft was the final first-round quarterback from the class to make his debut after missing the entire 2024 season due to a torn meniscus.

Despite the Vikings going all in on McCarthy, the 2025 season didn’t go as planned. McCarthy finished an injury-riddled campaign with just 10 appearances and a 61.8 PFF overall grade. He struggled with accuracy and protecting the football. McCarthy notched a 51.4% accuracy percentage, which ranked 44th out of 45 eligible quarterbacks, and his 4.8% turnover-worthy play percentage was fifth highest.

It wasn’t all doom and gloom for McCarthy. He showed real flashes early in the season, leading the Vikings to some impressive comebacks, and he made impressive throws despite the inconsistency. McCarthy finished his 2025 season with a 7.3% big-time throw rate, ranking second to only MVP favorite Matthew Stafford.

Vikings fans will look at his play in Weeks 14 and 15 as a reason for optimism. That stretch featured McCarthy's highest-graded games of his career. He looked in complete control and, most importantly, took care of the football (zero turnover-worthy plays).

The inconsistent play and constant injuries leave McCarthy’s future as a giant question mark. He’s shown at times why he was drafted in the top 10, but there are still too many negatives for the Vikings to be fully confident in the 23-year-old for the 2026 season.",https://media.pff.com/2025/10/Maye-Drake-Feature-2-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2026-01-28 15:26:44.081081

Earlier this week, multiple reports indicated Maye suffered an injury during the Patriots’ AFC Championship Game win over the Denver Broncos last Sunday. Maye and New England head coach Mike Vrabel all but confirmed the shoulder issue during media availabilities on Tuesday.

However, some speculated that Maye actually suffered the injury, the severity of which remains unknown, sometime before the Broncos game. And NBC Sports Boston’s Phil Perry confirmed that theory Tuesday evening.

“The issue has not been significant enough that it’s limited him in practices or games, which is why we haven’t seen it on the injury report, but it’s not perfect,” Perry said during Tuesday’s “Early Edition” episode. “As Drake Maye mentioned in his (WEEI) interview, (it’s a) long season, 30 weeks of throwing, I’m sure there’s some level of wear and tear there.

“But this is something that he has dealt with prior to the Denver game, and then of course landing hard on it the way he did, that doesn’t help.”

Story continues below advertisement

Perry was referencing a play that saw Maye scramble 13 yards before Broncos safety Talanoa Hufanga fell on him as he landed on his shoulder. Still, as many have noted, Maye threw a beautiful pass on a 31-yard flea-flicker completion to Mack Hollins two plays later, so his shoulder apparently wasn’t causing him significant discomfort.

Nevertheless, adrenaline can help athletes power through nagging injuries during games before soreness increases the following day. Only Maye and the Patriots know how much pain he truly is dealing with ahead of Super Bowl LX.

After Nix mentioned those previous injuries (and recoveries) to Sean Payton, the coach joked that he wouldn't have drafted the quarterback had he known about his ankle history. Payton reiterated during his end-of-season press conference on Tuesday that his remark was a joke to lighten the mood in the moment (Denver knew about Nix's history leading up to the draft).

""Understand that was in jest, and I'm going to stop trying to be funny,"" Payton said. ""I'm going to stop trying to be funny.""

Payton was asked if the team has concerns about Nix's repeated ankle injuries, and he said ""no."" In his answer, though, Payton also revealed that this type of injury was practically inevitable for Nix.

""No, I think what was found, though, what was a condition that was predisposed, right at that time,"" Payton explained. ""They always find a little bit more when they go in. It wasn't a matter of ‘if,’ it was a matter of ‘when.’ So it wasn't… Because when you look at the play and you're trying to evaluate it, he said, the doctor, operating surgeon, said that this was this was going to happen, sooner than later. Now you go about the rehab, proper orthotics, all those things. He's been one of those players that I would say has been available. There were others in that draft class that weren’t as available.

""I think the rehab coming off of this will be strong, but the news that was something we… The way it was explained that it was coming sooner than later. So listen, he'll rehab his tail off and get ready and get back to being healthy. I think for someone who runs with the ball, I think he's done a pretty good job of protecting himself, not all the time, but for the most part, he's done a pretty good job of sliding and understanding playing for another day.”

Now that the inevitable injury has happened and Nix has undergone surgery, fans in Denver will hope that the issue has been fixed and the QB won't face repeated setbacks going forward. Nix won the most games (24) through a QB's first two seasons in NFL history, and Payton expects him to bounce back with a healthy campaign in 2026.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/27/SBRC/88379646007-bo-nix-ankle-history.jpg?crop=3149,1771,x0,y0&width=3149&height=1771&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-28 14:27:04.992828

Which players could define the offseason? Who could be re-signed? Who might have a new team in 2026? We'll start in the AFC East:

AFC EAST

Buffalo Bills

C Connor McGovern

The Bills had the exact same starting offensive line in front of quarterback Josh Allen the past two seasons, but continuing that in 2026 will be difficult with both McGovern and starting left guard David Edwards set to hit free agency. This group has worked well together with offensive line coach Aaron Kromer, who is retiring, and while there would be real upside for the Bills in that five staying together, there's a solid amount of work to do to this roster this offseason, especially with a new coach coming in. Finances are going to come into play here, increasing the odds of the group looking different next season. -- Alaina Getzenberg

Miami Dolphins

CB Kader Kohou

Kohou missed the entire 2025 season after tearing an ACL early in training camp, but he has been a consistent producer at nickel corner for the past three seasons. The former undrafted free agent is an unrestricted free agent this offseason, as are fellow cornerbacks Rasul Douglas and Jack Jones -- all of whom Jon-Eric Sullivan and Jeff Hafley should consider re-signing. Coming off an injury, the amount Kohou asks for shouldn't be a backbreaking price for a Dolphins team that needs to navigate a tight salary cap this offseason. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

New England Patriots

DE/OLB K'Lavon Chaisson

The 6-foot-3, 255-pound Chaisson was a top bargain signing last offseason, having joined the Patriots on a one-year deal with a base value of around $3 million and a maximum value of $5 million. He could expect to double that, and perhaps even exceed that, after totaling 31 tackles, 7.5 sacks and 18 QB hits in the regular season. He joins safety Jaylinn Hawkins and defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga among the team's top players scheduled for free agency. -- Mike Reiss

New York Jets

RB Breece Hall

The Jets could've moved Hall at the Nov. 4 trade deadline, but they retained him for a reason: They would like to work out a long-term deal. Hall rushed for a career-high 1,065 yards and, although it wasn't his best all-around season (his receiving numbers plummeted), he did enough to win over coach Aaron Glenn. The Jets are committed to the run game, so it makes sense to keep their RB1. The question is, how much are the Jets willing to pay? Hall, entering his age-25 season, would be in high demand across the league, which is why the Jets could utilize the franchise or transition tag on him. -- Rich Cimini

AFC NORTH

Baltimore Ravens

C Tyler Linderbaum

The Ravens would love to keep Linderbaum, who has become the anchor of their offensive line. But it won't be easy because Linderbaum is expected to draw a lot of interest as one of the top free agents available. He is the first Baltimore offensive lineman to go to three consecutive Pro Bowls since guard Marshal Yanda went to six straight (2011 to 2016). Linderbaum could become the NFL's highest-paid center and surpass Kansas City's Creed Humphrey's $18 million per season. He's a free agent this offseason because Baltimore declined his fifth-year option at $23.4 million, which would have been $5.4 million more than the NFL's highest-paid center in terms of average per year. -- Jamison Hensley

Cincinnati Bengals

DE Trey Hendrickson

Once again, the Bengals will have to make a decision on Hendrickson's contract. But unlike in previous years, this one is much clearer. The odds are very slim that Cincinnati and Hendrickson, who is arguably the best free agent signing in franchise history, will find a path forward. Hendrickson played in just seven games last season because of a core muscle injury that required season-ending surgery. He's 31 years old and it doesn't make a ton of financial sense to stay in Cincinnati, either on the franchise tag or on a short-term contract. His time with the Bengals has yielded four Pro Bowls, an All-Pro nod and 61 sacks during his five-year tenure. -- Ben Baby

Cleveland Browns

LB Devin Bush

Bush, 27, is coming off the best year of his career. He recorded 125 tackles and three interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns. With Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah missing most of the past two seasons because of a neck injury, Bush has filled in admirably and formed a solid duo with rookie linebacker Carson Schwesinger. Bush is the only unrestricted free agent from a defense that finished the season as one of the NFL's best, and keeping him would help retain that continuity. But he's due for a sizable pay raise after playing on a $3.25 million salary in 2025. -- Daniel Oyefusi

Pittsburgh Steelers

RB Kenneth Gainwell

Gainwell joined the team as a free agent in 2025 on a $1.79 million, one-year deal. He's due for a significantly higher salary in 2026 after earning team MVP honors. He led the Steelers with 73 receptions and scored eight touchdowns as he split running back duties with Jaylen Warren. Gainwell was an all-purpose threat in Arthur Smith's scheme, but these Steelers could look a lot different with Mike McCarthy calling plays. The Steelers haven't typically given big contracts to running backs, and it seems more likely that the former Eagle will get paid elsewhere. -- Brooke Pryor

AFC SOUTH

Houston Texans

RG Ed Ingram

The Texans' trade in the 2025 offseason for the former 2022 second-round pick was met with skepticism, citing his benching during his final season with the Vikings. But he blossomed in Houston, allowing the 12th lowest pressure rate (6.4) among guards with at least 400 pass block snaps. He played a vital offensive line role for a group that allowed quarterback C.J. Stroud to be sacked only 23 times, a steep drop from the 2024 season in which he was sacked 52 times. -- DJ Bien-Aime

Indianapolis Colts

QB Daniel Jones

To be specific, the decision here has largely been made. The Colts are all-in on re-signing Jones after his one-year experiment with Indy in 2025 got off to a sizzling start before injuries ended it early. But now the Colts have some complicating factors to deal with, primarily their desire to run it back with a quarterback who is rehabbing a torn Achilles. Jones' injury status will likely impact contract negotiations on some level as the sides try to strike a deal. There is also the matter of Jones' timeline and whether he'll be ready for the start of the season, which the Colts are predicting. How does that impact their other quarterback decisions? -- Stephen Holder

Jacksonville Jaguars

RB Travis Etienne Jr.

Linebacker Devin Lloyd (a second-team All-Pro) is also a free agent, but the estimated franchise tag of $27.5 million is too high and he'll demand a big contact in FA, so the Jaguars are likely out on him. That might not be the case with Etienne. The franchise tag is estimated to be $14.1 million and the Rams' Kyren Williams signed a contract in August that pays him $11 million annually, so it might take more than $10 million annually to get Etienne to return. The Jaguars must decide if that's too much for a player who has had three 1,000-yard seasons in the past four years, and someone head coach Liam Coen praised for his fit and versatility in his offense. -- Michael DiRocco

Tennessee Titans

TE Chig Okonkwo

Okonkwo finished the final season of his rookie contract with 56 receptions for 560 yards, both career highs. Although he's not the typical in-line tight end, Okonkwo can be used in a variety of roles including out of the backfield as an H-back. Rookie Gunnar Helm emerged as the starting tight end last season with Okonkwo being used in different packages. It wouldn't be a surprise if the Titans let Okonkwo walk. But that depends on who the next offensive coordinator is. Okonkwo has proven himself to be a threat once he gets the ball in his hands as shown by his 6.2 yards after the catch average. So he will have value in the right scheme. -- Turron Davenport

AFC WEST

Denver Broncos

LB Alex Singleton

Certainly, running back J.K. Dobbins or defensive end John Franklin-Myers or linebacker Justin Strnad could have gotten the nod here. But while Singleton just turned 32 and was treated for cancer this season, no pending free agent's potential departure would require a bigger adjustment for the Broncos this offseason. Singleton led the team in tackles for the third time in four seasons. And despite cancer surgery in November, he was one of just three players on the team's defense to play at least 1,000 snaps (CB Riley Moss and S Talanoa Hufanga were the others). He could lure a bigger short-term offer from elsewhere, but if the Broncos don't keep him, that's a lot of tackles and snaps to replace. -- Jeff Legwold

Kansas City Chiefs

S Bryan Cook

As a three-year starter, Cook was by far the Chiefs' best safety. In defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo's complex scheme, the safety is one of the most critical positions, given the player's need for versatility. Cook played 83% of the defensive snaps this season and recorded a career-high six pass breakups and 85 tackles, often limiting big plays. If Cook joins another team in free agency, the Chiefs will have just Chamarri Conner and Jaden Hicks, who Spagnuolo said made more mistakes as a second-year player than he expected. -- Nate Taylor

Las Vegas Raiders

DE Malcolm Koonce

After missing the 2024 season because of a knee injury, Koonce had a quiet return to action for the most part. In 17 games (three starts), Koonce totaled 30 tackles and 4.5 sacks. The Raiders' starting defense will look a lot different in 2026. If Koonce is willing to come back on another one-year deal, he would be a solid depth piece on the defensive line. -- Ryan McFadden

Los Angeles Chargers

OLB Odafe Oweh

The Chargers traded for Oweh, a first-round pick in 2021 who had struggled for four seasons in Baltimore, and turned him into one of the league's most productive edge rushers. Oweh had 7.5 sacks in 12 games with the Chargers after having zero before they traded for him. His best game came in the postseason, when he had three sacks and two forced fumbles in the Chargers' 16-3 playoff loss to the Patriots, setting the single-game postseason franchise record for sacks. At 27, Oweh will be one of the most promising edge rushers available, and the Chargers will likely have to spend to keep him in L.A. For what it's worth, Oweh said after the season that he wants to remain in L.A. -- Kris Rhim

NFC EAST

Dallas Cowboys

WR George Pickens

After his offseason trade from the Steelers, Pickens did everything right to earn a massive payday. He set career highs in catches (93), yards (1,429) and touchdowns (nine) in his first year with the Cowboys. The Cowboys already have CeeDee Lamb on the books for $34 million per season and might have to equal or top that in order to sign Pickens to a long-term extension. That's why the strong belief is the Cowboys will use the franchise tag on him at a cost of about $28 million. Since 2018, the Cowboys have used the franchise tag six times, and the last time they signed a player to a long-term deal before the July deadline was Dez Bryant in 2015. -- Todd Archer

New York Giants

WR Wan'Dale Robinson

He led the Giants in catches (94) and yards (1,014) with fellow wideout Malik Nabers sidelined. He proved he can play inside and out. Robinson had a great contract year, leading all wide receivers out of the slot with 622 yards and 292 yards after the catch. It will all undoubtedly earn Robinson a significant payday. A return seems likely considering he has always been a favorite of GM Joe Schoen and the Giants need to add playmakers, not let the ones they drafted and developed walk. -- Jordan Raanan

Philadelphia Eagles

OLB Jaelan Phillips

The Eagles acquired Phillips from Miami at the November trade deadline for a 2026 third-round pick, and he proved to be a sound schematic and locker room fit. He had 2 sacks, 7 QB hits, 4 passes defensed and a forced fumble in eight games and excelled at setting the edge against the run -- a must in defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's system. Phillips' injury history might hold his value down some, but he's a young (26), productive edge rusher, which typically equals big money in free agency. Philadelphia has other contributors set to become free agents, including tight end Dallas Goedert, safety Reed Blankenship and linebacker Nakobe Dean. With players such as defensive tackles Jordan Davis and Jalen Carter eligible for paydays and only so much money to go around, the Eagles have some difficult decisions in front of them. -- Tim McManus

Washington Commanders

WR Deebo Samuel

Washington traded a fifth-round pick to obtain Samuel last offseason, and he responded with a team-high 72 catches -- the second most in his career -- for 727 yards and five touchdowns. He was not a big factor in the run game (only 17 attempts) partly due to the Commanders needing him more at receiver with other starters injured. The Commanders need another true receiver, one with downfield speed, opposite Terry McLaurin, but Samuel could still help as a versatile chess piece. The question is cost: Samuel made $17.5 million last season, but that's a steep price to pay for someone who just turned 30 and isn't the primary receiver. -- John Keim

NFC NORTH

Chicago Bears

S Kevin Byard

The 32-year-old safety led the NFL with seven interceptions and logged the fourth-most passes defensed (8) on the Bears' defense. Chicago's brass values Byard's contributions on the field as much as it does his impact in the locker room, where he was a captain in back-to-back seasons after signing a two-year, $15 million contract with the Bears in 2024. Byard is open to returning to Chicago and the Bears have expressed a desire to bring him back. But they also have decisions to make on three other safeties ahead of free agency, most notably Jaquan Brisker. ""Kevin's a special player,"" general manager Ryan Poles said. ""I have no problem saying that's a player that we would like to have back. But, again, when you add the other safeties into that mix and all the other decisions we have across the roster, with cap restraints and things like that, it'll be a challenge."" -- Courtney Cronin

Detroit Lions

DE Al-Quadin Muhammad

Muhammad is coming off a career-best season after making the most of a big opportunity in Detroit. The former sixth-round draft pick exceeded his one-year, $1.42 million contract with a career-high 11 sacks, 25 tackles and 53 pressures this season. However, at 30 years old -- and set to turn 31 this offseason -- the veteran defensive end will likely command a multiyear deal that could be out of Detroit's range. He could walk in free agency, forcing the Lions to find another edge rusher to pair with Pro Bowler Aidan Hutchinson either in the draft or via free agency. -- Eric Woodyard

Green Bay Packers

LB Quay Walker

Given that receiver Romeo Doubs and backup quarterback Malik Willis are likely luxuries the Packers can't afford, Walker becomes the biggest decision. They declined the fifth-year option on his rookie contract, but GM Brian Gutekunst has claimed all along he wants Walker back on a long-term deal. There had been on-and-off negotiations, but it's clear Walker won't come cheap. So the question is how much the Packers value him and whether they think they're positioned to replace him and make Edgerrin Cooper the centerpiece of the linebacker group. -- Rob Demovsky

Minnesota Vikings

WR Jalen Nailor

Nailor has spent the past two seasons as the Vikings' No. 3 receiver, and the assumption has long been that Nailor would depart as a free agent rather than bloat their cap structure at the position. Justin Jefferson is due to earn an average of $35 million in each of the next three seasons, and No. 2 receiver Jordan Addison -- a first-round pick in 2023 -- is now eligible for a contract extension. But Addison being arrested Jan. 12 and charged with misdemeanor trespassing, although the charges were later dropped, is a reminder that letting Nailor leave is not without risk. In his three-year career, Addison has missed three games because of an NFL suspension, two games because of injury and a quarter of another game as discipline for missing a walk-through practice. -- Kevin Seifert

NFC SOUTH

Atlanta Falcons

TE Kyle Pitts Sr.

After three straight uneven seasons, Pitts emerged again in 2025 as one of the best tight ends in the NFL. He was second in receiving yards (928) and receptions (88) -- trailing only Trey McBride -- and had a career-high five touchdowns. Going into this season, it seemed like Pitts and the Falcons would split. Now, Atlanta and its new leadership, led by president of football Matt Ryan and coach Kevin Stefanski, have a decision to make. Perhaps Pitts gets franchise tagged, which would bring him back for around $16 million. One more thing to note: Pitts' quarterback for his record-breaking rookie season in 2021 was none other than Ryan himself. -- Marc Raimondi

Carolina Panthers

WR Jalen Coker

You might think it's running back Rico Dowdle, who led the Panthers in rushing with 1,076 yards. But with Chuba Hubbard and Jonathon Brooks under contract and Dowdle's salary demand likely high, re-signing the former South Carolina star seems unlikely. That makes exclusive rights free agent Coker a priority to get signed to a long-term deal. Carolina can simply retain him with a one-year league-minimum tender, but since coach Dave Canales has already said Coker, a 2024 undrafted player out of Holy Cross, will enter the offseason as the No. 2 receiver behind Tetairoa McMillan, the time to lock him down is now. -- David Newton

New Orleans Saints

DB Alontae Taylor

While the Saints have several older veterans with voiding contracts, what they do with the 27-year-old Taylor will be the biggest storyline to watch in the 2026 free agency period. The Saints have parted ways with some of their starting defensive backs in recent memory (trading Marshon Lattimore to the Washington Commanders in 2024 and letting Paulson Adebo leave in free agency last year), so it's not a given that they re-sign him this year. Taylor has played in all 17 games for the past three seasons for the Saints. He can play both inside and outside and had two interceptions in 2025. -- Katherine Terrell

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

DB Jamel Dean

The decision to return for wide receiver Mike Evans and linebacker Lavonte David will be entirely up to Tampa Bay. Dean is interesting given his health issues (he has missed 21 regular-season games in seven seasons), but he was willing to take a significant pay cut last season, going from $12.5 million per year to $4.5 million. Still, the only starting cornerback who made it through all 17 games last season was rookie nickelback Jacob Parrish. The Bucs have to prioritize health at this position, but it's one of the more expensive positions in free agency. -- Jenna Laine

NFC WEST

Arizona Cardinals

S Jalen Thompson

Thompson has gone from being a supplemental draft pick into a bedrock of the Cardinals' defense, not just the secondary. He has been the Robin to Budda Baker's Batman and, at times, has been Batman himself. Thompson has played all over the secondary and flourished in different roles, but whether he comes back will be more a result of the new coaching staff, whenever it gets in place, than anything else. But breaking up the Thompson-Baker tandem might have unintended consequences for a defense that needs a bit of guidance and direction to reach its full potential. -- Josh Weinfuss

Los Angeles Rams

S Kamren Curl

The Rams didn't have a long list of free agents entering the preseason, and that list got even shorter after they re-signed running back Kyren Williams, inside linebacker Nate Landman and safety Quentin Lake during training camp or the season. Curl, who signed a two-year deal with the Rams in 2024, is now Los Angeles' biggest free agent decision. Curl had the biggest interception of the season for the Rams in the divisional round of the playoffs against the Chicago Bears, picking off quarterback Caleb Williams' pass in overtime. -- Sarah Barshop

San Francisco 49ers

WR Jauan Jennings

After a training camp injury and a contract stalemate that resulted in some added 2025 incentives but not a lucrative extension, Jennings will become an unrestricted free agent for the first time. He's coming off an up-and-down season that was marred by multiple injuries, but he set a career high with nine touchdowns. The Niners will move on from Brandon Aiyuk while Ricky Pearsall has struggled to stay healthy, which makes receiver a significant need this offseason. A Jennings return will depend largely on where his market goes as San Francisco wouldn't mind keeping him if the price is right. -- Nick Wagoner

With Mahomes suffering a torn ACL so late in the 2025 campaign, there’s been a lot of concern about when he’ll be able to get back on the field for the Chiefs.

Obviously, Kansas City will want to be extremely cautious with Mahomes’ recovery, even though the three-time Super Bowl champion has been adamant about returning sooner rather than later, claiming he aims to be ready for Week 1 of the 2026 NFL season.

Chiefs Team Owner Clark Hunt Updates Patrick Mahomes’ Recovery

During an appearance on Good Morning Football on Tuesday, team owner Clark Hunt talked about Mahomes’ recovery from the season-ending knee surgery as the NFL offseason gets underway for the Chiefs.

“I was with Patrick a couple of days ago in our training room, watching him go through the work that he’s doing to get back on the field with the rehab,” Hunt said of Mahomes. “And nobody works harder than Patrick.

“He certainly has a goal of being back for the beginning of the season. I wouldn’t put it past him. He’s somebody in the past who’s healed very quickly. And again, his work ethic I think gives him a huge advantage in getting back and being ready to play in 2026.”

It’ll be tough for Mahomes to be 100 percent healthy for Week 1 while coming back from knee surgery, but it’s also hard to say that the two-time NFL MVP quarterback can’t do something that he sets his mind to.

Hunt Shares Thoughts on Travis Kelce’s Future

Along with Mahomes recovering from the knee injury, fellow Chiefs superstar Travis Kelce is in the process of making a decision about his immediate future. He’s debating whether to return for another season in Kansas City or call it a career, marry pop star Taylor Swift and head into retirement after a Hall-of-Fame-caliber career in the NFL.

Hunt also talked about Kelce’s upcoming decision on whether he’ll retire or return for the 2026 campaign.

“As an organization, we certainly hope he will come back,” Hunt said of Kelce’s decision. “He had another great year, maybe not on par with where he was four or five years ago, but still had over 800 yards and was really one of the leaders on the offensive side of the ball for us. So there’s no doubt in my mind that he can still play.

“We’re trying to be respectful to give him the time that he needs to make a decision. He has sort of a busy offseason coming up with his engagement and marriage, so we want to be respectful and give him the time that he needs to make the decision, but we certainly hope he’ll be back.”

As Hunt points out, Kelce didn’t have the kind of season he’s used to, but he’s still a productive tight end and a valued part of the Chiefs franchise.

Only time will tell what Kelce decides to do and if he returns, whether he’ll be receiving passes from Mahomes right out of the gate.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2252111876-e1769537414297.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-28 14:27:24.559008

And more players will join the list as front offices make cuts, too.

We will have an updated top 100 in March, but for now, here are my top 50 pending free agents -- including just two quarterbacks. Let's stack the free agent class, starting with the 2024 sack leader.

Jump to the top-ranked:

QB | RB | WR | TE

OL|DL | LB | DB

1. Trey Hendrickson, Edge

2025 team:Cincinnati Bengals| Age entering 2026 season:31

What he brings:Hendrickson is a relentless defender off the edge, with a deep toolbox of counters and a knack for making plays late in the down. In seven games this season, he had four sacks. His 17.5 sacks and 65 pressures in 2024 were league highs. Hendrickson would immediately upgrade just about any team's defensive line.

2.George Pickens, WR

2025 team:Dallas Cowboys | Age entering 2026 season: 25

What he brings:With 22 receptions of 20 or more yards in 2025 (fourth most in the league), Pickens has the explosive ability to flip the field. That skill will lead to big money in the open market if he isn't franchise tagged. Pickens also finished third in the NFL with 1,429 receiving yards. His ability to run routes at all three levels boosts his free agent profile even more.

3.Tyler Linderbaum, C

2025 team:Baltimore Ravens | Age entering 2026 season: 26

What he brings:Linderbaum has a tone-setting mentality on the interior of the front, using elite foot speed and body control to match pass rushers or climb to the second level in the run game. His pass block win rate of 97.2% tied for second among 31 qualifying centers this season.

4.Daniel Jones, QB

2025 team:Indianapolis Colts | Age entering 2026 season: 29

What he brings:An Achilles injuryin Week 14 could delay Jones' availability at the start of next season, but it's clear he elevated his level of play and poise under coach Shane Steichen in Indianapolis. Jones' 64.1 QBR ranked eighth in the league through Week 13, and he threw with a much stronger sense of timing. He fits in an offense that features a good run game, which allows him to operate as a facilitator.

5. Jaelan Phillips, Edge

2025 team:Philadelphia Eagles | Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings:With his long 6-foot-5 frame, Phillips can play as both an edge setter and pocket disrupter. After being traded to the Eagles on Nov. 3, he had two sacks and 27 pressures in coordinator Vic Fangio's system, flashing improved range to the ball. Over his five-year career, Phillips has accounted for 28 sacks and 150 pressures.

6. Alec Pierce, WR

2025 team:Indianapolis Colts| Age entering 2026 season: 26

What he brings:A vertical stretch target at 6-foot-3 and 211 pounds, Pierce averaged a league-best 21.3 yards per catch in 2025. He also topped the 1,000-yard receiving mark and brought in six touchdowns. Pierce has the straight-line speed to lift the safeties, creating open coverage voids underneath for other targets. With more volume and an increased role, he has the skills to produce as a multi-level route runner.

7. Breece Hall, RB

2025 team:New York Jets| Age entering 2026 season: 25

What he brings:He's a fluid mover with good contact balance and the vision to find daylight, and he brings a dual-threat element to the backfield. Hall has 188 receptions in his career, while averaging 90 total yards per game. He also has 87 rushes of 10 or more yards over four seasons, serving as a three-down back who can rattle off a big play.

8. Rasheed Walker, OT

2025 team:Green Bay Packers| Age entering 2026 season: 26

What he brings:Walker's pass block win rate of 93.8% ranked 11th among 68 qualifying offensive tackles. His technique could still improve and he lacks a strong anchor, but he has the footwork and mobility to match the speed of edge rushers. At a premium position, Walker will see heavy interest in free agency.

9. Odafe Oweh, Edge

2025 team:Los Angeles Chargers| Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings:An explosive pass rusher who gets off the ball in a hurry, Oweh can also flatten his path to maneuver around offensive tackles. After gettingtraded from the Ravens on Oct. 7, Oweh had 7.5 sacks and 27 pressures in Los Angeles. Plus, he recorded three sacks in the team's wild-card loss to the Patriots.

10. Braden Smith, OT

2025 team:Indianapolis Colts| Age entering 2026 season: 30

What he brings:He is a big-bodied drive blocker at 6-foot-6 and 312 pounds, easily matching power in pass protection. Injuries have been a concern, as Smith has missed 17 games over his past three seasons. He started 13 games at right tackle for the Colts in 2025, and his pass block win rate jumped 7% from 2024.

11. John Franklin-Myers, DL

2025 team:Denver Broncos| Age entering 2026 season: 29

What he brings:Franklin-Myers lacks the lateral speed and bend to turn pressures into a bunch of sacks from edge alignments. But he's an active inside rusher who can play as a defensive tackle or 5-technique with his 6-foot-4, 288-pound frame. He had 7.5 sacks and 23 pressures this season.

12. Alontae Taylor, CB

2025 team:New Orleans Saints| Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings:Taylor's versatility and urgent play style show up on tape. He has the speed to cover receivers on the perimeter, but he can also play a disruptive role in the slot. In four seasons with the Saints, Taylor has 4 interceptions, 40 pass breakups and 7 sacks.

13. Quay Walker, LB

2025 team:Green Bay Packers| Age entering 2026 season: 26

What he brings:Walker's explosive traits create playmaking upside; he can cover ground as a run-and-hit defender. Plus, he diagnosed the run game at a quicker rate in 2025, averaging 4.9 tackles on designed rushes per game (11th highest). Overall, Walker had 2.5 sacks, 8 tackles for loss and 4 pass breakups.

14. Riq Woolen, CB

2025 team:Seattle Seahawks| Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings:Woolen has 12 interceptions and 36 pass breakups so far in his four-year career. A lack of consistent eye discipline has prevented him from reaching his ceiling in coverage, but he has the physical traits and speed at 6-foot-4 to help a defense majoring in man coverage and two-deep zone.

15. Mike Evans, WR

2025 team:Tampa Bay Buccaneers| Age entering 2026 season: 33

What he brings:Injuries limited Evans to eight games this season, but he had topped the 1,000-yard receiving mark in 11 straight seasons entering 2025. He's a classic boundary receiver, with 6-foot-5 size and great ball skills. Evans can still get loose in the red zone and produce as a No. 2 option.

16. Jaylen Watson, CB

2025 team:Kansas City Chiefs| Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings:Watson isn't a high-end playmaker, but he has the length to challenge in press and the route awareness to play top-down on the ball in zone schemes. He has 3 career interceptions and 23 pass breakups.

17. Malik Willis, QB

2025 team:Green Bay Packers| Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings:With his dual-threat traits and positive signs of development in Green Bay, Willis is one of the top quarterbacks in free agency. In four appearances (one start) this season, Willis completed 85.7% of his throws, rushed for 123 yards and scored four touchdowns. He'll be signed to start somewhere this March.

18. Travis Etienne Jr., RB

2025 team:Jacksonville Jaguars| Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings:Etienne looked more explosive in 2025, slashing through creases of daylight as a runner. His 26 rushes of 10 or more yards were tied for the 12th most in the NFL, and he's more than capable as a receiver out of the backfield (36 catches in 2025). He had 116 total yards and a touchdown in Jacksonville's wild-card loss to Buffalo.

19. Devin Lloyd, LB

2025 team:Jacksonville Jaguars| Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings:Lloyd's on-the-ball production increases his value heading into free agency. He had five interceptions on the season, returning one for a touchdown. He's a solid starter who flashed high-level ability this season.

20. Isaiah Likely, TE

2025 team:Baltimore Ravens| Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings: Likely's alignment versatility gives offensive playcallers more flexibility, and he has the catch-and-run traits to produce on high-percentage throws. He should be viewed as a ""move"" tight end who can get favorable matchups in the passing game. He had 27 catches for 301 yards and a touchdown this season, which was down from his six scores in 2024.

21. Romeo Doubs, WR

2025 team:Green Bay Packers| Age entering 2026 season: 27

What he brings: Doubs has the route-running traits and foot quickness to uncover, and he is more than willing to work the middle of the field on in-breaking concepts. While the Packers missed Jayden Reed, Christian Watson and Tucker Kraftover parts of the season, Doubsaveraged 13.2 yards per reception and caught five of his six touchdowns on red zone targets. In short, he's a reliable pass catcher.

22. Khalil Mack, Edge

2025 team:Los Angeles Chargers| Age entering 2026 season:35

What he brings: An elbow injury forced Mack to miss five games early in the season, yet he finished with 5.5 sacks and 28 pressures. He will need to be used more as a situational rusher at this stage of his career, but he is still a powerful defender who can create impact plays off the edge.

23. Kyle Pitts Sr., TE

2025 team:Atlanta Falcons| Age entering 2026 season:25

What he brings: Pitts plays the position like a wide receiver, and his numbers were up in 2025 (88 catches for 928 yards and five touchdowns). Though he needs to be more willing as an in-line blocker, teams are getting upside here in the pass game. And he has the tools to find favorable matchups from a variety of pre-snap alignments.

24. Kenneth Walker III, RB

2025 team:Seattle Seahawks| Age entering 2026 season:25

What he brings:Walker is a decisive runner who can press the edges with speed, find cutback lanes in zone schemes and provide big-play ability. His 33 rushes of 10 or more yards were the sixth most in the regular season, and he can be targeted on screens or swing routes out of the backfield. He has had at least 25 receptions in all four of his NFL seasons.

25. Bryan Cook, S

2025 team:Kansas City Chiefs| Age entering 2026 season:27

What he brings:A rangy safety with top-down speed, Cook fits in both split-field and single-high schemes. The 2022 second-round pick is the highest-ranked player at his position on this list. He had six pass breakups in 2025, playing82.6% of Kansas City's defensive snaps.

26. Rashid Shaheed, WR

2025 team:Seattle Seahawks| Age entering 2026 season:28

What he brings:Shaheed can stretch defenses vertically, plus he can turn screens or underneath throws into chunk plays. He also provides an upgrade on special teams, making the Pro Bowl this season as a fearless kickoff returner with open-field speed. Shaheed has had 29 receptions of 20 or more yards in his four-year career.

27. K'Lavon Chaisson, Edge

2025 team:New England Patriots| Age entering 2026 season:27

What he brings:Chaisson plays with an extra gear off the edge, using his vertical burst to get around offensive tackles. And he has the short-area speed to close on quarterbacks off stunts or inside loops. The former first-rounder had a career-best 7.5 sacks and 32 pressures this season, plus he added three more sacks in the team's first three playoff games.

28. Jauan Jennings, WR

2025 team:San Francisco 49ers| Age entering 2026 season:29

What he brings:At 6-foot-3, 213 pounds, Jennings is a consistent route runner who plays through contact and makes himself available to the quarterback on in-breaking targets. He caught 55 passes this season for an injury-riddled 49ers unit, scoring nine touchdowns. Jennings was even better in 2024, when he ranked 12th in ESPN's receiver scores and had 975 receiving yards.

29. Javonte Williams, RB

2025 team:Dallas Cowboys| Age entering 2026 season:29

What he brings:Williams looked more explosive on tape in 2025 than previous seasons. In Dallas, he showed short-area burst to dart through traffic, finishing with a career-high 1,201 yards. Williams had 26 carries of 10 or more yards, plus he averaged 2.6 yards after first contact. He should be viewed as a lead back who can also contribute to the passing game (35 receptions this season).

30. Boye Mafe, Edge

2025 team:Seattle Seahawks| Age entering 2026 season:29

What he brings:Mafe has a quick first step, which allows him to attack the edges of offensive tackles. His effort level and pursuit from the backside also lead to second-reaction sacks. Mafe can still refine his pass-rushing plan, but the traits are there to produce in a system that schemes favorable matchups out of multiple fronts. Mafe had two sacks and 33 pressures this season.

31. Isaac Seumalo, G

2025 team:Pittsburgh Steelers| Age entering 2026 season:32

What he brings:The 10-year veteran has the foot quickness to redirect defenders and the body control to wrestle back against power rushers. Seumalo's 97.3% pass rush win rate ranked second among 65 qualifying guards this season, and his 76.9% run block win rate checked in at fourth.

32. Reed Blankenship, S

2025 team:Philadelphia Eagles| Age entering 2026 season:27

What he brings:Blankenship can spin to the post, but he's at his best in split-field alignments, matching the seams and playing top-down on the ball. With nine interceptions over his four years with the Eagles, Blankenship makes plays from depth, plus he is a solid alley defender versus the run game.

33. Zion Johnson, G

2025 team:Los Angeles Chargers| Age entering 2026 season:26

What he brings:A young and durable interior blocker with movement traits, Johnson fits in both zone and gap run schemes. He is just entering his prime playing years, with a 90.7% pass block win rate over his four-year career.

34. Greg Newsome II, CB

2025 team:Jacksonville Jaguars| Age entering 2026 season:26

What he brings:Newsome has only four career interceptions, but he has created on-ball production with 33 pass breakups over five seasons. He has the tools to match in man coverage, but he's at his best in zone schemes that allow him to play with backfield vision. Newsome was traded to the Jaguars from the Browns on Oct. 8.

35. Connor McGovern, C

2025 team:Buffalo Bills| Age entering 2026 season:28

What he brings:A steady pass blocker in the middle of the front, McGovern has the mobility to climb and play in space versus linebackers. He had a 97.2% pass block win rate in 2025, which was tied for second among 31 qualifying centers.

36. David Edwards, G

2025 team:Buffalo Bills| Age entering 2026 season:29

What he brings:Edwards played option quarterback and basketball in high school, which gave him the light feet to redirect in pass protection or climb to space. He has played his best football as a pro over the past couple of seasons, and his 95% pass block win rate in 2025 ranked 12th among 65 qualifying guards.

37. Nahshon Wright, CB

2025 team:Chicago Bears| Age entering 2026 season:27

What he brings:A long, linear cornerback at 6-foot-4, 199 pounds, Wright had a career-best five interceptions in 2025. He took one back for a touchdown and also broke up seven passes. Though Wright lacks high-end recovery speed, his length, play instincts and production will increase his value for a defense that needs help in man coverage and Cover 2.

38. Joey Bosa, Edge

2025 team:Buffalo Bills| Age entering 2026 season:31

What he brings:Bosa has played in at least 14 games over the past two seasons after injuries limited him to a total of 13 games from 2022 to 2023. Averaging 36.3 snaps a game for the Bills, he had 5 sacks, 5 forced fumbles and 42 pressures. Bosa should be viewed as a situational rusher who can still win with speed-to-power. His effort level also leads to production late in the play.

39. Chig Okonkwo, TE

2025 team:Tennessee Titans| Age entering 2026 season:27

What he brings:At 6-foot-3, 238 pounds, Okonkwo can be schemed as a motion/movement player in the pass game. In addition to running seam and corner routes, Okonkwo gets loose on screens, crossers and unders. He caught 56 passes for 560 yards and two touchdowns this season, with 61.8% of his total receiving production coming after the catch. Elusive in space, he is a matchup piece for the right playcaller.

40. Wan'Dale Robinson, WR

2025 team:New York Giants| Age entering 2026 season:25

What he brings:A 5-foot-8, 185-pound slot receiver with the short-area speed to uncover, Robinson displayed more vertical ability this season for the Giants. He produced a career-best 14 receptions of 20 or more yards for New York, which was withoutMalik Nabersfor much of the season. With at least 92 receptions in each of his past two seasons, Robinson is a volume target who can work multiple levels between the numbers.

41. Kam Curl, S

2025 team:Los Angeles Rams| Age entering 2026 season:27

What he brings:A durable defender who has played in at least 16 games over his past three seasons, Curl can limit vertical throws in the deep areas of the field. He's also a strong tackler in the run front, finishing with a career-high 122 tackles this season (along with two interceptions and two sacks).

42. Joel Bitonio, G

2025 team:Cleveland Browns| Age entering 2026 season:34

What he brings:The 12-year pro has started 178 NFL games. He's a savvy technician who had a 96.4% pass block win rate in 2025 (third best among 65 qualifying guards), while allowing only two sacks. If Bitonio opts to return for a 13th season, he would provide both consistent play and a veteran voice to any offensive line room.

43. Cade Mays, C

2025 team:Carolina Panthers| Age entering 2026 season:27

What he brings:Mays has some athletic limitations, but his 6-foot-6 length and power put him in a position to win in pass protection. And he can displace defenders in the run game. Mays had a 94.3% pass block win rate this season, which ranked 20th out of 31 qualifying centers.

44. Jaquan Brisker, S

2025 team:Chicago Bears| Age entering 2026 season:27

What he brings:A downhill safety who creates disruption near the line of scrimmage, Brisker played in all 17 games this season after missing 12 in 2024 with a concussion. He's an alley filler who can blitz, plus he can play over the top in the deep half. In four seasons with the Bears, Brisker has had four interceptions, seven sacks and 14 pass breakups.

45. Leo Chenal, LB

2025 team:Kansas City Chiefs| Age entering 2026 season:25

What he brings:Chenal brings some versatility to any game plan as a defender who can play off-the-ball, insert into the front or even line up as a stand-up defensive tackle. Chenal is good at tracking the ball in the run game from the second level. In four seasons, he has recorded 193 total tackles, seven sacks and 28 pressures.

46. Rico Dowdle, RB

2025 team:Carolina Panthers| Age entering 2026 season:28

What he brings:Dowdle rushed for 1,076 yards this past season, and he had 26 carries of 10 or more yards. An explosive runner, he can work the edges or get vertical with the ball in zone schemes. And he gets up to top speed quickly. Dowdle also had 39 receptions for the Panthers this season, tying a career high.

47. Coby Bryant, S

2025 team:Seattle Seahawks| Age entering 2026 season:28

What he brings:An interchangeable safety with the vision to get a jump on the ball from depth, Bryant had four interceptions this season and a total of seven over his past two. A good fit as a deep half defender in a zone scheme, Bryant can also spin down to patrol the edges as a cutoff defender. There's some urgency to his game. Bryant has 7 interceptions, 2 forced fumbles and 5 passes broken up over his past two seasons.

48. Nakobe Dean, LB

2025 team:Philadelphia Eagles| Age entering 2026 season:25

What he brings:Dean bounced back from a knee injury in the 2024 playoffs to produce 4 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 55 total tackles in 10 games in 2025. He's the best blitzing linebacker in the league, arriving angry versus running backs in pass protection. And he has the pursuit speed to track the ball on the edges.

49. Kenneth Gainwell, RB

2025 team:Pittsburgh Steelers| Age entering 2026 season:25

What he brings:A change-of-pace runner, Gainwell caught a career-high 73 passes this season and was vital on third downs for Pittsburgh. He produces on backfield releases and can even draw positive matchups when flexed from the formation. Gainwell would fit a backfield rotation that caters to his dual-threat traits.

50. Alex Anzalone, LB

2025 team:Detroit Lions| Age entering 2026 season:31

What he brings:A nine-year veteran, Anzalone is quick to key the run game and can be schemed a blitzer. In coverage, Anzalone has the lateral quickness and eye discipline to match running backs in the pass game. He had 2.5 sacks and eight pass breakups in Detroit last season.

Just missed:

That goes for a back injury or a concussion.” And a different NFC defensive player: “I personally haven’t (tried to hide concussion symptoms) in the League.
But I feel like if it’s bad enough, you should let somebody know.” Our poll results only reflect players who said they tried to hide concussion symptoms since coming into the NFL.","This piece is part of The Athletic’s annual NFL anonymous player survey, covering a range of topics around the league.

Head injuries and the NFL’s concussion protocol are still polarizing topics among NFL players. More than a few were reluctant to engage in a discussion, even as part of our annual anonymous player survey. For instance, when asked if he had ever tried to hide concussion symptoms, one AFC offensive player responded he had not, before adding “and if I did, I wouldn’t disclose it to you.”

Data on concussions from the 2025 season is not yet available, but according to the NFL, concussions decreased 17 percent from 2023 to 2024, a 12 percent drop compared to the 2021 through 2023 seasons. As far as identifying concussions, league doctors “continue to evaluate 3-4 players for every concussion diagnosis.”

Players who answered our questions offered a wide range of thoughts.

“Yes, I’ve hid symptoms,” said an AFC offensive player who included that he did not regret doing so. “It’s all in your head. Concussions are all in your head.”

A different AFC offensive player: “Sometimes you go lights-out for a second. You just have to play it off. Get in the huddle.”

Conversely, an NFC offensive player: “Guys are stupid if they do that. We don’t mess with brains.”

And an NFC defensive player: “Hell no. I would never do that. If my s— isn’t feeling good, I’ll tell you and (leave) the game.”

There were more nuanced takes.

“For sure (I’ve tried to hide concussion symptoms),” said an NFC defensive player. “Football is about availability more than ability. You want to be available. You can hide certain symptoms and you’re going to hide whatever you can to be out there. I know it’s shameful to say.”

An AFC offensive player: “I think there's a gray area with guys who know they got their bell rung or just want to stay in and don't want to see the doctor versus actually trying to hide symptoms. I think even the ‘toughest’ guys know how brutal this game is and don't want to add extra risk. I think once you're in the league for a few years, you learn more about the fine line between 'OK, I can play through this,' and 'Oh, s---, I'm really hurt.' That goes for a back injury or a concussion.”

And a different NFC defensive player: “I personally haven’t (tried to hide concussion symptoms) in the League. I think there are levels to concussions. You feel a little dizzy and you don’t know if it’s a concussion or not, and you’re trying not to alarm anybody. But I feel like if it’s bad enough, you should let somebody know.”

Our poll results only reflect players who said they tried to hide concussion symptoms since coming into the NFL. If the results included players who said they did so at a lower level of football, such as high school or college, then 26 percent of our respondents admitted to hiding concussion symptoms at some point in their football past.

Of those who said they have hidden concussion symptoms and answered a follow-up question about whether they regretted it: Eight said they had no regrets, while one said he did.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/26112321/AP23332510581793-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-28 08:00:04.953062

And at this point, it's impossible to know which players are under consideration, but there are already mock drafts out there in the world, so we'll start taking a look at them.

The Panthers have seven total selections this year, and you can see all of their picks here, and we'll keep you posted on all the latest at Panthers.com.

Sadiq is the best tight end in the draft, and it's not close. He can run, block well and has great hands. His eight receiving touchdowns were the most of any tight end in FBS, making him a big-time red zone threat, as well.

Carolina could go with a defensive player here, but quarterback Bryce Young has taken a huge step this year. A lot of that progress has to do with the addition of wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan in last year's draft. Expect the Panthers to continue to give their young QB offensive weapons.

Carolina took a big step forward on defense (and overall) this season, but there's a looming void in the middle. Christian Rozeboom is a free agent, and the Panthers could use a three-down middle linebacker to step in. Allen is a read-and-react player who sees it and goes. In 2025, Allen had 97 tackles. He also can chip in with the pass rush, and you'll see him drop in coverage on tape.

The Panthers went from 5-12 in 2024 to NFC South champions at 8-9 this season. Nailing this pick could be important in defending that title and making more noise in the playoffs next season.

The Panthers address their linebacker group here by grabbing the rangy Styles. The Buckeyes 'backer brings a scintillating combination of athleticism and length, and he's always around the ball. Styles racked up 21.5 tackles for loss, nine sacks, nine passes defensed, and three forced fumbles over the past three seasons for Ohio State. He's comfortable in space, can play both the pass and the run, and is explosive when closing on the ballcarrier.

The Panthers have the second-worst pass-rushing grade in the NFL this season. After selecting Nic Scourton in the second round last year to help fix that problem, Carolina will take another Texas A&M edge rusher here in Howell. His 12 sacks are tied for fourth among all edge defenders in America this year.

Carolina has greater weaknesses than wide receiver and has invested significant draft capital into the position to little avail beyond Tetairoa McMillan. Makai Lemon is a smaller slot receiver who is grounded through the catch, a complement to McMillan's skill set.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/ngvhriwqjcv1gx5fg3pt,N,,2026-01-28 14:27:46.202276

When asked about Maye’s status by reporters, head coach Mike Vrabel did his best Matrix impression the way he dodged questions about Maye suffering a right shoulder injury during the title game.

“No, I wouldn’t say that anybody hurt anything… Everybody, including Drake, is not 100%.”

Speculation has been circulating that Maye might have injured his right shoulder during a scrambling play in the third quarter of Sunday’s game. Vrabel didn’t make anything of it publicly, although Maye did mention bumps and bruises after the game.

While it doesn’t sound like anything major, this will be something to keep an eye on as we get closer to the game. Maye has been durable, starting in all 17 games for the Patriots this season along with three playoff games to get to Super Bowl LX.

New England will be looking to cap off a resurrection campaign by winning the franchise's seventh Vince Lombardi trophy. That would make the Patriots the leader among all NFL teams, breaking the current tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Having endured a seven-year spell without a single postseason win the NFL’s most successful franchise are back in the championship game. Young quarterback Drake Maye is looking to follow in Tom Brady’s footsteps by winning the Super Bowl in his first season as a starter.

Maye has exceeded all expectations this season but may have picked up an injury at a crucial moment. Speaking after last weekend’s AFC Championship Game, former NFL team doctor David J. Chao suggested that Maye is carrying an injury.

“There is no question in my mind that Drake Maye injured his right throwing shoulder against the Denver Broncos,” Chao said. “Of course, how bad is the injury remains to be seen.”

Is Drake Maye injured?

If Chao’s analysis is correct and Maye really did pick up a throwing shoulder injury, it would represent a cruel turn of fate for the QB after a breakthrough season. On Tuesday Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel was pressed on the claims and was non-committal about Maye’s fitness.

“There’s not a player on our team that’s 100% healthy,” Vrabel said. “I would imagine we’ll go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in. But nobody’s 100%. This will be our 21st game.”

Vrabel continued: “This is a sport where there’s gonna be things that come up. We’ll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we’re required to. We understand that. We were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football so that’s kinda where everybody’s at.”

Nixon, who signed with Green Bay as a free agent in 2022 after spending his first three seasons with the Oakland/Las Vegas Raiders, is the only cornerback in the league to appear in all 17 games and post an INT in each of the last four seasons (2022-25).",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/nuwccvffmxlp9hgyv2ip,N,,2026-01-28 02:59:10.091352

The only proven, secured safety is Bell, and that means the position needs some serious attention this offseason.","FRISCO, Texas – With the 2025 regular season now behind the Cowboys, it's time to look ahead to 2026, where they'll try to get back into the playoffs for the first time since 2023.

As they begin to do so, our ""What's Next"" series will examine each position on the roster and look at the past, present and future of the room and the players within it. We'll continue the series with the safeties:

Past: If Darren Woodson doesn't get named to the Hall of Fame this year, we riot. Once again, the legendary Cowboys' safety is a finalist to be entered into Canton, but time will tell if he gets the knock at his door this time around or if he'll be snubbed, an egregious error in judgment toward a player that literally changed the entire NFL as it relates to how safeties are used nowadays.

And Woodson is just one part of the legacy at the position in Dallas, a list much too long to list in only a few words, but it includes names like Bill Bates, Charlie Waters, Mel Renfro, Cliff Harris, Roy Williams and Randy Hughes. There is no getting around the fact there's a standard to be upheld at safety in Dallas, but it's been a long time since it's reached these heights.

Present: There is much to figure out here, Cowboys. Kudos for finally coming into the present era and understanding the importance of the position, thanks to the Dan Quinn era that added Malik Hooker. That said, Hooker had a tough 2025 campaign that was mostly muddied by injury, and Donovan Wilson struggled to do what Matt Eberflus wanted; and largely because it was the opposite of what he made a name for himself doing: namely, being a downhill heat-seeking missile and not a pure cover guy.

The backups didn't fare much better, with promising young safety Juanyeh Thomas losing his season to debilitating migraines and Markquese Bell flashing, but doing most of his best work on special teams as he, too, struggled under the previous defensive regime. There's still younger talent that barely saw the field defensively, but do show some promise for later on.

Future: Alijah Clark immediately comes to mind here. The undrafted rookie went viral in 2025 for his effort on special teams, a hard-hitting, take-no-prisoners player who could get more of a look in Year 2 under Christian Parker. Zion Childress remains in Dallas on a futures deal and his versatility to drop down into nickel coverage could come in handy, while Julius Wood provides another power-punch at the position, and like Clark, is also trying to prove himself as an undrafted player from last year.

That's a lot to pin on such unproven youth though, but the Cowboys may not have much of a choice, assuming the position isn't addressed in free agency. Wilson is a free agent. Thomas is a restricted free agent that is working to put his migraines behind him. Hooker's three-year deal concludes after 2026, a season in which he'll hit the team's salary cap for $8.9 million.

As the 2025–26 NFL season comes to a close, free agency is coming into focus, and teams are beginning to evaluate potential targets to address roster deficiencies. Here are the top offensive tackles slated to hit free agency in 2026.

For now, each player’s profile includes three-year snap counts and three-year PFF grades, offering a broader, more stable view of performance than a single-season spike or dip.

Click here for PFF's full list of the top 250 free agents.

1. Rasheed Walker, Green Bay Packers

Snaps: 3,170 | PFF grade: 69.8

Walker will need to clean up his run blocking, where he earned no better than a 56.3 PFF grade in any of the past three seasons, but the team that signs him (or re-signs him) will look forward to getting a relatively consistent left tackle in pass protection.

2. Jermaine Eluemunor, New York Giants

Snaps: 2,918 | PFF grade: 70.8

Despite a disastrous 2025 season in New York that included the midseason firing of Brian Daboll, Jermaine Eluemunor was a clear bright spot along the Giants' offensive line. New York ranked fifth in PFF pass-blocking grade, with Eluemunor playing a central role. He sits 16th among qualified tackles in pass-blocking grade (76.8) since 2024 and is tied for seventh in pressure rate allowed (4.3%). He has also graded in the 74th percentile on true pass sets and the 79th percentile overall as a pass-blocker over the past two seasons.

3. Braxton Jones, ChicagoBears

Snaps: 1,653 | PFF grade: 74.6

Jones played just 210 snaps in 2025 after suffering a knee injury in Week 4, but he was effective when healthy in prior action. As a starter in 2024, he earned an 80.8 PFF pass-blocking grade and a 70.2 PFF run-blocking grade. While the 26-year-old will need to improve his pressure-to-sack conversion rate, his track record could still warrant a starting opportunity.

4. Rob Havenstein, Los Angeles Rams

Snaps: 2,180 | PFF grade: 76.9

Havenstein appeared in just seven games during the 2025 season after dealing with an ankle injury, but he was more consistent in the years prior. From 2020 to 2024, the Rams' right tackle earned an overall PFF grade of 86.1 along with a 90.2 PFF run-blocking mark. While the 33-year-old has been less effective in pass protection, he could still draw interest as a starting option on the edge.

As Drake Maye and the Patriots begin their prep work for Super Bowl LX, the 23-year-old quarterback’s health has now become an early storyline before the team makes the trek to Santa Clara this weekend.

Several doctors on social media — including former Chargers team doctor David Chao — noted over the weekend that Maye might have injured his shoulder during Sunday’s victory over the Broncos in the AFC championship game.

Speaking during his weekly appearance on “WEEI Afternoons” on Tuesday, Maye downplayed talk of being hindered by any sort of physical ailment.

“I’m feeling good. We’ve got some extra rest. I don’t think it’s from the game. I think it’s just the buildup of throwing, including training camp, 30 weeks straight of throwing and four days a week. It can add up,” Maye said. “But I got some extra rest and I’m feeling good and ready to go for the Super Bowl.”

While Maye brushed aside any discourse regarding his shoulder, he was candid when asked if he might be limited during practices over these next two weeks — be it at Foxborough or in California.

“I think it’s too early to say,” Maye said of his practice status ahead of a Feb. 8 showdown with the Seahawks at Levi’s Stadium.

“Right now I’m feeling good and looking forward to getting out there and preparing for the Seahawks and prepping to get ready to go,” he added.

Maye and the Patriots’ passing game labored on Sunday in Denver, with the MVP candidate completing 10-of-21 throws for 86 yards.

He still avoided any turnovers and used his legs (65 rushing yards) to both score New England’s lone touchdown and ice the game in the fourth quarter with a 3rd-and-6 scamper.

But, if the Patriots want to close out its improbable turnaround season with a Lombardi Trophy, it’s going to need more from an offense that is averaging just 18.0 points per game this postseason.

According to Chao, Maye appeared to hurt his shoulder in the third quarter of Sunday’s win at Empower Field at Mile High after being tackled by Denver linebacker Talanoa Hufanga.

Maye slammed his right shoulder in the ground at the end of the play and was spotted rotating his shoulder and adjusting his shoulder pads after getting off the gridiron.

Two plays later, Maye completed one of New England’s most explosive plays on an otherwise quiet evening for the offense — connecting with Mack Hollins on a 31-yard gain off a flea flicker.

Maye also didn’t seem worse for wear in the fourth quarter — stiff-arming Jonah Ellis on the seven-year run that moved the chains and allowed New England to run out the clock.

Speaking on WEEI Tuesday morning, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel said that none of New England’s players — Maye included — were completely healthy at this stage of the NFL calendar.

During a press conference with the media later that morning, Vrabel was again asked if Maye is healthy in the lead-up to Super Bowl LX.

“No, I wouldn’t say that anybody hurt anything,” Vrabel said. “Again, this is a sport where there’s going to be things that come up.

“We’ll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we’re required to, we understand that, but we were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football, so that’s kind of where everybody is at.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/UDOVNSDR52UKKDBPHEDCCOYUUU-6979335376978-768x432.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 00:59:30.863407

Star quarterback Drake Maye, the team’s second-year MVP candidate is injured, and worse, it is an injury to his throwing shoulder.

That’s the headline. But the full story is a whole lot murkier, based not on news coming from the Patriots or from Maye’s camp or even anyone directly connected to the NFL. It’s based on speculation from well-known orthopedic surgeon Dr. David Chao, who was the Chargers‘ team doctor for 17 years. Dr. Chao has turned his expertise into a cottage industry on social media, speculating about injuries in the NFL in real-time.

And he created a firestorm for obvious reasons by saying in an online video, “There’s no question Drake Maye has a right shoulder injury.”

But there has been ample push-back on that notion since.

Patriots Don’t See Drake Maye Injury as an Issue

Patriots insider Greg Bedard of The Boston Sports Journal, did not rule out the idea that Maye might have done some damage to his shoulder during the Denver win, but added that the injury is insignificant, if it exists at all. From Bedard on Twitter/X on Monday night: “The information that I have at this moment is that any Maye ‘injury’ to his throwing shoulder is not believed to be an issue.”

The play in question occurred late in the third quarter when Maye was tackled by safety Talanoa Hufanga after a 13-yard run. Maye landed on his right shoulder on the play and came up grabbing at his right shoulder pad, which Dr. Chao signaled was evidence of pain in the shoulder.

But it also signals a player adjusting his pads after being tackled. In a video about Dr. Chao’s video, Dr. Brian Sutterer pointed out that Maye also tugged his left shoulder pad, suggesting he was simply getting his uniform straightened out.

And for a quarterback who just suffered a shoulder injury, a strange thing happened two plays later. Maye hit wide receiver Mack Hollins on his best throw of a the day, a 31-yard completion that set up a Patriots field-goal try.

Conditions Cut Back on Passing in AFC Championship

Certainly, the Patriots sent Maye out on more designed runs than the team might have expected coming into the game, but that was dictated by the drastic change in conditions as the game went on, with snow falling, wind gusting and ball protection at a premium. Maye threw just one pass in the fourth quarter, an incompletion.

Coach Mike Vrabel said the conditions changed badly shortly before Maye supposedly suffered the shoulder injury.

“I would say halfway through the third quarter,” Vrabel said. “I think when we got that field goal. Again, I wish it would have been able to be a touchdown, but it wasn’t. Then it just kept getting worse and worse and worse. Our defense was playing really good. We were able to do just enough offensively to give them a break, even kicking a football and the operation, that stuff is things that you can’t really replicate back home.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2258167526-e1769520885685.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-28 08:00:21.732380

Kamara has approximately $67.4 million in career earnings through the end of the 2025 season.

“Given Kamara’s age and price point, New Orleans can’t expect to get more than a conditional late-round pick in return,” Bleacher Report’s Kristopher Knox wrote. “However, they may not need to go far to find a trade partner. The Denver Broncos may need a back to pair with RJ Harvey, as J.K. Dobbins is slated to be a free agent. Kamara, of course, spent a good chunk of his career under former Saints and current Broncos head coach Sean Payton.”

What Kamara Could Bring to the Table

When healthy, Kamara can still be a game changer.

That’s something the Broncos have sorely been missing throughout Payton’s first 3 seasons, save for the 10 games Dobbins played in 2025, when he was on pace to become Denver’s first 1,000-yard rusher since 2019.

Dobbins, it’s worth pointing out, should have his own options in free agency if he wants to go elsewhere, although he’s already expressed a desire to stay in Denver.

Even with his 2025 season factored into the mix — where he had career lows almost across the board — Kamara still has 17-game averages of 1,646 yards of total offense and 12 total touchdowns over his 9-year career.

Bringing Kamara in for the final year of his contract to play for the coach with which he had the most success seems like a risk the Broncos should be willing to take.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2179059132.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780,N,,2026-01-27 23:00:01.395875

January 31, 2026: Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. This has consistently been a key event for the Rams' pre-draft process; tight end Terrance Ferguson, outside linebacker Josaiah Stewart and running back Jarquez Hunter were participants in last year's event.

February/March

February 3, 2026: Pro Bowl Games in San Francisco. The Rams had four players selected to the Pro Bowl: quarterback Matthew Stafford, wide receiver Puka Nacua and outside linebackers Jared Verse and Byron Young.

February 17–March 3, 2026, 1 p.m. pacific time: Window for teams to designate franchise or transition players. It would be a surprise if the Rams use either of these tags, considering they have not used the transition tag since placing it on safety Lamarcus Joyner in 2018.

February 23, 2026-March 2, 2026: NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Ind. Los Angeles owns the 13th (via Atlanta) and 29th overall picks in the first round of this year's draft.

March 9-11: Legal negotiating period. Starting 9 a.m. pacific time March 9 and ending 12:59:59 p.m. pacific time March 11, teams are allowed to contact and negotiate with certified agents of players who will become unrestricted free agents when their contract expires on March 12, 1 p.m. pacific time (the start of the new league year).

“I’m feeling good. … I don’t think it’s from the game,” he said. “I think it’s just the buildup of throwing, including training camp, 30 weeks straight of throwing and four days a week. It can add up. But I got some extra rest and I’m feeling good and ready to go for the Super Bowl.”

He said it was “too early to tell” whether he might be limited in any practices leading up to the Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 8. The Patriots return to practice on Thursday.

“I think that everybody, including Drake, is not 100 percent at this part of the year,” coach Mike Vrabel said. “We’ll do everything that we can to help our players be prepared and get ready for this game.”

Maye went 10 of 21 for 86 yards against the Broncos. He also ran 10 times for 65 yards and a touchdown. The second-year QB has not missed a game this season.

Neither the Patriots nor Vrabel reported any injury sustained by Maye during Sunday’s game.

“I wouldn’t say that anybody hurt anything. Again, this is a sport where there’s going to be things that come up.,” Vrabel said. “We’ll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we’re required to. We understand that. But we were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football. So, that’s kind of where everybody’s at.”

Day 1: Takeaway | QBs | Risers | Notes

Shrine Bowl observations

Tuesday's biggest takeaway

The defensive line class stood out on Day 1. With many of the perceived top players at the position not participating in the Senior Bowl -- only two players (Zion Young, Lee Hunter) in my overall my top 32 are here -- there's an opportunity for risers to increase their draft stock, as there are fewer elite prospects to distract scouts. That's the case for this deep group of defensive linemen.

On Tuesday, Young, Hunter, Caleb Banks (Florida) and T.J. Parker (Clemson) all looked like top-40 players in a class with average talent. But the 2026 class is lacking overall, which could put those four closer to the overall top 25 given their standout play in the first practice session. Hunter was the best player I saw on the field throughout two practices (more on that later), but Parker and Young both won consistently with power and length while using speed to close on the ball in team sessions. And Banks, who is returning from a season-ending foot injury, was as impactful as expected. You're going to hear a lot about this defensive line class in the next three months. Tuesday was a great introduction. -- Miller

Tuesday's best quarterback performance

Tuesday's top performance belonged to Cole Payton (North Dakota State). The lefty passer had two of the most impressive throws of the day, the best coming off a bootleg on a deep ball to Caleb Douglas (Texas Tech). Having played in under-center at North Dakota State, Payton looked comfortable taking snaps and making throws from multiple pre-snap platforms. Even though he has a bit of an elongated and loopy throwing motion, it didn't have a negative effect on his timing.

Payton displayed his accuracy and mobility in multiple sessions. Payton suffered a broken thumb on his throwing hand during the Bison's loss in the FCS playoffs. He showed no signs of that injury. Payton carries grades as early as Round 4, as he's a big athlete that some teams have mentioned as a project worth selecting on Day 3. -- Reid

Day 1 standout prospects

Colton Hood, CB, Tennessee

All eyes were on Hood, my top-ranked player at the Senior Bowl, and he stepped up Tuesday. He showed patience and confidence in one-on-one settings, turning and running with opposing receivers with ease while not being beaten once. The 5-foot-11, 188-pound junior was my No. 18-ranked player entering the week and solidified his status as the best player in Mobile throughout position drills and team settings. The Buccaneers, Jets and Lions all look like strong landing spots for him in the middle of Round 1. -- Miller

Lee Hunter, DT, Texas Tech

I'm always looking for that ""wow"" first impression at all-star games and Hunter delivered it during team drills Tuesday. Lining up as a 1-technique, Hunter absolutely demolished an interior offensive lineman with his first-step power, rocking back the blocker's shoulders and easily gaining ground. That backs up what we saw on tape during Texas Tech's run to the CFP this season. The 6-foot-4, 325-pound Hunter currently ranks No. 29 on my board and boosted his stock even more on Tuesday. --Miller

Ted Hurst, WR, Georgia State

Given that he played at a small school, this week provides a unique opportunity for Hurst. The lengthy wideout (6-foot-3, 207 pounds) made one of the better highlights of the day with a one-handed sideline grab. Hurst's fluidity, especially given his size, has scouts intrigued. He's a strong run-after-catch player, too. With a strong predraft showing, Hurst could move up into the third round from his current spot, which I view as early on Day 3. -- Yates

T.J. Parker, Edge, Clemson

Viewed as one of the nation's top defenders entering the season, Parker didn't have the season many envisioned, with his sack total falling from 11 in 2024 to five last season. Parker took a positive step toward reviving his draft prospects on the first day of practice Tuesday, as the 6-foot-3, 265-pounder displayed lots of power in his hands. That strength was present throughout multiple periods of practice. Scouts view Parker as a top-40 prospect who could sneak into the back end of Round 1. -- Reid

Keylan Rutledge, IOL, Georgia Tech

After playing guard exclusively during his career at Georgia Tech, the 6-foot-4, 320-pound Rutledge took snaps at center throughout practice Tuesday. Rutledge showed comfort with snapping the ball and demonstrated that he can play any spot along the interior, answering one of the biggest questions scouts had about him entering the Senior Bowl. -- Reid

Quick-hitters from Day 1

Miller:

Offensive linemen usually start Senior Bowl week slowly while defensive linemen explode onto the scene with speed and power. It's best to allow offensive linemen to settle in, and that's what happened with Beau Stephens (Iowa). The guard prospect had a rough rep against Hunter early before settling down and winning with leverage and power against Zane Durant (Penn State) and others in one-on-ones. Stephens is a Day 3 prospect but showed impressive poise Tuesday.

Speaking of Durant, I must single him out for his Day 1 performance. The 6-foot-1, 290-pound defensive tackle won consistently at 3-technique with quickness and leverage throughout the practice against a good group of interior linemen. Durant currently sits as an early Day 3 player on my board but looked more like a top-100 prospect in his initial practice.

Reid:

Edge rusher Nadame Tucker (Western Michigan) caught my eye multiple times Tuesday. Opportunities like this are important for small-school prospects because they present major tests against high-level competition. The 6-foot-3, 250-pound Tucker entered the week as one of the event's lesser-known names but opened many eyes during the first day of practice. He could interest teams looking for a midround pass rusher.

Wide receiver Malachi Fields (Notre Dame) was the best offensive player on the American team on Day 1. Officially measuring 6-foot-4, 218 pounds, Fields used his frame well. He was challenged multiple times at the line of scrimmage during one-on-ones against the corners. His physicality showed up, and he was able to fight through jam attempts prior to making strong catches. Fields carries a mixture of mid-to-late Day 2 grades as a prospect who continues to trend upward.

Wide receiver Kevin Coleman Jr. (Missouri) quietly had a strong first day. A well-traveled prospect, he started his career at Jackson State (2022) before transferring to Louisville (2023) and Mississippi State (2024) before landing at Missouri. Coleman is a smooth route runner who spent time on the outside and in the slot during practice. He also looked comfortable fielding punts on a chilly and windy day. In speaking to scouts, Coleman is primarily viewed as an early-to-mid Day 3 prospect, which is where I also have him currently.

Yates:

Edge rusher Zion Young (Missouri) brought ferocious energy to the one-on-ones, as he showed the power that made him a great college player. Young wins with knock-back power and length as a rusher, which he used to land an offensive tackle on his back in a one-on-one rep. I think Young will go early in Round 2.

Gennings Dunker is the next in a long line of talented Iowa offensive linemen, and I liked what I saw from him in pass protection Tuesday. Dunker showed good lateral agility and the length to ward off edge rushers, plus a toughness and finish on his reps (as well as an off-the-charts mullet). He's another Day 2 prospect for me.

Shrine Bowl observations

I spent three days at the Shrine Bowl last week and the talent didn't disappoint. Cornerback Avery Smith (Toledo) was the week's biggest winner. He had no problem with the bump in competition, showing that he was capable of playing press man and in zone coverage. The 5-foot-10, 185-pound Smith was the prospect scouts were buzzing about the most and might have played his way into the top 100.

Offensive lineman Brian Parker II (Duke) also stood out. After spending last season at left tackle, the 6-foot-5, 300-pound Parker played center at Shrine Bowl practices, showing strong hands and a balanced base. He was viewed as a Day 3 prospect entering the event but boosted his stock and could go as early as Round 3.

On the quarterback front, Cade Klubnik (Clemson) recovered from a subpar Day 1 and had a strong final two days of practice. A streaky thrower, the 6-foot-2, 210-pound Klubnik had multiple excellent throws during the team portions of practice. He showed plenty of emotion after each impressive throw and certainly helped his standing. Opinions remained mixed on where Klubnik will go. Some scouts had third-round grades on him, but there were others who saw him as a mid-Day 3 passer. -- Reid

Maye appeared on WEEI Afternoons on Tuesday and affirmed that he is healthy following speculation that he suffered a shoulder ailment in the Patriots' 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos.

""I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good.

In an attempt to solidify the win, Maye stiff-armed Broncos linebacker Jonah Elliss while heading for the out-of-bounds line on third down with 1:51 to go in the fourth quarter. The first down gain allowed New England to punch their ticket to the Super Bowl.

Pro football doctor David Chao said in the aftermath of New England's win that the AP NFL MVP finalist injured his shoulder on the play. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel later stated that the injury talk was ""probably"" overblown when speaking with media members on Tuesday.

“I am far more concerned about Drake May’s right shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique heading into the Super Bowl.","Drake Maye’s Super Bowl status is under scrutiny after the Patriots QB clutched his throwing shoulder in the AFC Championship. While no official diagnosis has been released, NFL doctors suggest a possible sprain rather than a serious tear. His season-low passing numbers added to concern, leaving New England cautiously waiting as the Super Bowl approaches.

The New England Patriots are celebrating another playoff breakthrough, but inside the organization, concern has quietly replaced confidence. It was all focus on Drake Maye in the AFC Championship when all focus was not on the scoreboard, but the rookie quarter back Drake Maye had his throwing shoulder after being hit. The time was short, but its effect has been long since the last whistle. With the Super Bowl approaching, the Patriots are walking a fine line between optimism and uncertainty. Maye finished the game without leaving the field, yet his body language told a different story. Coaches have remained cautious, and medical silence from the team has only fueled speculation. Now, outside experts are stepping in to fill the information gap.

Medical experts weigh in as concern grows around Drake Maye

The timing could not be more delicate. Maye enters the biggest game of his young career with questions surrounding his health, his protection, and whether his shoulder can handle another four quarters under pressure. One of the first detailed evaluations came from Dr. Jesse Morse, who reviewed the play and offered cautious reassurance while outlining real risks. “Most likely possibilities: posterior capsular sprain or superior/posterior labral tear (10-11 o’clock) I think he got lucky, and it’s likely a sprain especially since he threw a dime 2 plays later to Mack Hollins,” Dr. Jesse Morse wrote on X. “Is he sore? Yes Did he significantly dislocate his shoulder? No, unlikely This isn’t the mechanism for an AC sprain.” While that assessment suggests Maye avoided serious structural damage, his performance afterward raised fresh concerns. He completed just 10 passes for 86 yards, his lowest output of the season. The Patriots still advanced, but the drop in efficiency was impossible to ignore. Former NFL team physician Dr. David Chao offered a more cautious perspective, comparing Maye’s situation to the opposing quarterback’s health. “I am far more concerned about Drake May’s right shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique heading into the Super Bowl. I’m not saying Drake May won’t play, and I’m not saying this is a season-ending issue,” Dr. Davis Chao said. “I’m saying that, as of Monday — nearly two weeks before the Super Bowl — the concern level is much higher for Drake May’s throwing shoulder than it is for Sam Darnold’s oblique.” For now, the Patriots are buying time with rest and limited disclosure. Whether that shoulder responds remains the defining question heading into football’s biggest stage.

During the Broncos' AFC Championship Game appearance, Nix cheered his team on from an Empower Field at Mile High suite — and Head Coach Sean Payton knows how difficult that must have been for Denver's quarterback.

""I'm sure there's disappointment for him to have to watch,"" Payton said Tuesday. ""… I think it's difficult. … I think it's difficult to get as far as he brought us — and then maybe to see also one of his contemporaries [in Drake Maye], someone in his draft class, that he would've loved to [have] competed against [to] advance. It can be a tough game.""

But as Nix recovers from surgery on his ankle — an injury Payton said doctors determined ""was coming sooner than later"" — and looks toward a return, his teammates believe the untimely end to his season could end up spurring him to future success.

""I can only imagine what this is going to do to fuel him,"" inside linebacker Alex Singleton said Monday.

Payton often mentions that confidence develops from demonstrated ability, and it's clear the Broncos' belief in their quarterback stems from the success he's helped Denver achieve in his first two seasons.

In 2025, the Broncos tied a franchise record for regular-season wins, earned their first division title in a decade and captured the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Nix led all NFL quarterbacks in game-winning drives in 2025, and he also posted six fourth-quarter comebacks including the postseason.

In a Divisional Round duel against the Bills' top-ranked passing defense, Nix threw for three touchdowns and delivered a go-ahead strike to Marvin Mims Jr. in the final minutes of regulation.

Time and time again, Nix has delivered. His teammates have certainly noticed — even if they can't always believe it.

""He's special,"" safety Talanoa Hufanga said Monday. ""There's a reason why I wore a shirt with him on it. I want him to feel the confidence that I have in him. [He's] a dude that just goes out there and, regardless of the situation — you guys all saw it all year — it's these fourth quarters and this dude pulls this game out, and you're just like, 'How does he do it?'""

Through Nix's first two seasons, there are a slew of impressive stats at which to point. He joined Peyton Manning and Justin Herbert as the only players in NFL history with at least 3,500 passing yards and 25 passing touchdowns in each of their first two seasons. He's only the third Broncos quarterback in franchise history with three passing touchdowns in a playoff game. Only Dan Marino and Patrick Mahomes have more games with four-plus passing touchdowns over their first two seasons.

And yet, the most impressive stats have to do with winning football games.

""I just think you evaluate a quarterback by how much he wins,"" General Manager George Paton said Tuesday. ""And there's been no quarterback in his first two years who's won more than Bo. We can just start there.""

Nix's 24 regular-season wins are tied for the most in NFL history in a player's first two seasons, and he posted more wins in 2025 than any quarterback has in a single season in franchise history.

Those numbers stem from Nix's late-game heroics, which Paton said could be counted on but cannot necessarily be taught.

""It got to the point where we're behind and Bo had the ball, and we're like, 'OK, we're going to win this,'"" Paton said. ""You can look at all the traits for quarterbacks: their arm strength, their accuracy, all that. … He has that 'It' factor. I don't think you can teach that. Either you have it, or you don't — and he has it. So, wow. [After] two years, we have a quarterback that can win, win at a high level. He's best in the big moments. We've seen that. Does he have areas to improve? Yes, like all quarterbacks. But if you have a quarterback that has that 'It' factor that's best in the big moments, that's pretty big.""

As Nix rehabs from his injury and looks to return for Year 3, those around him know they have the right player at the game's most important position.

""That's the guy you want at the helm,"" Singleton said. ""There's teams around the league that are fighting to find a guy to play that position, and we've found one. That's the biggest thing, is having a guy who can do that week in and week out, and he's shown that he's able to do that.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/broncos/ydsymvb5buc4mk9jjaki,N,,2026-01-27 19:01:51.703447

Daboll was fired on November 10, hours after the Giants' 24-20 loss to the Chicago Bears, which saw them blow a 20-10 fourth quarter lead and rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart sustain a concussion after previously being evaluated on three separate occasions since taking over as a starter.

From a personal perspective, a reporter asked, does he want Aaron Rodgers back as his quarterback?
The ability to develop quarterbacks was a key trait Steelers' brass wanted in their next head coach.
McCarthy, who is just the fourth Steelers' head coach since 1969 and the only one in that span from an offensive background, said he will call the plays with his new team.
""We came into this wanting to hire the best coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers,"" Rooney said.","PITTSBURGH -- Less than 10 minutes into the Mike McCarthy era of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the franchise's new head coach had to address the elephant in the room.

From a personal perspective, a reporter asked, does he want Aaron Rodgers back as his quarterback?

""That's nice the way he asked that,"" a chuckling McCarthy said to the question. ""I mean definitely. I don't see why you wouldn't. ... I have spoken to Aaron, and so that's really where we are there, but I was able to sit back and watch the games and watch most of the Pittsburgh games on TV and I thought he was a great asset for the team.""

The 62-year-old coach acknowledged that Rodgers, like other veteran players, needed time to decompress and make a decision on his future, but the coach embraced the idea of reuniting with the quarterback with whom he spent 13 seasons in Green Bay and won a Super Bowl title.

""I think that's very important,"" McCarthy said of players like Rodgers taking a break. ""The game is so emotional, what these men commit to, and what they put into it. I think that time away is important.""

Speaking at his introductory news conference Tuesday, McCarthy said he and general manager Omar Khan haven't discussed a timeline or a deadline for Rodgers' decision as they ramp up NFL draft preparation. The position appears similar to a year ago when Rodgers weighed his options until signing a one-year contract in June.

Facing uncertainty at the quarterback position entering the 2025 NFL draft, the Steelers opted to wait until the sixth round before selecting Ohio State quarterback Will Howard. The rookie spent most of the season on injured reserve after sustaining a broken finger in his throwing hand during what started as a promising training camp.

McCarthy said Tuesday he was impressed with Howard, who helped the Buckeyes to a national championship.

""I'm really excited about Will Howard,"" McCarthy said. ""He's someone that I thought really came on there at Ohio State. I'm anxious to work with him. It'd be great to have Aaron back. But Will and Mason [Rudolph], I'm really, really excited to get started with those guys.""

Before getting his first offensive coordinator job in New Orleans in 2000, McCarthy, a Pittsburgh native, got his start working with quarterbacks, something he picked up as a graduate assistant under the guidance of Paul Hackett, then the head coach at Pitt. Since then, McCarthy has helped with the development of quarterbacks including Rodgers and Dak Prescott.

""The quarterback position, to me, is a huge challenge because you don't have the individual time that the other positions have,"" McCarthy said about his process. ""But really finding time, being efficient with your workload capacity and making sure those guys get the fundamental training. So just never really deviating from the old school way that has worked for decades.""

The ability to develop quarterbacks was a key trait Steelers' brass wanted in their next head coach.

""With everybody we talked to, the conversation of developing the next quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers was part of it,"" Khan said. ""I think Mike's resume speaks for itself, who he's been around, but we're excited about working with Will, and that was a part of it.""

McCarthy, who is just the fourth Steelers' head coach since 1969 and the only one in that span from an offensive background, said he will call the plays with his new team. And he said the past 48 hours have been ""fluid"" as he builds his coaching staff.

Though the Steelers' past three head coaches were all young, defensive assistants without head coach experience, Art Rooney II said he wasn't necessarily searching for someone in that mold this time around. The team also brought in defensive coordinators Brian Flores and Anthony Weaver for in-person interviews before landing on McCarthy, reaching a verbal agreement with the coach on Saturday.

""We came into this wanting to hire the best coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers,"" Rooney said. ""So, we did not say we're trying to hire a young defensive coordinator or offensive guy. We had an open mind about it, I think, just wanted to make sure we found the best coach, and we were able to interview some great coaches.

""I won't say it was an easy decision, but I would say at the end of the day, it was an obvious decision for us that Mike was the guy for the job.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0127%2Fr1606454_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 18:02:40.750428

Shortly after the game, Payton told reporters about Nix's injury and that the quarterback would miss the rest of the season.

Nix is expected to be out at least 12 weeks after undergoing surgery. He reportedly will not be allowed to put any weight on his ankle for a month. If he recovers well, the earliest he can begin activity would be right around the 12-week mark.

The Broncos expect Nix to be recovered enough in time for offseason workouts.

“So listen, he’ll rehab his tail off and get ready and get back to being healthy,” Payton said. “I think for someone who runs with the ball, I think he’s done a pretty good job of protecting himself, not all the time, but for the most part, he’s done a pretty good job of sliding and understanding playing for another day.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eTXnpVXj55bfc6pyJOxLFQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/edb39a40-fa00-11f0-abfe-325a838ae772,N,,2026-01-27 22:01:48.870240

“I don’t think it’s from the game,” Maye said during his weekly appearance on WEEI radio in Boston. “I think it’s just the buildup of throwing, including training camp, 30 weeks straight of throwing four days a week. It can add up. … But I got some extra rest, and I’m feeling good and ready to go for the Super Bowl.”

The Patriots don’t have to release an injury report until next week and aren’t scheduled to hold their first pre-Super Bowl practice until Thursday.

On Tuesday, coach Mike Vrabel was also asked whether Maye suffered a shoulder injury in the game against the Broncos.

“No, I wouldn’t say that anybody hurt anything,” Vrabel said. “Again, this is a sport where there’s going to be things that come up, but … we’ll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we’re required to. … But we were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football. So, that’s kind of where everybody’s at.”

Perhaps most concerning for the Patriots is that Maye indicated he didn’t know yet whether he would be limited in practices leading up to the Feb. 8 game against the Seattle Seahawks in Santa Clara, Calif. “I think it’s too early to say,” Maye told WEEI.

Since the Patriots — unlike the Seahawks — didn’t have a first-round bye, the Super Bowl will be their 21st game of the season (on top of the three preseason games).

“I think that everybody, including Drake, is not 100 percent at this part of the year,” Vrabel said. “We’ll do everything that we can to help our players be prepared and get ready for this game.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/27150958/GettyImages-2258173908-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-27 17:00:40.807152

Nix broke a bone in his right ankle on Denver's game-winning drive in the Broncos' 33-30 overtime victory over the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round of the playoffs.

Nix flew to Birmingham, Alabama, last week for an operation performed by Dr. Norman E. Waldrop III, a renowned foot and ankle specialist at the Andrews Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center.

Nix watched from a suite Sunday as backup Jarrett Stidham took his place in Denver's 10-7 loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.

On Tuesday, the Broncos' brass provided the fullest accounting yet of Nix's injury, with Payton saying a preexisting issue made the fracture ""a matter of when.""

""What was found was a condition that was predisposed -- they always find a little more when they go in,"" Payton said. ""It wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. When you look at the play and you're trying to evaluate it -- the operating surgeon said that this was going to happen sooner than later. Now, you go about the rehab, proper orthotics, all those things.""

Payton said he has no concerns about Nix's health going forward even though Nix has had several ankle operations going back to high school.

""So listen, he'll rehab his tail off and get ready and get back to being healthy,"" Payton said. ""I think for someone who runs with the ball, I think he's done a pretty good job of protecting himself, not all the time, but for the most part, he's done a pretty good job of sliding and understanding playing for another day.""

General manager George Paton said Nix is tracking to return in May when the Broncos begin organized team activities.

Just before going to the lectern for his wrap-up news conference, Payton said he saw Nix cruising around team headquarters on his medical scooter, which he'll use until he graduates to crutches and then a walking boot.

""He was just up above us here,"" Payton said from the atrium of the Broncos' suburban headquarters. ""I said, 'What are you doing? Getting your scooter laps in?'

""You have to know him. He's fidgety to begin with,"" Payton said. ""He might have just been getting his scooter laps. He was up there, like, in an area he'd never be in departmentwise. He's handling it like a pro. Man, I'm sure there's disappointment for him to have to watch"" on Sunday.

Nix led the Broncos (15-4) to a franchise record-tying 14 wins in the regular season and their first playoff triumph since Super Bowl 50 a decade ago. He has won 25 games in two seasons and has an NFL-best 11 game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime during that span.

""It's difficult to get as far as he brought us, and then also to see one of his contemporaries, someone in his draft class who he would have loved to have competed against, advance,"" Payton said of Patriots QB Drake Maye, who was Nix's predraft training partner.

""It's a tough deal.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0118%2Fr1602103_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 17:00:43.242132

Mike Vrabel, Drake Maye downplay injury talk surrounding QB

In the hours after the Patriots' AFC Championship Game victory, there was speculation on social media that Drake Maye suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder in the final moments of their win over the Denver Broncos.

Maye told WEEI that it's ""too early to say"" if he'll be limited in practice over the next two weeks, but he isn't concerned about his throwing shoulder.

""I’m feeling good. I got in some extra rest. I don’t think it’s from the game. I think it’s just the buildup of throwing, including training camp, 30 weeks straight of throwing and four days a week.

But what exactly governs these moments, and how do they fit into the broader picture of NFL rules and player conduct?
When you watch an NFL game, you see incredible athleticism, split-second decisions, and, yes, sometimes, players getting hurt.
The league, in conjunction with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), has a robust system in place for player conduct and accountability.
They're tasked with ensuring that players conduct themselves in a way that honors the game.","It’s a moment that can stop a game dead in its tracks, a sudden halt to the thunderous collisions and strategic chess match that is an NFL game. We’re talking about injury timeouts, those crucial pauses when a player goes down and the clock grinds to a standstill. But what exactly governs these moments, and how do they fit into the broader picture of NFL rules and player conduct?

When you watch an NFL game, you see incredible athleticism, split-second decisions, and, yes, sometimes, players getting hurt. The league has a vested interest in player safety, and that's where the rules around injuries come into play. While the term ""injury timeout"" might sound straightforward, it’s part of a larger framework designed to ensure fair play and protect the athletes. Unlike a coach-called timeout to strategize, an injury timeout is typically initiated by officials when a player is visibly injured and unable to continue without attention. The game clock stops, and medical personnel can enter the field to assess the situation. This isn't just about stopping the game; it's about ensuring the player receives prompt care and that the game can resume safely once the situation is managed.

But the NFL's commitment to its players and the integrity of the game extends far beyond just stopping play for injuries. The league, in conjunction with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), has a robust system in place for player conduct and accountability. You might have seen headlines about fines or suspensions, and it’s worth understanding the philosophy behind them. It’s not about stifling the passion or taking the fun out of the game; it’s about maintaining a standard of behavior that respects the sport, the opponents, the officials, and the millions of fans watching.

Think of it as a shared responsibility. Before each season kicks off, players are given a detailed breakdown of the rules, including what constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct, dangerous plays, or actions detrimental to the league. They even sign forms acknowledging they understand these expectations and the potential consequences. This isn't a surprise tactic; it's about clear communication and setting expectations. The fines collected, interestingly, don't go into the NFL's coffers. Instead, they are directed towards programs that support former players and promote health, safety, and wellness across all levels of football, from youth leagues to the pros.

Compliance officers within NFL Football Operations play a key role here. They're tasked with ensuring that players conduct themselves in a way that honors the game. This means everything from avoiding unnecessary roughness – like those dangerous hits that could endanger a fellow player – to maintaining composure and sportsmanship. Fighting, taunting, and even inappropriate contact with officials are strictly prohibited and come with penalties. The league emphasizes consistency and fairness, applying these rules across all 32 teams.

It’s a complex ecosystem, isn't it? On one hand, you have the immediate, critical need to stop play for an injured player. On the other, you have a comprehensive code of conduct designed to uphold the spirit and safety of the game. Both are essential components of what makes the NFL the spectacle it is, ensuring that while the competition is fierce, it's also conducted with a fundamental respect for the game and everyone involved.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-27 16:01:24.143217

Two weeks -- a chance to go win the Super Bowl.
The Patriots will release an injury report on Wednesday and what it says about Maye will be a main topic of conversation throughout Super Bowl week.
The Seahawks are currently 4.5-point favorites in the Super Bowl.","The New England Patriots are heading to their 10th Super Bowl this century after defeating the Broncos 10-7 in a snowy, defense-heavy game in Denver. Patriots Nation went from celebrating a historically quick rebuild to worrying about the status of their starting quarterback as the team heads into Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks.

A social media account called ""Pro Football Doc,"" run by David J. Chao, who provides insight on many injuries after serving a an NFL team doctor for 17-plus years, made a claim that quarterback Drake Maye injured his shoulder in the AFC Championship Game.

""There is no question in my mind that Drake Maye injured his right throwing shoulder against the Denver Broncos,"" Chao said. ""Of course, how bad is the injury remains to be seen. What type of injury -- I'm still gathering data, but let me give you the evidence.""

Coach Mike Vrabel was asked about his quarterback's status during his appearance on WEEI on Tuesday.

""There's not a player on our team that's 100% healthy,"" Vrabel said. ""I would imagine we'll go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we'll turn it in. But nobody's 100%. This will be our 21st game.""

During his media availability shortly after his radio spot, Vrabel said the situation was ""probably"" blown out of proportion.

""I wouldn't say anybody hurt anything,"" Vrabel said, when asked if Maye hurt his shoulder. ""This is a sport where there's gonna be things that come up. We'll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we're required to. We understand that. We were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football so that's kinda where everybody's at.""

Maye was sacked five times and took numerous other hits, including one that some are pointing as the cause of the apparent injury. In the third quarter, Maye slid at the end of a 13-yard run and was tackled by Broncos safety Talanoa Hufanga. Maye landed on his throwing shoulder and at the end of the play was seen holding that shoulder.

After Sunday's win, Maye admitted that he was dealing with ""bumps and bruises.""

""I think a lot of those guys in that locker room are battling through things,"" Maye said. ""At the same time, the best thing about it is we have another chance at it. Another chance at it to get healthy. Two weeks -- a chance to go win the Super Bowl. That's what it is, and that's pretty cool.""

Some have theorized that the Patriots were more conservative on offense because he injured his shoulder. Others point out that the lack of a pass game was due to inclement weather, wanting to eat up more of the clock and the confidence in their defense against a Broncos offense that wasn't productive for most of the game.

Just two plays after the alleged injury occurred, Maye completed a 31-yard pass to Mack Hollins, a play that is also being used by some to say Maye's throwing shoulder is fine.

To seal the win, Maye called his own number, running on a naked bootleg rather than the seemingly original plan to hand the ball to running back Rhamondre Stevenson. The second-year QB's risk paid off when he gained seven yards on third-and-5, with a slight stiff arm using his throwing hand.

The Patriots will release an injury report on Wednesday and what it says about Maye will be a main topic of conversation throughout Super Bowl week.

The 21-year-old sustained the injury while chasing a long ball in the second half of United’s 3-2 win at league leaders Arsenal on Sunday, in which he scored a half-volley from just outside the box.

United are still assessing the extent of the injury, with a timeline still not totally certain.

The injury is a significant blow to United. After primarily being used as a wing-back under former head coach Ruben Amorim, Dorgu has been deployed as a left winger in a 4-2-3-1 by interim head coach Michael Carrick. He started and scored in the wins over Manchester City and Arsenal.

Ten weeks out would see Dorgu miss the club’s next eight matches and put him in line for a return after March’s international break, with United taking on Leeds United on April 11.

Carrick said in his press conference after the Arsenal game that he hoped that the injury was not too serious and Dorgu had “hopefully” come off with cramp .

He joins centre-back Matthijs de Ligt on the sidelines, who has missed the last 11 games with a back issue sustained in early December.

Dorgu has featured 22 times in the Premier League this season, recording three goals and three assists.

The Denmark international signed for United on February 2 last year, joining from Serie A club Lecce for £25million ($33.7m) and has made 44 appearances for the side to date.

‘A cruel blow’

Analysis from Manchester United correspondent Mark Critchley

Dorgu’s injury is a cruel blow to both United and the player himself, arriving on the back of his best week since arriving at Old Trafford a year ago.

Sunday’s spectacular strike at the Emirates followed another goal in the Manchester derby the previous weekend.

Add those to Boxing Day’s goal of the month contender against Newcastle United, Dorgu had scored three times in his five recent appearances when deployed further forward rather than as a left wing-back.

That new, more advanced role had reinvigorated a player who had struggled for form and consistency since joining in a €30m move from Lecce, so much so that former head coach Ruben Amorim said he could feel Dorgu’s “anxiety” from the touchline. The Denmark international has looked anything but anxious of late.

Matheus Cunha is an obvious replacement on the left wing and will surely be restored to the starting line-up by Michael Carrick in Dorgu’s absence, but given how well Dorgu has been playing recently, that absence will still be felt.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/27043338/GettyImages-2258250203.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-27 15:01:59.520848

It appears New England Patriots star quarterback Drake Maye sustained a shoulder injury during the team’s 10-7 win in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday.

Head coach Mike Vrabel was asked about the internet doctors who were speculating about Maye’s injury, and Vrabel did not defuse the concerns of Patriots nation with his answer.

""There’s not a player on our team that’s 100% healthy,"" Vrabel said during a recent appearance on WEEI’s ""The Greg Hill Show"" when asked about Maye.

Vrabel was then asked if he thought Maye was healthy enough to play at a high level, and the head coach continued to not directly answer the question.

""I would imagine we’ll go through the injury report and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in. But nobody’s 100%. This’ll be our 21st game.""

Fans on the internet have speculated that Maye got injured in the third quarter when he got hit on a scramble and immediately grabbed his right shoulder. Maye said after the game that he had some bumps and bruises.

Vrabel, when speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, said the concern about Maye’s injury has probably been blown out of proportion.

""Here is what I’m going to start saying about this radio show, this is like the Miranda rights. There is nothing I can say on there that can be used against me when I come back in here,"" Vrabel said on Tuesday, ""I think that everybody, including Drake, is not 100% at this part of the year, and we will do everything we can to help our players be prepared and get ready for this game.""

The Patriots will need Maye to be at his best in the Super Bowl, as the Seattle Seahawks defense was the best in the NFL this season, allowing just 17.1 points per game. Maye, who was fantastic in the regular season, has not seen the same success in the playoffs, despite making the Super Bowl.

In the regular season, the 23-year-old completed 72% of his passes for 4,394 yards with 31 touchdowns and eight interceptions, along with 421 rushing yards and two touchdowns. In the playoffs, Maye has not been as effective through the air, completing 55.8% of his passes for 533 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions while getting sacked 15 times.

However, Maye has been dynamic with his legs, rushing for 141 yards and one touchdown, the lone one the Patriots scored in the AFC Championship, in three games.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2026/01/drake-maye-looks-postgame-patriots-broncos.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 15:02:08.776101

DiNucci was working for CBS Sports as a commentator when the team lost starting quarterback Bo Nix to a season-ending ankle injury. One day after he broke down the Nix news on television, DiNucci received a call from the Broncos with an offer to join their practice squad.

Denver had familiarity with DiNucci from his time with the club in 2023, and he returned to the team last week to serve as QB3 behind fill-in starter Jarrett Stidham and promoted QB2 Sam Ehlinger. Unfortunately, the Broncos were not able to advance to the Super Bowl without Nix, falling to the New England Patriots 10-7 in the AFC title game.

Following that loss, Denver has started signing practice squad players to reserve/future contracts. DiNucci hasn't received a reserve/future deal, so it looks like his second stint with the team will be short-lived. He shared this message to Broncos Country following Sunday's loss:

If he does not receive a reserve/future contract from Denver in the coming days, DiNucci's practice squad contract will expire on Monday and he will become a free agent. The 29-year-old quarterback has spent time with five NFL teams during his career, appearing in three regular season games. His time with the Broncos might be coming to an end, but DiNucci's pro football career probably isn't over just yet.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/26/SBRC/88362154007-ben-di-nucci-message-to-broncos-fans.jpg?crop=1456,820,x0,y110&width=1456&height=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-27 18:02:58.921721

By Hunt Palmer

Garrett Nussmeier‘s senior season was grounded before it started.

The nagging August abdominal issue continued through September and into October before it finally cost him the final month of the season. This week at The Senior Bowl in Mobile, Nussmeier is looking to show NFL organizations that he’s recovered and back to the passer who topped 4,000 yards in 2024.

“I feel good. It’s been a long process trying to get healthy,” Nussmeier said. “We were really able to get some answers. Probably about a month ago was the first time we were able to figure out what it was. Finally got a good plan to try and get healthy, so it was a gametime decision to see if I would be able to come out here.”

So, what was the issue?

“I couldn’t use my core,” Nussmeier said. “So, I was throwing the ball without a core. I’ve been having to go back from the ground up and retrain myself and get back to finishing throws and rotating through the ball. I’m actually using my core now. It’s been nice. The ball is definitely coming out a lot different.”

Nussmeier finished his final collegiate season completing 67.4 percent of his throws for 1927 yards and 12 touchdowns. His yards per game average slipped from 311.7 to 214.1. He just wasn’t the same player.

Though he insists he’s not out to “prove anything”, The Senior Bowl offers a great opportunity for him to prove himself in the meeting rooms and on the practice field where some of the best prospects in the spring’s draft will be competing.

“When I was able to say, hey, I can go, full go, it’s a great opportunity for me,” Nussmeier said. “One, I grew up watching the Senior Bowl. My dad played in the Senior Bowl 30 years ago or something like that, back in the dinosaur age. To get that opportunity is really cool.”

THE DAILY BLOVIATION

Like many who follow the Cleveland Browns, I am struggling with the team's approach to the coaching search. Hell, I was on ""Team Keep-the-Coach"" in the first place, so if I had my druthers (whatever those are), we wouldn't even be in this place.

At this point, we don't know what course the Browns will take to finalize their coaching search. Supposedly, they're all heading back from Los Angeles to Cleveland today and will discuss things in Berea as a group. One doesn't even know the basic parameters of what they'll be discussing - Do they feel Sheelhaase is no longer in the running? How did the interview go? What do they know of Buffalo's interest in the coach?

And so forth.

Unfortunately, I can't opine with any degree of certainty about what will transpire today or in the succeeding days.

If I were the Cleveland Browns, I know what I would do, and it has little to do with probable results on the football field, which no one can predict anyway. It would have everything to do with the business I'm in.

As a fellow business owner and someone who has been tracking fans' involvement with the team over the years, I don't think the Browns are in the position of selling their football product, which has been atrocious for years. The Browns brand should be selling competence, professionalism, and fun. But 20 years of futility have ruined that, and they have precious little left to sell a skeptical fan base.

What the Browns should be selling is hope.

The remaining devoted fans of the Cleveland Browns still have some hope. It may be faint, but it's there. Otherwise, they would have given up long ago. They're looking for something, anything to cling to with respect to the team's future.

The Browns, if there are options for them, should be looking at what will inspire hope. Again, if the option is there, that's why they should choose Nate Sheelhaase as the next head coach of the Cleveland Browns.

If the team goes in another direction, they'll be required to ""sell"" Browns fans on their decision. Jim Schwartz, for example, is a great defensive coach, but he's not had a track record of success as a head coach. He's older, and like most older people, myself included, we sort of know what we're going to get and, historically, that's been limited. I think a fraction of the Browns' fan base could be won over to the selection, but it's going to take some selling to some skeptical fans.

With Scheelhaase, the Browns would be bringing in a young coach with a strong early track record, little experience, but an unknown ceiling. Browns fans would be able to get behind his potential as a selection and have some optimism. I don't see that optimism coming along with a hire like Schwartz, Monken, or Lynn.

As Jimmy Haslam and crew make their decision, they need to understand their track record, the mood of the fan base, and what product it is that they're selling. And right now, hope is their only product.

Have a good one! GO BROWNS!

Longtime readers of this Massie Morning Missive will remember that I was incredibly overexcited about the total solar eclipse several years ago. That event, for me, was a very big deal, and cemented for me my place in the universe. Namely, relatively insignificant, but at least having a good time. Events like the eclipse or photos from space are tremendous reminders of our connectedness to the universe and resonate with the spirit. This article goes into that, if you are interested.

The days of a head coach running things, are numbered for the few who can still hold the power like Andy Reid, and over for those without the cache.

Front offices are in charge, and coaches are just cogs in the wheel of a giant corporate machine. Consider most ""Managers"" in MLB, don't really set their own lineups, or make their pitching change decisions. It all comes from the front office with huge input from the analytics department. AI is analytics on steroids. Play design, counters, tendency breakers, may all come on Kurt Cignetti's 9-5 schedule soon for coaches, because computers will do the work. Coaches become about execution, and player management. I mean even now while they retain the authority mostly, some guy in their ear tells them when to go or kick on 4th down. Those little Microsoft tablets are going to be used for a whole lot more in the future.

Thus, I expect the half-life of an NFL coach has just gotten shorter, and will continue until we see things like we do in world soccer. If a manager makes it more than a year, its pretty extraordinary. Harbaugh may well be the last coach hired who gets big money, 5 years, and control. Why would you pay that for someone who won't really be in charge?

Ex-NFL team doctor that he believes Maye hurt his shoulder during the 10-7 win against the Denver Broncos. Chao has built a reputation for analyzing injuries on his social media accounts and has a track record of accuracy.

Dr. Chao noted he believed Maye hurt his shoulder on a run in the third quarter, when he landed on his elbow. Chao noted Maye was working out his shoulder after his next pass. On Tuesday, Chao provided an update on what he thinks of the Patriots quarterback’s shoulder injury.

“Nothing inflammatory here, just stating my opinion (and found more evidence that I will show when I can),” Dr. Chao wrote on X. “The right shoulder injury seems real. The possibility of missing (Super Bowl LX) does not.”

Mike Vrabel was asked on “The Greg Hill Show” about the rumors and gave a vague answer.

“There’s not a player on our team that’s 100-percent healthy,” Vrabel said on Tuesday.

When asked if Drake Maye is healthy enough to play at a high level, he kept things vague.

“I would imagine we’ll go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in,” Vrabel said. “But nobody’s 100 percent. (It’ll) be our 21st game.”

After not directly addressing his quarterback’s injury status on Tuesday morning, Mike Vrabel had a chance to clarify his comments during a press conference at Gillette Stadium later that day. He did remain somewhat vague, but did acknowledge that the story about Drake Maye’s injured shoulder was “probably” blown out of proportion.

“I think that everybody, including Drake, is not 100% at this part of the year. We’ll do everything that we can to help our players be prepared and get ready for this game,” Vrabel said.

When asked in a follow-up whether or not Maye did hurt his shoulder, the Patriots’ first-year head coach claimed that he “wouldn’t say that anybody hurt anything.”

“Again, this is a sport where there’s going to be things that come up, but I don’t think that there’s a — we’ll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we’re required to. We understand that. But we were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football. So, that’s kind of where everybody’s at.”

Original story 1/27/2026: Mike Vrabel sidesteps Drake Maye injury questions ahead of Super Bowl

At first glance, the New England Patriots appeared to have escaped the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos without any major injury issues. However, on Monday, speculation started to make the rounds online about quarterback Drake Maye potentially having injured his right throwing shoulder on a scramble play in the third quarter.

Maye himself did not show any limitations after the play, but did acknowledge some “bumps and bruises” during his press conference after the 10-7 victory spoke. Are they a valid reason for concern, though? That remains to be seen, especially with Mike Vrabel opting not to directly address the rumors on Monday morning.

Appearing on WEEI’s The Greg Hill Show, the Patriots’ head coach channeled his inner Bill Belichick when asked about Maye’s supposed shoulder ailment:

Q: Is he a 100% healthy today as you guys get ready?

Vrabel: There’s not a player on our team that’s 100% healthy.

Q: Is he healthy enough to play at a high level?

Vrabel: I would imagine we will go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in. But nobody is 100%. This will be our 21st game.

Maye finished the game without missing any time, and did not look particularly bothered by his shoulder or any other injuries during and after the contest. He completed his longest pass of the day, a 31-yarder to Mack Hollins, two plays after the scramble in question and was quick to pop up again following a sack in the fourth quarter that saw him land on that very same right shoulder.

As Vrabel noted, though, his team will share all the necessary information as part of its injury report. The first of those leading up to Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks will be released next Wednesday.

It all started late Monday when Dr. David J. Chao, a former Los Angeles Chargers team doctor who has since transitioned to a controversial sports media career, claimed Maye injured his right shoulder during the AFC Championship Game win over the Denver Broncos.

“Drake Maye injured his right throwing shoulder against the Broncos,” Chao wrote on X with an accompanying video that did little to substantiate his claim. “How severe the injury is, and the exact diagnosis, remains to be determined. Heading into Super Bowl LX, I’m far more concerned about Maye’s shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique.

At that point, it was easy to write off Chao’s claim as nonsense. And perhaps it still is, but subsequent reporting, plus comments from Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel, have fueled concerns about Maye’s health.

First, at 8:24 p.m. ET on Monday, Greg Bedard of the Boston Sports Journal provided a sourced update on Maye.

“The information that I have at this moment is that any Maye ‘injury’ to his throwing shoulder is not believed to be an issue,” Bedard wrote on X.

Obviously, that’s different than saying Maye doesn’t have an injured throwing shoulder.

Roughly 30 minutes later, ESPN’s Mike Reiss, one of the most well-connected reporters covering the Patriots, wrote these three interesting paragraphs:

“Maye’s physical condition also could be a factor. As part of his regular routine, Maye planned for time with team physical therapist/athletic trainer Zach Gerber, whom the signal-caller has credited for helping him endure through the physical grind of the season. Maye was sacked five times on Sunday and took other hits. One noteworthy hit came at the end of a 13-yard run late in the third quarter; on the play, Maye slid somewhat awkwardly and was tackled by safety Talanoa Hufanga, with Maye landing on his throwing shoulder.

“Asked by ESPN to describe how he felt physically after the conference championship game, Maye acknowledged ‘some bumps and bruises’ before adding, ‘But hey, that’s what it takes.’

” ‘I think a lot of those guys in that locker room are battling through things,’ he said. ‘At the same time, the best thing about it is we have another chance at it. Another chance at it to get healthy. Two weeks — a chance to go win the Super Bowl. That’s what it is, and that’s pretty cool.’ “

Again, that sure sounds like Maye is dealing with some sort of shoulder injury, albeit potentially minor.

That brings us to Tuesday morning, when Vrabel, appearing on WEEI’s “The Greg Hill Show“, was asked about the injury rumors and whether Maye is 100% healthy ahead of the Super Bowl.

“There’s not a player on our team that’s 100% healthy,” Vrabel said.

Vrabel then was asked whether Maye is healthy enough to play at a high level.

“I would imagine we will go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in,” Vrabel said. “But nobody is 100%. This will be our 21st game.”

You can draw your own conclusions, but the tea leaves point in an obvious direction. Again, there’s no reason to question Maye’s availability for Super Bowl LX, but there’s at least some reason to believe his shoulder is bothering him.

All eyes will be on Thursday’s practice and ensuing injury report, which will offer more clarity on Maye’s condition.

Saints safeties Justin Reid and Jonas Sanker emerged as a cornerstone of the defense, holding down the defensive backfield for majority of the season. Reid started 15 games, missing two to a knee injury, while the rookie Sanker played in all 17 — taking over as the starter in Week 2 following an injury to Julian Blackmon.

Reid signed with the Saints in free agency and made an immediate impact as a veteran voice in the locker room and earning a selection as a team captain in his first season back in his home state. Reid accumulated 72 tackles (37 solo) including two tackles for loss and a half sack, six pass deflections and an interception returned 49 yards for a touchdown.

Initially anticipated as a core special teams player by the coaching staff heading into the season, Sanker took on a prominent role following Blackmon's injury. The third-round pick made the most of his opportunity recording 80 tackles (46 solo) including three tackles for loss, six pass deflections, two interceptions returned for 29 yards and a fumble recovery returned for 27 yards.

Justin Reid on Jonas Sanker stepping into a starting role following Julian Blackmon's injury:

His story follows my story. My rookie year I started the second game of the season for the same reason — that there was an injury that came up in the first game and I started the second game — so I already talked to Jonas a little bit about that. And he'll be ready for the moment. He shined in preseason, he was flying around all over the ball and we just need that same player to play on Sunday. And his best will be good enough for us.

After all, there has been some online speculation following the game that starting quarterback Drake Maye may have sustained a right shoulder injury.
The two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are traditionally filled with speculation, rumors and storylines that very well may turn out to be inconsequential for the outcome of the game.
Drake Maye’s supposed shoulder injury is a candidate to fall into all those categories as well.
But a chance to go win the Super Bowl.","The New England Patriots’ 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship may not have been the prettiest game of the NFL season, but it doesn’t matter. A win is a win, and this particular one allows the Patriots to return to the Super Bowl after a six-year absence.

The victory is not the only thing the team can feel good about coming out of Sunday. The Patriots also seem to have avoided any substantial injuries along the way — or have they? After all, there has been some online speculation following the game that starting quarterback Drake Maye may have sustained a right shoulder injury.

LB Robert Spillane: The Patriots’ defensive signal caller remained on the ground after making a tackle on a short run with 3:37 left in the first quarter, and slammed his helmet in frustration afterwards. He eventually walked off the field under his own power, but went straight into the blue medical tent for further evaluation. Spillane eventually departed for the locker room and was announced as questionable to return to the contest because of an ankle injury. However, he reemerged in the second period and tried out his ankle on the sideline. Ultimately, though, he never reentered the game.

QB Drake Maye: New England’s starting quarterback found himself under substantial pressure against the Broncos’ top-tier pass rush, and ended up absorbing five sacks, seven hits, and four tackles on rushing attempts. On one of those, the supposed shoulder injury happened: with 3:46 to go in the third quarter, Maye scrambled up the middle and was taken down by safety Talanoa Hufanga. He landed on his right throwing shoulder, and his hand indeed went up to it immediately; he very well could have just been adjusting his shoulder pads, though, because he also did the same on the left afterwards. All of that is speculation, of course. What we do know is that Maye stayed in the game and did not show any unexpected signs of discomfort despite taking another hit and tackle later in the game. He also completed a 31-yards pass just two plays after the play in question.

The two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are traditionally filled with speculation, rumors and storylines that very well may turn out to be inconsequential for the outcome of the game. Drake Maye’s supposed shoulder injury is a candidate to fall into all those categories as well.

“Got some bumps and bruises, but, hey, that’s what it takes,” he said. “I think a lot of those guys in that locker room are battling through things, and I think at the same time the best thing about it is we get another chance at it. Another chance to get healthy — two weeks and we’ll go into some nicer weather, knock on some wood. We’ll see. But a chance to go win the Super Bowl. I mean that’s what it is. That’s pretty cool.”

The team captain previously missed four games because of an ankle injury, meaning that his situation is one worth monitoring coming out of the AFC title game. However, the fact that he was allowed to return to the sideline and possible return to the game if the situation had called for it can be interpreted as a positive sign.

Ultimately, however, we will have to wait for more information to come out. Some might come on Tuesday via head coach Mike Vrabel; some might come on Thursday when the team returns to practice.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2257692223.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C1.1254733359913%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2026-01-27 14:01:37.779966

It initially came as a surprise considering Maye finished the game and even completed some passes in the immediate aftermath.

However, Vrabel didn't completely shut it down when asked about it on The Greg Hill Show on Tuesday morning.

""There's not a player on our team that's 100 percent healthy,"" Vrabel responded. ""I would imagine we will go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we'll turn it in. But nobody is 100 percent. This will be our 21st game.""

It's important to note that Chao doesn't expect the injury to keep Maye from playing in Super Bowl LX.

""I know Patriots fans want to hear it but take a watch/listen and judge for yourself. Nothing inflammatory here, just stating my opinion (and found more evidence that I will show when I can). The right shoulder injury seems real. The possibility of missing SBLX does not,"" Chao posted on Tuesday.","https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/27/SPAT/88376196007-usatsi-28085874.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-27 13:05:47.567298

Speculation started spreading online about a possible shoulder injury to Maye’s throwing arm following a third-quarter scramble. Nothing seemed wrong during the game.

Maye finished it out and didn’t appear limited, but he did mention “bumps and bruises” afterward in the 10-7 win. No one’s sure yet if that’s typical postgame soreness or something more.

Head coach Mike Vrabel didn’t help clear things up when he joined The Greg Hill Show. He sidestepped the injury talk entirely.

“There’s not a player on our team that’s 100-percent healthy,” Vrabel said when asked if Maye was fully healthy.

“I would imagine we’ll go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in,” Vrabel added. “But nobody’s 100 percent. (It’ll) be our 21st game.”

Maye played every snap and looked fine as the game went on. He threw his deepest ball of the afternoon just two plays after the scramble everyone’s talking about, a 31-yard completion to Mack Hollins.

He also took a fourth-quarter sack and landed hard on that same shoulder but got up without hesitation.

Despite the lack of depth, it remains unlikely that Liverpool will enter the market for senior defensive help this month.","Liverpool’s defensive resources have been further depleted after youngster Wellity Lucky was ruled out for at least two months with a hamstring injury.

The 20-year-old centre-back is a member of Liverpool’s under-21 squad but has frequently trained with the first team this season, and has been on the bench in the Premier League five times. He made his senior debut in the 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat to Crystal Palace in October.

While he is not considered a Premier League starting option, his injury — which has forced him to miss the under-21s’ last two matches against Arsenal and Leeds United — means head coach Arne Slot has one fewer defensive option for his substitutes’ bench.

Summer signing Giovanni Leoni has been out injured since September after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury, a blow that left Liverpool with three senior options.

Joe Gomez came off injured after colliding with goalkeeper Alisson in the defeat to AFC Bournemouth on Saturday night. It is not expected to be serious but the length of his absence remains unknown.

Ibrahima Konate, who has been first choice alongside Virgil van Dijk this season, remains on compassionate leave after the death of his father.

Central midfielder Wataru Endo was brought on by Slot in place of Gomez against Bournemouth. Fellow midfielder Ryan Gravenberch is another option Slot could use in that position having switched him there during matches.

Liverpool are short on defensive options across the pitch, with right-back Conor Bradley also suffering a season-ending injury against Arsenal earlier this month. Tottenham Hotspur held talks with the Anfield club over a move for veteran left-back Andrew Robertson but Liverpool are currently not willing to sanction that deal, partly due to difficulties in recalling Kostas Tsimikas from AS Roma.

Despite the lack of depth, it remains unlikely that Liverpool will enter the market for senior defensive help this month.

Marc Guehi, who was close to signing on the summer’s transfer deadline day, signed for Manchester City this month with Liverpool deciding not to rival them due to the financial package it required.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/26121719/GettyImages-2250723578-scaled-e1769447865731.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-27 13:05:56.755086

Estimated Reading Time: 13 minutes

The 2025 NFL season is nearly complete, which means we can begin to assess the state of each team’s roster for next year. We’ll attempt to find one breakout player for each team ahead of the 2026 campaign.

Arizona Cardinals: DI Walter Nolen

The Cardinals' first-round pick was limited to just six appearances and 169 defensive snaps in his rookie season, but he produced an excellent 80.1 PFF pass-rush grade across that small sample. Had he played enough snaps to qualify, Nolen would have recorded the 13th-best pass-rush win rate (13.0%) among defensive tackles. The Cardinals will surely be hoping that he can fully recover from his season-ending knee injury and replicate that production.

Atlanta Falcons: EDGE Jalon Walker

Walker battled through some minor injuries to produce a 71.6 PFF overall grade as a rookie. He racked up 29 pressures, including six sacks. Perhaps the more surprising part is that his 81.3 PFF run-defense grade ranked sixth among qualified edge defenders. Walker was supposed to go through a longer transition period in the run game as he made the move from linebacker to edge defender. If he maintains that production while continuing to improve as a pass rusher, he could soon become a bona fide star.

Baltimore Ravens: S Malaki Starks

Starks served as a respectable understudy to veterans Kyle Hamilton and Alohi Gilman in Baltimore’s secondary this season. He earned a solid 68.9 PFF overall grade across more than 1,000 snaps in his rookie season. Starks’ 79.9 PFF run-defense grade was a top-20 mark among qualified safeties, and he should continue to improve in coverage with more experience.

Buffalo Bills: DI Deone Walker

Walker was a fourth-round pick who always had the potential to outperform his draft slot. He did so immediately, playing 549 snaps this season and placing second among Buffalo’s defensive linemen with a 78.3 PFF pass-rush grade. Walker tallied 20 pressures, two sacks, five batted passes and even an interception in the team’s playoff game against the Broncos. His development will be a major storyline in 2026 as the Bills try to improve their defense for a Super Bowl run.

Carolina Panthers: WR Jalen Coker

Coker missed the first six games of the 2025 season due to injury and took a while to find his rhythm as he recovered. He became a key piece for Carolina’s offense during the stretch run, and his production crescendoed with a 134-yard outing in the team’s playoff loss to the Rams. Those efforts resulted in Coker earning a 75.3 PFF receiving grade this season, which would be incredibly useful if he can play all 17 games in 2026.

Chicago Bears: T Ozzy Trapilo

Trapilo’s respectable level of play once he was inserted into the starting lineup may have earned him the Bears’ left tackle job heading into 2026. From Week 12 through the wild-card round, Trapilo earned a 73.5 PFF overall grade — a top-30 figure among qualified offensive tackles. It should be noted that he had not played left tackle since 2022, so there should be further improvement in store.

Cincinnati Bengals: T Amarius Mims

After a season and a half full of consistent struggles, Mims may have turned a corner late in the season, potentially changing the complexion of Cincinnati’s offensive line. From Week 12 through Week 18, Mims earned an 81.0 PFF overall grade that ranked 13th among qualified offensive tackles. He also did not allow a sack across his final eight games of the season.

Cleveland Browns: DI Mason Graham

Graham put together a consistent, though not necessarily flashy, debut season in the NFL. He racked up 36 pressures as a pass rusher and improved after a bumpy first few weeks in run defense. From Weeks 7 through 18, Graham earned a 73.8 PFF overall grade that ranked 16th among qualified defensive tackles. If he adds strength in his first full NFL offseason, Graham could become the impact player that Cleveland drafted him to be.

Dallas Cowboys: LB DeMarvion Overshown

Overshown returned from a devastating knee injury that ended his 2024 season to produce a respectable 67.4 PFF overall grade across 218 snaps in 2025. Dallas has now seen nearly 1,000 snaps of solid play from Overshown across his first two seasons. Dallas needs all the defensive help it can get, and the team should be able to rely on a healthy Overshown to improve the unit in 2026.

Denver Broncos: WR Pat Bryant

Bryant didn’t get many opportunities in the first half of his rookie season, but he became a reliable contributor to Denver’s offense down the stretch. Since Week 8, he produced a solid 73.0 PFF receiving grade while placing third on the team with 364 receiving yards. He should continue to garner further opportunities alongside Courtland Sutton and Troy Franklin in 2026.

Detroit Lions: G Tate Ratledge

Ratledge did a fine job as Detroit’s starting right guard in his rookie season while leading the team with 1,088 offensive snaps played. His 70.3 PFF overall grade and 73.5 PFF run-blocking grade both ranked second among qualified rookie guards. Another year of improvement in pass protection, where he excelled while at Georgia, could turn Ratledge into a well-above-average starter in the near future.

Green Bay Packers: WR Matthew Golden

Golden’s playing time drastically declined when Christian Watson returned from injury in Week 8. However, he showed up when it mattered most with 84 yards and a 90.0 PFF receiving grade in Green Bay’s playoff loss to the Bears. Romeo Doubs will be a free agent this offseason, which should provide Golden the opportunity to start in 2026.

Houston Texans: WR Jayden Higgins

Higgins took a while to get going, but he brought his trademark brand of reliable football to Houston during the second half of his rookie season. From Week 10 through the divisional round, Higgins earned a 77.3 PFF receiving grade, tying him for 20th among qualified wide receivers. As expected when he was drafted, he displayed his excellent hands all season, dropping just one pass. Higgins should garner a heavier target share in 2026.

Indianapolis Colts: T Jalen Travis

Travis, a rookie fourth-round pick, didn’t see significant action until the Colts’ final five games this season. As he filled in for the team’s injured starting tackles, Travis showed he could be a capable starter. In those five games, four of them at right tackle, he earned a solid 72.1 PFF overall grade while allowing just one sack. Starting right tackle Braden Smith seems likely to depart in free agency, so Travis will have a prime opportunity to succeed Smith in that role.

Jacksonville Jaguars: RB Bhayshul Tuten

Starting running back Travis Etienne Jr. will be a free agent this offseason, and it’s unclear whether he will remain in Jacksonville. The team could look for reinforcements at the position, but 2026 could serve as a prime opportunity for Tuten to seize the starting role. Tuten recorded a respectable 67.7 PFF rushing grade this season while forcing 19 missed tackles across just 87 carries. An expanded role in the passing game could also lead to his breakout.

Kansas City Chiefs: CB Nohl Williams

Jaylen Watson and Joshua Williams are both set to be free agents this offseason, which could open the door for some cornerback competition in Kansas City. Of course, the Chiefs seem to have found another productive defensive back in 2025 third-round pick Nohl Williams. The rookie out of California earned a solid 75.6 PFF coverage grade this season while breaking up four passes. He should have every opportunity to earn a starting role in 2026.

Las Vegas Raiders: RB Ashton Jeanty

While Jeanty rushed for nearly 1,000 yards in his debut campaign, he did so at an incredibly inefficient rate. He averaged just 3.7 yards per carry, and more than 80% of his yards came after contact. That was primarily the result of Las Vegas' 30th-ranked PFF run-blocking grade. If the team can improve its offensive line and quarterback play, Jeanty could be set on a path toward greater production in 2026.

Los Angeles Chargers: S R.J. Mickens

The sixth-round pick made 11 appearances, including six starts, and earned a 70.8 PFF overall grade in the process. His fundamentally sound play style fit in perfectly with the Chargers’ secondary, and he reeled in two interceptions to boot. Veteran Tony Jefferson will be a free agent, so Mickens could assume an expanded role in 2026.

Los Angeles Rams: TE Terrance Ferguson

The Rams love their multiple-tight-end sets, and veteran Tyler Higbee is slated to be a free agent this offseason. That leaves Colby Parkinson and Terrance Ferguson as the top internal options remaining at the position. Parkinson is a favorite of quarterback Matthew Stafford, but Ferguson racked up 250 receiving yards and three touchdowns this season, including postseason play. Incredibly, he produced that yardage total across just 12 receptions. More big plays from Ferguson should be in store in 2026.

Miami Dolphins: T Patrick Paul

Paul proved himself capable of being Miami’s starting left tackle in 2025 after increasing his PFF overall grade by more than 20 points from his poor 2024 mark. He earned a solid 74.4 PFF pass-blocking grade while allowing just four sacks this season. Miami has very few constants on its roster right now, but Paul’s presence and potential improvement at left tackle are major assets for a team seemingly entering a rebuild.

Minnesota Vikings: EDGE Dallas Turner

Turner may have finally found his footing during the second half of this season. From Weeks 10 through 18, the former first-round pick racked up 24 pressures and seven sacks while ranking 16th among qualified edge rushers in PFF pass-rush grade (76.5). Turner also seemed to find further comfort in run defense, which could make him a more viable three-down player in 2026.

New England Patriots: WR Kyle Williams

New England is suddenly flush with playmaking wide receivers, including Stefon Diggs, Kayshon Boutte and Demario Douglas. But Kyle Williams could further enter the fray after displaying flashes of his big-play ability in 2025. He has averaged 19.6 yards per reception and scored three touchdowns across just 11 receptions.

New Orleans Saints: WR Devaughn Vele

Vele's 293 receiving yards this season may not seem like much, but he started to develop a nice rapport with quarterback Tyler Shough before missing the Saints' final three games due to injury. From Weeks 12 through 15, Vele earned an 84.7 PFF receiving grade while averaging nearly 60 yards per game. The Saints are searching for reliable weapons alongside Chris Olave, and Vele could be an option.

New York Giants: QB Jaxson Dart

Dart was certainly in the spotlight during his rookie season, and he earned a respectable 68.4 PFF overall grade with an injury-ravaged supporting cast. Star wide receiver Malik Nabers suffered a season-ending injury in Dart’s first start. Running back Cam Skattebo suffered his own season-ending injury in Week 8. Left tackle Andrew Thomas also missed four games. Armed with a healthier supporting cast and a new coaching staff, Dart has a chance to improve significantly in 2026.

New York Jets: DI Jowon Briggs

Briggs experienced something of a breakout in 2025, which unexpectedly came in the form of pass-rush production. He earned an outstanding 85.6 PFF pass-rush grade this season while racking up 38 pressures. Briggs was known as more of a run stuffer in college and with the Cleveland Browns, but his PFF run-defense grade dipped to 55.5 this season. If he returns to form on the ground and maintains his excellent pass-rush numbers, he could quietly become a star in the Jets’ defense.

Philadelphia Eagles: LB Jihaad Campbell

Campbell got his opportunity to start in the absence of Nakobe Dean early in the season and performed very well. His playing time diminished when Dean returned, but Dean is set to be a free agent this offseason. Across his 10 starts, Campbell earned an excellent 82.1 PFF overall grade while missing just four tackles. He should soon become a mainstay in the Eagles’ defense alongside Zack Baun.

Pittsburgh Steelers: T Troy Fautanu

After missing nearly all of his rookie season due to injury, Fautanu seemed to find his footing in 2025. Bear in mind that he was still adjusting to playing right tackle, where he had logged just two snaps in college at Washington. He played well across 1,000 snaps this season, earning a 69.4 PFF pass-blocking grade and allowing just three sacks all year. Fautanu should be able to sustain and improve upon that production in 2026.

San Francisco 49ers: CB Upton Stout

Stout, a third-round pick, quickly became the 49ers’ primary nickel cornerback and improved as the season progressed. From Week 11 through the divisional round, Stout earned an 81.6 PFF overall grade, which ranked sixth among all qualified cornerbacks. That mark also ranked second behind Denver’s Ja'Quan McMillian among primary slot cornerbacks. The 49ers likely found a gem in Stout, and he should continue to improve as their nickel in 2026.

Seattle Seahawks: G Grey Zabel

Zabel has battled all season as the Seahawks’ starting left guard and is playing his best football in the most important moments of his team’s season. Since Week 14, Zabel has earned an 80.6 PFF overall grade — the ninth-best mark among all qualified guards in that span. That includes two outstanding performances, both of which earned him 80.0-plus grade, against the rival 49ers. Zabel has future Pro Bowler written all over him if he continues his late-season pace.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers: CB Jacob Parrish

Parrish filled a variety of roles for the Buccaneers this season. His 69.3 PFF overall grade ranked second among qualified rookie cornerbacks. He intercepted two passes while breaking up three others en route to a respectable 66.6 PFF coverage grade. More impressively, he owned a 78.5 PFF run-defense grade — a top-15 mark at his position. Parrish should be a mainstay in Tampa Bay’s secondary heading into 2026.

Tennessee Titans: S Kevin Winston Jr.

Winston didn’t see the field much until the second half of the season, but he displayed flashes of starting potential, particularly in the run game. His 89.4 PFF run-defense grade led all qualified safeties. Winston will need to improve upon his poor 43.4 PFF coverage grade, but his new defensive-minded head coach, Robert Saleh, should be able to find a valuable role for him.

Washington Commanders: T Josh Conerly Jr.

Conerly’s 59.9 PFF overall grade for the season may not portray an imminent breakout, but he improved down the stretch. From Weeks 9 through 18, Conerly ranked just outside the top 30 qualified tackles with his 71.6 PFF overall grade. He allowed just two sacks in that time frame while stabilizing his play in the run game. The Commanders should be very encouraged by what they saw from Conerly during the second half of the campaign.",https://media.pff.com/2026/01/Golden-Matthew-Feature-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2026-01-27 13:06:01.097522

A win is a win, and this particular one allows the Patriots to return to the Super Bowl after a six-year absence.

The victory is not the only thing the team can feel good about coming out of Sunday. The Patriots also seem to have avoided any substantial injuries along the way — or have they? After all, there has been some online speculation following the game that starting quarterback Drake Maye may have sustained a right shoulder injury.

Let’s assess both his and the team’s overall injury status after rewatching the game and based on the information we have available as of Tuesday morning.

Patriots injury analysis: AFC Championship Game

LB Robert Spillane: The Patriots’ defensive signal caller remained on the ground after making a tackle on a short run with 3:37 left in the first quarter, and slammed his helmet in frustration afterwards. He eventually walked off the field under his own power, but went straight into the blue medical tent for further evaluation. Spillane eventually departed for the locker room and was announced as questionable to return to the contest because of an ankle injury. However, he reemerged in the second period and tried out his ankle on the sideline. Ultimately, though, he never reentered the game.

QB Drake Maye: New England’s starting quarterback found himself under substantial pressure against the Broncos’ top-tier pass rush, and ended up absorbing five sacks, seven hits, and four tackles on rushing attempts. On one of those, the supposed shoulder injury happened: with 3:46 to go in the third quarter, Maye scrambled up the middle and was taken down by safety Talanoa Hufanga. He landed on his right throwing shoulder, and his hand indeed went up to it immediately; he very well could have just been adjusting his shoulder pads, though, because he also did the same on the left afterwards. All of that is speculation, of course. What we do know is that Maye stayed in the game and did not show any unexpected signs of discomfort despite taking another hit and tackle later in the game. He also completed a 31-yards pass just two plays after the play in question.

What this means for the Patriots

The two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are traditionally filled with speculation, rumors and storylines that very well may turn out to be inconsequential for the outcome of the game. Drake Maye’s supposed shoulder injury is a candidate to fall into all those categories as well.

The 23-year-old himself, after all, looked good and the field and also did not sound overly worried during his postgame presser.

“Got some bumps and bruises, but, hey, that’s what it takes,” he said. “I think a lot of those guys in that locker room are battling through things, and I think at the same time the best thing about it is we get another chance at it. Another chance to get healthy — two weeks and we’ll go into some nicer weather, knock on some wood. We’ll see. But a chance to go win the Super Bowl. I mean that’s what it is. That’s pretty cool.”

Obviously, time will tell what exactly happened and whether there is cause for concern. The same is true for Robert Spillane as well.

The team captain previously missed four games because of an ankle injury, meaning that his situation is one worth monitoring coming out of the AFC title game. However, the fact that he was allowed to return to the sideline and possible return to the game if the situation had called for it can be interpreted as a positive sign.

Seattle went toe-to-toe with Los Angeles in this one, as quarterback Sam Darnold managed to outduel Matthew Stafford with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.

Mike Macdonald Reveals Injury Updates After Seahawks Beat Rams

Throughout the Seahawks’ playoff run, injuries have been a pretty important topic of discussion. Right before the team’s divisional round matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, Darnold suffered an oblique injury that threw his status for the game up in the air. While he ended up playing, Darnold is still dealing with this in the wake of Seattle’s huge win in the NFC Championship Game.

The good news for the Seahawks is that they will get an extra week of rest and recovery ahead of the Super Bowl. While they aren’t exactly dealing with any major injuries ahead of this contest, guys like Darnold are dealing with various bumps and bruises that could have an impact on the outcome of this game.

Several other injuries popped up in the team’s win over the Rams. Starting left tackle Charles Cross has been dealing with a lingering foot injury, while fullback Brady Russell and linebacker Drake Thomas were forced out of the game early with new ailments. When speaking about the team’s injury situation, though, Macdonald didn’t sound particularly concerned about the status of any of his players.

“(Brady Russell’s) got something with his hand, so we’ve got to work through that,” Macdonald said on “Brock & Salk.” “Charles is gonna be sore, Sam is gonna be sore. Drake (Thomas) has got a shoulder (injury). There’s a couple of other things we’re gonna work through, but nothing major, to our knowledge.”

Considering the circumstances, it would take something truly major for any of these players to miss the Super Bowl. And with ample time to get healthy for this game, the hope is that Seattle will have its full complement of players ready to go for this one.

I'm going to sort through all of that and try to make sense of the two conference title games and what they mean. Let's start in the NFC.

Seahawks 31, Rams 27

Sam Darnold finally came through. Regardless of what happens in the Super Bowl, Darnold has officially completed the rewrite of his career and gone from disappointing draft pick and journeyman to a meaningful part of a great team. And now, after definitively conquering a Rams team that seemed to have carved out a home in Darnold's head, he's one win away from a Super Bowl title nobody could have expected.

Even as Darnold rose from the depths of the time he spent with coaches Adam Gase and Matt Rhule on hopeless teams, it was always easy to qualify his successes. He was playing in a dream situation with the Vikings in 2024 given the coaching staff and playmakers, and advanced metrics saw him as something closer to an average quarterback. His brutal end to that season against the Lions and Rams in consecutive weeks convinced the Vikings that they were better off moving forward with J.J. McCarthy as a less-expensive solution under center.

Darnold joined the Seahawks, and for three months, he was the NFL's most efficient QB. That success, however, also came within a play-action-heavy scheme and with a breakout superstar in receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and when Darnold met the Rams again in Week 11, he cratered in a 21-19 loss. The 2018 No. 3 pick dropped from first in the NFL in Total QBR before the Rams game to 27th the rest of the way.

Even as the Seahawks beat the Rams in their December rematch, the story of that game was more about what surrounded Darnold. He averaged less than 1 air yard per throw in the first half, as the Seahawks tried to limit Darnold's exposure to the Rams' pass rush. Darnold threw two picks, giving him six in two games against Los Angeles, but he made a handful of important throws during the team's fourth-quarter comeback and in overtime to help lead the Seahawks to a 38-37 victory.

The Seahawks hadn't needed Darnold since then; they had relied on their defense and a resurgent running game to fuel their success down the stretch. That wasn't the case Sunday. Running back Kenneth Walker III had a great game in terms of making unblocked or underblocked defenders miss, but Seahawks backs turned 22 carries into just 66 rushing yards. And a dominant Seahawks defense came up with a critical stop in the fourth quarter to hold on to a four-point lead, but the Rams again had little trouble marching up and down the field, averaging more than 8 yards per play and scoring 27 points. The Seahawks needed a great game from Darnold.

They got one. Darnold went 25-of-36 for 346 yards with three touchdown passes. His 82.9 Total QBR was the second-best performance by a quarterback this postseason, trailing only Josh Allen's herculean effort to beat the Jaguars in the wild-card round. Without much of a running game throughout the night, Darnold thrived as a dropback passer, throwing for a season-high 248 yards and two touchdowns without play fakes. The game was put on Darnold's shoulders, and he repeatedly responded with accurate throws.

Perhaps as important, the negative plays that sparked so much frustration against the Rams in the past mostly disappeared. Darnold wasn't intercepted and put only one ball in danger all night. He took three sacks, two of which came on plays in which pass rushers were instantly on Darnold, leaving him no choice but go down and eat the football.

Darnold's struggles dealing with sustained pressure have been career-altering moments in the past, but he went 5-of-11 for 102 yards and hit all three of his touchdown passes against pressure. The visible panic and frustration Darnold has shown at times, particularly against these Rams, simply wasn't there. Darnold had been on either side of the timing paradigm, either trying to extend plays and taking too many sacks or getting sped up and getting the ball out too quickly while getting tricked into interceptions. He was repeatedly on time, even under pressure, in the NFC title game.

Organizationally, it seemed the Seahawks realized that their only way through the Rams was with Darnold involved and playing well, too. There was no repeat of the hide-the-QB game plan from the first half of Week 16, as Darnold hit Rashid Shaheed up the sideline for 51 yards on the first third down of the game and averaged 8.6 air yards per throw during Sunday's contest.

And after the Seahawks got their fourth-quarter stop and handed the ball back to Darnold with a four-point lead, Seattle was able to bleed the Rams dry of timeouts and burn most of the remaining clock by staying aggressive and throwing the football. Darnold dropped back five times on second and third downs, and he rewarded the Seahawks for their faith. On a second-and-6 inside Seattle's 10-yard line, offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak dialed up hard play-action and trusted Darnold to turn his back to the defense without giving the ball up. And the QB made the correct decision to check down to Walker, who ran away from a tackle and picked up a first down.

Darnold missed an open Shaheed on the ensuing second down on one of his worst throws of the night, but he made up for it by hitting Cooper Kupp on a crosser on the next play to pick up another first down. With 3:05 to go on the next second down, the Seahawks went back to play-action, and Darnold escaped the pocket to hit Smith-Njigba for another first down on the run. And with 2:17 left, another boot off play-action drew a holding penalty on Rams cornerback Cobie Durant, preventing Los Angeles from getting the ball back with anything more than a prayer. Darnold also hung on to the ball on the ensuing third down when nobody blocked defensive tackle Braden Fiske, who ran over the Seattle quarterback on what appeared to be a busted play.

It's not dismissing Darnold's performance to say that his receivers helped. Shaheed, who had previously made a massive impact as a runner and return man without really contributing as a receiver, finally brought in a deep shot in the opening quarter. Smith-Njigba made a spectacular one-handed catch and spun Kam Curl around on a corner-post route for a 42-yard gain. Kubiak got Smith-Njigba wide open for a touchdown on a blown coverage, lining the star wideout up in the backfield and running him into the end zone on a sail route. Kupp picked up three critical third downs. Heck, Jake Bobo stepped in and ran a post-corner route of his own for a score.

Of course, having a great game against the Rams doesn't inoculate Darnold from struggling in the future. He'll be criticized if he doesn't play well in the Super Bowl. But the idea that having Darnold as your quarterback was disqualifying to your chances of competing for a title? That the journeyman QB would fold when the games really mattered against great defenses? Those lines of thought are out the window. Darnold just outplayed and beat the likely MVP in Matthew Stafford to go to a Super Bowl. For so long, Darnold's past has felt like prologue. Now, it's just the past.

The Rams, meanwhile, will feel like their 2025 losses all blend together. While Stafford and the offense turned the ball over six total times in two inexplicable defeats to the Falcons and Panthers, L.A.'s four other losses generally shared similar scripts. The Rams had weaknesses, and those weaknesses were exploitable. And while they had enough talent and star power to cover up those problems, subpar execution at the wrong time had a way of costing them close games against upper-echelon competition.

If the Rams were losing a big game this season, this was the typical script:

1. The special teams were a disaster. The Rams finished the season 26th in DVOA there, and even that might undersell how dramatically Sean McVay's special teams came up short in key moments. A pair of blocked field goals cost them a win over the Eagles in Week 3. Another block and a miss helped decide a loss to the 49ers in Week 5. The Rams also missed a 48-yard field goal and allowed a Shaheed punt-return touchdown to help fuel the comeback win by the Seahawks in Week 16, leading McVay to fire special teams coordinator Chase Blackburn two days later.

Things haven't gotten much better since then, although the Rams had previously managed to overcome those issues. The Panthers blocked an Ethan Evans punt with 4:18 to go in the fourth quarter in the wild-card round, turning the ensuing short field into a touchdown to take the lead. Evans then managed only a 33-yard punt late in the fourth quarter against the Bears, setting Chicago up at midfield as it drove for the game-tying touchdown at the end of regulation. In both cases, the Rams were able to win the game despite those issues.

They weren't quite as lucky Sunday. This time, punt returner Xavier Smith was to blame. The 28-year-old muffed two punts, and he fell on the first, but wasn't as lucky on the second, as Smith fell over in what must have felt like slow motion before the ball bounced off his body early in the third quarter. The Seahawks recovered on Los Angeles' 17-yard line, and Darnold hit Bobo for a touchdown on the next play. It was the only turnover of the game, and the short field was likely the difference in what was otherwise a very close contest.

Dareke Young was the Seahawks player who initially pressured Smith and then recovered the loose ball. He ran past Rams cornerback Emmanuel Forbes Jr. on punt coverage. Forbes' performance Sunday was part of another common problem for the Rams in their losses ...

2. Teams were able to pick on the cornerbacks. This was the clear weak spot on GM Les Snead's roster, but the Rams trusted that their scheme and pass rush would be enough to cover for an underwhelming crew of cornerbacks. The only significant move they made to add talent at the position was trading for Titans cornerback Roger McCreary, who didn't play for most of the regular season. Forbes outplayed expectations after struggling to live up to his draft stock in Washington, but teams were able to pick on him in key spots, including plays in the Rams' loss to the Eagles and on a pair of fourth-down scores in their loss to the Panthers in Week 13.

The Rams have spent the entire postseason cycling through their options at corner. Ahkello Witherspoon sustained a shoulder injury early in the wild-card win over the Panthers, ending his season, which led the Rams to bring back Darious Williams, who was a healthy scratch for that contest. Forbes also suffered a shoulder injury and played just four snaps in the Rams' win over the Bears last week, leading to larger roles for Williams and McCreary.

Forbes practiced in full on Friday and had no injury designation heading into the game, but despite being one of the team's regular corners alongside Durant for most of the year, he didn't play a single defensive snap in the first half of Sunday's loss. Forbes did play on special teams, which seemed to suggest that he might not be able to tackle if used on defense -- but then the Rams put the third-year pro on the field for 24 defensive snaps in the second half. If Forbes was healthy enough to play defense after halftime, why wasn't he on the field beforehand?

The answer is the Rams were probably desperate to get Williams off the field at that point. The veteran, whose spot on the roster has likely been a product of his $8 million in salary guarantees this season, was a liability for the Rams early in this game. Shaheed simply torched the 32-year-old for a 51-yard gain on the opening series, with an ankle tackle required to save a touchdown. On the next snap, Williams played off-coverage against Smith-Njigba, with the Seahawks throwing a one-step hitch to their star wideout, who simply vaporized Williams with a juke. Smith-Njigba then picked up 16 yards on a curl against Williams in the second quarter. In all, Williams played just nine defensive snaps in the third quarter and none in the fourth.

Williams wasn't the only cornerback who struggled. Durant had a key third-down pass breakup, but he allowed a touchdown pass to Bobo, appeared to be one of the defenders involved in the blown coverage on the Smith-Njigba score, gave up a critical third-down conversion to Kupp on the final drive and finished the day by being flagged for holding on Kupp to all but end the game.

3. A fourth-down play goes awry. Some of those fourth downs were kicks, but the Rams' loss to the 49ers swung on a red zone fumble by Kyren Williams and a subsequent fourth-down failure in overtime, when McVay regretted dialing up a duo run for Williams on fourth-and-1 in the red zone while trailing by three. The 49ers stuffed it for no gain to end the game.

Last time, McVay blamed himself. This time, after the Rams were stopped on fourth-and-4 from the 6-yard line with 4:59 to go, he had a more curious culprit. I'm not sure I've ever heard a coach blame the other team busting a coverage for stopping their fourth-down play, but that's exactly what McVay did after the game: ""They kinda lucked into having two guys peel on Kyren right there. I know that can't be part of their design. So it was a fortuitous bust by them.""

I wouldn't judge Seahawks fans for seeing that quote and screaming about sour grapes, but let's understand what happened from McVay's perspective, too. On the fourth-and-4, the Seahawks were crowding the line of scrimmage and showing a zero blitz, suggesting to Stafford that he needed to get the ball out quickly. At the snap, they actually dropped out and rushed only three, bracketing Puka Nacua in the slot.

McVay has grown fond of throwing the ball to Williams on third and fourth downs this season on choice routes, where Williams has a lot of open space and the ability to break inside or outside depending on the leverage of the coverage. It's a natural place to go with the football when we consider how much attention teams are putting on Nacua and Davante Adams in key spots. Williams is never getting double-covered in those situations, and if the Rams create space for him with their route distribution, it's almost impossible for the defender to be right.

On this play, Williams released upfield and headed toward the end zone. The end man on the line was safety Julian Love, who looked like he was beat quickly by Williams while trying to drop into coverage, but edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence also dropped off and ran with Williams, taking away the quick throwing lane for Stafford, who had to work elsewhere. The veteran eventually forced a throw to Terrance Ferguson against tight coverage from Devon Witherspoon, with the pass falling incomplete. Fortuitous coverage bust? Or did Mike Macdonald recognize McVay's tendency of creating space for Williams in key spots and double the right guy at the right time? Ultimately, it doesn't matter; the Rams failed on a key fourth down, and they never came close to taking the lead again.

There was another factor that hasn't typically been a problem in 2025. McVay has massively improved his game management and fourth-down decision-making this season after lagging behind the rest of the league for most of his tenure as a head coach. On Sunday, though, McVay made two obvious mistakes, and they might very well have changed the game.

Late in the third quarter, the Rams got a huge break courtesy of Seahawks corner Riq Woolen, who dropped a pick, was then flagged for taunting to give the Rams a first down, and then immediately allowed a long touchdown pass to Nacua on the next play. While the Rams were perhaps still emotionally recovering on the sideline from Woolen's vicious taunting, McVay made a simple mistake.

The touchdown put the Rams down five at 31-26, pending the extra point. McVay kicked. There's not a huge win probability swing by kicking there, given how much time was left, but ESPN's win probability model suggests that teams should go for two in that situation if they have even a 33% chance of converting. The Rams, with a historically efficient rushing attack, certainly would trust their chances of converting at a higher rate.

Coaches aren't necessarily thinking about those endgame scenarios late in the third quarter, and there's an old coaching trope about how teams shouldn't go for two until the fourth quarter, even if the current score suggests that a 2-pointer would be valuable. It's one of those numbers-based arguments that never seems to hold up under scrutiny. Conservative coaches and announcers often justify taking the points and kicking field goals early in games by using the present score and plugging in what a field goal would do; indeed, we'll talk in a minute about the Broncos, who were supposed to take the points and go up 10-0 to make the game a two-score contest in the second quarter.

Why should the present score matter if you take the points but not matter if you're going for two? The benefits of going for two down five are obvious: You'd need a touchdown to win whether you're down four or five, but if you get the 2-pointer, you'd be down three and can tie the game with a field goal. You wouldn't know if you'll need that 2-pointer, but you also don't know whether that field goal to make it a two-possession game in the first half will end up being essential by the end of the day, either.

Computers can do a better job of sorting through all the various scenarios of how many possessions are left and how likely each team is to score in advance of a 2-point decision like that, but the simplest argument is to act on what the score is right now. And after a 28-point third quarter, neither team scored in the fourth, meaning that the Rams really did need that 2-pointer.

If the Rams had failed and stayed down five, their endgame wouldn't have changed. If they had succeeded and been down three, of course, the Rams could have kicked a field goal to tie the game with 4:59 to go on fourth-and-4. Instead, down by four points, they had no choice but to try scoring a touchdown.

The other mistake came on the ensuing possession. While the refs ruled that Kupp's catch on third-and-7 gave the Seahawks a first down, the initial replays seemed to hint that the veteran wideout might have been just short of the sticks. McVay called his second timeout, then had his challenge flag in his hand, but he didn't risk using his final timeout to challenge the spot.

This was a clear mistake. Given a tight spot and the game situation, McVay very clearly should have just thrown the challenge flag to have the spot reviewed as opposed to calling a traditional timeout. If the challenge had failed, nothing would have changed: The Rams would have essentially burned a timeout to stop the clock. And if the challenge succeeded, of course, the Rams wouldn't have lost a timeout and could have used it to stop the clock in advance of a fourth-down decision by Seattle.

Coaches don't want to waste challenges, but there was virtually no downside here. The Rams were a minute away from the two-minute warning, at which point all challenges come from the replay booth. McVay had two challenges remaining. Unless he thought that the initial spot was ruled short on the field, believed it was fourth down and used his timeout before learning otherwise, this was a missed opportunity.

Those decisions didn't single-handedly decide the game, but the Rams stacked some sloppy decision-making and work on the field. Stafford and the rest of the offense couldn't overcome those mistakes.

Patriots 10, Broncos 7

Nobody said it had to be pretty. The most memorable game of the 2001 Patriots' trip to the Super Bowl was their divisional-round win over the Raiders in Foxborough. While we call that the ""Tuck Rule"" game because of the fateful call that overturned a Tom Brady fumble, the most impressive play from that matchup was Adam Vinatieri's 45-yard field goal in whiteout conditions to tie the game with 27 seconds to go. The legendary kicker then hit a 23-yarder in overtime, sending the Pats to the AFC title game and eventually to a stunning Super Bowl victory.

Sunday's win over the Broncos won't be quite as memorable. It was decided by a 23-yard field goal from Andy Borregales, but that kick came early in the third quarter and was the only successful try out of five attempts by the two kickers in this game. Conditions were fine during the first half, but by midway through the third quarter, weather took over the contest and reduced the game to something out of the 1970s, both in terms of play selection and video fidelity.

The Broncos managed just 32 yards and one first down over their five possessions in the second half. Jarrett Stidham got off to a solid start, but after the first quarter, his 26 dropbacks produced just 37 net yards. Denver's best chance of scoring in the second half came after a brutal 33-yard punt by Bryce Baringer, which handed the Broncos the ball in field goal range, only for Wil Lutz's 45-yard kick to be blocked.

Stidham made the game's biggest mistake, though. Facing pressure on a third-and-4, he drifted backward and tried to get outside the pocket to avoid an intentional grounding penalty. Stidham tried to flip the ball out just as he was hit by Christian Elliss. The play was initially ruled as grounding before being reevaluated as a backward pass and fumble. The Pats were denied a defensive touchdown by the referees blowing the play dead, but Drake Maye ran a touchdown in from 6 yards out to tie the game at 7.

The Broncos will feel like they missed an opportunity. Maye and the Patriots' offense did little in this game, struggling to consistently move the ball even before the weather arrived. Just two of New England's 12 drives yielded more than one first down. Denver safety Talanoa Hufanga dropped what would have been an interception on the Pats' opening series of the game, with the Broncos fooling Maye in coverage as the second-year star tried to throw a slant to Stefon Diggs.

If Stidham just goes down for a harmless sack on that third-and-4 and the Broncos punt the ball away, they might have been OK. The weather might have kept the Patriots from having any chance of scoring in the fourth quarter.

Sean Payton was second-guessed during and after the game for deciding against kicking a field goal to go up 10-0 early in the second quarter. With Denver facing a fourth-and-1 on New England's 14-yard line, the ESPN Analytics model was very comfortable with Payton's decision at the time. (Running the ball might have been preferable, though, to the Broncos putting the ball in the hands of their backup quarterback.)

Payton might have wanted to play for a low-scoring game if he knew the weather system was going to be as severe as it was by the second half, but the way the game played out is evidence of how valuable a touchdown can be in this sort of contest. If the Broncos kick a field goal and nothing else changes, the score's 10-10, and the game goes to overtime, where they have a 50-50 shot of winning. If they convert and score a touchdown and nothing else changes, they win 14-10 and go to the Super Bowl. Given how little the Patriots were able to do on offense, 14 points might very well have been insurmountable.

The other what-if will be more painful, given that the Broncos didn't have Bo Nix on Sunday. Nix had his ups and downs this season, but he was essentially a league-average starter for the second consecutive year, and that's a lot better than Stidham, who wasn't able to do much after the scripted plays ran out. He hit Marvin Mims Jr. with a great throw past a flat-footed Christian Gonzalez for a 52-yard gain to set up Denver's only touchdown. But Stidham's six other throws of 10 or more yards downfield produced just 6 yards.

Ending the year without Nix was obviously unlucky, and the Broncos were without wideout Troy Franklin and lost fellow wideout Pat Bryant to an injury for the second consecutive week. But this was a relatively healthy team in 2025, with Nix and safety Brandon Jones (who was hurt late in the year) as the only starters to finish the season on injured reserve. The Broncos were also one of the league's oldest teams on a snap-weighted age basis, and so while the Broncos do have some young stars, Payton has relied on veterans and free agent additions to help make them competitive. That nearly led them to a Super Bowl, but after going 9-2 in one-score games and adding a 10th close win against the Bills last week, the Broncos weren't able to squeak out another narrow win at home in the AFC Championship Game.

Given those factors, it's tough to imagine them being back here again in 2026, although it's fair to say there weren't many people who expected the Broncos to be hosting the Patriots in this game at the start of the season, either.

As for the Patriots, well, they might be even more difficult to evaluate now than they were before the postseason. Before the playoffs, everybody could agree that Maye was playing lights-out football and that the Pats had benefited from playing an easy schedule. They eventually finished, per Pro-Football-Reference.com's methodology, with the 10th-easiest regular-season schedule for any team since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. The postseason was supposed to be a test of whether the Patriots were for real.

Winning means you pass the test, of course, but it's not exactly happening the way we would have expected. Maye has struggled through a difficult postseason, running a 51.1 Total QBR, which was roughly about what Tyler Shough had during the regular season. He has held on to the ball too long, fumbled six times and thrown two interceptions, although he was able to make it through Sunday's game without turning the ball over.

Maye has made a handful of perfect throws during this run, including a flea-flicker to Mack Hollins that served as his only completion of more than 10 yards on Sunday. He has also made an impact with his legs, which was Maye's primary contribution in the Pat's win over the Broncos. He turned 10 carries into 65 yards, including a 6-yard touchdown and scrambles of 13, 16 and 28 yards, which set up the game-winning field goal and two Borregales misses. Maye sealed the AFC up by keeping the ball on a third-down naked bootleg and outrunning Jonah Elliss to the sideline for a first down to end the game. It wasn't a memorable passing performance, but Maye still found a way to add meaningful value on a day when the Pats couldn't do much on offense.

And ironically enough, if Maye does end up winning the Super Bowl, this will go down as one of the more impressive runs through defensive juggernauts by any quarterback in recent memory. By EPA per play rankings, Maye has already beaten the third- (Texans), sixth- (Chargers) and seventh-best (Broncos) defenses in football. He's about to face the best by this metric in the Seahawks in Super Bowl LX. I won't argue that he has been anywhere near as impressive in the playoffs as he was during the regular season, but if Maye wins in two weeks, there can't be many quarterbacks who have beaten four of the league's top seven defenses in a single postseason run.

Instead, the story of the playoffs for the Patriots has been their defense. While advanced metrics were still fond of Maye even after adjusting for quality of opposition, the same wasn't true for the defense. New England's defense finished the season 23rd in DVOA and 18th in ESPN's Football Power Index. The Pats lost star defensive tackle Milton Williams to a midseason ankle injury before returned in Week 18, but they weren't rated as a top-10 unit even before he went down.

Since the start of the postseason, though, the Pats have suffocated opposing offenses. They've allowed a total of 26 points through three games. With the offense struggling, Zak Kuhr's defense has also faced a ton of possessions, making that an even more impressive figure. The Pats are allowing just 0.72 points per drive in the playoffs. Since 2000, the only team to play three postseason games on their side of the bracket and allow fewer points per drive is the 2000 Ravens, who were one of the most dominant defenses in NFL history.

Of course, as always with the 2025 Patriots, there are reasons to be skeptical. Every team the Pats have faced was compromised by injuries. The Chargers were down their top two offensive tackles (Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater) and couldn't protect Justin Herbert. The Texans entered their divisional-round game without Nico Collins and then lost Dalton Schultz in the first half, costing C.J. Stroud his top two receivers. And the Broncos were starting Stidham, who hadn't thrown an NFL pass in two years, with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. Throw in some messy weather to help out the defense, and we can talk ourselves into the Pats' defense being a mirage.

The truth is somewhere in between. This unit was unlucky in terms of red zone performance during the regular season, ranking fifth by EPA per play outside the red zone and 28th inside the 20. The Patriots really did miss Williams, who had three of the team's five quick pressures on Sunday. K'Lavon Chaisson has had a career year, and he had a much-needed solid performance with Harold Landry III sidelined, but the strength of the Pats' pass rush is the interior pressure from Williams and Christian Barmore.

Their other strength is at cornerback, and that's where the story might crystallize. When the Patriots signed Carlton Davis III this offseason in free agency, it seemed they were establishing a clear plan of playing plenty of man coverage. The Pats had been one of the league's most man-heavy defenses under Bill Belichick and Jerod Mayo, and in Gonzalez, they already possessed one of the league's finest young cover corners. Combining Gonzalez and Davis gave the Pats the freedom to do whatever they wanted in coverage.

During the regular season, though, the Pats didn't really play much man, perhaps to make life easier for rookie safety Craig Woodson. They were in man coverage just 37.2% of the time, which ranked 23rd in the league. While Kuhr went to playing man more than 50% of the time in the Pats' Week 15 loss to the Bills, they were generally a zone coverage team. That extended through the first two weeks of the postseason.

On Sunday, though, the Patriots played man on 50% of Stidham's dropbacks. They dominated Denver's receivers in the process. Stidham went 11-of-16 for 97 yards against zone looks, but the Broncos starter was 6-of-15 for just 36 yards with a touchdown and an interception (by Gonzalez) against man coverage. Getting into man looks allowed the Pats to blitz Stidham more than 40% of the time, and he averaged just 2.5 yards per pass attempt against the blitz.

Were the Patriots willing to lean into man coverage only because of the presence of Stidham and the dismal weather in Denver? Or was this a sign that they're going to be more aggressive playing man in the Super Bowl? Belichick was famously insistent on stopping the opposing team's top playmaker in big games. And while the Pats could try sticking Gonzalez on Smith-Njigba, Belichick typically preferred to bracket or double-team the opposing team's star while sticking his best cover corner on the opposing team's second-best wideout.

There'll be plenty of more time to talk about that in next week's Super Bowl preview, but on Sunday, the Pats were able to get aggressive on defense and squeak out a close victory.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0126%2Fr1605700_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:06:12.361971

While many eyes will be on the Senior Bowl this week, college all-star games have been going on all month, and the Saints' scouting department has been busy at all of them. Here's a quick look at the buzz from the all-star game circuit.

NFL-FCS Showcase (Nashville, Tenn.)

The Saints were one of several to meet with Alabama State left tackle Desmond Daniels at the FCS Showcase all-star game, per Easton Butler of 247 Sports. Daniels was limited to just four games by a knee injury but already underwent surgery and has returned to practice, which is a good sign, and it's notable that the Saints previously visited Alabama State's campus (per Jaeden Day for the Montgomery Adveritser). Butler added that the Saints were one of eleven teams that met with Colgate wide receiver Treyvhon Saunders at the same event. Saunders finished second in receptions (50) and receiving yards (700), with six touchdowns. Both prospects are potential third-day draft picks in the later rounds.

Hula Bowl (DeLand, Fla.)

At the Hula Bowl, Commanding the Huddle's Ryan Fowler reports the Saints were among many teams that spent time with UTSA linebacker Shad Banks Jr., another Day 3 prospect. Butler also shared that the Saints met with Delaware offensive lineman Fintan Brose (who has started games at every spot but left tackle) at this all-star game. Draft Diamonds senior writer Jimmy Williams noted that more than 20 teams, including the Saints, visited with Georgia Southern wide receiver Camden Brown. New Orleans also met with Kansas running back Leshon Williams, per Sleeper's Arye Pulli. Williams transferred from Iowa to help replace Devin Neal and rushed for 560 yards on just 97 carries. Each of these guys are seen as late-round picks or priority free agents.

College Gridiron Showcase (Fort Worth, Texas)

Reporting from the College Gridiron Showcase, Draft Prep's Malik Boynton listed the Saints among six teams that met with Baylor safety Devyn Bobby. Butler reported that Western Michigan tight end Blake Bosma also spoke with the Saints here; he added that Old Dominion cornerback Botros Alisandro was on their list of visits, too. The Saints met with Troy tight end Ethan Conner here, too, per KPRC2 Houston's Aaron Wilson. These prospects are each hoping to hear their names called in the draft's later rounds.

The American Bowl (Lakeland, Fla.)

Another college all-star game, the American Bowl, had almost half the league (the Saints among them) spending time with James Madison cornerback Elijah Culp, per Butler's reporting. 7 News Boston WHDH's Ethan Hurwitz shared that even more teams, including New Orleans, checked in on Penn State center Nick Dawkins at this event. Butler added that Mississippi State outside linebacker Malick Sylla highlighted his time with the Saints among meetings with 21 different teams. Of the group, Sylla and Dawkins seem likeliest to be drafted.

East-West Shrine Bowl (Frisco, Texas)

Fowler specified that the Saints were one of six teams that interviewed Wake Forest running back Demond Claiborne at the East-West Shrine Bowl, and that they had a formal meeting with him. While they didn't sit down with him in a formal meeting, Butler noted that the Saints and all 31 other teams spent time with Navy defensive tackle Landon Robinson, too. Claiborne could be picked early in Round 4 on the third day of the draft, and Robinson may not be far behind. USA TODAY's Josh Carney reports the Saints met with Louisiana linebacker Jaden Dugger, as did the other 31 teams. He's a draftable prospect in the later rounds.

Of course these are just some of the prospects the Saints have met up with in recent weeks, and we don't know how intensive those conversations are. In many cases it's as simple as a scout or position coach exchanging contact information to set up a later visit. We also only know the meetings that have been reported, and the team is contacting dozens of players each week. Eventually, everybody has spoken with everybody at some point between the all-star games, NFL Scouting Combine, pro day workouts, and formal visits at the team facility. Don't read too deeply into these reports. But they are something to file away for later if a couple of those players do end up in New Orleans.","https://saintswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/26/SSNT/88364892007-usatsi-27953464.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-27 13:06:16.134680

Football is a team sport and there are several reasons why Allen, Jackson and Mayfield have come up short.

“There was a lot that I didn’t know back then, so I’m just going to continue to learn and grow in this great game,” Darnold said.","Sam Darnold will be starting in the Super Bowl before Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen and the rest of the NFL’s Class of 2018 quarterbacks.

It took Darnold five teams and eight seasons to get here.

Darnold led the Seattle Seahawks to a 14-3 record, a division title, the No. 1 seed and was at his best in the NFC championship game.

Seahawks had a brilliant way to get JSN open in NFC title win

Despite an oblique injury, Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in Seattle’s 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. He completed 25 of 36 passes and had no turnovers.

“He just shut a lot of people up,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said. “Really happy for him.”

Labeled a bust early in his career, Darnold was still doubted by critics following his impressive turnaround.

Now, he’s one win away from hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Seahawks are 4 1/2-point favorites over the New England Patriots on BetMGM Sportsbook.

Darnold was picked No. 3 overall by the New York Jets in 2018. Baker Mayfield went first to the Cleveland Browns. Allen went to the Buffalo Bills at No. 7. Josh Rosen was chosen 10th by the Arizona Cardinals. The Baltimore Ravens selected Jackson with the final pick of the first round at No. 32.

Jackson has won two AP NFL MVP awards and is 0-1 in the AFC championship game. Allen is the reigning NFL MVP and twice lost to the Chiefs in the AFC title game.

Mayfield led the Browns to their only playoff victory this century and has won two division titles and one playoff game with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, his fourth team.

Rosen was traded by Arizona after going 3-10 as a rookie and is out of the NFL after starting just three more games.

Darnold’s success doesn’t make others failures. Football is a team sport and there are several reasons why Allen, Jackson and Mayfield have come up short. Both Allen and Jackson saw their coaches fired this month because their teams didn’t live up to expectations.

Darnold’s story is about perseverance and redemption. It’s another clear example why coaching matters.

Darnold struggled mightily during three seasons with the Jets playing for coaches Todd Bowles and Adam Gase, and offensive coordinators Jeremy Bates and Dowell Loggains. His 78.2 passer rating during that time ranked third worst among 53 QBs with at least 500 attempts.

Darnold went to Carolina and played two seasons for coaches Matt Rhule and Steve Wilks, and coordinators Jeff Nixon, Joe Brady and Ben McAdoo.

None of them could unlock his potential. He didn’t have the right coaching or supporting cast, and his teams lacked stability.

Then he spent a season with Kyle Shanahan and assistants Klint and Klay Kubiak in San Francisco in 2023. Darnold backed up Brock Purdy on a 49ers team that reached the Super Bowl. He got a chance to watch, learn and study in an environment that fostered growth.

Shanahan praised Darnold’s arm talent, his ability to read defenses and run the offensive scheme.

Darnold went to Minnesota and thrived under coach Kevin O’Connell. He had a breakthrough season in 2024, throwing for 4,319 yards and 35 TDs while having a 102.5 passer rating and leading the Vikings to 14 wins.

But Minnesota chose to stick with J.J. McCarthy, whose injury opened the door for Darnold to play and flourish.

Based off his success with the Vikings, the Seahawks gave Darnold a three-year, $100.5 million contract to replace Geno Smith. He became the first quarterback in NFL history to lead two different teams to 14 wins in consecutive seasons. Tom Brady did it with the Patriots.

“We believe in him. The building believes in him. The city believes in him. It’s awesome to run out onto the field with him,” All-Pro wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba said.

Darnold has come a long way since telling coaches he was “seeing ghosts” during a lopsided loss to the Patriots in his second season.

“There was a lot that I didn’t know back then, so I’m just going to continue to learn and grow in this great game,” Darnold said. “There is a lot of stuff that I can get better from today even. I feel like I missed some throws out there that I shouldn’t miss. There were some things offensively that I feel like we can do better. So, we’re always looking to get better. I’m always looking to get better. That’s the great part about this game is you win an NFC championship and you win games throughout the season, but there is always ways that you can look to get better.”

Chao, who spent nearly two decades working as the official team doctor for the then-San Diego Chargers, has transitioned into the world of sports media and provides instant injury analysis for fans of the NFL, NBA and MLB — and made the argument that Maye suffered an injury on Sunday.

“Drake Maye injured his right throwing shoulder against the Broncos,” Chao wrote on X on Monday, with his post accompanied by a four-minute video explaining his totally unsubstantiated diagnosis. “How severe the injury is, and the exact diagnosis, remains to be determined. Heading into Super Bowl LX, I’m far more concerned about Maye’s shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique.”

It’s safe to say that his argument is rather shaky, as is his past. Chao has a history of medical malpractice and was sued on two separate occasions with damages awarded totaling over $6 million, according to The Law Offices of Melinda J. Helbock.

What does any of this mean?

Maye’s shoulder will be something to watch for, as he did reach for it on a couple of occasions after taking a hit in the third quarter on Sunday. The Patriots’ first injury report of the week is due on Wednesday, and his appearance or lack thereof will help bring some clarity to an odd situation.

If we don’t see the sophomore signal-caller, it’s safe to say he’ll be ready to go for Super Bowl LX. If we do, there’s a wonder of just how substantial the injury is and whether or not it will impact his availability — though something tells us there isn’t too much to worry about.

Though he managed to exit the field independently, the 30 year old proceeded directly to the blue medical tent for evaluation. Subsequently, he departed for the locker room and was removed from action.

""They need him. This is big,"" Romo observed as CBS was obligated to transition to commercials.

Spillane serves as a team captain and has become a key voice within the Patriots' defensive unit. He joined New England through a three-year, $33 million free agency contract in March, drawn by the chance to compete under head coach Mike Vrabel.

He swiftly became a cornerstone on defense, valued for both his three-down versatility and leadership qualities. Spillane began the season as New England's top linebacker and participated in 95.4 percent of snaps during the first 13 games of the campaign.

Spillane sustained a foot injury before New England's Week 15 matchup against the Buffalo Bills and missed the rest of the regular season due to this setback. The veteran made his comeback for the playoffs and took the field for a total of 96.3 percent of plays against the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans, recording 12 tackles and a vital pair of pass breakups.

His loss was deeply felt by the Pats as the Broncos looked to capitalize on the opportunity. Denver seized control of the AFC Championship game early, with Stidham connecting on a 6-yard touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton within the opening five minutes.

Following Spillane's departure from the game against Denver, backup Jack Gibbens assumed duties as the Patriots' defensive field general. Gibbens fulfilled that identical responsibility during Spillane's earlier absence this season.

Nevertheless, the Patriots defense performed impressively and will believe the unit earned a touchdown. With 3:11 left in the opening half on third-and-4, Stidham took a hit and seemed to fumble the football, which rolled toward the sideline where Elijah Ponder gathered the loose ball.

The linebacker then sprinted into the end zone without being touched for a defensive score, but officials blew their whistles and ruled the play dead.

The referees initially called the play an incomplete pass and intentional grounding. Following a review, however, they determined it was a fumble recovered by New England, creating an immediate red zone chance.

Ultimately, Tua Tagovailoa's story is one of talent, resilience, and a clear vision for his future.","It’s easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of professional sports, especially the NFL. For a player like Tua Tagovailoa, that whirlwind has been particularly intense. We've seen him rise, face a significant setback, and now, he's charting his course forward. It’s a story that’s less about flashy headlines and more about resilience.

Back in 2017, Tua was a name on everyone's lips. Leading Alabama to a national championship win as a freshman, he wasn't just a promising talent; he was seen as a future star, potentially the top pick in the NFL draft. His college career was marked by impressive stats and accolades, a testament to his skill and leadership on the field.

But then came November 16th. A devastating hip dislocation against Mississippi State ended his season prematurely. This wasn't just a minor injury; it was a serious blow that cast a shadow over his NFL prospects. Many players in his position might have opted to stay in college, focus on recovery, and perhaps finish their degree. Tua, however, made a different choice.

He decided to enter the NFL draft. Explaining his decision, Tua spoke about the profound influence of his parents, a reflection of his Samoan heritage where family guidance is paramount. He also articulated a pragmatic view: even with a potential future injury, securing a professional salary would benefit not just himself but also those who supported him. It was a mature perspective, demonstrating a readiness to embrace the next chapter, regardless of the team that called his name.

Interestingly, when asked about his ideal NFL destination, Tua didn't shy away from naming the Dallas Cowboys, the team he grew up cheering for. He was quick to clarify, though, that his intention wasn't to displace their current quarterback, Dak Prescott. Instead, he expressed a desire to learn, to be part of a team, and simply to get back on the field and compete. This desire to play, to contribute, and to grow under experienced guidance speaks volumes about his character.

His journey also highlights the interconnectedness of the football world. We've seen him share a unique bond with fellow Hawaiian and former NFL star Marcus Mariota, who mentored him in high school. This kind of mentorship, passing down wisdom and experience, is invaluable.

More recently, Tua has been navigating discussions surrounding potential interest in Tom Brady by his team, the Miami Dolphins. He's handled these conversations with a grounded approach, emphasizing his presence as the team's quarterback and dismissing the surrounding noise. He's focused on his role, on the team's current situation, and on the support he feels. It’s a testament to his ability to stay centered amidst external pressures.

Ultimately, Tua Tagovailoa's story is one of talent, resilience, and a clear vision for his future. From the highs of championship victories to the lows of serious injury, and now navigating the complexities of the NFL, he continues to approach his career with a blend of ambition and humility. It’s a journey that continues to unfold, and one that many are watching with keen interest.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-27 04:58:51.042500

Follow along with Yahoo Sports for the latest NFL news, injury updates and more leading up to Super Bowl 60.","The matchup for Super Bowl LX is officially set, as the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots prepare for the big game, with kickoff set for Sunday, February 8, at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.

The Patriots rallied in a low-scoring affair with Denver to kick off championship Sunday, defeating the Jarrett Stidham-led Broncos 10-7. Denver was without Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the team’s overtime win over the Bills in the divisional round, while a snowy and windy second half rendered offensive production on either side ineffective. MVP candidate and second-year quarterback Drake Maye cleaned up the turnovers, which have plagued him as of late, leading New England to advance to Super Bowl 60 in Mike Vrabel’s first year as the team’s head coach with just 86 total passing yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions.

The NFC championship offered NFL fans seeking offense a bit more joie de vivre, as the Los Angeles Rams and Seahawks combined for 879 yards of offense. Seattle defeated LA 31-27, despite a strong performance from Matthew Stafford, who finished the day with 374 passing yards, 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions, taking just a single sack on the day for a nine-yard loss. Sam Darnold posted an equally impressive stat line of 346 yards, 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions after having struggled against the Rams over two games in the regular season (two touchdowns, six interceptions).

LA’s hopes of another Super Bowl under head coach Sean McVay were nearly realized with a third-quarter taunting penalty against Seahawks cornerback Riq Woolen to set up a Rams touchdown that kept it close. However, late in the fourth quarter, the Seahawks managed a fourth-down stop at the goal line, which had the potential to give the Rams a late lead. That play — which McVay later called a “fortuitous bust” in his post-game presser — all but sealed the deal on Seattle’s trip to Santa Clara.

Meanwhile, the head coaching searches for the Las Vegas Raiders, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns and Arizona Cardinals continue this week, with those teams now able to pursue additional interviews with candidates from the staff of the Broncos and Los Angeles Rams, now that they’ve been eliminated from postseason contention.

While there won't be official injury reports until next week, Macdonald gave a few updates on his team's injuries coming out of Sunday's win.

Quarterback Sam Darnold, who had a phenomenal game, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns, was limited in practice last week due to the oblique injury he suffered in practice leading up to the divisional round. Whether Darnold will continue to be limited in his preparation this week or next week remains to be seen.

""I don't know what the trajectory is, how many reps he's going to need, how much he's going to want to take,"" Macdonald said. ""I don't know that yet.""

The news was positive on left tackle Charles Cross, who was able to play Sunday despite leaving the divisional round win with a foot injury.

""To my knowledge, he's good, just a little sore,"" Macdonald said.

The Seahawks had two players leave Sunday's win with injuries, fullback/tight end and special teams standout Brady Russell, who has a hand injury, and linebacker Drake Thomas, who has a shoulder injury.

On Russell, Macdonald said, ""He's got a hand right now, so we'll just kind of work through it on what the timing is and what we need to do.""

And on Thomas, Macdonald said. ""I don't know the extent of practice available and all that, but it's just a shoulder right now.""

Fullback Robbie Ouzts missed Sunday's game due to a neck injury, and Macdonald did not know yet whether Ouzts will be back for the Super Bowl, though that is the hope.

""We hope so,"" he said. ""It's got to calm down so we can have a better feel for how it's going to look.

Almost two weeks after suffering a season-ending Achilles injury, Kittle was back out on the golf course -- albeit with a few creative adjustments.

Kittle tore his right Achilles tendon during the NFL Wild Card Game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Jan. 11 and underwent surgery three days later, on Jan. 14. He shared a video to Instagram on Friday of himself back on the golf course. While still unable to put weight on his foot, Kittle joined 49ers teammates Brock Purdy, Trent Williams and Kyle Juszczyk, and found a workaround that allowed him to participate.

The 32-year-old tight end remained seated in his golf cart while using a device from Power2Golf, a $1,500 attachment that allows golfers to hit shots without swinging. The setup allowed Kittle to launch long-range shots from the cart.

After the 49ers’ win over the Eagles, San Francisco moved forward without Kittle and later suffered a 41-6 blowout loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFL Divisional Round.

Injuries were a recurring storyline for Kittle this season. He missed five games earlier in the year with a Grade 3 hamstring strain, sat out another contest in December due to a left ankle sprain, and also dealt with a recurring thigh injury that sidelined him in Weeks 3 and 11.

Report details Seahawks WR Cooper Kupp’s turmoil with Rams

It also helps that there’s a two-week gap between the conference title games and the Super Bowl on Feb. 8, which provides an opportunity for some extra rest.

During his Monday afternoon press conference, Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said the team will take Tuesday and Wednesday off before returning to the practice field Thursday. Macdonald said the team then plans to fly to the Bay Area on Sunday, which gives them a full week in California ahead of Super Bowl 60 against the New England Patriots in Santa Clara.

Below is a recap of what Macdonald said when asked about the injury statuses of a handful of players.

• Macdonald said starting linebacker Drake Thomas is doing “good” after exiting the NFC title game with a shoulder injury in the second half, but that he doesn’t know what his practice availability will look like this week.

• Macdonald said the team is hopeful that rookie fullback Robbie Ouzts can return for the Super Bowl, but that his neck injury needs to “calm down.” Ouzts was inactive for the NFC title game after being listed as questionable on Friday’s injury report.

“It’s gotta calm down, so we can have a better feel for how it’s gonna look,” Macdonald said. “But I’m not sure what his practice status is gonna be this week. I’m not sure.”

• Macdonald said the team is still working through the status of fullback/key special teamer Brady Russell, who exited the NFC title with a hand injury in the second half.

“He’s got a hand right now, so we’ll just kind of work through it on what the timing is and what we need to do,” Macdonald said.

• Macdonald said left tackle Charles Cross is “good” after starting and playing all 67 snaps in the NFC title game. He exited Seattle’s Jan. 17 divisional round game with a foot injury and was sidelined for the first two practices last week before being listed as a full participant in last Friday’s practice.

“To my knowledge, he’s good,” Macdonald said. “He’s just a little sore.”

• When asked about the upcoming practice plan for quarterback Sam Darnold, Macdonald said he’s not sure yet how many reps he’ll take over the next two weeks. Darnold has been playing through an oblique injury that he suffered during a Jan. 15 practice. He was limited during practice last week.

“I don’t know what the trajectory is with how many reps he’s gonna need or how much he’s gonna want to take,” Macdonald said. “I don’t know that yet.”

Her simple social media post, shared during championship weekend, reflected resilience and acceptance as Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time in years and shifted focus from title runs to recovery and family.

January has rarely looked this quiet for the Mahomes household. For years, this stretch of the NFL calendar meant pressure, playoff noise, and championship stakes. This time, the spotlight landed somewhere unexpected. While the AFC Championship unfolded without Kansas City, Brittany Mahomes made it clear she was already living in the offseason. Instead of a stadium suite or sideline celebration, Brittany chose a gym mirror and a message that spoke louder than words. Her social post, shared during the height of championship weekend, reflected both acceptance and resolve. It was a subtle signal that the chapter had turned, even if the hunger to return has not faded.

Brittany Mahomes embraces reset as Chiefs era pauses

Brittany Mahomes posted a workout selfie during the AFC Championship game with a caption that caught fans’ attention. “Vibing to this song every day for forever,” she wrote, pairing it with Ella Langley’s “Choosin' Texas.” The song choice nodded to shared roots with her husband, Patrick Mahomes, and hinted at grounding rather than disappointment. For seven straight seasons, the Kansas City Chiefs owned a place in the AFC Championship conversation. That run ended abruptly this year after Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers. The injury reshaped everything. Kansas City missed the playoffs, and January became about recovery instead of rivalry. While Brittany focused on fitness and routine, the New England Patriots edged past Denver to reach Super Bowl LX. It was a stark contrast to last postseason, when Brittany celebrated wins alongside global stars and postseason confetti filled the air. Now, the Mahomes family rhythm looks different. Patrick has leaned into rehab while spending time with Brittany and their children, including celebrating daughter Golden’s first birthday. The pause has not dulled ambition. It has sharpened it. Brittany’s post was not about absence. It was about resilience. The Chiefs are out this January, but the message from their most visible supporter was unmistakable. The reset is real, and the return is already on their minds.

David J. Chao isn’t so sure, however…

Chao, who spent nearly two decades working as the official team doctor for the then-San Diego Chargers, has transitioned into the world of sports media and provides instant injury analysis for fans of the NFL, NBA and MLB — and made the argument that Maye suffered an injury on Sunday.

“Drake Maye injured his right throwing shoulder against the Broncos,” Chao wrote on X on Monday, with his post accompanied by a four-minute video explaining his totally unsubstantiated diagnosis. “How severe the injury is, and the exact diagnosis, remains to be determined. Heading into Super Bowl LX, I’m far more concerned about Maye’s shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique.”

It’s safe to say that his argument is rather shaky, as is his past. Chao has a history of medical malpractice and was sued on two separate occasions with damages awarded totaling over $6 million, according to The Law Offices of Melinda J. Helbock.

The memory Izzy shared earlier this week of a stunned hallway will be forever imprinted upon my heart. Sometimes a momma can’t make it better. Sometimes she just has to stand back and watch them walk through it. And being a mom of three football boys you all know this isn’t my first injury rodeo. Perspective is so powerful and candidly I can say Bo’s has been better than his mom’s this week. But it’s true. Our faith gives us peace and reason even when the world’s view doesn’t make sense. God is so good to always show up when you need Him most. He lets you be mad and sad and then gently reminds you of truth…that God orders each of our steps and that we could be living a life with far more disappointments and life altering issues other than a broken bone. And even when we don’t understand, HIS ways are always good. Often times our family’s life and adventures on social media look so grand…the wins, travels, and even in our losses we smile.. but it’s important to me for you to see that our life (and my attitude🤪) stinks sometimes too. And that doesn’t make us doubt our faith less it actually strengthens it. I won’t be freezing at Mile High tomorrow but I sure will be cheering…Go Broncos!💙🧡Rom8:28","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/26/SBRC/88362153007-bo-nix-mom-instagram.jpg?crop=2999,1688,x0,y154&width=2999&height=1688&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-26 22:00:29.935927

The NFL announced Monday that Wright will participate as an injury replacement for Philadelphia Eagles’ cornerback Quinyon Mitchell. The Pro Bowl game will take place Feb. 3 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, the first time the Pro Bowl has been part of the Super Bowl experience.

Wright will join Bears left guard Joe Thuney, center Drew Dalman and safety Kevin Byard at the games after he originally didn’t earn a Pro Bowl nod. It’s the most Pro Bowlers the Bears will have at the game since 2019, when the team brought four players.

It’s a fitting honor for Wright, who had a career year after he signed a one-year contract with the Bears. Wright earned his first career Pro Bowl honor after he led the NFL with eight takeaways.

He intercepted a career-high five passes, which was tied for second in the NFL behind Byard, and returned one for a touchdown. Wright also forced two fumbles, including a key one while stopping the Philadelphia Eagles’ “tush push” on Black Friday.

Wright made the most of his opportunity with the Bears, his third team in five seasons. He stepped up as a starter after the Bears lost starter Jaylon Johnson for a majority of the season with a groin injury.",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=11c02817-fc3d-54a7-870f-e459e8802071&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2026-01-26 19:00:48.952320
,,2026-01-26 22:14:15+00:00,NFL.com,Mike Macdonald on Sam Darnold's sterling 3-TD NFC title win: 'He just shut a lot of people up tonight',Eric Edholm,,,,,https://www.nfl.com/news/mike-macdonald-on-sam-darnold-s-sterling-3-td-nfc-title-win-he-just-shut-a-lot-of-people-up-tonight,"""I'm happy to be a part of this team, this group and this coaching staff, I'm really happy to be here.
I'm just gonna continue to do the best that I can to put this team in positions to win football games.""
In the Week 16 victory against them in Seattle, Darnold had two more.
Darnold's support doesn't just come from his offensive teammates.
After Darnold's four-INT game earlier this season, Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones vociferously defended Darnold, offering some choice words for anyone who was doubting him then.","Neither team scored in the final quarter, with the Seahawks stopping the Rams on fourth-and-4 at the Seattle 6-yard line with just under five minutes remaining. Darnold led the Seahawks on an 11-play drive, draining 4:29 of clock and helping prevent the Rams from mounting a miracle drive late.

Darnold credited the support he's received from up and down the roster as the reason he has been able to thrive with the Seahawks since signing a three-year, $100.5 million deal this past offseason.

""It's great. I feel that support. Not only with their words, but with how everyone treats each other in the building,"" Darnold said. ""I'm happy to be a part of this team, this group and this coaching staff, I'm really happy to be here. I'm happy to be in this position. I'm just gonna continue to do the best that I can to put this team in positions to win football games.""

Darnold's right-hand man all game, as he has been most of the season, was Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who finished the game with 10 catches for 153 yards and Darnold's first TD of the night. The NFL's receiving-yards leader and Darnold have developed a tight bond in their first season together, with each elevating their games.

""The work Sam puts in on and off the field, in the film room, knowing what to expect, knowing how I can get open and get the ball and change the game, honestly I got to give him a lot of credit,"" Smith-Njigba told NFL Network's Stacey Dales. ""I just want to make his job easier and be there for him, be open, get open and make it as easy as possible. It's been a great first year.""

Often doubted, Darnold entered this postseason with the reputation as a journeyman on his fifth team in eight seasons and whose first playoff game ended in a nine-sack loss to the Rams last season. As the guy the Jets and Panthers both dumped unceremoniously. As, at most, the fourth-best quarterback of the 2018 NFL Draft class, with Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson winning MVP awards and Baker Mayfield leading two different franchises to playoff victories.

Now Darnold has a chance to be the first from that QB class to win a Super Bowl. He actually made the game two years ago as the 49ers' backup, but Darnold can win it as Seattle's starter -- and his focus is squarely on his team, not on his QB colleagues around the league.

""It's unbelievable,"" Darnold said. ""Obviously, those are great players, but it's more so (about) the team. Just the hard work that we've put in throughout this season.""

Darnold answered plenty of questions along the way this season in leading the Seattle Seahawks to a 14-3 record and earning the NFC's top seed, even while leading the NFL in turnovers this season.

Six of his interceptions came against the Rams. Darnold threw four interceptions in the Week 11 loss. In the Week 16 victory against them in Seattle, Darnold had two more. On Sunday, zero picks and zero fumbles. Darnold has twice thrown for more yards than he did Sunday in his career, including in a five-TD game against the Falcons. But no game has meant more in Darnold's career than Sunday's win.

Now with two impressive playoff victories under his belt, Darnold has turned in the third-highest passer rating (122.4) in a single postseason prior to the Super Bowl, behind only Matt Ryan in 2016 (132.6) and Patrick Mahomes in 2019 (131.5).

""I tell you what, I'm not a quarterback expert,"" Macdonald joked, ""but that's some high-powered quarterbacking going on in that game by No. 14 for sure.""

Darnold's support doesn't just come from his offensive teammates. After Darnold's four-INT game earlier this season, Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones vociferously defended Darnold, offering some choice words for anyone who was doubting him then. And now?

""Everything that I said, (I) stood on it,"" Jones said. ""Sam's a baller, like I said, man. Doubt Sam if you want to. Sam's gonna show up every time. That's what we've known, and that's why I stood on that night for him, and I'd do it all over again.""

Seahawks defensive lineman Leonard Williams, who labored alongside Darnold in those ugly days with the Jets, had nothing but bouquets for his quarterback, citing Darnold as the paragon for Seattle's ability to overcome adversity.

""His resilience, his poise, his leadership. He's overcome a lot,"" Williams said. ""Still has doubters somehow, and once again, he's proven the doubters wrong.""

Now Darnold is one win away from a career-defining victory. That it will come against the Patriots is no small irony. After all, he's 0-4 against them in his career, all blowouts and during his Jets days, throwing for one TD and nine interceptions.

During a four-INT game against the Patriots in 2019, Darnold was seen on camera that night saying he was ""seeing ghosts."" Asked about that game on Sunday, Darnold quipped: ""I almost forgot about it, so thanks.""

And after his performance in the NFC Championship Game, nearly everyone else has, too.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/jhqfnj67opu1h8n43v74,N,,2026-01-26 19:59:36.133806

After being acquired by the New Orleans Saints in the offseason, Devaughn Vele made a noticeable impact during the 2025 campaign before his season was cut short by a shoulder injury. The 6‑foot‑5 wide receiver totaled 25 receptions for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns, averaging 11.7 yards per catch across 13 games. Vele emerged as a reliable target, especially on third downs, and provided much‑needed size and catch ability in the Saints' passing game. His contributions validated New Orleans' decision to trade draft capital to bring him to the roster, and his progress bodes well for an expanded role in 2026.

He’s more of a fluid mover than I thought he was. So it allows me to coach and expect him to be able to run every route on a route tree. When some guys are not 100% fluid movers, there’s only certain routes that they can excel in. Because they just, athletically, can’t move the way they need to to be elite in every single break, every single movement that it takes, to run every route on a route tree. He, at his height, is able to run every route on a route tree.

Barring something unexpected, the Seattle Seahawks will have Pro Bowl quarterback Sam Darnold ready to go for Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8 against the Patriots.

Darnold, who was listed as questionable ahead of the Seahawks’ NFC Divisional Round contest vs. the San Francisco 49ers but ultimately suited up, has been battling an oblique injury.

Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald gave injury updates on Darnold and other Seahawks players on Monday.

“Macdonald said QB Sam Darnold (oblique) and LT Charles Cross (foot) will be sore after playing through injuries. ‘There’s a couple other things we’re going to work through, but nothing major, to our knowledge,’ he said,” ESPN’s Seahawks reporter, Brady Henderson posted on X.

The 28-year-old Darnold (who’s 0-4 in his career vs. New England) earned his second straight Pro Bowl honor this campaign after recording 25 passing touchdowns and 14 interceptions in the regular season. He’s gone 37-for-53 with 470 passing yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions across Seattle’s two playoff games.

The Jaguars will face six teams that made the playoff this season after playing eight playoff teams this season.","Like the recent snow that has has concaved most of us in our homes, the NFL has a tendency to bury promising teams that recently tasted success. That was the case this season for the Washington Commanders, who went from the doorstep of the Super Bowl to having the seventh overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft by virtue of their 5-12 record in 2025.

Washington certainly wasn't hoping for that decline, and neither are the 12 teams whose seasons ended during the this year's postseason in 2026. While no one plans to have a down year, it's inevitable that at least a few teams each season will succumb to injuries, close calls, late-game collapses, etc. For teams like the Bears, it may come down to the ball simply taking a few unfavorable bounces after a season where things largely went their way.

Conversely, there are those teams that -- somehow, someway -- find themselves in the playoffs year after year while keeping their Super Bowl window ajar. Lately, that team in the AFC has been the Bills, while the NFC's 49ers have made the playoffs four out of the last five years.

Which losing playoff teams have the best shot at getting to next year's Super Bowl? See for yourself, as we've ranked each team from worst to first.

** -- 2025 playoff teams

12. Carolina Panthers

2025 Record: 8-9 (1st in NFC South)

2026 opponents: Buccaneers, Falcons, Saints, Lions, **Bears, Ravens, Bengals, **Seahawks, **Broncos, Vikings, **Packers, **Steelers, Browns, **Eagles

One of the NFL's feel-good stories in 2025, it's safe to say that the Panthers will be hard-pressed to have similar success in 2026. For staters, they'll face a significantly tougher schedule next year that includes a half-dozen teams that made the playoffs a year ago.

Carolina's success next year will largely depend on whether or not Bryce Young can take another leap this offseason. The Panthers could aid Young's development by getting him a wideout who can complement Tetairoa McMillan, whose 1,014 receiving yards last season was 620 more than Carolina's next leading receiver, Jalen Coker.

11. Pittsburgh Steelers

2025 Record: 10-7 (1st in AFC North)

2026 opponents: Ravens, Bengals, Browns, Falcons, **Panthers, **Broncos, **Texans, Colts, **Jaguars, **Patriots, Saints, **Eagles, Buccaneers, Titans

The Steelers never had a losing season under Mike Tomlin, but that might change under new head coach Mike McCarthy. By virtue of winning the AFC North, the Steelers will face six teams that made the playoffs in 2025. They'll also face two of the NFL's hottest teams at the end of the 2025 regular season in Atlanta and New Orleans.

Once again, quarterback will be Pittsburgh's biggest question mark heading into the offseason. If Aaron Rodgers comes back, that'll give the Steelers a puncher's chance at making the playoffs. But even in that scenario, it doesn't look very promising for Pittsburgh as the North (assuming Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow are healthy) should be a much tougher division in 2026.

10. Green Bay Packers

2025 record: 9-7-1 (2nd in NFC North)

2026 opponents: **Bears, Lions, Vikings, Falcons, **Bills, **Panthers, Dolphins, **Texans, Cowboys, **Patriots, Saints, Jets, Buccaneers, **Rams

Like Pittsburgh, Green Bay will have to face two emerging teams in Atlanta and New Orleans. Their 2026 schedule also includes games against six playoff teams.

While they did make the playoffs, 2025 was a disappointing season for the Packers that led to questions about Matt LaFleur's future before he was given a contract extension. Green Bay started 9-3-1 before Micah Parsons' season-ending injury sent the season in a tailspin. The Packers then lost defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and have replaced him with former Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon.

9. Houston Texans

2025 record: 12-5 (2nd AFC South)

2026 opponents: Colts, **Jaguars, Titans, Ravens, Bengals, **Bills, Cowboys, Giants, Browns, **Steelers, **Chargers, **Eagles, Commanders, **Packers

After an 0-3 start, the Texans rallied to finish the regular season with a 12-5 record. They then crushed the Steelers in the playoffs -- the franchise's first road playoff win -- before running out of steam against the Patriots in the divisional round.

The Texans' defense was elite last season, but C.J. Stroud's struggles in the playoffs led to Houston's season ending in the divisional round for a third straight year. It's very possible that the Texans will miss the playoffs altogether in 2026 unless Houston gets more consistent play from Stroud.

8. Los Angeles Chargers

2025 record: 11-6 (2nd in AFC West)

2026 opponents: **Broncos, Chiefs, Raiders, **Bills, Dolphins, Ravens, **Seahawks, **Rams, Buccaneers, Browns, **Packers, Vikings, **Steelers

After a 3-0 start, injuries started to take their toll on the Chargers, who ended the 2025 season with three straight losses that dropped their record against fellow playoff foes to 3-3.

The Chargers have replaced Greg Roman with Mike McDaniel, who will be Justin Herbert's fifth different offensive coordinator since the Chargers drafted him in 2020. McDaniel will now be tasked with helping Herbert win his first playoff game.

7. Chicago Bears

2025 record: 11-6 (1st in NFC North)

2026 opponents: Lions, **Packers, Vikings, Buccaneers, **Eagles, **Jaguars, Jets, **Patriots, Saints, **Bills, Dolphins, Falcons, **Panthers, **Seahawks

There are several reasons why Bears fans might need to brace themselves for a letdown in 2026, starting with the fact that their team will face a whopping seven teams that made the playoffs a year ago.

Chicago won eight one-possession games in 2025 that was largely the byproduct of Caleb Williams' uncanny play in the clutch and a defense that led the league in turnovers forced. Those strengths largely overshadowed Williams dreadful 58.1% completion percentage Chicago's defense finishing 23rd in the league in points allowed.

In 2026, the Bears will need more consistent play from Williams and better overall play from their defense if they are going to avoid becoming next year's version of this year's Washington Commanders.

6. Jacksonville Jaguars

2025 record: 13-4 (1st in AFC South)

2026 opponents: **Texans, Colts, Titans, Browns, **Steelers, **Eagles, Commanders, **Patriots, Ravens, Bengals, Cowboys, Giants, **Bears, **Broncos

Jacksonville is one of the few playoff teams that on paper will have an easier schedule in 2026. The Jaguars will face six teams that made the playoff this season after playing eight playoff teams this season.

A big challenge for the Jaguars will be the sheer fact that Liam Coen and his team won't sneak up on anyone after being one of the NFL's biggest surprises this year. The Jaguars would help their cause this offseason by bolstering a defense that was just 21st in the league against the pass and 27th in sacks.

5. Buffalo Bills

2025 record: 12-5 (2nd in AFC East)

2026 opponents: Dolphins, **Patriots, Jets, Chiefs, **Chargers, **Bears, Lions, Ravens, **Broncos, **Packers, Raiders, Vikings, **Texans, **Rams

Before Bills Mafia floods my inbox, I'd like to mention that I think Buffalo will can make a Super Bowl run in 2026. It's just anything but a sure thing.

Buffalo will have a new coach after the surprising firing of Sean McDermott despite his glittering record that includes a 72-27 mark since 2020. Adding to odds of Buffalo missing the playoffs for the first time since 2018 is the fact that it will face seven teams that made the playoffs this year and will also face two teams (the Vikings and Lions) that went 9-8.

As the Chiefs experienced this season with Patrick Mahomes, all it takes is an injury to a franchise quarterback for your season go off the rails. It goes without saying that an injury to Josh Allen would be catastrophic for a Bills team that puts a lot on his plate.

4. Philadelphia Eagles

2025 record: 11-6 (1st in NFC East)

2026 opponents: Cowboys, Giants, Commanders, Cardinals, **Panthers, **Bears, **Texans, Colts, **Jaguars, **Rams, **Steelers, **49ers, **Seahawks, Titans

Philadelphia went to the Super Bowl in 2022, had an off year in 2023, and then won its second Super Bowl in 2024. If history repeats itself, the Eagles should bounce back in 2026 after having a down 2025 season that ended with a home playoff loss to the 49ers.

While they have an impressive group of skill players and a defense that finished fifth in scoring in points allowed in 2025, the Eagles will have to have more harmony on offense next season if they are going to overcome a brutal schedule that includes seven teams that made the playoffs in 2025. The Eagles will also more than likely have to deal with a more competitive division.

3. San Francisco 49ers

2025 record: 12-5 (3rd in NFC West)

2026 opponents: Cardinals, **Rams, **Seahawks, **Broncos, **Eagles, Raiders, Commanders, Vikings, Dolphins, Cowboys, Chiefs, **Chargers, Giants, Falcons

The 49ers have a talented roster and one of the league's best coaches in Kyle Shanahan. Health, however, has continued to allude them to the point that the team's brass is going to look into the viral substation conspiracy this offseason in an effort to avoid another injury-riddled season. Health and the fact that they play in one of the NFL's toughest divisions may be the 49ers' two biggest roadblocks in 2026.

2. Denver Broncos

2025 record: 14-3 (1st in AFC West)

2026 opponents: **Chargers, Chiefs, Raiders, **Bills, Dolphins, **Rams, **Seahawks, **Jaguars, **Patriots, **Panthers, Jets, **49ers, Cardinals, **Steelers

No disrespect to the newly-minted AFC champion Patriots, but the Broncos may have been a Bo Nix injury away from getting to big game after coming up just short on Sunday. With Nix, Denver went 15-3 (including the playoffs) while boasting the league's third-ranked scoring defense.

The Broncos have the team to make another deep playoff run, but it's worth noting that they'll face a brutal schedule that includes eight teams that made the playoffs in 2025. The Broncos will need to play well in the regular season if they are going to get back to the playoffs.

Denver would increase its odds this offseason by making some upgrades at its skill positions, specifically at running back given J.K. Dobbins' injury history and R.J. Harvey making a bigger impact at receiver during his rookie season.

1. Los Angeles Rams

2025 record: 12-5 (2nd in NFC West)

2026 opponents: **Seahawks, **49ers, Cardinals, Cowboys, Giants, **Packers, Chiefs, **Chargers, **Bills, **Eagles, Commanders, Buccaneers, Raiders, **Broncos

The Rams came up short in Seattle, but there's a lot of reasons to feel good about next season if you're a Los Angeles fan.

Los Angeles led the NFL in scoring this season, was 10th in points allowed, and has one of the game's best coaches in Sean McVay. The Rams are surely hoping to retain both of their top assistants -- defensive coordinator Chris Shula and offensive coordinator Nate Scheelhaase -- with the Raiders, Bills, Browns and Cardinals still looking for head coaches.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/25/f0313273-346a-47e9-8bcc-af3273a93a2a/thumbnail/1200x675/98c23106163d6933947dd605b3608bec/calebsad.png,N,,2026-01-26 18:01:24.675452

Before any rulings were made, the New England Patriots ran an errant football out of the hands of Jarrett Stidham and into the end zone. But then it was ruled the Denver Broncos QB had thrown incomplete but for intentional grounding.

The refereeing crew wasn't done. Eventually, they changed their ruling, calling it a backward pass, and therefore a fumble.

But the Pats couldn't actually return the ball to the end zone, because a whistle had blown. That makes it an erroneous whistle, and the officials gave New England the ball at the spot of recovery.

A few plays later, the Pats' Drake Maye ran in their only touchdown of the game in an eventual 10-7 win to advance to the Super Bowl.

The Athletic's Mike Sando broke this play down in a column on Monday morning, and he points out that this call may have been entirely wrong:

Officials erred in blowing the whistle on the play, which seemed to help Denver by nullifying an apparent Patriots fumble return for a touchdown. But language in Rule 7, Section 2 Article 1(o), relating to an erroneous whistle while the ball is loose, seems confusing when it says, ""the team last in possession may elect to put the ball in play at the spot where possession was lost, or to replay the down.""

Was New England the last team in possession, or was it Denver?

MORE: Drake Maye, Mike Vrabel make Patriots super again

Essentially, the way that rule reads suggests that it matters greatly when the whistle actually blew, because if it came before the recovery, it implies Denver would get the choice to replay the down.

Maybe the fact that it's a clear and obvious recovery matters elsewhere from the rulebook, as it does with certain replay review situations.

It also still wasn't clear to everyone who analyzed the play afterward that it was even a backward pass to begin with.

It's certainly a call that loomed large and went against the Broncos, a week after the big catch-turned-interception call against the Bills went in Denver's favor.

He generated 2.5 sacks with 17 QB pressures on 91 pass rushes for an 18.7% pressure rate.
The ninth-year pro led all linebackers with 36 QB pressures, per PFF.
Campbell finished the regular season with 76 tackles, 11 QB pressures, three passes defensed and a forced fumble.
After returning from injury in Week 10, he allowed just 17 QB pressures.","The old man can still play. In his return to Arizona, the 39-year-old Campbell generated 6.5 sacks, second most on the team, with 28 QB pressures and 43 total tackles. He added two passes defensed and blocked a field-goal try for the 10th time in his illustrious career. Fourteen of those pressures came while he was being double-teamed, the fifth most such pressures in the NFL in 2025. A lot went wrong in Arizona this season, but bringing back the ageless wonder wasn't one of them. Imagine the Cards' defense if Campbell hadn't been on the field for 17 games.

With many observers focusing on the young edge players in Atlanta's reworked defense, it seems Onyemata's play was relatively overlooked. In his third season in ATL, the big man anchored the middle of the defense as a top-10 run defender, earning seven tackles for loss and a career-high 62 tackles; he also added 18 quarterback pressures from his interior position. His 13 run stuffs led the club, with the Falcons allowing a yard more per rush with Onyemata off the field.

Lewis was a clear choice as the unsung hero to single out following the Panthers' turnaround. The sixth-year pro excelled in his second season in Carolina, driving defenders off the ball in the run game. His film is littered with pancakes and opposing linemen being pushed downfield to open holes in the ground game. Lewis also enjoyed his best season as a pass protector, grading in that area of the game as a top-five guard, per Pro Football Focus, which credited him with allowing a single sack and just 13 QB pressures on 553 pass-rush snaps over 16 regular-season games.

In a magical season for the Chicago, most Bears received their just flowers, from a highly-praised offensive line to a turnover-crazed secondary to the young playmakers on defense. Had he played a full season, Booker would have surely garnered more of the spotlight. Thanks to a knee injury, he didn't make his 2025 debut until Week 9 -- but even so, Booker finished third on the Bears' D in both sacks (4.5) and QB pressures (30), generating a 9.9% QB pressure rate over the final 10 regular-season games. In the first seven weeks of the Bears' season, Chicago generated a 28.7% QB pressure rate (27th in the NFL) with 9.1 pressures per game (31st). After Booker entered the lineup, those numbers went to 33.2 % (21st) and 12.5 pressures per game (14th). I'm not suggesting Booker gave the Bears a monster pass rush, but his presence undoubtedly got them closer to respectability. The second-year pro is still rough around the edges, and Chicago must add more QB-chasing oomph, but Booker is on the same trajectory as his upward-trending team.

The Cowboys found a legit third receiver. In his second season, Flournoy generated 475 yards on 40 catches (11.9 yards per catch) with four touchdowns. As a beneficiary of the defensive attention paid to CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens , Flournoy thrived, generating 0.09 EPA per route, 11th-best among all receivers with at least 200 routes run. His 0.45 EPA per target finished second on the Cowboys, behind only Pickens. Assuming Jerry Jones finds a way to retain Pickens, Dallas will enter 2026 with an excellent trio as the team looks to return to prominence.

The veteran linebacker was the glue that held the Lions' defense together for as long as possible. Anzalone finished with 95 tackles, second on the team behind All-Pro Jack Campbell , and nine passes defensed, including one INT. He generated 2.5 sacks with 17 QB pressures on 91 pass rushes for an 18.7% pressure rate. Among Lions defenders with at least 200 coverage snaps, Anzalone’s -0.31 EPA per target was tops. A leader on a defense decimated by injuries, the linebacker helped keep a unit that could have easily been one of the worst in the league above water under first-year coordinator Kelvin Sheppard.

With stars like Micah Parsons and Xavier McKinney garnering plenty of attention, Williams’ solid play likely got lost in the shuffle for most observers. The second-year safety authored an all-around strong campaign, generating three interceptions, five passes defensed and 89 tackles, with four TFLs. Williams’ ability to play multiple spots was utilized heavily by defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley. According to PFF, the safety spent the bulk of his snaps aligned deep (510) but also played in the box (303) and manned the slot at times (135). That skill set allowed the Packers to be much more diverse in their defensive packages.

The former fifth-round pick didn't just fill the void at left by right tackle Rob Havenstein 's absence due to injury -- he improved the Rams' offensive line. In 10 regular-season starts, McClendon allowed 12 pressures and one sack, per PFF, compared to 22 pressures and a sack in seven games from Havenstein. McClendon also helped boost the run-blocking, bulling open holes on the ground and morphing into one of the better road-grading offensive tackles this season. The sledding got a bit tougher in the playoffs (11 pressures and one sack allowed), but still; this was a rare example of a team stumbling into a better situation with an injury fill-in.

Wilson struggled in coverage, but when he was moving forward, oh baby, did he have a massive impact on Brian Flores’ defense. Seemingly every game, Wilson made a splash play, generating 6.5 sacks and 108 tackles, including 17 TFLs. The ninth-year pro led all linebackers with 36 QB pressures, per PFF. His 20 runs stuffs were tied for third-most among all players in 2025, per Next Gen Stats. A free agent this offseason, Wilson should stick with Flores.

Most eyes were on Tyler Shough ’s impressive end to the season, putting the Saints on a path to contention in 2026. But the quarterback wasn’t the only rookie who came on strong. Banks, the Saints' first-round pick, went through some first-year struggles but rounded into form, offering a glimpse of his potential ability to help solve the issues that have persisted along New Orleans' offensive line. While still rough around the edges, the 315-pound left tackle played well to close the season before suffering an ankle injury in Week 18. In the final four weeks, Banks allowed just one sack and proved he can be one of the better run-blocking tackles, grading out as PFF’s No. 5 run blocker at the position from Week 14 on.

One positive from the Giants' otherwise forgettable campaign: The pass protection wasn't a complete disaster this time around. Andrew Thomas ' ability to play in more than a handful of games was a big factor, but Eluemunor also did his part on the right side. While not a great run-blocker, the 31-year-old was steady in the pass game, allowing 19 QB pressures, tied for the eighth-fewest among players with at least 580 pass-blocking snaps, per PFF -- and if we filter by position, that mark tied for the lowest among OTs.

As part of a talented Eagles defense, Campbell flew under the radar as a rookie, but the first-round pick was stellar, outside of a midseason lull during which he was the odd man out in a stacked linebacker rotation. Campbell finished the regular season with 76 tackles, 11 QB pressures, three passes defensed and a forced fumble. With an athletic profile, he excelled in pass defense, finishing as a top-five linebacker in coverage grade, per PFF. Heading into 2026, Vic Fangio should find a way to get Campbell, who played 63 percent of the Eagles’ defensive snaps, on the field more.

With injuries riddling San Francisco's roster, Kyle Shanahan’s offense needed to unearth production from unexpected places. He found it in Tonges. The backup tight end’s regular-season numbers don’t pop off the screen: 34 catches on 46 targets for 293 yards and five touchdowns. That will happen when George Kittle is the top target on the depth chart. But this was a serious uptick in usage for a player who’d caught zero passes in his career after going undrafted in 2022, with much of his production (29 catches, 269 yards, three TDs) coming in games Kittle missed during the regular season. Niners QBs had a 126.4 passer rating when targeting Tonges in 2025, sixth-best among all TEs with at least 40 targets, per NGS. Given that Kittle is questionable to start the 2026 campaign after suffering a torn Achilles, keeping the restricted free agent around seems like a no-brainer for San Francisco.

In Year 2, Barner became a key weapon in the top-seeded Seahawks offense, generating 52 catches for 519 yards and six touchdowns. Barner proved a pivotal outlet for Sam Darnold , particularly in high-leverage situations. Five of the TE’s six touchdowns came in the red zone, and Darnold posted a 137.8 passer rating when targeting Barner inside the 20-yard line, second-best mark of all tight ends with at least 10 targets (behind only Tucker Kraft ), per NGS. Barner generated a 12.9% success rate per route, third-best among tight ends with at least 250 routes run, behind only George Kittle and Trey McBride . And let’s not forget about ""the Barn Yard"" -- the tight end converted 10 of 11 attempts in short-yardage push plays, with one touchdown.

Goedeke’s importance to the Bucs offense was highlighted in the six games he missed. The right tackle didn't allow a sack in 11 games this season. After returning from injury in Week 10, he allowed just 17 QB pressures. Solid across the board, Goedeke proved to be one of the Bucs' most crucial offensive pieces, alongside bookend Pro Bowler Tristan Wirfs . If the right tackle can stay healthy after missing games each of the past two seasons, Tampa’s offense will be more potent in 2026 under new OC Zac Robinson.

The Commanders' offense wasn’t pretty, and the ground game struggled for spells. But while rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt generated plenty of buzz, Rodriguez proved a stabilizing force when Washington turned to him down the stretch. Of his 500 yards and six TDs on 112 carries, 381 yards and five scores came on 85 attempts in the final seven games. The third-year back’s .03 rush EPA per carry ranked tied for fifth-best among all RBs with at least 100 totes (compared to Croskey-Merritt’s mark of -0.06). Rodrguez earned a 45.5% success rate on carries, with 29 missed tackles forced; he also averaged 3.46 yards after contact forced per carry. He might not profile as an every-down back, but Rodriguez proved valuable in 2025.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/nsy4zqtbuc6zjdmnoz4w,N,,2026-01-26 18:01:40.413935

The Panthers would move on from Legette before making him a tight end, though I’m not sure I’d characterize that scenario as likely, either.
But expect Legette to be in camp next summer, regardless of whether the Panthers add another receiver or two.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — We posted the call-out for questions Friday morning as the Carolinas were preparing for Ice Storm-ageddon. But other than some kind words from Glenn L., there was scant mention of milk, bread, salt or generators.

Instead, The Athletic’s readers maintained their focus, didn’t let the elements take them off their game and kept their eyes on the prize: the Carolina Panthers’ plans over the next three months.

A lot can and will change for the Panthers and every other team during the 87-day stretch between Monday and the first night of the 2026 NFL Draft. Which is to say, what seems logical now might be rendered irrelevant by April. Also: more mailbags!

But there are important threads to follow over the course of the offseason, several of which you asked about: Ikem Ekwonu’s knee, Xavier Legette’s future and the Panthers’ ability to build on the franchise’s first playoff berth since the 2017 season.

Let’s get to them before it gets any colder in Charlotte.

A lot of focus on the short-term approach to the tackle position with Ickey’s injury, but there’s also the long-term question with Ickey and Taylor Moton both being under contract for only one more season, and long-term questions arising (Moton entering age-32 season and Ickey’s recovery from injury). Thoughts on a long-term approach? — Brian H.

Moton is actually signed through the 2027 season after his extension last summer, but the point stands: Is it time to start looking further down the road when talking about tackle? And how the Panthers answer that could tell us a lot about whether they think Ekwonu can come back from his patellar tendon surgery at or near his pre-injury level.

The Panthers have invested heavily in the offensive line under Dan Morgan and Dave Canales, signing guards Robert Hunt and Damien Lewis to big contracts in 2024 and extending Moton in August. But Morgan hasn’t taken an offensive lineman in two drafts as a GM, and bringing in a young tackle makes some sense.

That said, the only way I could see Morgan drafting a tackle at 19 would be if the Panthers are convinced Ekwonu won’t be the same player moving forward, and it’s way too early for them to know that. It’s tough to find franchise tackles after the first two rounds, but the Panthers could take one later to develop and serve as a stopgap until Ekwonu is ready.

Although LB and edge seem to be the most talked about possibilities for the pick at 19, do you sense they eye an interior DL that can also rush the passer? (Remember hearing that they liked Mason Graham had he fallen to No. 8.) — Fernando A.

Never say never, but those two positions that Fernando mentioned feel like much bigger priorities than defensive line. In fact, the D-line seems like a place where the Panthers can trim a little fat to create cap space, with A’Shawn Robinson a potential cut as he enters the final year of his contract with a $12.6 million cap number.

And while the Panthers did like Graham, who had just half a sack in 17 starts for the Cleveland Browns, they like their interior rotation, even with Turk Wharton struggling through an injury-plagued season. Derrick Brown, coming off a career-high five sacks, and a healthy Wharton can push the pocket and set up the edge rushers, a group that needs reinforcements.

With all the heat that Keon Coleman caught this season, he played fewer games than Xavier Legette and still put up more yardage and touchdowns. And he’s almost three years younger than Legette. Could the Panthers pull a Matt Millen and draft a third straight first-round receiver this year? — Jeremy F.

I don’t see it. This feels like the year Morgan, the former linebacker, goes defense in the first round. Of course, I had the Panthers drafting Jalon Walker last year in most of my mocks (though I didn’t ignore their interest in Tetairoa McMillan).

Even so, Morgan wants to give Bryce Young another playmaking receiver, specifically a yards-after-catch demon who “can take a 5-yard catch and take it the distance, or make a few guys miss and come up with a big play.”

Looking at the list of free-agent receivers, one name jumps off the board. Seattle Seahawks speedster Rashid Shaheed, whose touchdown on the opening kickoff set the tone for the Seahawks’ divisional-round win vs. San Francisco, would help the Panthers in a couple of areas but won’t come cheap.

I don’t want to say XL was a disappointment but he definitely underperformed. How likely is it that he is still on the roster next year? Could a positional change to TE be possible? — Eli C.

Readers had too much Legette interest to squeeze into one question, so we’re sizing up to XXL. To be clear: That is not to imply that Legette could bulk his way into a three-point stance, à la Kelvin Benjamin’s attempt to make the New York Giants’ roster as a tight end in 2021 after sitting out the previous two seasons.

The Panthers would move on from Legette before making him a tight end, though I’m not sure I’d characterize that scenario as likely, either. Yes, Jalen Coker is a better receiver than Legette and is now the WR2 alongside McMillan. But Coker has yet to get through a full season, and Legette’s size and speed still make him a home-run threat, no matter how unpolished the rest of his game is.

Morgan has a strong track record of getting draft picks for unproductive and/or unhappy receivers, so that possibility can’t be dismissed. But expect Legette to be in camp next summer, regardless of whether the Panthers add another receiver or two.

They could always flip him at the deadline. But at his end-of-season news conference, Canales didn’t sound ready to give up on Legette yet.

“The thing I respect about Xavier through this process is all that’s done is work. All he’s done is continue to try to find ways. How can I help?” Canales said. “He continued to block, continued to be available. He’s returning kicks and just finding ways to do that. He’s made of the right stuff. I have full faith and confidence that Xavier will bounce back and have an excellent year next year.”

How “in” on winning now should Dan Morgan be this coming season? Do they continue to take the confident but measured steps forward, or should they take more risk? — Adam S.

When the Panthers stood pat at the trade deadline, it spoke volumes about how they viewed the 2025 team: A talented squad with a chance to make the playoffs, but not one ready to contend for a Super Bowl, yet.

It was the right read. For as fun as the season was for a fan base desperate for something positive to rally around, the Panthers backed into the playoffs with an 8-9 record and on a two-game losing streak.

Canales has had two seasons to bring in the type of players he wants to build the culture, and Morgan and VP of football operations Brandt Tilis have been judicious with their free-agent dollars. When they were outbid for Milton Williams last March, they pivoted and used that money on several defensive additions.

Now Morgan has to address the pass rush. Would he do so with a big splash like Trey Hendrickson? Maybe. But the Panthers still aren’t one player away.

“We’re not going to be reckless,” Morgan said. “But at the same time, we’re going to bring talent in here. We’re going to make moves that we feel like will help us out in the future.”

On to the speed round, which really is a speed round as I’m trying to get this finished before the ice hits, the power lines fall and I can’t send this mailbag to my editor until February.

How do you see the Panthers doing next year with a first-place schedule, and how much do you think this will factor into expectations from ownership for where the bar is for success next year? — Deirdre C.

I edited Deirdre’s question for brevity’s sake (and in case I need to make another firewood run). While it’s fun to talk about schedules (the NFL has turned the May release into a one-day schedule-palooza), the reality is the first-place piece of it only involves three games. Yes, they’re against three teams that were good in 2025 (Denver, Seattle and Philadelphia). But there’s no guarantee they’ll be good again next year (I’m looking at you, Eagles). The Panthers played a third-place schedule this season, and two of those bronze medalists from ’24 made the playoffs this year — Jacksonville and Green Bay. The third was Dallas, which thinks it’s going to be good every year. I’d guess Deirdre and everyone else would say ending a seven-year playoff drought was worth sweating through three games next year that could be tough.

Do you get the feeling Canales will ever give up offensive play calling? — Jason C.

This was a question in our December mailbag as well, and my answer hasn’t changed: No, unless Dave Tepper tells him to. Play calling is Canales’ thing, and he seems to be getting a better feel for it. I’d like to see him push the ball downfield a little more.

Am I the only one concerned about Jaycee’s concussion numbers? Seems to me we should be. — Todd C.

It’s an important question and something Horn, the Panthers’ coaches and medical staff will monitor closely after he was in the protocol twice in a six-game span. It’s difficult to know how Horn or anyone will recover from head injuries. Not that we needed any reminders about the serious nature of concussions, but Josey Jewell’s situation provided one.

Soup or salad? — Will C.

Typically salad, especially after 18 weeks of press box buffets. But given the forecast, I’m going soup this week. Hope everyone gets through the storm safely and soundly.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/24231440/GettyImages-2247021269-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-26 17:00:40.482684

Robert Spillane, LB, New England Patriots

Will Campbell, T, New England Patriots

Mack Hollins, WR, New England Patriots

Perhaps the biggest injury from Sunday was Robert Spillane. He’s been a key cog in the run defense for New England, and he wears the green dot on his helmet for the defense. That means he’s the player who communicates the plays from the defensive coordinator on the field. Spillane has been dealing with an ankle injury for weeks off and on. The extra week of rest is likely to do him some good, and I would expect him to play in the Super Bowl. Making it through the whole game could be the bigger issue, but we’ll see how the next couple of weeks go.

Mack Hollins and Will Campbell are no longer on the injury report, as both played Sunday. A big point of concern for the Patriots could be Campbell, who has now allowed 12 pressures in his last four games. That’s a lot of pressure allowed from a left tackle. Now, the three teams the Patriots have faced in the playoffs rank first, ninth, and 10th in sacks this season. That’s a stiff test for any tackle but Seattle is eighth in sacks, 12th in adjusted sack rate, and third in pressure rate. The road for Campbell doesn’t get any easier.

Hollins made his presence known in Denver before and during the game. He only had two receptions but one was a big play down the field in the third quarter on a flea flicker. His run blocking is also a big component for New England. He could be an unlikely hero for the team in two weeks.

Sam Darnold, QB, Seattle Seahawks

George Holani, RB, Seattle Seahawks

The talk from Seattle last week was about Sam Darnold. He wasn’t throwing the ball in practice leading up to facing the 49ers due to an oblique injury. Seattle controlled that game from the opening kickoff, so Darnold wasn’t required to do much. Questions still lingered a bit about his injury. He put that to rest against the Rams, making throw after throw for 300+ yards and three touchdowns. Given the stakes and Darnold’s past in big moments, this was his best game as a pro in my eyes. Seattle should have no concerns heading into the Super Bowl.

They also had to be fairly happy with George Holani, who played a role in the backfield without Zach Charbonnet. Holani did next to nothing with his carries (just three for 4 yards) but took three receptions for 27 yards. Notably, he also played on 23 snaps out of the 67 Seattle had. That’s a lot to ask of a player who hasn’t been active since Week 12, but Holani was up to the task. He certainly won’t threaten Kenneth Walker III for much work, but at least Seattle feels comfortable putting him on the field.

I doubt that many would have predicted that the final four teams in the NFL this year would be the Rams, Seahawks, Patriots and Broncos. It should be a great day of football, even if Denver is missing their starting quarterback. Bo Nix fractured his ankle last week, so Jarrett Stidham is forced into duty for the AFC Championship Game. Denver could also hold the key to cash game builds. We’re waiting to see if receivers Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant will play, along with running back J.K. Dobbins. The Broncos play first, so stay tuned to see if anything changes in the cash core on Sunday.

Playing GPP offers far more reward but plenty of risk as well, so some players opt to play cash every week. In this article, we’ll be setting cash cores for both DraftKings and FanDuel. These cores are meant to eat all the yummy chalk we can and play the popular players, even if we think they could potentially fail. Players that get rostered by 80% of the field in cash games don’t hurt you all that bad if you’re in that 80%. Let’s get busy and figure out who we’re playing!

Note – You still want to be tuned into the FTN Discord for any updates. Things can change and all plays for the cores will be put into the NFL Optimizer Sunday afternoon after the inactives are announced.

Prior to the Browns, Quinn spent five seasons (2016-20) with the Detroit Lions as the team's executive vice president of football operations and general manager. He oversaw all football operations, including the restructure of the player personnel department, scouting evaluation processes and the overhaul of the organization's scouting and technology systems. He implemented new processes for salary cap management, player contract negotiations and the use of analytics. Quinn also upgraded the player performance and strength and conditioning departments, while also overseeing the renovation of the Lions' Allen Park practice facility.

Quinn's time in Detroit was also highlighted by his Pro-Bowl draft pick in Taylor Decker (2016) and Pro-Bowl and five-time All-Pro center draft pick, Frank Ragnow (2018).

Before Detroit, the Norwood, Mass., native saw historical success as part of the New England Patriots organization for 16 seasons (2000-15). He held numerous titles in the Patriots' player personnel department, including being the director of pro scouting (2012-15) and assistant director of pro personnel (2009-12), in addition to being a national scout (2008), regional scout (2004-07), pro scout (2002-03) and player personnel assistant (2000-01).

Quinn helped construct the Patriots' dynasty, with the team earning four Super Bowl titles, six AFC Championships, 13 AFC East titles and recorded 10 seasons with 12-or-more wins and 14 seasons with 10-or-more wins during his 16-year tenure.

He arrives in Atlanta with 17 seasons of experience in the NFL and 10 seasons of experience at the collegiate level. Last season, he was with the Miami Dolphins as special teams coordinator after serving as the assistant special teams coach for the Los Angeles Rams in 2024. Prior to the Rams, Aukerman spent seven seasons (2017-23) with the Tennessee Titans, beginning as an assistant special teams coach in 2017, prior to being promoted to special teams coordinator in 2018 and adding the title of assistant head coach in 2023. He spent four seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers, serving as assistant special teams coach (2013-15) and special teams coordinator in 2016. Prior to his time with the Chargers, Aukerman spent two seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars as a defensive assistant (2011) and assistant special teams coach (2012) after starting his NFL coaching career with the Denver Broncos as a defensive assistant (2010).

In 2025, Aukerman guided kicker Riley Patterson to the highest field goal percentage of his career (93.1%), which finished fourth in the league. In addition, Aukerman mentored punter Jake Bailey to the second-highest net yard per punt percentage of his career (42.6), which also finished as the top single-season mark in franchise history. Bailey's six punts downed within the five-yard line also finished as the second highest in 2025. Miami tied for the league lead with two blocked field goals, was seventh in punt return average (13.3 yards per return) and 11th in kick return average (26.4 yards per return) while Malik Washington was ninth in the league in kick return average with an average of 26.8 yards per return and returned one punt for a touchdown.

Aukerman spent seven seasons (2017-23) with the Tennessee Titans, where he began as an assistant special teams coach. He was promoted to special teams coordinator in 2018 and assistant head coach/special teams coordinator in 2023. Throughout his tenure with Tennessee, Aukerman helped the Titans reach the postseason in four of seven seasons, winning two AFC South division titles, advancing to the AFC Championship in 2019 and securing the No. 1 seed in the AFC in 2021.

From 2022-23, Aukerman mentored punter Ryan Stonehouse, who led the league and set an NFL record with a 53.1 gross punting average as part of his 2022 rookie campaign. Following the 2022 season, Stonehouse was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team and second-team All-Pro. He finished fourth in the NFL that season and set a rookie record with a 44.0-yard net average.

He coached two Pro Bowl players in punter Brett Kern (2017-19) and long snapper Morgan Cox (2022). Kern led the NFL in both net punting average (44.6) and gross punting average (49.7) in 2017. His 44.6-yard net punting average ranked second in NFL history at the time. He also led the league with 52.7 percent of his punts (39 of 74) placed inside the 20 in 2018 and in 2019 led the NFL in punts inside the 20 (37). Kern led the league again in 2020 with 59.5 percent of his punts (22 of 37) inside the 20 and had the league's third-best ratio of punts inside the 20 to touchbacks (18:1) in 2021.

Between 2017-21, the Titans ranked 10th in punt return average (8.8 yards per return) and had the fifth-fewest special teams penalties in the NFL (67). Kern ranked second in the NFL with a 42.5-yard net punting average in that period.

In 2018, Aukerman's first season as the Titans' special teams coordinator, the team set a new NFL record for kickoff return average (32.0), becoming the first team in NFL history to average more than 30.0 yards per kickoff return in a season.

Prior to joining the Titans, Aukerman spent four seasons (2013-16) with the San Diego Chargers as an assistant special teams coach (2013-15) and special teams coordinator (2016).

Aukerman's first coaching role in the league came in 2010 as a defensive assistant for the Denver Broncos. He then joined the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011 in the same capacity before transitioning to special teams with Jacksonville in 2012 as an assistant special teams coach.

Prior to the NFL, Aukerman spent 10 years coaching at the collegiate level. He served as the linebackers coach at Kent State during the 2009 season. He had two stints at Miami of Ohio, as linebackers coach and co-special teams coordinator from 2005-08 and previously as a graduate assistant from 2001-02. Aukerman also spent two seasons as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator at Western Kentucky (2003-04).

His first coaching role was at his alma mater, the University of Findlay, as the wide receivers coach in 2000. Aukerman played defensive back and wide receiver for the Findlay Oilers from 1995-98 and was a member of both the 1995 and 1997 NAIA National Championship teams.

As the NFL season reaches its final chapter, only two teams remain standing with Super Bowl Sunday set for February 8th. Below is a breakdown of the key injuries from the Conference Championship games, along with what they could mean for both the Patriots and Seahawks as they prepare for the biggest stage of the season.

Key: Position Player, Team | Injury | Projected Return to Play

WR Pat Bryant, Denver | Hamstring | Ready Next Season

After battling back from a concussion, Pat Bryant suffered an additional setback Sunday afternoon with a hamstring injury. Although he was initially listed as questionable to return, Bryant did not re-enter the game.

With an extra week of rest, my guess is that he would have played in the Super Bowl had the Broncos advanced, though his role may have been limited or more of a decoy. The rookie wide receiver had an up-and-down 2025 season but showed flashes of his upside. He will look to build on his success next year.

RB J.K. Dobbins, Denver | Lisfranc/Foot | Ready Next Season

Denver opened the 21-day practice window for J.K. Dobbins earlier last week, but he was ultimately ruled out for the Conference Championship. Similar to Pat Bryant (above), this projection is speculative given the Broncos' elimination, though it appeared Denver was preparing to have Dobbins available for the Super Bowl. Dobbins' career has been plagued by injuries, yet he has consistently battled back. He will have a full offseason to address his foot injury, and I suspect he will be part of a team's backfield in 2026.

There’s still a slight hope for generational snow games in the seasons to come.
Now, if Buffalo can just manage to claim some more home playoff games …","There are two kinds of football fans in this world: Those who watched Sunday’s AFC championship and loved the dramatic, season-changing effect that the elements had on the game … and those who should just sim the season on Madden.

Just two words — “snow game” — make every football game better, and Sunday’s game approached snowy, icy perfection. Like settlers trapped on a snowy mountain pass, Drake Maye and the Patriots outlasted Jarrett Stidham and the Broncos in Denver (though, presumably, the survivors did not eat the losers). The still photos from the game are gorgeous, a stunning tableau of swirling snow and desperation as both teams suddenly realized they were facing a third, far superior challenger.

Advertisement

Now, the actual gameplay itself? That was terrible. Both teams had already struggled to move the ball against far superior defenses. Throw in the elements that began to impact things in the third quarter, and this wasn’t even a fair fight. Watching some of the finest athletes in the world picking their way delicately through the snow like they were trying to avoid stepping on dandelions, or rumbling on the ground like five-year-olds who had just wrecked off a sled … well, that’s not exactly aesthetically pleasing football. Certainly not ideal conditions for the second-most-important game of the year.

Snow games aren’t fair, the critics protest. You shouldn’t work an entire season, August to January, only to see all your planning, all your effort, all your strategy and scheming blown away in 12 minutes of snowy hell.

You know what? That’s right! It shouldn’t go down that way! In a perfect world, every football game would be the best 11 on the best 11, everyone healthy, everyone on the field in perfect climate, everyone with the maximum opportunity to perform at the absolute pinnacle of their ability.

But the underlying fundamental principle of sports is the ability to compete when conditions aren’t ideal. It’s the old Mike Tyson chestnut — “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face” — played out in 12-degree temperatures. If sports are a reflection of life, well, what’s more life-like than months of planning for a big moment abruptly undone by terrible weather? Sure, it’d be wonderful if every family vacation or child’s birthday party went off under pristine skies, but we know that so often doesn’t happen.

Advertisement

(Aside: Do not feel bad for anybody who gambled on this game and lost money because of the snow. That’s why it’s called gambling, not investing. Gamblers hope for perfect conditions; sports books know that perfection is unattainable and profit off that knowledge.)

Another fundamental element of sports: It’s not just how you act, it’s how you react. When the unthinkable or the unexpected becomes your new reality — when that thunderstorm starts dumping buckets on your meticulously orchestrated outdoor wedding, say — what do you do then? Do you curse the heavens, or do you adapt?

The anticipate-and-adapt element is a key reason why Sean Payton is drawing so much criticism for opting to go for it on fourth down midway through the second quarter. The wisdom of going for a crucial fourth down with an inexperienced quarterback aside, Payton knew, or should have known, that rough weather was on the way. NASCAR crew chiefs scheme this way all the time, getting their drivers up front on the chance that weather will call the race early. There was no chance the NFL was going to call this game on account of snow, but a two-possession lead with snow on the way is a nice hand to hold.

There’s a larger point to be made here about the real versus the ideal, and the way that we are collectively doing our very best to eliminate all random chance from these games. We engineer our newest stadiums to replicate the natural world with a perfect scientifically engineered grass-like product and perfect mechanically generated air temperature, yes. But that’s not what makes these games worth watching. If all we are after is perfection, we’d sim the season with AI. The unpredictable element — whether it’s a sudden snow or, say, a player nearly taunting his team out of the playoffs — is why we come back to sports, season after season.

The bad news for snow football fans, though, is that the league is slowly, collectively filtering the random weather element out of the game. This isn’t surprising; when you drop $5 billion on a new stadium, you don’t want a pesky element like weather determining whether it’s comfortable.

There are currently 21 NFL teams that play in open-air stadiums, and excluding the obvious never-snow ones — Tampa Bay and Miami — at least half a dozen of the still-remaining open-air teams are planning some form of roof or canopy overhead in the years to come. Planned or in-progress stadiums and renovations in Nashville, Jacksonville, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City and Washington, D.C. would be domed or covered.

The most recent new stadium built open to the air is, coincidentally enough, Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, which opened in 2014 and has the benefit of being in, well, California. Of all the new stadiums on the way, only Buffalo’s stadium will be open to the air … and the irony in that, given Buffalo’s tendency for epic snow, is perfect. There’s still a slight hope for generational snow games in the seasons to come.

This was the latest gut punch for a franchise that limped into this conference title matchup. The high of winning a divisional round thriller against the Buffalo Bills in overtime was almost instantly shattered once word got out that Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury. That thrust backup Jarrett Stidham into the limelight, and while the veteran had his moments, he couldn't get his team to pull off what would've been a miraculous upset.

Now, Sean Payton's club is looking into the abyss of the offseason and on the precipice of doing a postmortem of the 2025 season. By most accounts, it was a wildly successful campaign, owning a 14-3 record over the regular season, which was good enough for an NFC West title and the No. 1 seed. As they look to begin preparing for the 2026 season, let's highlight what's on the horizon for the organization.

Bo Nix's recovery takes center stage

Nix suffered a broken right ankle in the final moments of that overtime win against the Bills. The second-year quarterback has already undergone surgery to repair the ankle, with the procedure done this week. The early prognosis was that Nix is expected to be sidelined for 12 weeks. If he stays on that recovery timeline, Nix should only miss a small amount of OTAs (if any) and certainly be on track to participate during mandatory minicamp later this spring. That gives Nix plenty of time to get into form before Denver opens up training camp, so this injury is not debilitating enough that it'll bleed into 2026.

Does the coaching staff lose key figures?

Payton has been able to bring the Broncos back to relevance, but that success may soon result in key figures on his coaching staff being poached. With Denver now eliminated, teams looking for a head coach can now hold in-person interviews with Broncos staffers, including defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and offensive pass game coordinator Davis Webb. Both Joseph and Webb have been popular candidates this hiring cycle, and it would not be shocking to see one or both coaches depart in short order.

Webb has interest from the Las Vegas Raiders and Buffalo Bills, and neither of those destinations has filled their vacancy to this point. Webb also interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens, but the franchise recently hired former Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter. While Payton calls the offensive plays, having someone of Webb's acumen departing is hardly ideal for a still-developing offense under Nix.

As for Joseph, he has been requested by a large contingent of teams. While some of those organizations have since filled their roles, the Raiders and Arizona Cardinals are two clubs that have expressed interest in Joseph and are still on the hunt for a new coach.

Joseph's potential exit could prove to be the biggest X factor of Denver's offseason. A big piece as to why the Broncos made it to the AFC Championship was due to Joseph orchestrating arguably the best defense in the NFL. Denver was fourth in the NFL in scoring and first in the NFL in sacks (including postseason). If Joseph leaves, there's the risk that the unit takes a slight step back.

Bolstering offense around Nix

A couple of the areas the Broncos should look to address this offseason come on the offensive side of the ball. Specifically, they need to continue surrounding Nix with talent at the skill positions. This season, the Broncos ranked 28th in the NFL in yards per reception from the wide receiver and tight end positions combined. Courtland Sutton was able to lead the team with 1,017 yards receiving, but Denver did struggle to find a top secondary pass-catching option, volleying from Troy Franklin to Pat Bryant to Marvin Mims at receiver. They also never truly got Evan Engram off the ground as Payton's ""Joker"" at the tight end spot.

Moreover, Denver need to bolster the backfield. The rushing attack cratered after J.K. Dobbins went down with a foot injury in Week 10. Rookie RJ Harvey averaged just 3.7 yards per carry on the year. Their inability to run the football effectively came back to bite them in the AFC Championship, where they averaged just 3.3 yards per rush as a team. With a backup quarterback under center and snowy conditions late in the contest, a capable ground attack could've helped them pull off the upset. Instead, that deficiency helped be their undoing. With Dobbins looking at free agency this offseason, along with a shaky injury history, Denver would be wise to add a back in some capacity this offseason.

Travis Hunter's return from a season-ending knee injury and how the Jaguars eventually settle on using him next season is one of the biggest offseason storylines.

At his season-ending news conference, general manager James Gladstone said Hunter would be be a two-way player again in 2026. Whether he'll be a cornerback first and then a receiver -- as Gladstone hinted -- or a receiver first and then a cornerback remains to be seen.

Hunter finished his rookie season as more of a receiver than corner. He played 67% of the team's offensive snaps and 36% of the defensive snaps -- mainly coming in when the Jaguars were in nickel -- before the non-contact knee injury he suffered in practice on Oct. 30 required season-ending surgery.

But Gladstone indicated that it would be the reverse in 2026.

""Obviously you can take a peak at expiring contracts on our roster and see which side of the ball has more,"" he said ""At this point walking into the offseason, corner is a position that we have a few guys who are on expiring contracts. By default, you can expect there to be a higher emphasis on his placement [at corner].""

The Jaguars have three cornerbacks on expiring contracts: Greg Newsome II, Montaric Brown and Christian Braswell. Brown started 12 games and Newsome, whom the Jaguars acquired via trade in early October, started 11. There are two receivers whose contracts are expiring: Dyami Brown and Tim Patrick. They combined to catch 35 passes.

Hunter could start at one corner with Jourdan Lewis at the other, and in nickel situations Lewis could slide inside and Jarrian Jones would play outside, or Lewis could remain outside and Jones plays nickel.

Either way, early indications are that Hunter is primarily going to be a cornerback and have a package of plays on offense. What Gladstone does when free agency arrives will help clarify what the Jaguars will do with their two-way threat.

Here are four other major storylines for the Jaguars' 2026 offseason:

What happens with free agent RB Travis Etienne Jr. and LB Devin Lloyd?

Could either, or both, be back in 2026?

Etienne is coming off his third 1,000-yard rushing season (1,107) and posted 13 total touchdowns. He turned out to be a very good fit in coach Liam Coen's offense, improved as a pass blocker, and was the team's most consistent offensive player. He has 3,798 yards rushing in four seasons, which puts him third on the franchise's all-time list, and his 5,136 yards from scrimmage ranks fifth.

The estimated franchise tag for a running back in 2026 per OverTheCap.com would be $14.153 million, which would make Etienne the fourth-highest-paid running back in terms of annual salary. That would be nearly $3 million more than James Cook III ($11.5 million), who led the NFL in rushing in 2025.

Using the tag seems unlikely, especially since the Jaguars drafted Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen Jr. in 2025 with an eye toward replacing Etienne in 2026. Both made modest contributions as rookies: Tuten ran for 307 yards and averaged 3.7 yards per carry and Allen was used mainly as a pass protector and third-down back.

But Etienne said he wasn't ruling out coming back.

""When I got drafted here, I wanted to be one of the best running backs to ever put on a jersey,"" he said. ""I wanted to be remembered like the guys, Fred Taylor, Maurice Jones-Drew. You want to set that standard. You want to leave a legacy.""

Lloyd's situation is different. He was the No. 27 pick in 2022 -- the Jaguars traded back into the first round to select him -- and was named the NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Month in September 2022. But he has had an up-and-down career since then.

He started every game he played in 2023 and 2024 and had more than 100 tackles in each season but often had issues in coverage and got caught out of position in run defense, and as a result the team opted to not pick up his fifth-year option last spring.

Lloyd responded with the best season of his career: five interceptions, one fumble recovery, 10 quarterback hits and second-team All-Pro honors.

The estimated franchise tag for linebackers, per OverTheCap.com, is $27.45 million. That's a high number to spend on a linebacker who doesn't pass rush and the Jaguars are unlikely to use the tag, so Lloyd will be a free agent.

In November, ESPN ranked Lloyd as the 23rd-best impending free agent. The only linebackers higher on the list were Quay Walker, who is coming off his rookie contract, and Khalil Mack, who turns 35 in February.

Lloyd talked around the question of whether he wanted to return.

""I just want to be where God wants me to be,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, that's where I want to be and I'm waiting on that answer from him. Like I said, I haven't put any thought into it. Everything's been about trying to be the best player I can be for this team this year. And ultimately, I want to be where God wants me to be.""

A new contract for Travon Walker?

As of now, Walker will be playing the 2026 season under his fifth-year option. And though there are no indications the team will be working on a contract extension soon, it sounds as if the Jaguars do want him around long term.

Walker played through a broken left hand and a right knee injury in 2025 and finished with 3.5 sacks (the fewest since his rookie season), 38 tackles and 13 QB hits in 14 games. The No. 1 pick in 2022 now has 27.5 sacks and 57 QB hits in four seasons.

Though Walker hasn't become the dominant pass rusher the previous regime hoped for, he has been a powerful edge setter and is very good against the run. Gladstone was effusive in his praise of Walker's work ethic, attitude and willingness to play through injuries.

""The thing that I really appreciate in watching Travon move is how much he loves this place, how much he loves his teammates,"" Gladstone said. ""That just seeps out of his soul. Those are the type of people you want to align yourself with. It's the type of players that we want to make sure that are still in our building moving forward.""

So what could a potential extension look like? It would be surprising if it were anywhere close to what Detroit gave Aidan Hutchinson, who was selected one spot after Walker: four years, $180 million, $141 million guaranteed. His $45 million annual salary is second only to Green Bay's Micah Parsons ($46.5 million) among pass rushers.

Hutchison has been a much better pass rusher than Walker: Hutchinson has 43 sacks (tied for seventh most in NFL since 2022) while playing in seven fewer games.

A better comparison could be the extension that teammate Josh Hines-Allen signed in April 2024: five years, $141.25 million with $88 million guaranteed. That's $28.25 million annually, which ranks ninth among edge rushers. Hines-Allen has 40.5 sacks since 2022, including 17.5 in 2023.

""I just play ball and let my agent and people upstairs do what they're going to do,"" Walker said. ""I would love to be here. I wouldn't want to be nowhere else. I love this community. I love the players in this locker room. I love the coaching staff. I love everything about this organization.

""I like the trajectory that we're going and I want to be a part of it. So I'd love to be here forever.""

What do the Jaguars do with WR Brian Thomas Jr.?

ESPN's Bill Barnwell wrote on Thursday that Thomas would draw significant interest if the Jaguars were willing to make him available for a trade despite a significant dip in production in 2025.

Thomas had a rough start to the 2025 season, catching 27 passes for 365 yards and one touchdown, and averaging 13.5 yards per catch with five drops in the Jaguars' first seven games. The Jaguars were using him more in the middle in those first seven games and Thomas wasn't comfortable -- he appeared to shy away from contact several times (including in the end zone against Cincinnati) -- in that role.

The Jaguars then used him differently: more outside the numbers and down the field to stretch the defense and create more openings for Jakobi Meyers, Parker Washington and Brenton Strange in the middle and on intermediate routes.

Thomas was more productive in that role, catching 21 passes for 342 yards and a touchdown, and had only one drop in the final nine games.

He also averaged nearly 3 yards more per catch -- 16.3 -- in that stretch.

But trading him isn't a wild idea. This regime didn't draft him, Washington has emerged as a major part of the offense, Meyers is locked in for at least the next two seasons, and Thomas could draw a first-round pick in return.

However, the Jaguars view Thomas as an integral part of the offense moving forward, with Coen saying he and the coaching staff would ""continue to pour into guys to try to get the most out of then to help our team win as many games as humanly possible and B.T. will 100 percent be a part of that.""

What happens with OL Walker Little?

On Dec. 2, 2024, Little signed a three-year, $40.5 million contract extension (with $25.9 million guaranteed) to be the Jaguars' left tackle. Thirteen months later, Cole Van Lanen signed a three-year, $51 million contract extension (with $32.5 million guaranteed) to be the Jaguars' left tackle.

Van Lanen is clearly Coen and Gladstone's choice to be the starting left tackle going forward.

So where does that leave Little in 2026? Here are some options:

He could be the backup swing tackle, but his base salary of $11 million is fully guaranteed in 2026, which would mean the Jaguars' highest-paid offensive lineman in terms of base salary wouldn't be a starter.

He could compete for a spot at guard. That's where he ended up playing in Weeks 16 and 17 last season, starting in place of injured right guard Patrick Mekari. Mekari, by the way, has the second-highest base salary of any Jaguars offensive lineman in 2026 ($10.5 million).

The Jaguars could trade him. It would cost the team $7.235 million in dead money and save them $7.265 million. But teams know Little is no longer a starter at tackle so that probably would lessen the substance of any offers. The Jaguars do have fourth-round pick Wyatt Milum as a potential swing tackle replacement.

Competing for the spot at guard seems most likely. Coen and offensive line coach Shaun Sarrett want linemen who can play multiple positions, and Little is experienced, with 39 starts at tackle and guard.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0126%2Fr1605719_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:02:27.256447

Later that summer, Whelan usurped veteran Pat O'Donnell for the Packers' punting job and has only continued to get better during each of his three seasons in Green Bay.
Green Bay is not an easy NFL city to punt in, especially once the temperatures start to dip in November.
Veteran long snapper Matt Orzech arrived in Green Bay during the same 2023 offseason as Whelan.","GREEN BAY – There aren't many NFL players who can outrun Bo Melton. It's been his signature trait since entering the league in 2022.

That prodigious 4.3 speed made Melton an ideal candidate to serve as a flyer for Daniel Whelan and the Packers' punt unit, one of two perimeter players responsible for applying the initial pressure on the opposing team's returner.

And what a responsibility that turned out to be.

Once Melton started working with Whelan a couple years ago, he noticed an interesting pattern developing. He kept running, the punts kept going and punt returners kept backing up.

""He boots that ball so far,"" said Melton with a laugh. ""Daniel is that guy. He has that boot. Just blessed to be on a team where he can punt that thing and give his guys time to get down there.""

Whelan's combination of natural talent, pure power and an insatiable desire to take his game to another level has positioned him as one of the NFL's top up-and-coming punters.

It also catapulted the 6-foot-5, 219-pound punter to the top of the team's record book after Whelan shattered the Packers' single-season records for both gross (51.7 yards per punt) and net (43.9) punting average.

His gross average ranked No. 1 in the NFL and marked the first time a Green Bay punter has led the league in the category since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger. It was also the third-best single-season mark by a punter with at least 40 punts in NFL history.

Whelan isn't one to publicly bask in the glory of his own success. Even after notching the most decorated season ever by a Packers punter, he'd rather point the credit to Melton or the coverage team than acknowledge his vital part of the process.

""Love that. That's good for the punt team,"" said Whelan after the regular season. ""It's all them.""

It does have plenty to do with Whelan, too. After sifting through six punters over seven years, Green Bay brought in the Irish-born Whelan after a standout 2023 season with the XFL's D.C. Defenders.

Later that summer, Whelan usurped veteran Pat O'Donnell for the Packers' punting job and has only continued to get better during each of his three seasons in Green Bay.

The NFL is starting to take notice. Whelan was the No. 1-graded punter this season, according to Pro Football Focus, and received three first-team votes in AP All-Pro balloting. Green Bay has never had a punter make the All-Pro team.

""He's a great dude, great in the locker room, but he's a real weapon out on the field in terms of being able to flip the field,"" Head Coach Matt LaFleur said. ""I feel like anytime we've gotten in some of those critical moments where we really need a great kick, he's come through for us.""

Green Bay is not an easy NFL city to punt in, especially once the temperatures start to dip in November. The wind patterns can be tricky not only inside Lambeau Field but also at practice.

Whelan has found a way to cut through all of it. Veteran long snapper Matt Orzech arrived in Green Bay during the same 2023 offseason as Whelan. Even now, Orzech is in awe of what his fellow specialist can do.

""Bombs. Honestly,"" said Orzech when asked what he saw from Whelan this past season. ""From the day he showed up, it was immediately obvious that his leg explosion was pretty impressive. I've never seen somebody who hits 5.0-plus (seconds for hang time) punts consistently. Even in crazy wind or cold, there's still going to be a 5.0 on the chart for the day, which is unbelievable. It's crazy.""

Melton and fellow flyer Zayne Anderson often have a good laugh about Whelan's ability to defy the laws of gravity at times and his ability to position the ball.

Whelan made obvious strides in his directional punting in 2025 while still downing 18 punts inside the 20. When the time came to swing away, Whelan could handle it, too. His 32 punts of 50-plus yards ranked fourth in the NFL and were the most by a Packer in a season dating back to 2000.

For good measure, Whelan knocked down one last accolade in the Packers' regular-season finale against Minnesota when he posted a gross average of 53.9 yards and a net average of 50.8 yards on a career-high eight punts.

His net average of 50.8 yards per punt was the second-best mark by an NFL player since 2000 in games with eight-plus punts (Johnny Hekker; Dec. 4, 2016).

Recognition isn't what drives Whelan, though. It's never been his goal to simply break records. He wants to win games and get to a Super Bowl. If his foot helps make that happen, then the 26-year-old punter feels like he's doing his job.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/fwy4pob1hmvkuxhtdpdq,N,,2026-01-26 17:00:53.852704

After missing just five contests during four seasons in Jacksonville, Cisco acknowledged the challenge of watching the team's results unfold without being on the field.
But despite missing the final 9 games, the 2025 season served as a valuable learning experience for the newcomer.
Cisco, who is set to become a free agent this offseason, spoke highly of the relationships he built during his first season with the Green & White.
The Jets failed to record an interception during the 2025 season.","The 2025 season was a bittersweet homecoming for New York native S Andre Cisco.

The five-year veteran -- who was born in Queens, attended high school on Long Island and played college football at Syracuse -- was signed by the Jets in March after spending four seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

""I've enjoyed it,"" he said of his return to the area. ""Just coming back to the Northeast, being in the atmosphere of the people and all of those things has been really refreshing for me.""

On the field, however, Cisco did not have the season he envisioned. The former third-round draft selection sustained a season-ending pectoral injury during a Week 8 win over Cincinnati and underwent surgery the following week. Prior to the injury, Cisco had played all but 1 defensive snap, and his 41 tackles were the second most on the team through 8 contests.

Cisco, who mentioned he tries ""to find a spiritual lesson with everything,"" said his time spent on the sidelines was no different.

""I feel like I've matured a lot during these last eight to nine weeks,"" he shared on Jan. 5. ""Just being on the sideline and taking some time. I've never been on IR in-season, so that's the most time I missed. It's very unique, obviously, within that.""

After missing just five contests during four seasons in Jacksonville, Cisco acknowledged the challenge of watching the team's results unfold without being on the field. But despite missing the final 9 games, the 2025 season served as a valuable learning experience for the newcomer.

""I learned a lot about being on a new team and being considered more of a veteran,"" he said. ""Coming here and being a veteran presence taught me a lot. What guys really need from veteran presences; I was trying to be that most of the year.""

Cisco, who is set to become a free agent this offseason, spoke highly of the relationships he built during his first season with the Green & White.

""I really appreciate the year I had here,"" he said. ""Really thankful for AG [HC Aaron Glenn] and Mougey [GM Darren Mougey] and how they do things.""

He added: ""AG was probably the most transparent I've had as a head coach, in terms of just being honest, but also being uplifting and positive. I think the biggest thing is, he knows what he wants his team to look like. He was able to pinpoint those things easily and just continue to enforce it. And I think things will get turned around.""

Part of that turnaround could involve making more plays on the ball. The Jets failed to record an interception during the 2025 season. And Cisco -- who recorded 8 INTs across his four seasons in Jacksonville, including a career-high 4 in 2023 -- said taking the ball away is part of ""the brand that I try to carry.""

""As a group, we've got to make plays on the ball,"" he said. ""We've also just got to continue to limit explosives. It's cookie cutter to say, but it's really true. If you limit explosives, you win games.""

As the Jets focus on these defensive details during the offseason and beyond, Cisco's priority will be on elevating other aspects of his game.

""Maximizing my skill set,"" he said of his goals for the offseason. ""Making plays on the ball has been such a key thing for me that I need to continue to refine other parts of my game, so that I'm available to do everything and every type of job.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/rppcp4a35fh6cqjxbqms,N,,2026-01-26 14:01:33.857740

His second team moved on after 17 starts.

His third team signed him solely as a backup.

His fourth team won its most games in a quarter-century with Darnold as its starter. But when he couldn't win his last two, pressure-packed games, however, the team decided to go with an untested rookie instead.

Last spring, the Seattle Seahawks became the fifth NFL team to give Darnold a chance when they signed the 28-year-old as a free agent. Less than a year later, Darnold gave them a Super Bowl berth Sunday.

In Seattle's 31-27 win over the Rams in the NFC championship game, Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns with no turnovers — the type of performance in a high-stakes game that, given the way he was traded, released and given up on by his four previous teams, few believed Darnold was capable of during his winding, eight-year path through the NFL.

“You can’t talk about the game without talking about our quarterback,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said. “He just shut a lot of people up tonight, so I’m really happy for him.”

In the 103rd game of his career, Darnold has now made a Super Bowl before any of the four other quarterbacks drafted in the 2018 first round, including Most Valuable Player winners Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens.

Russell Wilson, who as quarterback led Seattle to a Super Bowl win during the 2013 season and an appearance the next, wrote on X late Sunday that ""Darnold's comeback story over the past 2 years has been one of the most inspirational things to watch! Cool seeing him overcome!!!!""

When the Super Bowl begins Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, it will feature opponents that undertook lighting-quick rebuilds. New England was 4-13 last season before hiring Mike Vrabel as coach a year ago; Macdonald created what many statistics judged the NFL's best defense in only his second season as head coach.

The quarterback on one sideline has also taken an accelerated path to the NFL's biggest stage. At 23 years old, New England's Drake Maye will become the second-youngest quarterback ever to start a Super Bowl. Maye, the third overall pick in 2024, will be making just his 34th career start.

Six years before Maye was drafted, Darnold was selected third overall, too, by an AFC East also-ran. But to say Darnold's own journey to the Super Bowl, in contrast, was more winding would be an understatement.

“For him to overcome what he had to overcome, I’m rolling with Sam all day,” said Smith-Njigba, who accounted for 153 yards on 10 catches, and a touchdown, Sunday. “We believe in him.”

""I feel that support,"" Darnold said. ""Not with only their words but with how everyone treats each other in the building. There's a lot of respect that goes around the building. Everyone respects the work that we all put into this great game and so I'm just happy to be part of this team, man.""

Many teams had taken chances on Darnold, believing in the potential that was revealed Sunday.

Instead, after 38 games with the woeful Jets, he was traded to Carolina, where Darnold started 17 games before too many losses and injuries contributed to losing a quarterback competition to Baker Mayfield in 2022. The next season, Darnold got an up-close view to a Super Bowl appearance — as a backup in San Francisco. A year later, when Minnesota rookie J.J. McCarthy got hurt in preseason, Darnold stepped in as the starter and with unexpectedly shocking results, and led the Vikings to a 14-3 record.

He looked to be playing his way to a giant contract as a free agent until the Vikings fell apart during their last two games, with Darnold unable to reproduce his strong statistics while under constant pressure. The capper was a blowout loss in the Wild Card round to the Rams, who harassed Darnold into nine sacks.

During free agency, Minnesota judged McCarthy to be its future and moved on. Even Seattle hedged its bets on Darnold. Though the totals in his contract with the Seahawks said three years and $100 million, the fine print reportedly contained a contractual ripcord that the team could pull after just one season.

By throwing for 4,048 yards, a career-high completion percentage and helping Seattle earn the NFC's top seed in the playoffs, Darnold's season suggested his turnaround in Minnesota was no fluke. And yet, it also didn't settle questions about his postseason readiness. In two of the team's most-important games of the year against the Rams, he had thrown for just two touchdowns and six interceptions combined. And his 14 interceptions were the third-most in the NFL.

Even Seattle's 41-6 playoff-opening win last week against San Francisco spurred doubts. Darnold had played despite injuring his oblique days earlier while practicing, and in the week leading up to the NFC title-game matchup against the Rams, Darnold nursed the injury by ""barely practicing,"" said Macdonald, the Seahawks' coach.

Had the injury occurred halfway through the season, Darnold said, he might have been concerned by the lack of practice repetitions. He felt he'd accumulated enough by the championship game to trust his preparation.

He was right.

""It's should go down as one of the best performances in playoff history, I imagine"" considering his lack of practice time, Macdonald said.

One year after sacking him nine times in the playoffs, the Rams again tried to rattle Darnold with pressure that he countered by throwing three touchdowns.

It was Darnold's third consecutive game without a turnover.

Since throwing for four interceptions, without a touchdown, in a Week 11 loss to the Rams, Darnold has thrown for 12 touchdowns and four interceptions. After the Nov. 16 loss to the Rams, Darnold had impressed linebacker Ernest Jones IV by arriving early to the Seahawks' practice facility to begin working on the next week's opponent.

“Sam’s impressed me by like, he can just move forward,” Jones IV said. “...Sam trusts his arm, he trusts his ability and we trust Sam. So all you gotta do is give Sam that encouragement or whatever the case may be. Let him know that we got his back, and he’s able to lead us to a Super Bowl.”

That trust by Seattle in Darnold was apparent after getting the ball back with 4:54 left in the fourth quarter while holding a four-point lead and hoping to run out the clock. On the drive's seventh play, facing second and 10, Darnold rolled out to pass and found the NFL's leading receiver, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, for a first down. Two plays after that, on second and 7, Fox broadcaster Tom Brady expressed surprise that Seattle was putting the ball in Darnold's hands to pass on a bootleg play rather than run the ball, to try to run out the clock. It led to a defensive holding penalty.

""Courageous call,"" Brady said.

By the drive's end, the Rams got the ball back with just 25 seconds and were unable to drive the field in time for a go-ahead score.

In the Super Bowl, Darnold will face the same Patriots franchise that once flummoxed him so badly that cameras caught him telling Jets teammates on the sideline that he was ""seeing ghosts.""

Now the Patriots will be seeing a whole different quarterback.

""I almost forgot about it,"" Darnold said, smiling. ""For me, there was a lot that I didn't know back then, so I'm just going to continue to learn and grow in this great game. There's a lot of stuff that I can be better from today, even.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260125-darnold-1028-GR-57c4b2.jpg",N,,2026-01-26 11:04:04.546862

The presence of Gardner has taken on greater importance in light of the uncertain situation with the Colts' other top cornerback, Charvarius Ward.","INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indianapolis Colts had just executed one of the biggest trades in franchise history, and the excitement was still palpable.

Cornerback Sauce Gardner, a former No. 4 draft pick, had been acquired from the New York Jets for a huge haul, and the acquisition had the Colts -- who were 7-2 at the time -- thinking big.

Gardner, who had done nothing but lose games during the first half of the season in New York, was also thrilled.

""I'm looking forward to this year and my future as a Colt,"" he said in his introductory news conference on Nov. 6.

But what actually transpired in Gardner's immediate future was mostly a letdown. The Colts went into a tailspin that destroyed their season. And Gardner sustained a left calf injury that he couldn't shake. He went on to play just 36% of the team's defensive snaps in the eight games after the trade, and the Colts never reaped the immediate rewards they hoped the trade would yield.

Indianapolis, tied for the best record in the NFL at the time of the trade, lost its final seven games after a series of injuries that included quarterback Daniel Jones' season-ending ruptured right Achilles.

And yet, there is widespread optimism in the organization about Gardner moving forward.

""He's incredible,"" coach Shane Steichen said. ""He's a hell of a player. He's sticky in coverage. He's an elite corner that can win one-on-one matchups. Every time he was out there, he did a hell of a job doing it.

""So, [I'm] really looking forward to his future in this organization.""

The delayed gratification of the trade would seem difficult to accept. The Colts traded two first-round picks (2026 and 2027) and receiver Adonai Mitchell for Gardner. It was a huge cost, with some in NFL circles critiquing the deal even before Gardner's injury.

But the Colts are keeping the whole thing in perspective, believing that Gardner's presence on their roster for years to come is just as valuable as the potential playoff boost they hoped he was going to bring in the 2025 season.

For one, the Colts have emphasized their flexibility and contractual control of Gardner for five more seasons after he signed an extension with the Jets just last year. Gardner, a two-time first-team All-Pro selection, has a team-friendly contract with modest salary cap figures for the next two seasons. And if Gardner's play declines in the future, the Colts would suffer no cap consequence for moving on from him.

But the expectation is Gardner will be part of the Colts for the foreseeable future.

""I definitely think this is a long-term home, and that's been communicated to me,"" Gardner said. ""Teams need premier cornerbacks.""

General manager Chris Ballard, whose reputation is somewhat tied to the long-term outcome of the trade, remains bullish on Gardner. Ballard mulled the trade for weeks before executing it on the NFL's trade deadline in November.

""I kept asking myself, 'Look, would we get this guy in the draft?'"" Ballard said. ""Well, maybe [if we] get a little luck. But you're talking about a premier guy that's been to Pro Bowls. He's 24 years old and the contract was, we thought, advantageous to acquire.

""Sauce has got a really bright future, and he's going to be a core piece for us here for a while.""

Gardner has maintained a consistently optimistic attitude about the situation, even in light of his injury. He has quickly acclimated to his new surroundings and become popular among his teammates. And Gardner is all-in on Indianapolis.

""It's a lot of good that came out of this and is still coming out of this,"" he said at the conclusion of the season.

""I definitely look forward to being a part of the future here. I know I'm going to continue to do what I have to do on and off the field, so I'm looking forward to what we're going to do.""

The presence of Gardner has taken on greater importance in light of the uncertain situation with the Colts' other top cornerback, Charvarius Ward. He said earlier this month that he is contemplating retirement after severe complications following a series of concussions this season. Ward, one season into a three-year, $54 million contract, said he plans to discuss the issue with his family and come to a decision in the near future.

The Colts envisioned the pair of corners locking down receivers during the stretch run this season, but both ended up sidelined. But they see Gardner as a sure thing, a player quarterbacks will have to consistently contend with.

""We got a 24-year-old premier cornerback that still has upside,"" Ballard said. ""Those guys are not easy to find.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0122%2Fr1604257_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:03:38.929140

Predicting risers

Which prospect are you most excited to see in Mobile?

Miller:Caleb Banks, DT, Florida. Banks stands out on tape when healthy. But he wasn't healthy this past season after suffering a foot injuryin fall camp that ultimately limited him to three games. If he's well enough to participate this week, Banks could reignite the Round 1 buzz he had entering the season. The 6-foot-6, 330-pound nose tackle has a rare speed-to-power combination that would be a must-watch in individual drills against Senior Bowl offensive linemen.

Reid:Chris Johnson, CB, San Diego State. Johnson was named Mountain West Co-Defensive Player of the Year after intercepting four passes this season, two of which he returned for touchdowns. A true technician, the 6-foot 185-pounder has outstanding foot quickness, which allows him to remain sticky in press coverage. He also shows the spatial awareness to make plays in zone. Johnson needs to answer questions about his vertical speed and whether he can play with power-conference receivers, but he's already receiving strong Day 2 buzz. Don't be surprised if he's entrenched in the top 50 with a good performance in Mobile.

Yates;Keylan Rutledge, G, Georgia Tech. Why not go a little off the board here? I believe Rutledge will hear his name called on Day 2, as he started 26 games the past two seasons for a Yellow Jackets team that relies on gap schemes in the running game. The 6-foot-4, 320-pounder is one of this draft's most physical players, a trait he'll have the chance to showcase during one-on-ones. There are certain players whose play style immediately draws you in, and Rutledge does that for me. He could put a defender on his back a few times this week, both in practices and in Saturday's game.

Make one prediction about the Senior Bowl quarterbacks.

Reid:LSU'sGarrett Nussmeierwill be the most impressive passer this week because his anticipation and accuracy will shine in this setting. The 6-foot-1, 205-pound Nussmeier has a daredevil mentality and isn't shy about throwing into tight windows over the middle of the field or outside the numbers. His experience with altering protections at the line of scrimmage will also stand out. After a disappointing, injury-plagued season, Nussmeier will be looking to recapture the early-round buzz he had entering 2025. In speaking to scouts over the past few weeks, the highest projection I've heard is Round 3, but others had Round 5 or 6 grades on him. I think Nussmeier will improve on those this week.

Make one prediction about the pass catchers.

Yates: There will be a period of practice when NC State tight end Justin Jolysteals the spotlight. Joly, who spent his final two seasons with the Wolfpack after two years at UConn, is a terrific athlete and receiver at the position. Though he is listed at 6-foot-3 and 263 pounds on NC State's roster (Senior Bowl-verified measurements will come out early next week), he has the timing and catch radius to be one of those ""just throw it in his direction"" pass catchers. And keep an eye on him for Rounds 3-5 at the draft.

Make one prediction about the rest of the offensive group.

Miller: Penn State running back Nicholas Singletonwill break out. He has the tools to shine at the Senior Bowl after a quiet season in which he had only 549 rushing yards on 123 carries as part of a greater Nittany Lions offensive malaise. Singleton's burst at 6 feet, 224 pounds stands out as a trait that teams will always covet when evaluating running backs. There isn't a clear RB2 in the class behind Jeremiyah Love, and Singleton could rise into that ranking.

Make one prediction about the edge rusher group.

Reid: We'll be talking about Texas Tech'sRomello Height as one of the biggest risers of the week, and I expect him to generate eye-popping pressure during one-on-ones due to his bend and determination. The 6-foot-3, 235-pound Height combined with David Bailey to form a fearsome Red Raiders pass rush, finishing with 10 sacks this season. Height is a bit lean and will turn 25 before next season, but he could have an immediate, pivotal role as a situational pass rusher in the NFL. I see a late-Day 2, early-Day 3 prospect.

Make one prediction about the cornerback group.

Miller: Georgia is known for producing NFL defensive backs, and Daylen Everette will break out this week thanks to his elite size and SEC experience. The 6-foot-1, 190-pounder is sticky at the line of scrimmage and has parlayed that into five career interceptions. Everette's talent in press coverage makes him stand out on tape. And with the lack of high-end receiver talent at the Senior Bowl, Everette -- who is probably a third-rounder -- should excel in one-on-ones and when asked to hang near the line of scrimmage.

Make one prediction about the rest of the defensive group.

Yates:Pittsburgh'sKyle Louiswill emerge as one of the big winners of the week. He was a star linebacker for the Panthers, but he will almost assuredly move to safety in the NFL because of his frame (6-foot-1, 220 pounds) -- and I believe he has the skills to become a starter there. Louis has excellent ball skills (six interceptions over the past two seasons) and unmistakable tenacity. His energy will show up in practice, as will his coverage skills against tight ends. I believe he's a Day 2 pick.

Call your shot now: Which potential Day 3 sleepers will be big risers this week?

Kevin Coleman Jr., WR, Missouri. Coleman emerged as the Tigers' No. 1 wide receiver and a fifth-round prospect this season, catching 66 passes for 732 yards and 1 touchdown. His yards-after-catch ability at 5-foot-11, 180 pounds is notable. He's electric in space and has elite acceleration skills. Coleman also returned a punt for a touchdown this season, further highlighting his elusiveness. It seems as though an undersized receiver turns heads every year in Mobile, and Coleman's route-running skills and pure speed should stand out. -- Miller

Keyron Crawford, Edge, Auburn. Though first-round lock Keldric Faulk is the Auburn pass rusher who gets the headlines, Crawford caught my attention when I watched the Tigers this season. He finished fourth in the SEC with 43 pressures and is a bendy athlete with good quickness off the edge, along with standout hand usage. He uses a formidable swipe-and-chop move to get around pass protectors and should give tackles fits during one-on-ones. Crawford could come off the board anywhere from Round 3 to Round 5. -- Yates

J'Mari Taylor, RB, Virginia. Taylor was the engine of the Cavaliers' offense and one of the biggest surprises in the ACC this season. The North Carolina Central transfer made the FCS-to-FBS transition with ease, leading conference running backs with 14 touchdowns and finishing third with 1,062 rushing yards. Taylor is a sturdy, balanced rusher who also has value as a pass catcher out of the backfield. It's tough for running backs to excel in an all-star game setting, but Taylor is a fourth- or fifth-round prospect who could find his stock soaring after Senior Bowl week. -- Reid

Tacario Davis, CB, Washington. Remember two years ago, when Davis was at Arizona and we were talking about him as a potential Round 1 player? The 6-foot-4, 200-pound corner followed coach Jedd Fisch to Washington and saw his play decline, but the tools are still there. This week could be a reminder to scouts of his raw ability. As a press-coverage standout, Davis should be sticking to receivers at the line of scrimmage all week in practice. He carries a fifth-round grade at the moment. -- Miller

Ted Hurst, WR, Georgia State. Hurst had an excellent final season that included four games with 100-plus yards and four with a 50-plus-yard catch. Hurst is a big-bodied wideout (6-foot-3, 185 pounds) with impressive movement skills. Georgia State used him as a vertical threat and an underneath target on screen opportunities. When he reaches top speed, it's impressive to watch. This week will be a good test against top-tier competition, and I think he's a late-Day 2, early-Day 3 prospect. -- Yates

Max Iheanachor, OT, Arizona State. He played well against Texas Tech's Bailey-Height edge rusher duo and is a highly athletic tackle prospect. A former soccer and basketball player, Iheanachor's strong hands and light feet make him a prime candidate to shine during one-on-one pass-rush drills. He needs to get stronger as a run blocker, but Iheanachor is one of the best pass blockers in this year's class. He's viewed as a middle-round pick but could rise into the top 100 after this week. -- Reid

The NFL Draft, especially for quarterbacks, is a complex puzzle.

It means that even if Allar recovers and plays well, he'll still be part of a crowded field vying for attention and, ultimately, NFL draft selection.","It's tough when you hear about a promising young athlete facing a serious injury. For Penn State quarterback Drew Allar, the news of a significant setback has inevitably cast a shadow over his future, particularly concerning his prospects for the 2026 NFL Draft. While the immediate concern is his recovery and return to the field, the ripple effects of such an injury in the hyper-competitive world of college football and professional scouting are undeniable.

We've seen how injuries can derail even the most talented players. The question now is how this particular setback will impact Allar's draft stock. Scouts and analysts are constantly evaluating not just raw talent, but also durability and the ability to perform under pressure, especially after adversity. The narrative around a player can shift dramatically, and a serious injury can introduce a new layer of uncertainty that wasn't there before.

It's not just about the physical toll; it's also about the mental fortitude required to come back stronger. For Allar, the path forward will involve not only rehabbing but also demonstrating that he can regain his form and leadership on the field. The upcoming season, whenever he's able to fully participate, will be crucial in rebuilding that confidence, both for himself and for the evaluators watching.

And let's be honest, the quarterback landscape in college football is always buzzing. Names like Shedeur Sanders and Arch Manning are frequently in the conversation, often compared and contrasted with players like Allar. There's a constant churn of talent, and while Allar has shown flashes of brilliance, the competition is fierce. Experts and fans alike are always looking for the next big thing, and the debate over who is truly 'better' is a constant fixture in sports media.

Interestingly, the reference material highlights a few key points that paint a broader picture. There's talk of Allar excelling off the field, which is certainly a positive sign of maturity and dedication. Penn State's hopes for a National Championship run are often tied to his performance, underscoring his importance to the team. Yet, there's also criticism regarding leadership, suggesting that even before any injury, the narrative around him wasn't entirely one-sided.

The NFL Draft, especially for quarterbacks, is a complex puzzle. Teams are looking for a blend of physical tools, mental acuity, and leadership. While Allar possesses many of the desired attributes, the injury adds a significant variable. It forces a re-evaluation of his timeline and his readiness for the professional level. Will teams see this as a temporary blip, or a reason to look elsewhere? The answer likely lies in his recovery and his performance in the games he can play.

We also see discussions about other promising quarterbacks, like Garrett Nussmeier and Luke Altmyer, being compared to Allar. This constant comparison is part of the game, and it underscores the depth of talent at the quarterback position in college football. It means that even if Allar recovers and plays well, he'll still be part of a crowded field vying for attention and, ultimately, NFL draft selection.

Ultimately, Drew Allar's journey is a compelling one to watch. The injury is a significant hurdle, but it doesn't necessarily define his entire future. His resilience, his ability to overcome this challenge, and his performance on the field will be the true determinants of his NFL prospects. The 2026 draft class is still taking shape, and while this injury presents a challenge, it's not the end of the story.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-26 10:00:10.013062

No one should really expect to win the Super Bowl with essentially a rookie quarterback.
Kwesi and Kevin, Can you please sign Aaron Rodgers so we can get to the playoffs and possibly the Super Bowl?
As a fan for over 50 years, I'm starting to wonder if I will ever see that first Super Bowl win.","My mind wasn't on football much this weekend, but I'm going to keep the focus there in this edition.

Super Bowl LX will feature the Patriots and Seahawks on Feb. 8 in Northern California.

As the playoffs have reached this point, it's been an offseason filled with coaching changes across the NFL.

The NFL head coach openings reached 10 this offseason, matching 2022 when Vikings Head Coach Kevin O'Connell was hired.

He and Tampa Bay's Todd Bowles are the only two members of that class who are still with the teams that hired them.

The following teams have hired head coaches so far:

Dolphins: Jeff Hafley (was Packers DC from 2024-25)

Falcons: Kevin Stefanski (was Browns HC from 2020-25)

Giants: John Harbaugh (was Ravens HC from 2008-25)

Ravens: Jesse Minter (was Chargers DC from 2024-25)

Steelers: Mike McCarthy (last coached as Cowboys HC from 2020-24)

Titans: Robert Saleh (was 49ers DC in 2025 after being Jets HC from 2021-24)

The Bills, Browns, Cardinals and Raiders are still working on their hires.

That means there are numerous rows of dominoes still waiting to fall.

In the meantime, Vikings Defensive Coordinator Brian Flores signed a new contract with Minnesota (his previous one had expired earlier in January). Flores has interviewed for head coach openings and could still depart if chosen by another team for one of those positions, but for now, the Vikings can continue to evaluate prospects with the idea of their fit in Flores' scheme, which is valuable considering college all-star games are happening.

Teams are evaluating prospects at the 101st East-West Shrine Bowl in Frisco, Texas (game is this Tuesday night on NFL Network) and are sending evaluators to Mobile, Alabama, for the 77th Senior Bowl (game is Saturday on NFL Network).

Vikings.com's Rob Kleifield is heading down to the Gulf Coast to cover this week's Senior Bowl practices, so be on the lookout for coverage from ""L.A."" (Lower Alabama).

Let's get to some questions.

I really enjoyed watching Jalen Redmond play this past season. The Vikings have done pretty good with UDFAs, but he's truly a cut above. I hope they sign him to a four-to-five-year extension really soon so we can keep him after a decent season. I think he'll be a bit more expensive if he keeps up his production.

— Jason Gibeaut in Gallipolis, Ohio

If anyone missed last week's position recap of the defensive line, Redmond was a central figure throughout and listed by our Lindsey Young as the group's ""Unsung Hero,"" although we both agree that Redmond's flowers already began arriving, especially from Vikings fans. It's quite likely that his game film raised eyebrows across the NFL, and if he continues this trajectory, other fan bases will know him, as well.

Redmond scored well in metric after metric this season, showing impressive improvements from 2024 and is someone the Vikings are quite excited about continuing his career in Purple.

The in-depth, never-stop-combing scouting efforts that landed Redmond in summer of 2024 show relentlessness can yield rewards. Redmond is an exclusive rights free agent for 2026, making it highly likely he will be with Minnesota. This page from the NFL Operations Manual explains categories of free agents.

Redmond was set to become one last offseason before reaching a deal last January with the team, well ahead of free agency.

There's a baseline for what Redmond could make for 2026, but the Vikings might also consider going beyond that to avoid a future bidding battle with other teams once Redmond is no longer an ERFA. His line of 62 tackles, 12 TFLs, 6.0 sacks and five passes swatted at the line of scrimmage, along with a forced fumble and two fumble recoveries certainly generates a buzz.

Have the Vikings considered adding Malik Willis from Green Bay as a quarterback? He seems like a great option.

— D. Heine

We know that O'Connell and General Manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah emphasized that making the QBs room as deep and talented as possible during their end-of-season press conferences.

That could involve bringing in a free agent or making a trade if a veteran addition is desired.

Carson Wentz was added right before the season on a one-year deal. He is among this year's class of pending free agents.

Spotrac.com has a convenient list of QBs who are pending free agents that include Willis, the former Titans third-round pick who has impressed as Green Bay's backup for the past two seasons. Willis will be just 27 on May 27, so there's a good bit of football ahead for him.

It will be interesting to see what the market is for the free agent QBs. I've heard some people mention Willis being a candidate for some substantial dollars heading his way. Daniel Jones is oft-mentioned as one of the most likely to generate interest, but he's coming off a late-season Achilles injury.

Note: this was sent earlier last week before Flores' new contract was announced, but I'm including to cover the second part of the question.

Will the Vikings receive compensation if they lose Brian Flores to a head coaching job since his contract actually expired?

If so, what is that compensation and what year? Sure hope to keep him as our coordinator.

— Rick in Blaine, Minnesota

I'm not exactly sure how the determination would have fallen on the awarding of any comp picks since Flores' contract had expired.

Now that Flores has signed a new deal, if he was hired by a team to be its head coach, then Minnesota would be awarded a third-round compensatory pick this year and another in the 2027 NFL Draft.

Let's keep this season in perspective! Most independent analysts predicted the Vikings to go 9-8. If the Vikings had a reasonable number of injuries, and ""even Steven"" luck, I think we would have hit that mark easily. No one should really expect to win the Super Bowl with essentially a rookie quarterback. It is a two-year project!

— Joe in Phoenix, Arizona

The six quarterbacks selected in the first round in 2024 — Caleb Williams (No. 1 overall), Jayden Daniels (No. 2), Drake Maye (No. 3), Michael Penix, Jr. (No. 8), J.J. McCarthy (No. 10) and Bo Nix (No. 12) — will forever be intertwined.

The teams of Maye and Nix advanced to the AFC Championship, but Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the Divisional Round. Maye now has a chance at winning Super Bowl LX. Daniels and the Commanders made it to the NFC Championship Game in his rookie season before hobbling through a rough 2025. Williams and the Bears made it to the Divisional Round but were outlasted by the Rams.

That leaves Penix and McCarthy as the only two so far who are waiting for their first postseason action, but McCarthy is the only one in the bunch who has had only one season as a starter.

He turned 23 last Tuesday. Williams turned 24 in November, Daniels turned 25 in December, Maye will be 24 in August, Penix will be 26 in May, and Nix will be 26 in February.

While all are through the second year of their rookie deals, there's more of a runway for McCarthy's development, which can be among factors in draft decisions.

Minnesota winning 14 games in 2024 with Sam Darnold on a one-year deal guided the conversations about the Vikings to being a team in ""win now"" mode. Instead of using the franchise tag on Darnold for an extra year of his services or trying to counter the substantial (and dividend-yielding) deal offered by Super Bowl-bound Seattle, the Vikings pivoted to McCarthy and tried to implement what they thought would best fit around a QB who was learning in real time with every rep. McCarthy going into this full NFL offseason healthy should be quite helpful for his development.

The Vikings do readily admit room for team improvements so that results are above the 9-8 record thanks to an encouraging finish.

Kwesi and Kevin,

Can you please sign Aaron Rodgers so we can get to the playoffs and possibly the Super Bowl? We now know for sure McCarthy isn't ready yet and couldn't have a better mentor for a season than a three-time MVP and Super Bowl Winner! Get our o-line right, and Rodgers will take us to new heights I and thousands of other fans haven't felt since we had Brett Favre!

— Dan Staton in Cedar Rapids, Iowa

Favre turned 40 during the 2009 season that nearly ended with the ultimate dream for Vikings fans. Rodgers turned 42 in December, and while he and the Steelers topped Minnesota in Dublin, Pittsburgh finished with a 10-7 showing that won the AFC North before losing in the first round of the playoffs.

I'm not sure if Rodgers will decide this was the end of the train tracks or if he'll want another chance with Pittsburgh (and a reunion with Mike McCarthy) or to go to another team. I did think he looked more in 2025 like what we've come to expect from Rodgers than he did in 2024 when he was in his first season back from the Achilles injury.

I didn't realize this, but Rodgers' most recent playoff victory was Jan. 16, 2021.

I mentioned in my previous response that I think McCarthy stands to benefit significantly from a full, healthy offseason, as well as the in-game experiences he had during his first 10 career starts.

Dan's comments about getting the o-line ""right"" are valid because I think any QB would have struggled for a team using 26 different combinations of offensive linemen. Experience perhaps could have masked some weaknesses, but the Steelers offensive line showed to be no match for Houston's defensive line in the Wild Card, and it affected a first-ballot Hall of Fame QB.

As a fan for over 50 years, I'm starting to wonder if I will ever see that first Super Bowl win. I believe in K.O. as the head coach, but I think Kwesi's drafts have been awful!! If you look at the roster, how many of the starters and key players were drafted by Rick Spielman? He had misses, too, but look at the roster and see how many core players were drafted more than four years ago under a different system vs. the past four. I hope he figures it out soon, as I just watched Bo Nix take his team to the AFC Championship, and he was drafted after J.J. And we all know about the safety he passed on that is an All-Pro with Baltimore, and Kwesi drafted one that's out of the league.

— Dave in Rapid City, South Dakota

Everyone has hits and misses in drafting. It's then about how much the hits can offset the misses or how quickly a miss can be stop-gapped.

There are some residual players selected with drafts led by Spielman that have continued to be important foundational players. Adofo-Mensah's first draft class (2022) included 10 selections with five on offense and five on defense, and the results were not what anyone envisioned.

Only running back Ty Chandler and receiver Jalen Nailor remained with the team in 2025. Chandler's fourth season was impacted adversely by a knee injury suffered in Week 1. Nailor had some nice games and a couple of down moments but showed a general growth every season where he could become a free agent sought by multiple other teams this offseason.

Switching defensive coordinators and schemes one year after the first draft was one factor, but there were others in play, including the severe leg injury Lewis Cine suffered a few games into his career. Another impact affecting playing time for more recent draft picks has been Minnesota's success in free agency.

We've seen some of Spielman's later-round picks develop (Joshua Metellus and Blake Brandel come to mind) and be re-signed by the current administration. We've also seen the current administration mine the undrafted free agent market for a difference maker like Myles Price.

Nix definitely made some plays, particularly key ones near the end of the Divisional Round game against Buffalo, but it is worth noting the Broncos ranked No. 3 in points against and No. 2 in yards allowed this season. Yes, I do know that Minnesota finished No. 7 and No. 3 in those categories.

Ideally the expected general continuity of coaching staff with Flores in line to stay, will position Minnesota's defense to start 2026 the way it closed 2025 (even if some personnel changes occur), and the offense can take the necessary steps forward to be a more complete team in position of making a deep postseason run.

Seattle went 10-7 in 2024, losing a tiebreaker to the Rams for the NFC West and missing the playoffs by one spot. The moves the Seahawks made this offseason elevated that team to the No. 1 seed and sent the squad to the franchise's fourth Super Bowl appearance.

Vikings offensive line coach Chris Kuper was let go. Twenty-plus different personnel combinations. An 11-percent sack rate. How much of this was Kuper's fault and how much was bad luck with injuries? Whoever they hire to be the new line coach better have a plan on how to keep the offensive line healthy. There was a great letter in last week's mailbag about how long it took QBs like Troy Aikman, Peyton Manning, John Elway, Drew Brees and Steve Young to find their footing and establish themselves. Patience is key. Will Carson Wentz be healthy enough to serve as the veteran presence in the QB room?

— Gerald Goblirsch

There's always a human element involved with every coaching change that gets disregarded far too often. Families are involved, and I wish the best for people in their next chapter. Kuper's contract expired, and he was not offered another one.

The sacks per pass attempt checked in at 12.4 percent, which ranked 31st in the NFL. Some sacks were on McCarthy waiting with the football too long while reading the defense, some were on deep-developing plays and others occurred too fast within a play.

Minnesota's effort to remake the interior of its offensive line did not come to full fruition because of injuries to Ryan Kelly and then backup Michael Jurgens, which led to Brandel playing the center position for the first time, but there was some encouraging play by first-round pick Donovan Jackson, and the Vikings believe Will Fries will continue ascending after having shaken off the rust from the broken leg he suffered in 2024 with the Colts.

We will keep you posted on Minnesota's plans for the offensive line.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/f0h6gubpyobbjnjoaaj6,N,,2026-01-26 12:03:43.511309

Sports Info Solutions tallied each team's total games missed due to injury. Then they went a step further and estimated the number of points lost based on which players were out and how much time they missed. This helps take into account the impact of a player's time missed. For example, rookie reserve linebacker Nick Martin missing four games to injury would be less impactful on the scoreboard than Christian McCaffrey missing one game due to injury.

It turns out that the 49ers neither had the most games lost nor the most points lost to injury, but they did lead all playoff teams in the second category.

SIS had San Francisco's roster down for 262 total games missed to injury − the seventh-highest total in the league and the fourth-most among teams that reached the postseason.

What hurt the 49ers most this season, however, wasn't their total number of games missed. It was the quality of the players who were sent to the sidelines. That includes wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, tight end George Kittle, quarterback Brock Purdy, linebacker Fred Warner and defensive end Nick Bosa who all missed either a significant portion of or the entire 2025 campaign.

Because of the quality of players San Francisco saw injuries to, their total points lost landed at 200 per SIS. That was the third-highest mark in the NFL behind the Arizona Cardinals (266 points) and the Washington Commanders (230). The 49ers lost the most points to injury among playoff teams, just ahead of the Buffalo Bills who lost 190 points.

That duo was well clear of the next playoff team, the Los Angeles Chargers. They were 12th overall and third among playoff teams at 148 points lost − seven touchdowns (with extra points) and a field goal fewer than the 49ers.

San Francisco did manage to get some key players back on offense by the end of the year, as evidenced by their 35.7 points from Weeks 11-17. The defensive side is where injuries were a major problem. The 49ers' pass rush was non-existent and their ability to stay organized and effective against the run and pass in the second level went away without Warner manning the middle of their front seven.

There are a slew of holes the 49ers have to fill on their roster this offseason, but their path back to a Super Bowl starts with their stars staying healthy.","https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/25/SNIN/88351377007-usatsi-27232285.jpg?crop=8231,4630,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-26 10:00:13.973860

What Giannis' injury means in Milwaukee - CBS Sports,Jack Maloney,,,,,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/giannis-antetokounmpos-injury-bucks-blessing-in-disguise/,"What does that mean for him and the Bucks, and could this injury actually be a blessing in disguise?
Antetokounmpo's injury throws a major wrench into the deadline plans for the Bucks and every other team that was waiting for a resolution on his status.
However, this calf injury will likely keep him from playing in the mid-season showcase for the second consecutive year.
He also sat out last year due to a calf injury.
This is the fourth time in the last three seasons that Antetokounmpo has suffered a calf injury.","MILWAUKEE -- Shortly after the Milwaukee Bucks suffered yet another loss on Friday night, this one by two points after a furious comeback attempt against the Denver Nuggets' back-ups fell short, Giannis Antetokounmpo sat at his locker and let out a yell. He then clapped his hands loudly in frustration, put on his socks and turned to face the media.

He had bad news to deliver about his right calf, which had been limiting him all night and kept him out of the final 34 seconds.

""The next steps will be go to MRI tomorrow, after the MRI they will tell me probably I popped something in my calf, or my soleus, something. They'll probably give me a protocol of 4-6 weeks that I'll be out. This is from my experience being around in the NBA,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""After that, I'm going to work my butt off to come back. That will probably be the end of February, beginning of March. Hopefully the team will be in a place that we can at least make the Play-In or the playoffs. Just take it day-by-day, try to get better.""

The Bucks have not announced an official timeline for Antetokounmpo's injury, but he missed over three weeks earlier this season with a calf strain on the same leg, and indicated that this injury felt the same to him. He is likely heading back to the sidelines for an extended period, and could be out through the trade deadline (Feb. 5) and All-Star Weekend (Feb. 13-15), and possibly longer.

What does that mean for him and the Bucks, and could this injury actually be a blessing in disguise?

Time to tank?

The Bucks got off to a 4-1 start that included wins over the Toronto Raptors, Golden State Warriors and New York Knicks. It seemed as though their audacious offseason plan to waive-and-stretch Damian Lillard, sign Myles Turner and surround Antetokounmpo with shooting could pay off.

Since then, however, they've been one of the worst teams in the league, in part due to a parade of injuries. Friday's loss to the Nuggets was their sixth in the last eight games, and they're now a season-worst eight games below .500. At 18-26, they are in 11th place in the Eastern Conference, 2 ½ games behind the Atlanta Hawks for the final Play-In Tournament spot.

The Bucks are closer to the Brooklyn Nets for the fifth-worst record in the league than they are to the Philadelphia 76ers for a top-six spot in the East. For the season, the Bucks are 3-11 with Antetokounmpo out of the lineup. At that pace, they have little hope of still being in the Play-In race if he's out until after the All-Star break.

While the Bucks do not control their own first-round pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, they will have a first-round pick. They will receive the least favorable of their pick and the New Orleans Pelicans' first-round pick. The 11-36 Pelicans have the second-worst record in the league and are well on their way to a top-five selection. If both teams are bad, that guarantees the Bucks a good pick.

It's impossible for the Bucks to get the No. 1 overall pick, but they could pick as high as No. 2 if they continue to fall down the standings and get some lottery luck. A top-five selection in what is regarded as a generational draft class is well within the realm of possibility, depending on when/if Antetokounmpo returns. The Bucks haven't drafted higher than No. 10 since Antetokounmpo came to town, and this could be a rare chance to get an elite talent while he is still on the roster.

Giannis Antetokounmpo shouldn't play another game for the Bucks this season, and probably not ever again

Sam Quinn

What about the trade deadline?

Earlier this month, Antetokounmpo told Sam Amick of The Athletic that he would never request a trade. However, after the Bucks' narrow win over the Hawks on Monday, Antetokounmpo was asked if he would finish the season in Milwaukee and responded, ""I don't know. I take it day-by-day.""

Following the Bucks' loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, Antetokounmpo called out his teammates for being ""selfish"" and ""not playing hard."" Shams Charania then reported Friday that discussions between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo about his future had ""intensified in nature"" and that the ""tension"" inside the organization and locker room was at an ""all-time high.""

Over the last month, however, there were numerous reports that the Bucks had actually been looking to buy at the deadline to increase their chances of making the playoffs in a weaker-than-usual Eastern Conference.

About the only thing that had been clear about Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee was that the entire league was watching.

""Giannis is the trade deadline,"" Brian Windhorst said earlier this week. ""There is really not a lot of other players out there that can move the needle. There is very small to no market for Ja Morant or Anthony Davis. The entire league is watching Giannis.""

Antetokounmpo's injury throws a major wrench into the deadline plans for the Bucks and every other team that was waiting for a resolution on his status.

The Bucks should no longer be buyers at the deadline or entertain any deals in which they give up future assets such as Ryan Rollins or their 2031 first-round pick. It's unclear how Antetokounmpo's injury will impact other teams' pursuit of the two-time MVP, but it likely increases the odds that he remains with the Bucks for the rest of the season.

Antetokounmpo likely out of the All-Star Game (again) and award consideration

Antetokounmpo was recently named as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 10th consecutive season, which is the longest active streak in the league. However, this calf injury will likely keep him from playing in the mid-season showcase for the second consecutive year. He also sat out last year due to a calf injury.

In addition, this injury will end Antetokounmpo's chances of award consideration. The 65-game threshold for major awards means that players cannot miss more than 17 games in a season. Antetokounmpo has already missed 14 games, and even if he comes back earlier than expected, he's going to miss four more games.

Antetokounmpo has been named to the All-NBA First Team and finished in the top-four in MVP voting in each of the last seven seasons. Those streaks will come to an end.

""It's hard, but always in my mind I think of the good things that have happened in my life, and I think of where I am in this moment, and what my goals are, and what stops me from these goals, which might be this injury, and the first thing that you have to think about is that it can be way worse,"" Antetokounmpo said Friday. ""You can be out for 12 months, 18 months. Being out for two, three, four, five, six weeks, whatever the case may be and not making the All-NBA, for sure it's gonna hurt. For sure it will be a little bit frustrating, but it doesn't matter. That's not where we are right now mentally as a team, as a player. All-NBA it's in June, I'm in January.""

Can the Bucks turn this into a positive?

This is the fourth time in the last three seasons that Antetokounmpo has suffered a calf injury.

In addition to the right calf strain that kept him out for three weeks earlier this season, he missed over two weeks (and sat out of the All-Star Game) last season due to a left calf strain. A left calf strain also kept him out of the final week of the regular season and the playoffs in 2024.

""I don't think it looks great, personally,"" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Friday. ""This calf keeps coming up and it's concerning. I'm not a doctor, but I'm smart enough to know that his calf keeps bothering him and there's something that is there and it keeps happening, and that's troublesome for all of us.""

No one in Milwaukee wanted to see Antetokounmpo injured yet again, but there's a chance for the Bucks to turn this into a long-term positive.

This team is not going anywhere this season. Since their 4-1 start, they have three wins against teams in the top-six in either conference, and overall they are 24th in offensive rating, 21st in defensive rating and 24th in net rating (-3.4). Even in a world where they made some moves at the deadline and fought their way into the Play-In, they were not going to be a contender.

Now, there's a very good chance they end up with a top-10 pick, and possibly even higher than that -- especially if Antetokounmpo's injury keeps him out for more than a month (at which point there's little reason for him to return at all this season). Whatever happens with Antetokounmpo down the line, that's much better for their future than a futile Play-In chase.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/25/1fd314b9-602a-4003-b47f-0aaa03c6f3c8/thumbnail/1200x675/92e73abecf634a58f440295e69a0c01c/giannis-getty-33.png,N,,2026-01-26 10:00:21.735407

Bryant, Denver’s third-round pick out of Illinois last April, has now been injured in three of his last four games.","Bo Nix, of course, could’ve watched from the grass Sunday with the rest of his teammates. But that would’ve brought cameras. And shifted too many eyeballs towards him than he was comfortable with.

So the Broncos’ injured second-year QB watched the AFC Championship Game from a suite at Empower Field, wanting to not draw attention to himself. And beyond a few shots on the CBS broadcast, the camera was instead trained on Nix’s replacement: 29-year-old backup Jarrett Stidham, a West Texas boy who rolled in for the first start of his Denver career in a cowboy hat.

Come spring 2026, though, Nix will be back in a Broncos uniform and shoulder pads. A source confirmed to The Denver Post that Nix’s season-ending ankle surgery this past week will have a roughly 12-week timetable for recovery, and that doctors have pinpointed that Nix should be able to return to action by the Broncos’ organized team activities in late May.

ESPN’s Adam Schefter first reported that Nix had a 12-week timetable to return.

After the fractured ankle that shocked the entire city of Denver in a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills on Saturday, Jan. 17, Nix flew to Birmingham, Alabama, for a Tuesday ankle surgery performed by Dr. Norman Waldrop of Andrews Sports Medicine. Broncos head coach Sean Payton said this week that the operation went well, and that he’d like Nix around the organization again as soon as he was able to be.

“Absolutely — all of our guys that have been injured are part of this team, and so, sooner the better,” Payton said Wednesday.

Nix offered his first public comments since the surgery on Thursday, with a lengthy caption on an Instagram post that said the last few days had been “hard to put into words.”

“What started as one of the most exciting games I’ve ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I’ve ever received,” Nix wrote. “This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it.”

If Nix’s timeline goes according to plan, the Broncos’ starting quarterback will have ramped up well before the start of training camp in 2026.

Nix finished his second season in Denver with 3,931 passing yards and 30 total touchdowns against 11 interceptions, leading the NFL in passing attempts with 612. He shouldered much of the Broncos’ offense in the wild-card win over Buffalo, either dropping back or running the ball on 85% of Denver’s total attempts from scrimmage.

Pat Bryant exits with a hamstring injury

Pat Bryant’s recent stretch of tough injury luck continues.

The Broncos rookie wideout left the AFC Championship Game in the first half due to a hamstring injury and was later ruled out. Bryant, Denver’s third-round pick out of Illinois last April, has now been injured in three of his last four games.

The 23-year-old suffered a scary-looking concussion in Week 16 against Jacksonville, when he was carted off the field and taken to the hospital for further evaluation. Then, Bryant left last week’s divisional win over Buffalo in the first quarter with another concussion.

Bryant had three catches for 32 yards in that game, and finished the regular season with 31 catches for 378 yards and one TD in 15 games. Prior to his injury against Jacksonville, his role in the Denver offense had been increasing, including a career-high 82 yards receiving in the 22-19 home win over Kansas City on Nov. 16.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26017763553070.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2026-01-25 23:58:32.522231

The Seahawks will face the New England Patriots on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara for the NFL title.

Sam Darnold passed for 346 yards and three touchdowns for the Seahawks in a showdown with Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, who passed for 374 yards and three touchdowns.

Share your thoughts on today’s game: live@theathletic.com

Sam Darnold continues to play without limitations despite dealing with an oblique injury suffered on Jan. 15. Darnold made every throw he typically makes in the divisional-round win over the 49ers and he’s again operating normally against the Rams. He’s 7-of-9 for 114 yards through one quarter and has already made multiple throws rolling to his left.

The Rams pass rush has yet to get to Sam Darnold on nine first-quarter drop-backs, but Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak has had a good plan to negate it with runs to Kenneth Walker III, screen passes and play-action roll-outs.

Los Angeles has had Darnold's number with pressure over the past year-plus, and it's going to need to find ways to rev that engine today, which will have to start by stopping the run better. Walker averaged 4.4 yards on eight carries in that first quarter, after which Seattle leads 10-3.

That one-handed catch from Jaxon Smith-Njigba? That certainly caught the attention of several of our readers.

Below are some of your thoughts on that epic one-handed grab:

Christopher L.: That one handed catch from JSN changed my life!

David H.: JSN with the one-hander 🤣. He didn’t even tuck it in but held it in his open hand.

Paul C.: Holy cow—what a catch!

The home crowd wanted a call but I think it's good here at the start of this one — after the controversy last time around — that the officials are letting these guys play.

Q1 0:55 - Seahawks 10, Rams 3

A holding penalty backs the Seahawks up to second-and-goal from the 19... and then Kenneth Walker III gets those 10 yards back on a screen. But Sam Darnold can’t link up with A.J. Barner in the end zone. No flag despite contact on both sides there. Jason Myers hits the 27-yard chip shot and the Seahawks are back up by 7.

Klint Kubiak is already borrowing a little of what Chicago did well in the run game against the Rams defense last week. In simple terms, it's ""run around Poona Ford"" - wide stretch runs that are asking the linebackers to travel horizontally. When the Rams adjusted and stretched their front, Ken Walker just hit them up the gut on back to back 8-yard runs.

Q1 8:15 - Seahawks 7, Rams 3

Sean McVay immediately tries to push the ball downfield further, but Matthew Stafford’s passes to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams fall incomplete. Stafford then can’t link up with Nacua short of the sticks.

Harrison Mevis gets L.A. on the board with a 44-yard field goal.

Rashid Shaheed was acquired at the trade deadline. Last week, the Seahawks receiver began the team's postseason with a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.

Today, he jolts the Seahawks' offense with a 51-yard reception.

Yeah, that trade was worth it for Seattle.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/A5ycpWGkjLfg_eYcx07utSTX6_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-25 23:58:43.950712

PLAYERS PLACED ON INJURED RESERVE THIS PAST WEEK:Bo Nix, QB, Broncos (ankle); Zach Charbonnet, RB, Seahawks (knee)

We're down to the NFL's version of the Final Four, and we're blessed with an exceedingly light injury report in terms of potential short-term absences. Naturally, the divisional-round postseason-ending injuries to Bo Nix and Zach Charbonnet listed above will loom large, but otherwise, the four teams will be going into battle with relatively healthy rosters. Without further ado, let's look at the latest as of Sunday morning:

RUNNING BACKS

The Seahawks' George Holani (hamstring) was activated from injured reserve Friday and doesn't carry an injury designation for Sunday's conference championship clash against the Rams. Holani could be in line to serve as the No. 2 running back for Seattle behind Kenneth Walker, considering Zach Charbonnet's (IR, knee) status. However, both Velus Jones and Cam Akers were promoted from the practice squad Saturday, and the duo does have more experience than Holani.

WIDE RECEIVERS

The Broncos' Troy Franklin (hamstring) is questionable for Sunday's conference championship clash against the Patriots after practicing in limited fashion all week. If Franklin is unable to suit up, more opportunity will be available for rookie Pat Bryant and veteran Lil'Jordan Humphrey behind No. 1 receiver Courtland

If Franklin is unable to suit up, more opportunity will be available for rookie Pat Bryant and veteran Lil'Jordan Humphrey behind No. 1 receiver Courtland Sutton as they work with fill-in signal-caller Jarrett Stidham.

The Patriots' Mack Hollins (abdomen) was activated from injured reserve Saturday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's conference championship game against the Broncos after finishing the week with a full practice Friday following a limited Thursday session. As per Saturday night reports, Hollins is expected to play and will likely fill a downfield role that will potentially take targets away from both DeMario Douglas and Kyle Williams.

The Patriots' Harold Landry (knee) is out for Sunday's conference championship game against the Broncos.
