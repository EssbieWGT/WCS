Running back AJ joined the Philadelphia Eagles after spending his first five seasons in the NFL with the Green Bay Packers, the team that drafted him.

But one of the things that didn't change: Gabrielle, AJ's wife, rooting for her other half.

Gabrielle, a lifestyle blogger and content creator, posted a heartfelt end-of-season tribute to her husband on Instagram Jan. 13.

Two days prior, the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles – who clinched back-to-back NFC East titles – were eliminated in the wild-card round in a shocking loss to the San Francisco 49ers.

""Season 6 ✅ Always a little bittersweet when it doesn’t end the way you hope, but this year in Philly was still so special. So many memories, incredible people, and moments we’ll always be grateful for,"" Gabrielle wrote in her post.

After AJ missed the entire 2024 season with the Pack because of a neck injury, he signed as a free agent with the Eagles in March on a one-year deal.

The Eagles' first preseason game of 2025 marked the first NFL game Dillon played in since coming back from his injury. Quadzilla took the field in his first regular-season game since New Year's Eve 2023 in the league's 2025 season opener.

He would end up playing in seven regular-season games, rushing for 60 yards on 12 carries and catching three passes for 21 yards. He was inactive for the Eagles' playoff game.

""Forever proud of you, @ajdillon2 your drive, composure, and resilience never go unnoticed 🫶"" Gabrielle continued in her post.

Head coach Arne Slot has already spent most of the season without summer signing Giovanni Leoni, who arrived at the end of August and suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in September’s Carabao Cup tie with Southampton.

Eight senior defensive options became seven, and now it has dropped to six — right-back Jeremie Frimpong, centre-backs Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez and left-backs Milos Kerkez and Andrew Robertson.

It is a precarious predicament, and while all indications were that they are set for a quiet January window, this latest injury setback should change that.

Earlier this season, adding defensive reinforcements seemed necessary due to Konate’s poor form, but the France international has looked more secure in recent weeks. Instead, additions are required because they are one more injury away from being in serious trouble.

Kerkez was the only fit senior defender who did not feature in the 4-1 FA Cup third-round victory over Barnsley and although Slot said before the game he would play a strong team, Van Dijk playing another 90 minutes felt unnecessary.

In recent weeks, right-back Calvin Ramsay and centre-back Wellity Lucky have been regulars on the bench due to Liverpool’s lack of squad depth. A tie against Barnsley, who lie 16th in the third-tier League One, offered an opportunity for Slot to give them first-team game time, but he didn’t. Ramsay, 22, was an unused substitute and Lucky, 20, did not make the matchday squad. Unless there is an extreme injury crisis, Slot is clearly reluctant to use them.

Liverpool have already been treading a fine line. Gomez, whose unfortunate injury history is well known, has been the only cover for centre-backs Van Dijk and Konate — and now the 28-year-old will also have to be the primary backup option at right-back for the remainder of the season.

Despite limited game time, Gomez has still needed to manage a knee injury this season. Frimpong, who has been playing right wing in recent weeks due to attacking shortages, has missed more than a dozen Liverpool games due to hamstring injuries. Konate’s chequered injury past — even if he has largely been reliable since Slot’s arrival — cannot be ignored either.

“Jeremie Frimpong has to play a lot of minutes, also comes back from an injury, has missed out on three or four months of a lot of playing time,” Slot told reporters in his post-Barnsley press conference.

“I liked him again today, by the way, but I have to make sure he can play again at the weekend and then we go to Marseille and to Bournemouth. It is nine games in January with six defenders available. I have to manage it in the right way.”

That sounds like a head coach who will have to find solutions internally.

Whenever Slot has been asked about his limited options at centre-back, for example, he has frequently referenced midfielders Ryan Gravenberch and Wataru Endo as possibilities. He has also shifted Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones from midfield to right-back.

Experimenting with Szoboszlai at right-back was forced on Slot in the opening weeks of the campaign because of injuries to Bradley and Frimpong. Wins were secured against Newcastle United, Arsenal and Burnley but its effectiveness has diminished.

Bradley and Frimpong were missing for the successive home defeats to Nottingham Forest, when Szoboszlai started at right-back, and PSV, when Jones lined up there. Opponents have begun targeting the defensive deficiencies of a midfielder playing out of position. Liverpool have looked more balanced with a natural right-back.

Liverpool’s ongoing 11-game unbeaten run has seen them start a defender at right-back in each game. Slot has also used more midfielders in his starting XI. That may change with Hugo Ekitike back fit and when Mohamed Salah returns from the Africa Cup of Nations, but needing to use a midfielder at right-back weakens the depth of another area of the squad while papering over the cracks of another.

Slot has made it very clear in recent press conferences that there is still plenty for his side to achieve this season. His strong line-up against Barnsley was an indication of his thoughts on an FA Cup run. Performances against Inter Milan and Real Madrid suggest a deep run in the Champions League is not improbable, but qualification for next season’s edition is a must.

Not accelerating summer plans — which Liverpool have done in the past — or making any move risks putting those aspirations in jeopardy.

Signing a right-back on loan, for instance, would be a sensible short-term solution, but whether players considered good enough are available is a different question. It would be more likely that Liverpool think long-term and buy a player who will help in the present and the future.

Their squad size — ironically, given the lack of options Slot has had available to him for recent games — does present an issue. They only have homegrown spaces available to register any new signings, which is one of the reasons Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi continues to make perfect sense.

A £35million ($47m) deal was all but finalised at the end of the transfer window until Palace pulled the plug. There is no guarantee Guehi leaves this month, as he will be a free agent and have his pick of clubs in the summer, but Manchester City are pushing to sign him.

If Liverpool made a signing that was neither under-21 nor homegrown, it would require them to unregister one of their 17 non-homegrown players.

In the Premier League squad, the most logical move would be Ramsay — adding a defender would move him back down the pecking order. Outside of him, it would mean sacrificing another lesser-used squad player, such as Federico Chiesa or Endo — although neither feels like a realistic possibility.

In the Champions League, even if the player was under-21, they would have to be registered. That would be a tougher decision — Ramsay was not originally included and Leoni, who also could not be classed as an under-21 player because he has not been at the club for over two years, has already been replaced by Chiesa.

Chiesa was the surprise omission from the initial squad, with Rio Ngumoha chosen ahead of him. The former has played 61 minutes across three appearances in the Champions League, while the latter clocked up 16 minutes in his only appearance on matchday one against Atletico Madrid. A tough decision may have to be made.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/13053035/GettyImages-2255958038-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-14 07:00:44.475637

Linebacker Dre Greenlaw, who was one of the Broncos' biggest free agency acquisitions this past offseason, returned to the practice field and is on track to play in the divisional round game at Empower Field at Mile High.

Greenlaw, who missed eight games this season because of injuries and one because of a suspension, had missed the last two games of the regular season with a hamstring injury.

Greenlaw left the Broncos' Dec. 21 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars when he pulled up trying to chase down Travis Etienne Jr. with just over two minutes left in the game. He had missed six other games earlier this season with a thigh injury.

""It's good to have a healthy Dre Greenlaw back in the game,'' Broncos coach Sean Payton said after Tuesday's practice, the Broncos' first on-field work of the week.

Given the Bills led the league in rushing this season with 159.6 yards per game, it is a welcome return even for a Broncos defense that has been one of the league's best this season. Especially since it was also the Bills who unceremoniously shoved the Broncos out of the playoffs this past January with 210 yards rushing in the 31-7 wild-card win with 79 of those rushing yards coming in the first quarter alone.

James Cook III, who led the league in rushing this season with 1,621 rushing yards with a 5.25 yards per carry average that was second best in the NFL, finished Buffalo's playoff win this past January with 120 yards on his 23 carries.

""Obviously they whupped our butt last year,'' Broncos outside linebacker Nik Bonitto said.

""There were a lot of things we felt coming away from a game like that [such as], 'we're not there yet [and] we need to improve,''' Payton said. ""It's the runner, it's the scheme. ... We'll have to be ready.''

The Broncos signed Greenlaw to a three-year, $31.5 million contract last March with the hope he would add some physicality to a defense that had some difficulty limiting opponents' explosive runs in the 2024 season. But he missed the offseason program with thigh injuries as well as the Broncos' first six games of the season.

He was also suspended for a game -- the Broncos' Oct. 26 win over the Dallas Cowboys -- because of a postgame confrontation with referee Brad Allen after the Broncos' win over the New York Giants. At the time, the NFL said Greenlaw ""chased after referee Brad Allen and verbally threatened him as he tried to leave the field.''

The Broncos finished No. 2 in run defense overall this season -- 91.1 rushing yards allowed per game -- and had the highest rate of run stops at, or behind, the line of scrimmage this season at 30.3%.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0114%2Fr1600311_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 04:02:19.256899

The Broncos return to practice Tuesday in preparation for their AFC Divisional round playoff game against the Buffalo Bills.

The anticipation is inside linebacker Dre Greenlaw will be out there among ‘em. Still, it would be wise if Justin Strnad keeps his chin strip buckled tight.

Starting with the final week of April, Greenlaw missed six months with a nagging quad injury, returned to play in eight games, then suffered a hamstring injury late in the Broncos’ 11-game-winning streak-snapping loss to Jacksonville on December 21 and missed the final two regular-season games.

The “soft-tissue” injury, as they’re called, has so plagued Greenlaw it wouldn’t be a surprise if he again returns on a limited snap count this week against the Bills. When Greenlaw returned from his quad injury in late-October, he played 21 and 27 snaps in his first two games back while his backup Strnad played 41 and 57 snaps.

The Broncos should also return defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers to practice Tuesday. Franklin-Myers had been recently bothered by a strained hip that caused him to sit out the previous 1 ½ games.

Meanwhile, the Broncos were hoping center Luke Wattenberg could return for next week’s AFC Championship Game providing all goes well Saturday afternoon against the Bills at Empower Field at Mile High.

Then there’s the longer-term injuries to safety Brandon Jones and running back J.K. Dobbins. Jones did have surgery to repair a torn pec muscle, sources tell 9NEWS, with the team keeping open the possibility the safety could return by Super Bowl 60, again if the Broncos make it that far. Dobbins had surgery to repair a Lisfranc injury suffered Nov. 6 in a 10-7 win against the Raiders. Head coach Sean Payton has said he hopes Dobbins returns ""soon.""

Keep in mind, the usual recovery time for those respective injuries – torn pec and Lisfranc -- extends beyond the February 8 Super Bowl date. Jones’ pec injury occurred near the end of the first half of the Broncos’ win against Green Bay on December 14. The Super Bowl would be just seven weeks from his injury.

Asked Tuesday if he thought Jones would make it back, Broncos head coach Sean Payton paused to think about it, thn said, ""I don't think so."" He thought some more and repeated, ""I don't think so.""

Still, Jones obviously hasn't given up. He was working out on the side rehab field during the early portion of practice Tuesday. And again, the Broncos did keep his return window open for longshot chance at Super Bowl.

Dobbins’ Lisfranc issue would be three months from the Super Bowl. Former Broncos All Pro left tackle Ryan Clady suffered a Lisfranc injury in week 2 of the 2013 season and was unable to return in time for Super Bowl 48.

Then again, there may be no better medicine than motivation. Neither Jones or Dobbins, who were 2020 draft class mates – Jones in the third round by Miami and Dobbins in the second round by Baltimore - have played in a Super Bowl as their sixth NFL season winds down.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/e1e56de9-0db2-42ec-bafb-edba8fcaa88a/20260113T192454/e1e56de9-0db2-42ec-bafb-edba8fcaa88a_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 04:02:23.854249

The 2026 Games are scheduled to begin in less than a month, giving Kim a short window to recover and pursue her third consecutive gold medal in the halfpipe. Kim won gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang and again in 2022 in Beijing.

In an update posted to Instagram Tuesday, Kim said she wasn’t surprised to learn she had torn her labrum, the lining of the socket that holds the shoulder together. She did not specify which shoulder was injured when she fell while preparing for the upcoming Laax Open.

""There are two ways to do it, and the way I did it is less severe than the other, so I’m really happy about that,"" she said. ""Obviously, I’m really disappointed that I can’t snowboard until right before the Olympics, which is going to be hard. I haven’t gotten nearly the amount of reps that I would have liked, but that’s OK.""

LINDSEY VONN, 41, CONTINUES REMARKABLE COMEBACK WITH WORLD CUP DOWNHILL WIN AHEAD OF OLYMPICS

The women’s Olympic halfpipe contest begins Feb. 11.

The 25-year-old Kim, who has already qualified for the U.S. team, would be the heavy favorite to win in Italy if she’s healthy. She said she won’t compete this weekend in Laax. She didn’t mention the Winter X Games in Aspen later this month, which are the last big contest before the Olympics.

Kim has participated in only one competition this season — last month in Copper Mountain — and while warming up for the final there, she sustained a shoulder injury.

Last week, she posted video of her fall in Switzerland, which showed her skittering across the halfpipe after losing her bearings on the landing of a jump. At that time, she said she dislocated the shoulder and wasn’t in much pain. An MRI from last Friday revealed the labrum tear.

In her video, Kim said she’ll have to wear a ""super-sexy shoulder brace"" that is uncomfortable.

""I went through a bunch of different waves of emotions, but, honestly, I’m really excited for this week,"" she said.

Prior to that game, Cooper told Tampa play-by-play broadcaster Dave Randorf that they avoid the “worst-case scenario” on Point.
“But he is week to week.” Any absence longer than three weeks would jeopardize Point’s availability for the Olympics.
Maybe an injury replacement offers Team Canada a chance for a do-over there and they can rethink roles in other ways.
One way or another, if Point needs replacing, it’s another difficult decision coming for Team Canada and one that won’t please everyone.","Jon Cooper called it “the elephant in the room.”

The Tampa Bay Lightning coach had just watched one of his NHL team’s best forwards, Brayden Point, have to be helped off the ice Monday in Philadelphia, unable to put any weight on his right leg. And, as Team Canada’s coach, Cooper had also watched one of his Olympic team’s more trusted players injured with the start of the Milan Cortina Olympics just around the corner.

“I mean, there’s a big tournament coming up in a month, and he’s a big part of us,” Cooper said. “Let’s just hope everything turns out all right.”

The early indications aren’t encouraging. The Lightning haven’t placed any firm timelines or revealed the nature of the injury to Point’s right knee, but a league source said Tuesday that it’s “not good.”

The injury occurred moments after Point scored a power-play goal for the Lightning. As he stretched out to knock home a rebound, Flyers defenseman Cam York fell awkwardly on his right leg. Point immediately threw off his gloves and grabbed for the knee. Teammate Nikita Kucherov and Lightning head athletic trainer Tom Mulligan then slowly helped him off the ice.

Point traveled with the Lightning to Pittsburgh, where they’re set to face the Penguins on a back-to-back Tuesday. Prior to that game, Cooper told Tampa play-by-play broadcaster Dave Randorf that they avoid the “worst-case scenario” on Point.

“His season is not over,” said Cooper. “But he is week to week.”

Any absence longer than three weeks would jeopardize Point’s availability for the Olympics. NHL players are due to charter to Milan on Feb. 7, and Olympic teams have until the Feb. 11 start of the tournament to make injury replacements. Beyond that date, they are limited to the 25 players on their official roster.

Point was one of six players named to the initial Canadian roster in June. A two-time Stanley Cup winner and former 50-goal scorer, his versatility was on display while helping Canada win the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. Point played both center and right wing at that event, including seeing time beside Connor McDavid during the championship game.

He had a slow start to the season for Tampa Bay, but his game was rounding into much better shape over the past month. Point has scored eight goals and 19 points in 15 games since Dec. 9, helping the Atlantic Division-leading Lightning to a 10-game winning streak in the process.

“The tough part for Pointer is his game had really turned the corner, and it seemed like he was scoring every night for us,” Cooper said.

The Calgary native hasn’t previously represented his country at the Olympics.

In the event that Point’s injury knocks him out of the tournament, Canada general manager Doug Armstrong’s management team has a group of forwards already standing by in reserve to select a replacement from.

Obviously, everyone involved hopes Point recovers in time for Milan. But in the meantime, conversations need to be had in case he ultimately has to be replaced.

On Dec. 31, the day Canada’s roster was announced, Armstrong explained how they would go about assembling the reserve list should an injury occur.

“We’ve worked a (reserve) list that we think checks a lot of different boxes,” Armstrong told The Athletic. “So if this player gets hurt, and he performs a certain role, what replacement do we want?

“We’ll want to make sure we keep as many options available so that we take the player that’s playing the best in the area we need him.”

In other words, there isn’t necessarily one specific player who is the “next man up” should an injury require a roster change. The replacement would depend on two factors: the candidate’s performance at the time of consideration and the skill set and role of the player being replaced.

Sam Bennett, Connor Bedard, Wyatt Johnston, Mark Scheifele, Seth Jarvis and Travis Konecny are among those on the reserve list, according to league sources.

What role would Point have on the Olympic roster, if healthy? One league source said the plan was to play him on the top line alongside McDavid. As mentioned, that’s where Point was in the championship game, but there was some line-blending and line-matching as the game went. He also played some center in that tournament.

Either way, he would be headed for a top-six role in Milan.

There are two ways Team Canada could go about replacing him: Replace him with a player who can directly take over his role or elevate a player already named to the team to that role and backfill at the bottom.

If Team Canada was looking for a player who could play both center and wing and also, like Point, was a right shot, that would bring Bedard and Johnston especially into focus. One can’t discount fellow right-hand shots Scheifele and Jarvis, either.

Probably the closest skillset match for Point is Johnston. But Bedard offers the most offensive ceiling.

And don’t overlook Bennett, for the simple fact that he was the most difficult player for management to leave off the roster in the first place. Maybe an injury replacement offers Team Canada a chance for a do-over there and they can rethink roles in other ways.

One way or another, if Point needs replacing, it’s another difficult decision coming for Team Canada and one that won’t please everyone.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/13165039/GettyImages-2200098923-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-14 01:59:21.029204

The grueling injury often takes about nine months to fully recover from -- placing the 32-year-old’s NFL future in jeopardy as he enters his 10th season.

Teammates such asChristian McCaffrey, Ricky Pearsall, Eddy Pineiro and Demarcus Robinson were among the flood of comments offering support to Kittle, who also seemingly confirmed reports of the bottle of Patrón delivered to the locker room after he was carted off.

Kittle said, ""You know you’re in a special place"" when team owner Jed York is the first person to meet you in the locker room. York was reportedly the one who sent the bottle.

Edwards and offensive tackle Ozzy Trapilo on injured reserve, the team announced on Tuesday. The move effectively ends both of their respective seasons after injuries suffered in Chicago’s Wild Card win over the Packers on Saturday.

As corresponding roster moves, the Bears activated offensive tackle Braxton Jones off the injured reserve list and called up linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin from the practice squad to the active roster. Taking Reeves-Maybin’s spot on the practice squad will be linebacker Nephi Sewell, a four-year NFL veteran who also is Bears linebacker Noah Sewell’s older brother.

Jones, arguably the best value pick from Ryan Poles’ first draft as Chicago’s general manager, was the team’s primary starting left tackle from 2022 to 2024. He started the first three games of the season in 2025 but ultimately got benched in favor of Theo Benedet. He suffered a knee injury afterwards and has been on the Bears’ injured reserve list since October. With 44 career starts, he brings valuable experience to the table with Trapilo out for the rest of the postseason.

Reeves-Maybin, a 2023 Pro Bowler and All-Pro as a special teamer, signed with the Bears in November. He has played in three regular season games for the Bears this year purely as a special teamer, most notably tallying two tackles in Week 15 against the Browns. He took eight defensive snaps on Saturday against Green Bay, finishing with a tackle and a quarterback hurry as a blitzing defender.

Edwards suffered a fractured fibula in the Packers game that will leave him out for the remainder of the postseason. It’s unfortunate timing for the 29-year-old, who missed seven games during the regular season with multiple injuries. Trapilo had been coming into his own as Chicago’s starting left tackle, having held the role since Week 12 when Benedet got hurt and keeping a stranglehold on the role since.

Packers Preparing Contract Talks with Matt LaFleur

ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports the Packers plan to work on a new deal with Matt LaFleur after the season. Green Bay doesn’t want him entering 2026 on an expiring contract, even if another playoff flameout has turned up the outside noise. The organization has never been one to hand out top-tier coaching salaries, and LaFleur’s 76-41-1 record is now weighed against postseason frustration. Teams with openings are watching closely in case negotiations sour. If LaFleur ever actually hit the market, he’d instantly jump near the top of multiple lists.

Harbaugh Mania Takes Over the Coaching Cycle

The Falcons completed an interview with John Harbaugh, marking the first confirmed conversation after his firing and the clearest sign yet that he’ll be able to pick almost any job he wants. NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo believes the Titans are firmly in the race thanks to a roster reset, enormous cap space and rookie QB Cam Ward. SNY’s Connor Hughes reports many coaching candidates think this comes down to the Giants or Falcons, with the runner-up turning to Kevin Stefanski. Harbaugh is expected to pace himself, interview next week, and let teams come to him. Wherever he lands, it’s going to shape the rest of the carousel.

Mike McDaniel Drawing Heavy Interest

The Falcons completed their interview with Mike McDaniel, who also met with the Browns and has sit-downs scheduled with the Titans and Ravens. He’s one of the more unique candidates in this cycle, with a track record of squeezing strong offensive output out of Miami’s fractured quarterback situation. The Browns also completed their interview with him, viewing him as a real candidate for the top job. While offensive coordinator opportunities will be plentiful, it’s clear there’s still real head-coaching interest in him.

Ravens Coaching Search Expands

The Ravens completed an interview with Kliff Kingsbury and formally requested interviews with Browns DC Jim Schwartz, Rams pass-game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase, Chargers DC Jesse Minter and Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver. Kingsbury continues to float between head-coaching buzz and coordinator options, while Schwartz has drawn strong in-house support in Cleveland. Weaver has already met with Arizona and Atlanta. Minter’s surge continues after a strong defensive showing late in the season. Baltimore appears willing to explore every possible angle to reset around Lamar Jackson.

Browns Request Udinski

Cleveland requested an interview with Jaguars OC Grant Udinski. He’s a fast-rising name after helping Jacksonville settle into one of the league’s better late-season offenses. With Jim Schwartz already interviewing in-house, the Browns seem determined to cover the field before making a call.

Raiders Add Jesse Minter to Their List

The Raiders added Chargers DC Jesse Minter to an already lengthy candidate list featuring Jeff Hafley, Vance Joseph, Klint Kubiak, Matt Nagy, Nate Scheelhaase and Davis Webb. Minter’s defense smothered Drake Maye in the Wild Card Round even in a losing effort, and it’s clear teams noticed. Las Vegas remains one of the trickier landing spots given roster questions and front-office uncertainty, but the volume of interview requests signals they’re determined to reset the identity of the franchise.

Giants Request Chris Shula

New York requested to interview Rams DC Chris Shula, joining the Cardinals and Raiders as teams lining up for a closer look. Shula’s work with a low-budget defense earned him significant league-wide respect this season, and he has quickly become one of the more interesting defensive candidates of the cycle. The Giants continue to cast a wide net as they pursue their next coach.

Dolphins Request Kelvin Sheppard

Miami requested an interview with Lions DC Kelvin Sheppard after completing their interview with Klint Kubiak. Sheppard made an immediate impact in his first year as coordinator, building a tough, aggressive defense that played well above expectations. The Dolphins also have requests out for Jeff Hafley, Robert Saleh, and Chris Shula as they search for the successor to Mike McDaniel.

Injury Ward

Nico Collins (head) exited Houston’s Wild Card win after landing head-first into the turf. Collins showed signs of disorientation and was ultimately carted off. Expect him to be in concussion protocol this week. His status for the Divisional Round is very much up in the air.

Matthew Stafford (finger) is good to go for the Divisional Round, according to Sean McVay. The sprain didn’t keep him off the field last week and shouldn’t limit him as the Rams prep for Chicago.

Dalton Kincaid (foot) wore a boot after the Wild Card win, but Sean McDermott called the move precautionary. His practice participation later in the week will determine whether Dawson Knox is in line for more work.

Gabe Davis (knee) tore his ACL and will miss the rest of the playoffs. It’s a brutal blow for Buffalo, who will turn to Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks, Tyrell Shavers and Keon Coleman to fill the void.

Tucker Kraft (knee) anticipates opening training camp on the PUP list, though he expects to be ready for Week 1. His return timeline remains one of the bigger Packers storylines heading into 2026.

A coaching cycle rarely tilts an entire postseason, but the league is spinning fast and every interview feels like the start of another ripple. Meanwhile, contenders are taping up quarterbacks, shuffling receivers and adjusting game plans on the fly. Buckle up. The Divisional Round is here, and the next domino is never far away.

There are just three weeks of football left in the 2025 season. For most of the league, preparations for 2026 have already begun. This article will break down the biggest team needs that will benefit fantasy managers heading into the 2026 offseason.

AFC Offseason Team Needs

Baltimore Ravens: Add More Pass-Catching Talent

The Baltimore Ravens will enter the 2026 season with a new coaching staff leading the Lamar Jackson offense. Baltimore is also set to return Derrick Henry and four of five offensive linemen (center Tyler Linderbaum will be a free agent) but is set to lose Isaiah Likely and DeAndre Hopkins in free agency.

The Ravens need to explore replacing (or retaining) those big bodies in the passing attack to complement the skill sets of Zay Flowers and Mark Andrews.

Buffalo Bills: Try to Find a WR1 for Josh Allen (Again)

Once again, the Buffalo Bills’ passing attack is being held up by the stellar play of Josh Allen with a mishmash of average talent. Buffalo had just one receiver (Khalil Shakir) with over 600 receiving yards. 11 different players had at least 100 receiving yards.

Keon Coleman hasn’t worked out as the team’s WR1 after being drafted as the 33rd pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, but that shouldn’t discourage Buffalo from going back to the well to find a pass catcher again. The Bills’ offense can unlock another level if they can find a player that defenses must account for in the passing attack.

Cincinnati Bengals: Upgrade the Interior Offensive Line

The Cincinnati Bengals’ offensive line showed growth over the course of the 2025 season. According to StatsHub, the Bengals ranked 17th in pressure rate (29.9%) and tied for 21st in sack rate (5.2%). Both marks were improvements over 2024.

Unfortunately, Cincinnati is set to lose a starting center (Ted Karras), guard (Dalton Risner) and two experienced backups (Cordell Volson and Lucas Patrick). Protecting Joe Burrow is paramount given his injury woes, which means the team needs to invest resources to fortify its interior line this offseason.

Cleveland Browns: Re-Tool the Offensive Line

The Browns have a lot of needs on the offensive side of the ball, but the most glaring issue for 2026 is the offensive line. Right tackle Jack Conklin is the only starter set to return next season on a unit that has struggled with age and injuries in recent seasons.

Cleveland could choose to bring back a couple of veterans like Joel Bitonio and Ethan Pocic on the interior, but it would be wise to use their increased draft capital to infuse some youth into this group.

Denver Broncos: Add a Reliable Complement to RJ Harvey in the Backfield

RJ Harvey had a fantastic rookie season for the Denver Broncos (and fantasy managers), but Denver’s run game took a clear step back when J.K. Dobbins was knocked out with an injury. Among 58 running backs with at least 40 carries since Week 10, Harvey ranked 50th in expected points added (-16.19) and 37th in success rate (39.6%).

Harvey should improve in his second season, but this is still an offense that prefers to utilize multiple backs with varied skill sets, which is set to lose Dobbins, Jaleel McLaughlin and Tyler Badie to free agency.

This is a stellar running back free agent class with plenty of options that can spell Harvey in his second season to give the Broncos a more stable rushing attack.

Houston Texans: Continue to Build up the Offensive Line

The Texans are seemingly set at the skill positions, but they could stand to add talent in the trenches. Houston’s offensive line held up well in the passing game by finishing in the bottom 12 among all offenses in sacks (31) and pressures (177) allowed. However, they were terrible as run blockers.

The Texans had the third-lowest expected points added (-54.44) and success rate (36.8%) in the NFL in 2025. They also had the seventh-highest stuff rate (21.1%) and third-lowest explosive run rate (9.1%). Only guard Ed Ingram is set to hit free agency in 2026, but Houston could stand to upgrade several pieces of this group.

Indianapolis Colts: Figure Out the Quarterback Position

It looked like the Colts had struck gold with Daniel Jones under center the first 10 weeks of 2025. The Colts had one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL and were the top seed in the AFC. Just four weeks later, Jones had suffered a torn Achilles and the season spiraled.

That injury leaves the Colts in a bad position. Jones was starting to regress before suffering a significant lower-body injury but played at a high level before being hurt. Early reports indicate the Colts and Jones are open to agreeing to a long-term deal, but the Colts will need to figure out who is under center until he’s ready to return.

Anthony Richardson Sr. or Riley Leonard could play to start the season, or the team could add a more reliable option out of free agency.

Jacksonville Jaguars: Add to the Backfield

The Jaguars had an excellent season thanks to Travis Etienne Jr.’s ability to keep the offense on schedule as a runner while adding explosive plays. Thankfully for Etienne, his high level of play came during a contract year.

Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen Jr. can have bigger roles in 2026, but Jacksonville will likely look to extend Etienne or dip into the deep free agent running back class to ensure their running game stays a strength next season.

Kansas City Chiefs: Add a Dynamic Running Back

Kansas City’s rushing attack struggled again in 2025. Kareem Hunt (3.7) and Isiah Pacheco (3.9) both averaged fewer than four yards per carry. The issue was more thanks to the talent in the backfield than the offensive line. According to StatsHub, the Chiefs were ninth in both rushing success rate (43.3%) and yards before contact (2.4).

The Chiefs tried (and failed) to trade for Breece Hall at the trade deadline but should use their free agent money to upgrade the backfield now that the season is over. Both Hunt and Pacheco are set to hit free agency.

Las Vegas Raiders: Add the Quarterback of the Future

The Raiders came into 2025 with a new, highly paid coaching staff, an exciting rookie running back (Ashton Jeanty) and a theoretically upgraded quarterback (Geno Smith). Fast forward 18 weeks and the team has fired the coaching staff and will surely replace Smith.

This goal won’t take much to accomplish since the Raiders hold the first pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza is considered the favorite to be selected first overall, but there is plenty of time between now and the draft for things to potentially change.

Regardless, the Raiders need to identify a quarterback to get the most out of their young corps of weapons.

Los Angeles Chargers: Upgrade the Interior Offensive Line

The Chargers once again had brutal play across the offensive line thanks to significant injuries to left tackle Rashawn Slater (knee) and right tackle Joe Alt (ankle). Both players will hopefully be ready for 2026 (Slater’s injury is far less certain).

However, the Chargers also have glaring issues on the interior. Los Angeles has a chance to reset the group this offseason with three contributors at guard (Zion Johnson, Jamaree Salyer, Trevor Penning) set to hit free agency.

Miami Dolphins: Overhaul the Offense

The Dolphins elected to fire head coach Mike McDaniel, meaning a new offensive system will be in place. The team is expected to move on from Tua Tagovailoa as well.

Miami has some solid pieces along the offensive line and two explosive weapons (De’Von Achane and Jaylen Waddle). However, decisions on the coaching staff, and subsequently the quarterback, loom large ahead of 2026.

New England Patriots: Continue to Upgrade the Offensive Line

Drake Maye took a big step in 2025, turning into an MVP candidate in his second season. The Patriots are set to return their entire receiver group (plus Hunter Henry) and both of their running backs next season. One area they need to address is the offensive line.

Garrett Bradbury and rookie left guard Jared Wilson combined to allow four sacks and 48 pressures on the interior this season and could be upgraded. The team could also explore adding a right tackle in the draft with Morgan Moses’ injury history and age.

New York Jets: Find a New Direction at Quarterback

First-year head coach Aaron Glenn hoped that Justin Fields could be his starting quarterback of the future. Unfortunately, his struggles as a passer led the Jets to start Tyrod Taylor and Brady Cook for four games apiece.

The Jets have the second overall pick in the draft, but this quarterback class lacks many NFL-ready options after Fernando Mendoza. The Jets will need to decide if they can develop a young quarterback in the draft or if they can acquire a veteran with multi-year starting potential this offseason.

Pittsburgh Steelers: Figure Out the Quarterback Position

Aaron Rodgers was fine in his (first?) season with the Steelers and has not ruled out returning in 2026. He proved he is still a viable option, but at some point, the Steelers need to try and find a quarterback who can provide multiple years under center.

The Steelers drafted Ohio State’s Will Howard with a Day 3 pick in 2025, but there is no indication that the team views him as more than a developmental option at this point.

Tennessee Titans: Add Receiving Talent to Help Cam Ward Develop

The 2025 Titans had just two players finish with over 500 receiving yards in Cam Ward’s rookie season. Three of their top four pass catchers were drafted in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. The team’s leading receiver, tight end Chig Okonkwo, is set to hit free agency.

The Titans need to hit on their new coach, but more importantly, they have to give Cam Ward more consistent weapons at receiver. The Titans will have plenty of veteran options in free agency like George Pickens, Mike Evans, Rashid Shaheed and Wan’Dale Robinson, if they hit free agency.

Any team can almost win a game. Monday, I counted down the most unlikely losses of the season, the games where a team climbed up around 95% or higher in win probability (per ESPN) only to let the opponent come back and win. It can happen to great teams (the Rams and Eagles have two of the 12 worst losses), it can happen to terrible teams (the Giants had the single least likely loss of the season).

But only really bad teams can have no chance at any point.

There’s an easy explanation of this, of course — the start of the game. The Broncos can come out and lay a total egg and lose 35-10 or something, but because they start out as a good team, their start-of-game win probability isn’t ever going to dip that far below 50%, even if they play terribly the rest of the way.

In other words, what follows below — the most expected losses of the 2025 season, aka the teams that had the lowest “peak” win expectancy in a given game — might not come as a huge surprise. But it’s still a fun look back.

There were nine times this season a team failed to reach a 25% win probability at any point in the game, coming from six different teams. You can probably name them (or at least four of them) pretty easily. Let’s count them down.

The Least Unlikely Losses of the 2025 NFL Season

9. Miami Dolphins vs. New England Patriots, Week 18

Peak win probability: 22.8%

The Patriots entered Week 18 in a situation where a win kept them in contention for the AFC’s No. 1 overall seed. The Dolphins entered Week 18 in a situation where the 2026 season couldn’t come soon enough. That’s why the Miami win probability was only 18.4% at kickoff, and with the Patriots scoring a touchdown inside of the first two minutes, it didn’t climb much. Early in the second half, the Dolphins had it at 17-10 and had the ball just outside the red zone, so they reached up around a 1-in-4 chance … until a Quinn Ewers pass was picked off. That was all she wrote, and the Pats won 38-10.

8. Cincinnati Bengals vs. Detroit Lions, Week 5

Peak win probability: 21.7%

The Bengals were supposed to be contenders, and even by Week 5, they were only 2-2. That said, the two wins came in Joe Burrow’s starts, and 2025 Jake Browning hadn’t looked anything like 2023 Jake Browning Meanwhile, the Lions had looked rough in Week 1 but then turned dominant, beating the Bears, Ravens and Browns by a combined 63 points and scoring 124 points in the three games. So even an offense that had Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Chase Brown wasn’t enough for the win probabilities, and the Bengals never climbed much above a 1-in-5 chance (which they were after one snap of the game). The Lions led 7-0 after 4:10 of the game, and the Bengals never got closer than that in a 37-24 loss.

7. Las Vegas Raiders vs. Philadelphia Eagles, Week 15

Peak win probability: 20.9%

In the end, the Eagles clearly weren’t as good as many of us expected them to be, and entering Week 15 they were on a three-game losing streak. Still, pretty much everyone saw this as a get-right game, with the Raiders bottoming out early this season and never rising much above that. The 20.9% mark was where the game started for the Raiders, and the Eagles ran a long, 13-play drive to score a touchdown. The Raiders responded with a long, 13-play drive of their own, where they … turned it over on downs. They trailed 7-0 after a quarter, 17-0 after a half and never scored en route to a 31-0 loss.

6. Tennessee Titans vs. San Francisco 49ers, Week 15

Peak win probability: 18.4%

The Titans never got anything going this year. Their only wins were over the Cardinals when Arizona shot themselves in the foot enough times that Plaxico Burress was jealous, a win over a Chiefs team that had given up on the season, and an actual win over … Shedeur Sanders and the Browns. So every team was heavily favored over the Titans, but the 49ers — who entered their matchup off a bye and on a three-game winning streak where they had outscored their opponents 87-39 — were perhaps the best for the task. And hey, late in the first half, the Titans had the ball in San Francisco territory with a theoretical chance to tie the game. And even at that moment, their win probability was … 15.2%. They’d go on to lose 37-24.

5. Tennessee Titans vs. Indianapolis Colts, Week 8

Peak win probability: 16.8%

Man, remember when the Colts were good? /wistful Colts fan

Week 8 was probably the peak of the Colts season. They entered at 6-1 and rolling and destroyed their division rivals 38-14 to get to 7-1. They’d go 1-8 the rest of the way. It stunk. But hey, in Week 8, they looked great, and they jumped out to a 10-0 lead. The Titans made it 10-7, but the Colts scored the next 28 points, so it was never really a sweat.

4. New Orleans Saints vs. Los Angeles Rams, Week 9

Peak win probability: 15.6%

Tyler Shough looked pretty good as a rookie! That didn’t really include his first start, back in Week 9, when the Rams took him, and the Saints, to the woodshed. Taysom Hill led the team in rushing. The Rams led 10-0, 20-3 and 34-10 (the final score). The 15.6% mark was the “eh, let’s throw them a bone” win probability as the start of the game. No one ever thought they’d win this one.

3. New York Jets vs. New England Patriots, Week 17

Peak win probability: 15.5%

Notice that team that had this game? Get used to seeing it here.

Turns out, having Brady Cook throwing to Adonai Mitchell and John Metchie III against the possible NFL MVP and a potential No. 1 seed in the AFC means you don’t get a lot of respect from the models. And given the Patriots scored their first touchdown within 5 minutes and their second within 10 en route to leads of 21-0 and 42-3 before winning 42-10, the lack of respect appears to have been warranted.

2. New York Jets vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, Week 15

Peak win probability: 12.5%

Another game, another Jets game started by Brady Cook against a contending team. The Jags entered on a four-game winning streak where they had beaten the Chargers, Cardinals, Titans and Colts by a combined 123-52, and Trevor Lawrence was forcing his way into the MVP conversation. The Jets actually did manage a few points in this one, getting to 20, but with the Jags roaring to 48, it didn’t really matter. (But hey, if you bet “Both teams score in all four quarters” for this one, good for you, because it hit.)

1. New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills, Week 18

Peak win probability: 8.5%

A thing I probably should know but don’t is how much the win probability model takes into account things like “Josh Allen is going to start the game but barely play.” Like, I know it takes players into account — that’s how it knows when a bad team is facing a good one and opens the probability at some impossibly low number. But Allen is determined to keep his consecutive-game streak going, so he wasn’t going to sit; he was going to play a snap and then give way to Mitchell Trubisky. Thus, did the model think Allen was going to play (in which case the Jets never even sniffing 10% makes sense), or did it believe it would be almost entirely Trubisky (in which case the odds still make sense, but man, what an insult)? I don’t know, but given the Jets didn’t even score until the last half of the last quarter when they were down 35-0, whatever the model thought, the odds were very solid.

The Jets were so bad, y’all.

The 2025 NFL season felt extremely weird for any number of reasons, but here’s one more: By ESPN in-game win probably, there were 13 games in the 2024 regular season where a team reached 90% win probably or better and lost. In 2025, there were 24.

Now, obviously, win probability charting is more of a for-fun exercise than hard science. It’s fun to look at, but it doesn’t actually tell you that much. But oh boy, the fun to look at is very fun to look at.

What comes below is about the regular season, but here’s a playoff example: Sunday, the Bears had an incomplete pass on third-and-3 from around midfield when they were down 11 points with 5:41 left. At that moment, win probability had the Packers at 97.8% likely to win the game:

Of course, we know what came next. 27-yard completion to Rome Odunze. Touchdown to Olamide Zaccheaus. Two-point conversion to Colston Loveland. Brandon McManus missed kick. DJ Moore touchdown. Bears win. 2.2% likelihood turned to 100%.

That sort of thing happened with shocking frequency in the 2025 season. So below, I’m counting down the 14 most unlikely losses of the 2025 NFL regular season. These are the 14 times a team reached at least 94.0% win probability only to see if disappear. Remember: Not analysis. Just fun.

The Most Unlikely Losses of the 2025 NFL Season

14. Green Bay Packers vs. Cleveland Browns, Week 3

94.0% win probability

Early in the fourth quarter, Jordan Love completed a 34-yard pass to Matthew Golden on third-and-8. They were up 10-0 on the moribund Browns and were driving to go up 13 or even 17. A minus-1 yard run and two incompletions later, the Packers punted. The Browns dinked-and-dunked down to get a field goal. But it’s a field goal, right? Who really cares? Except … Love threw an interception deep in his own territory on the next drive, the Browns turned it into a one-yard field goal. Tie game. The Packers got a field goal blocked. And ultimately, Andre Szmyt kicked a 55-yard walkoff field goal. Every single thing that could have gone wrong for the Packers in the last 10 minutes of that game did go wrong.

13. Chicago Bears vs. Minnesota Vikings, Week 1

94.2% win probability

It’s easy to forget this one now, with the Bears marching into a home game in the Divisional Round and the Vikings entering an offseason where they might not even keep their young quarterback as starter. But in Week 1, J.J. McCarthy had a fourth quarter for the ages. The Vikings entered the fourth down 17-6, but McCarthy threw for two touchdowns and ran for another. The Bears scored a late touchdown, but it wasn’t enough. Week 1 ended with the Vikings 1-0 and excited, the Bears 0-1 and deflated, and the NFC North looking like a Green Bay/Minnesota matchup. Oh, how things changed.

12. Los Angeles Rams vs. Philadelphia Eagles, Week 3

94.4% win probability

It’s rare to reach elite win probability super early in the second half, because it’s hard to run away that much. But only a couple minutes into the third quarter in Week 3, the Rams were beating the Eagles 26-7 and got the Eagles to second-and-13 after a holding penalty. Only … Jalen Hurts completed a 38-yarder to A.J. Brown on the next play. Believe it or not, the Rams were done scoring in the game, while the Eagles went touchdown (33 yards, Dallas Goedert), touchdown (9 yards, Brown), touchdown (4 yards, DeVonta Smith) and for good measure, they blocked a potential game-winning Rams field goal with no time left, and Jordan Davis returned that for a touchdown. The Eagles scored 26 unanswered points to stay undefeated.

11. Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Atlanta Falcons, Week 15

95.1% win probability

Tampa was probably never going to win the Super Bowl, but there are still going to be some major regrets from the 2025 season. The team was 3-0, 5-1 and 6-2. Baker Mayfield was an MVP candidate. Instead, they lost four of their last five, seven of their last nine and eight of their last 11. And none was worse than this one, when the Bucs led the all-over-but-the-shouting Falcons 28-14 in the fourth quarter before letting Kirk Cousins lead two touchdowns drives and a field goal. The Falcons beat the Bucs, didn’t lose again, and because they tied the Bucs and Panthers at 8-9, tiebreakers sent the Panthers into the playoffs and sent the Bucs home.

10. Philadelphia Eagles vs. Denver Broncos, Week 5

95.4% win probability

There were several times this season where everyone basically concluded that the Broncos were a smoke-and-mirrors affair. This was one of them, trailing 17-3 late in the third quarter and at risk of falling to 2-3. They punted here, and the Eagles spent more than a full quarter of game time (from 13:18 of the third quarter to 13:11 of the fourth) at 80% win probability or above. But the Broncos woke up in the fourth quarter, getting touchdowns from J.K. Dobbins and Evan Engram and a 36-yard Wil Lutz field goal with 1:11 left to beat the Eagles 21-17. They only lost one time the rest of the season.

9. Philadelphia Eagles vs. Dallas Cowboys, Week 12

96.3% win probability

Back-to-back Eagles! And this one came early, with the Eagles up 21-0 in the second quarter and driving. It looked not only like a victory over their rival, but a demolition that would have all but ended the Cowboys season. Instead, they punted. The Cowboys scored a touchdown before halftime and two more in the second half, then kicking a game-winning field goal as time expired. The Eagles missed a field goal and lost a fumble in the fourth quarter, and in the second half they 30 plays for 108 yards. “The offense falls apart in the second half” was kind of a theme of the 2025 Eagles.

8. New York Giants vs. Chicago Bears, Week 10

96.9% win probability

Under 6 minutes left, and the Bears trailed by 10 points. The win probability for the Bears was 3.1%, but given how Chicago’s season has gone, it was probably like 94%, as the Cardiac Bears had comebacks galore. They scored a touchdown on the drive they were on. The rest of the game, the Giants had nine plays on offense — a three-and-out for minus-8 yards, and a turnover on downs on a six-play, 11-yard drive. The Bears followed up one touchdown with another, and within five minutes they managed to go from “under 5% to win” to “comfortably kneeling the ball to finish off a victory.”

7. Arizona Cardinals vs. Tennessee Titans, Week 5

97.4% win probability

Hands down the funniest game of the year. The Cardinals led 21-6 with 12 minutes left looking to get to 3-2. Instead, they had a whole comedy of errors in the game. The snap off Kyler Murray’s face that became a turnover had happened earlier, but they also added in a massive Emari Demercado run into a goal-line fumble and touchback and somehow turned a Cardinals interception into a Titans touchdown, when Dadrion Taylor-Demerson picked off a pass and fumbled it into the end zone for Tyler Lockett to recover. Podcasts did entire episodes just about the Cardinals’ comedy in that second half.

6. Cincinnati Bengals vs. New York Jets, Week 8

97.5% win probability

It was Week 8. The Jets were winless. The Bengals were struggling, but they were expected to compete, especially if they could just tread water until Joe Burrow got back. And with 9:28 left, the Bengals were up 14 and the Jets had third-and-6 in their own territory. Even the most nihilistic of Bengals fans had to feel very secure. But the Jets scored a touchdown and got the two-point conversion (doing the “go for 2 when a touchdown gets you within 8” thing that draws so much conversation), the Bengals had a three-and-out, the Jets scored again, the Bengals turned it over on downs, and the Jets had their first win of the season. Absolutely no one saw it coming.

5. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Houston Texans, Week 10

98.4% win probability

This one peaked at 98.4% early in the fourth quarter, but it was really a whole-game thing. The Jags were up 3-0 after 4 minutes, up 10-0 after 7 minutes, up 17-0 after 16 minutes. But yes, with 13:09 left, the Texans had an incompletion on third down to get to fourth-and-2 down 29-10. It seemed over, especially with C.J. Stroud hurt and Davis Mills under center. Instead, Mills led not one, not two, but three touchdown drives, including a 14-yard running score to take the lead that was the second-longest run of his career. And for good measure, the Jags forced a fumble on the Texans’ desperation play to end the game and returned that for a touchdown too. A 26-0 fourth quarter really set the Texans’ season in the right direction, as they didn’t lose again. But it was OK — the Jags didn’t have another loss in the regular season either.

4. Los Angeles Rams vs. Seattle Seahawks, Week 16

98.8% win probability

This was the game of the year, unless one our No. 2 finishers is it. Thursday night, DVOA Bowl, division rivals. Only … the Rams led 30-14 in the fourth quarter. The Seahawks passing game couldn’t get going. Outside of a single 55-yard Kenneth Walker III run, neither could the running game. Kind of a letdown. And when Sam Darnold threw a pick at the goal line with 9:48 left, it certainly seemed all over. But the Seattle defense forced a three-and-out and Rashid Shaheed returned the ensuing punt for a touchdown, and … the Seahawks came alive. Touchdown, another touchdown, the craziest two-point conversion you’ll ever see, missed Rams field goal, overtime. The Rams scored a touchdown in overtime (Puka Nacua with an all-time game), but the Seahawks answered with a touchdown and another two-pointer. Ballgame, 1 seed all but locked up.

T2. Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears, Week 16

99.1% win probability

So Week 16 was wild, huh? And it certainly foretold of a crazy postseason. With 3:27 left, the Packers led the Bears 16-6. The Chicago offense had nothing going on. Caleb Williams had just run for 11 yards on third-and-10, but a holding brought it back and forced third-and-20. But a face mask on the next play gave the Bears life. They notched a field goal on that drive, recovered an onside kick (who knew that was still possible?) and scored a touchdown with 24 seconds left (Jahdae Walker’s second career reception), before winning in overtime. The Packers had been in line for maybe the NFC’s 1 seed, the Bears were facing fraud allegations. Instead, the Packers never won again, and the Bears are hosting a game in the Divisional Round.

T2. Baltimore Ravens vs. Buffalo Bills, Week 1

99.1% win probability

If that Week 16 Seahawks/Rams game wasn’t the game of the year, this one was. The first Sunday of the NFL season had been fine, but it didn’t have a signature game until the prime-time battle between AFC favorites Buffalo and Baltimore. The Ravens got to 99.1% when they were up 40-25 with 4:48 left in the fourth quarter, but they spent most of the fourth quarter above 90%. It looked like the Ravens were on their way to having their finally-breaking-through season in 2025, even if it was only Week 1. And then all of a sudden, it wasn’t. Keon Coleman caught a touchdown on a scramble play. Derrick Henry, who had 169 yards and 2 touchdowns in the game, fumbled. The Bills scored again. The Ravens had a three-and-out. And then Matt Prater, who was 41 and had been on the team for three days, kicked a walkoff field goal. It was all anyone could ask for out of the season opener … unless you were a Ravens fan.

1. New York Giants vs. Denver Broncos, Week 7

99.8% win probability

The Giants led 19-0 entering the fourth quarter. The Broncos had gained all of 111 yards through their first eight drives — six punts, a turnover on downs and the end of the first half. It wasn’t just an upset, it was a beatdown. And that wasn’t even the 99.8% part! The Giants were overwhelming favorites as the fourth quarter started, 92.5%, but then they answered the Broncos’ first score with a touchdown of their own to go up 26-8. Surely the game was iced, right? Nope, the Broncos scored with 5:01 left. The Giants threw an interception. The Broncos scored again. The Giants punted. The Broncos scored again. They were up 30-26. OK, you lose. But then! The Giants scored, just to make it interesting. Unfortunately, Jude McAtamney missed the extra point (his second of the game, so when the Broncos kicked a 39-yard field goal as time expired, it wasn’t to tie the game (or even to lose by one) … it was the game winner. The Giants lost a game that should have been impossible to lose.",https://dmxvtdt4jwgem.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/John-Harbaugh.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 01:59:31.937079

The Seahawks kicked off their practice week on Tuesday in preparation for their divisional round game against the 49ers, and did so with nearly everyone on their 53-man roster, as well as two players designated to return from injured reserve, taking part in the practice.

Only two players did not practice, linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) and tackle Josh Jones (knee), who started at left tackle in place of an injured Charles Cross for the final three games of the regular season, playing through knee and ankle injuries in Week 18.

Cross, meanwhile, was listed as a full participant after missing three games with a hamstring injury, as was safety Coby Bryant, who missed the previous two games with a knee injury. Their statuses lines up with what Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said about those two players heading into Week 18, which was that both Cross and Bryant would likely make it back for the playoffs.

Two new names to the injury report were cornerback Riq Woolen (oblique) and outside linebacker DeMarcus Lawrence (Achilles), who were both limited participants.

Tight end Elijah Arroyo, who was designated to return to practice last week, was listed as a full participant, while linebacker Chazz Surratt, who was designated to return on Tuesday, was limited.

The 49ers, coming off a wild card win over the Eagles on Sunday, held a walkthrough, meaning their report was an estimation of participation had they practice. Receiver Ricky Pearsall, who missed the last two games with a knee injury, was listed as limited, as was left tackle Trent Williams, who returned for Sunday's game after missing the Week 18 game against Seattle due to a hamstring injury.

""What that looks like at a pretty impactful position on your salary cap, when you're able to possibly plan for your depth chart looking in a way where you can be competitive no matter what.""

McCarthy entered the season with massive questions after suffering a preseason knee injury in 2024 that caused him to miss the entire season. It was a roller-coaster for the Michigan product, who flashed at times late in games but was inconsistent, missing passes badly for long stretches. Injuries also plagued the QB, who missed time with ankle, hand and concussion issues.

""J.J., I was really encouraged by the type of football he started to play towards the second half of the season and finishing the way he did,"" O'Connell said. ""We spend a lot of time talking about what the layers of change really were, and I think we all just tried to have a mindset on completions and however we could generate them, we started to see a little bit of that show up.

There is little question that the Vikings need a reliable veteran to buffer McCarthy.

Late in the third quarter, the 26-year-old caught a pass from quarterback C.J. Stroud but had a hard fall where he fell on his face and was in enough pain that he needed to be taken to the blue medical tent. After being carted to the locker room, he was ruled out with a concussion. And now Texans fans are worried that Collins might not be able to play when the team faces the New England Patriots on Sunday, January 18 in the NFL Divisional Round.

The doctor, who specializes in assessing football injuries, gives him a “30% chance” of clearing the sport’s concussion protocol within six days.

Morse notes that this is the second concussion that Collins has apparently received in his career, with his first being sustained earlier this season against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7. That injury forced him to miss one game. That said, he suggests that this second concussion could take longer for him to recover from.

He explained, “The fact that he required help off the field, that this is his 2nd concussion in less than 3 months (sometimes repeat concussions cause lingering symptoms) and that this game was played on a Monday (short week), will make him clearing the protocol very difficult.”

The NFL concussion protocol, which Patriots’ Christian Gonzalez is also going through, has five steps and each step requires a minimum of one day to clear. So the earliest that Collins could return to the field is Saturday, with him needing to be in limited practice on Thursday for him to have a shot to return in time.

Bills coach Sean McDermott said Tuesday that Shavers played the second half Sunday on his torn ACL, which he suffered in the second quarter on a punt return. As he came off a block, Shavers immediately pulled up and began limping and then was looked at by athletic trainers on the field. Shavers came back to play 21 offensive snaps in the final two quarters but did not return to special teams.

""He embodies what we're all about,"" McDermott said. ""... For him to then come back into the game, and then for it to turn out to be what it was is remarkable. Remarkable toughness, remarkable commitment to the team.""

The Bills also lost Gabe Davis to a torn left ACL in the game, and fellow wide receiver Joshua Palmer was placed on injured reserve last week with a lingering ankle injury.

That leaves Buffalo with only three available receivers on the active roster -- veteran Brandin Cooks, Khalil Shakir and Keon Coleman -- as it prepares to play in Denver on Saturday against the top-seeded Denver Broncos. Curtis Samuel (elbow) had his practice window opened from injured reserve Tuesday and was listed as a full participant in the team's walk-through practice. The practice squad includes receivers Mecole Hardman Jr., Stephen Gosnell and Kristian Wilkerson.

""Another guy's got to step up. That's point-blank what it means,"" McDermott said. ""And I don't mean to be short. It's just right now, it's full confidence in the guys in that room, and we brought back Kristian Wilkerson, and he'll be a good addition back to us on the practice squad, and we go from there.""

Quarterback Josh Allen was listed as limited on the injury report with his same foot injury and two others from the game against the Jaguars -- a knee injury and right finger injury.

""I feel good. I feel good,"" Allen said. ""Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks on a ... I know it's a Tuesday for us, but on a Wednesday-type mindset.

Beal, who played for the New York Giants, was last seen near Virginia Beach in Virginia on July 12, 2025. He was 28 years old at the time he was reported missing but would now be 29.

According to details provided by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, which is a federal system for tracking people who have disappeared in the U.S., Beal's girlfriend was the last person to see him.

Beal's girlfriend reported that he borrowed her car and was supposed to head to work. Instead, she got a call from him a day later, with Beal reportedly saying that he was in Virginia Beach, but was headed home.

""Samuel has not been heard from or seen since the phone call,"" the NMUPS alert for him said.

Federal officials said they don't believe he brought anything with him to Virginia Beach other than the clothes he was wearing, some extra shoes and a wallet containing his credit card and driver's license.

When the vehicle was recovered in Virginia Beach by one of the girlfriend's family members, officials say, the family member found Beal's shoes and socks on the floor of the car along with some sand.

Virginia Beach is an oceanfront city in Virginia just north of the North Carolina border. It's unclear how far Beal drove to get to Virginia Beach, or how far it was from his work.

Beal's sister, Essence Zhane, shared a post on Facebook on Jan. 12 that included additional details about the case, urging anybody with info about the NFL player's disappearance to come forward.

In her post, Zhane included photos of a paid parking ticket for a beachfront lot in Virginia Beach with a timestamp from just before 6 p.m. on July 13.

""Tomorrow makes it 7 months since we’ve last heard from or seen my brother,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""We’ve done everything we could on our end to piece things together and at this point we’re in desperate need of support on all ends.""

Beal was selected by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2018 supplemental draft, and appeared in six games as a cornerback for the team.

His career with the NFL was cut short in the 2020 season when he opted out of playing because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to court documents, Beal was arrested in July 2020 during a traffic stop in Ohio, where he was charged with improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of marijuana. He was indicted a month later on the two weapons charges and initially entered a plea of not guilty. Beal eventually changed his plea to guilty in June 2021 and was placed on probation for a year.

This is the second time in as many years that Bland has had surgery on his foot. Todd Archer of ESPN said that Bland should be ready for the Cowboys’ offseason program, but the veteran cornerback’s focus is on training camp.

DaRon Bland played in 12 games this season, posting 73 tackles, three tackles for loss, and one interception. Before the start of the season, Bland signed a four-year, $92 million contract extension with the Cowboys. He was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 20 due to an injured foot.

In 2024, Bland played in just seven games because he suffered a stress fracture and began the season on injured reserve. He played in the team’s final seven games of the year and notched 41 tackles, five passes defended, one forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.

The Cowboys selected Brand in the fifth round of the 2022 NFL Draft. He had a breakout season in 2023, leading the NFL in interceptions (nine) and tying the NFL record for most interceptions returned for a touchdown in a season (five).

DaRon Bland reacts to signing a new contract with the Cowboys

Before the start of this season, Bland shared his reaction to getting a new contract with the Cowboys. “Kind of surprised, kind of a little bit dumbfounded,” Bland said, per Tommy Yarrish of DallasCowboys.com. “Couldn’t believe it, that I’m making that much and doing what I do.”

Bland also discussed finding a role with the Cowboys after joining the team in 2022. “Being patient and learning to grow, having that mindset that where I was at that point was not the end point, so just keep driving each day, take it day by day…” Bland said. Not many fifth-rounders get the opportunities that I had and be in this league and be able to do what I do, and I’m just thankful for the opportunity to keep being out here.”

Before joining the Cowboys, Bland played one season at Fresno State. In that season (2021), the 26-year-old tallied 45 tackles, two interceptions, and five passes defended.",https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2026/01/13155804/DaRon-Bland-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:13:19.488136

The number seven linebacker, Garret Wallow, had eleven tackles and a pass defensed.
The number six linebacker, Eric Kendricks, had ten and the game-sealing pass defensed.
This team can do what no one thinks they can, and let's hope they prove everyone wrong for another three games.","A few weeks ago, I wrote that the Niners are the grittiest team in the NFL. That could not have been truer on Sunday night.

Down their number one, number two, number three, and number four linebackers? Who cares? The number seven linebacker, Garret Wallow, had eleven tackles and a pass defensed. The number six linebacker, Eric Kendricks, had ten and the game-sealing pass defensed.

Though the defensive line produced little pressure, it forced numerous three-and-outs and held the Eagles to field goals, keeping the game close throughout.

Quarterback Brock Purdy, whom so many have disparaged over the years, made a few mistakes, one of them costly, but was lights out in the most important moment, avoiding sacks and rushing for a key first down on the game-winning drive.

I have written before that the way to tell a great player from an average player is by when they make mistakes. Purdy threw an interception at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Then he went 5-for-6 and threw a touchdown (and scrambled for a first down) when the game was on the line. Give me the interception early and the game-winner late over no interceptions and a string of incompletions when it matters.

The worst news of the game was the injury to star tight end George Kittle, who suffered a torn Achilles. This late in the year, it will likely keep him off the field for most of next season.

But faced with that loss, Kyle Shanahan did something unusual. Rather than simply shift to backup tight end Jake Tonges, who has been effective this year, he also used fullback Kyle Juszczyk the way he uses Kittle.

Philadelphia had never seen Juszczyk used in the passing game that extensively, and he made several key plays down the stretch, catching three passes on the last two touchdown drives.

The team also rallied around Kittle. McCaffrey was not alone in calling him the ""heart and soul of the team"" and told reporters the squad is ""going to play for him the rest of the way."" This is the attitude of a team that has faced adversity on a nearly weekly basis.

Perhaps Kendricks said it best when he related that when he got to the Niners in November, ""It was easy [to adjust to his supporting role] because everybody on this team is so unselfish. So it was just easy to come in and check [his] ego at the door and just get it done for the team to win.""

Before Kittle went down, the 49ers entered the game shorthanded on playmakers, but Demarcus Robinson played like a number one receiver, catching six balls for 111 yards and a touchdown. Jauan Jennings reprised his Super Bowl throw two years ago to hit McCaffrey for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.

Overall, the victory might not be on par with one of The Catch epics, but given all that this team has had to overcome, it was a memorable accomplishment. It was a game they had to win, and a performance they can take not only into the upcoming matchup with the Seahawks but even into next year.

This team can do what no one thinks they can, and let's hope they prove everyone wrong for another three games.",https://static.49erswebzone.com/v/bMmZxV/content/media/article/01b13d8efdb8fca4429cbd1d7c9fc7f2.jpg?social=true,N,,2026-01-14 02:00:10.034012

The only two Seahawks on the 53-man roster who sat out Tuesday’s practice were backup offensive tackle Josh Jones (knee) and backup linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder). Key special teams player Chazz Surratt (ankle), who missed the final six games of the regular season, was limited after being designated to return to practice off IR earlier in the day.

49ers’ injury report

The 49ers held a walkthrough on Tuesday, so their practice report is an estimation of what players would have done in a full practice.

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee) and 12-time Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) – neither of whom played in the 49ers’ Week 18 loss to Seattle on Jan. 3 – were both listed as limited. Pearsall has missed the 49ers’ past two games, including their wild card playoff win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. Williams returned from a one-game absence to play in the wild card game.

Four-time Pro Bowl linebacker Fred Warner (ankle), who has been on IR since mid-October, returned to practice as a limited participant. The 49ers are eyeing a potential return from Warner for the NFC Championship Game, if they’re able to get past Seattle.

Broncos coach Sean Payton pushed back on that notion after Tuesday's practice.

""I don't think so, I don't think so,"" Payton said when asked if there's a chance Jones will return this season.

Denver still has room for up to three players to be designated to return from IR this season. Two candidates to return for a potential AFC Championship game are center Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) and running back J.K. Dobbins (foot). Wattenberg and Jones worked on a sidefield during Tuesday's practice, according to the Denver Post's Parker Gabriel.

Coming off a first-round bye, the Broncos are in mostly good health as they prepare for Saturday's divisional showdown with the Buffalo Bills, who are dealing with a host of injuries.

Buffalo wide receiver Gabe Davis suffered a torn ACL on Sunday and safety Jordan Poyer (hamstring) has already been ruled out for the divisional round. The Bills took another hit on Tuesday when coach Sean McDermott announced that fellow receiver Tyrell Shavers also tore his ACL on Sunday, ending his season. McDermott said Shavers played 22 of the team's 34 second-half snaps after suffering the injury.

Buffalo is now left with just three healthy receivers on the active roster: Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks and Keon Coleman. Fortunately for the Bills, Curtis Samuel (elbow) returned to practice this week, opening his window to be activated from IR. Buffalo also has three WRs available on the practice squad.

Notably, the Bills released receiver Elijah Moore in October, and the Broncos signed him to their practice squad.

Patriots injury analysis: Wild card round

CB Carlton Davis III: When the Patriots came out of the two-minute warning in the second quarter, Davis was not in his usual position at outside cornerback. Instead, he was in the blue medical tent and shortly thereafter departed for the locker room. Announced as questionable to return with a toe injury, he ended up missing five defensive snaps before returning to start the second half. Davis did not show any obvious signs of discomfort before his exit, so it is unclear when exactly he injured his toe.

CB Christian Gonzalez: Breaking up a Justin Herbert pass attempt intended for Quentin Johnston, Gonzalez collided with the wide receiver on his way to the ground and was slow to get up afterwards. He did remain in the game for the next snap — another incompletion to set up a punt — but headed into the medical tent afterwards. From there, the Pro Bowl defender left the field for the locker room and was later announced as questionable to return with a head injury. He never came back out and shortly before the game ended was officially downgraded to out.

What this means for the Patriots

While Carlton Davis managed to return to the game and finish without any visible limitations, Christian Gonzalez is a massive question mark. As head coach Mike Vrabel noted on Monday, the Pro Bowler is in the league’s concussion protocol, and there is no timeline yet for his return.

Arguably New England’s best player on this side of the ball, Gonzalez missing any time in the lead-up to Sunday’s game, let alone the contest itself, would be a blow to the team’s defense. While Houston’s offense is not in the upper echelon in terms of productivity and scoring potential, it features some high-end receiving talent led by wide receivers Nico Collins and Christian Kirk.

Having Gonzalez available against that pair and the rest of Houston’s defense would be a massive plus. For now, however, uncertainty reigns.

Wednesday will mark the first key date in that regard, and when it comes to finding out which other Patriots are nursing injuries or illness after the wild card round.

""Again, we're not doing much [in practice], so he'll walk through out there with us today and things like that.
As Shanahan pointed out, the 49ers will not be doing much on-field or full-speed work this week as they prepare for the Seahawks.
Shanahan said Tuesday that Warner hasn't been pushing him behind the scenes to return earlier, at least not verbally.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Linebacker Fred Warner took a significant step toward a potential playoff return as the San Francisco 49ers began preparations for Saturday's showdown with the Seattle Seahawks.

The Niners opened Warner's 21-day practice window on Tuesday, clearing the path for him to possibly be available for the NFC Championship Game after dislocating and fracturing his right ankle in a loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Oct. 12.

""We're opening his window, so he can do some stuff like that,"" coach Kyle Shanahan said. ""Again, we're not doing much [in practice], so he'll walk through out there with us today and things like that. But hoping he can be ready for next week.""

As Shanahan pointed out, the 49ers will not be doing much on-field or full-speed work this week as they prepare for the Seahawks. It is the third time in four weeks that the Niners have played with less than a full week's worth of rest.

That means Warner will not get a chance to do much aside from walk-throughs, but since Tuesday is 26 days from the Super Bowl, it made sense to open his practice window now because the season is going to end close to when his 21 days would end, and the Niners would have to decide whether to activate him.

Warner said on ""The Ryen Russillo Show"" this week that he is ""ready whenever they're ready,"" adding that he's ""pushing, training hard"" and ""back doing full football drills.""

Warner was spotted last Thursday doing some drills on a side field for the first since the injury and then posted some footage of him going through drills on his Instagram account.

Shanahan said Tuesday that Warner hasn't been pushing him behind the scenes to return earlier, at least not verbally.

""That's not Fred's style totally,"" Shanahan said. ""He does that by showing how hard he's working on the side and knows that we're watching.""

Warner has been on injured reserve since mid-October and missed the final 12 games of the regular season as well as Sunday's NFC wild-card win against the Philadelphia Eagles. And while he is trending in a positive direction, he still has plenty of steps to clear medically before he can play again this season.

""I approach it by what doctors tell me,"" Shanahan said. ""I'm like Fred; if he feels good and tells me he's good, I'm probably going to think he's good and trust him to get out there. But you can't always think with your heart and emotionally, so you ask doctors where he's at -- all the things that these guys have to pass, just protocols that we have in, just sprinting and jumping and things like that. And he's got to hit all those before we feel safe.""

Elsewhere on the injury front, 49ers tight end George Kittle is scheduled to have surgery Wednesday for his torn right Achilles and will go on injured reserve this week.

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall, who has missed the past two games with knee and ankle injuries, is slated to be a limited participant in Tuesday's walk-through with the same designation for left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), defensive linemen Keion White (groin, hamstring) and Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) and guard Dominick Puni (ankle).",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0320%2Fr1466603_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 18:01:57.637465

Franchise stability (8): Tomlin deserves most of the credit for the stability over the past 19 seasons.
Roster talent (6): The skill player talent is there, with Skattebo and Malik Nabers giving Dart something to work with on offense.
Roster talent (5): Pro Football Focus had Miami’s offensive line ranked 30th and defensive line ranked 31st this past year.","The Arizona Cardinals need a head coach after firing Jonathan Gannon. During their last coaching search, the rest of the NFL job openings were snapped up before Arizona could land on its hire of Gannon.

Ultimately, this process comes down to selling yourself to a pool of candidates who have a decent bit of leverage. If other teams have more appealing situations, you might miss.

Or you take a risk on pursuing a candidate nobody else is, something that ended up happening with the Gannon hire — because of timing at least.

How enticing is Arizona’s job opening? Quarterback Kyler Murray appears to be on the way out. The roster-building under general manager Monti Ossenfort has been happening for three years with mixed results. What do the other gigs have that Arizona does not?

To do this in an organized way, we’re giving each team’s quarterback situation, franchise stability and roster talent a rating from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best-case scenario. And then we’re ranking the job in terms of desirability based on the totals.

We went through this exercise on Jan. 6, the day after the regular season ended, when six teams had openings.

There are now nine total openings NFL-wide after Mike Tomlin stepped down from his post with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Spoilers: The Cardinals will not be at the front of the line if the top candidates have multiple options.

Ranking the NFL’s head-coaching openings by QB situation, stability and roster talent

1. Baltimore Ravens (John Harbaugh fired)

Total: 25

QB situation (9 out of 10): Lamar Jackson appears to be very involved in the head-coaching search, which is probably good news for any coach who wants the job.

Franchise stability (9): Six finishes atop the AFC North in Harbaugh’s 2008-25 reign is pretty good. A Super Bowl XLVII win and three more AFC Championship Game appearances make for a lot of winning, too. Executive vice president and general manager Eric DeCosta has been with the team since 1996 and took over as the guy in charge in 2019. That screams stability.

Roster talent (7): The offensive and defensive lines need work, but you have great starting points with Zay Flowers coming off his best season yet and Derrick Henry remaining a beast with 1,595 rushing yards at 32 years old. Linebacker Roquan Smith and safety Kyle Hamilton are earning their large paychecks on defense to give stability behind a presumably reshuffled defensive line.

2. Pittsburgh Steelers (Mike Tomlin stepped down)

Total: 17

QB situation (3): Pittsburgh navigated a weird wait for Aaron Rodgers to sign with them last offseason, and it appears that having a new coach incoming does not make that scenario optimal if Rodgers is going to be wishy-washy about whether he wants to play football or consume jungle foliage while locked in a lightless room. Mason Rudolph is the backup, and there’s just a No. 21 pick to seek a QB of the future in the draft.

Franchise stability (8): Tomlin deserves most of the credit for the stability over the past 19 seasons. Double-digit wins were commonplace, after all, but five Wild Card losses in the past six years made it time. Similar to the Ravens’ situation, general manager Omar Khan has only been in charge of the whole thing since 2022 but has been part of the franchise dating back to 2001. He gets to make his first head-coaching hire with all that organizational knowledge in mind.

Roster talent (7): Other than quarterback, the roster isn’t in bad shape and neither are the books. Top-end talent on both sides of the ball begins with D.K. Metcalf and Jaylen Warren on offense, with a defense with very productive starters in T.J. Watt, Cam Heyward, Joey Porter Jr., Payton Wilson and Patrick Queen. The defense should be set up nicely, and then it’s on Khan to figure out the signal caller and how to protect him and add to the skill slots.

3. New York Giants (fired Brian Daboll)

Total: 16

QB situation (7): Jaxson Dart’s emergence was a breath of fresh air for a franchise struggling to build confidence among its fan base, and he produced with 2,272 yards, 63.7% accuracy and 15 touchdowns to five picks — plus nine rushing scores.

His bro-nection with Arizona State product Cam Skattebo gives the team easy-to-root-for leaders, so long as both remain healthy. Concussion issues cropped up for Dart a handful of times. A new head coach must connect with them.

We are pretty sure Dart is a guy to build around.

Franchise stability (3): General manager Joe Schoen is 22-45-1 with a single playoff appearance since he joined the team. This is probably his last chance to get it right.

Beyond that, the Giants have had a single winning season since 2016. Schoen, at present, is most well-known for giving a reason to let very good running back Saquon Barkley walk, while being filmed for Hard Knocks. Not great awareness.

Roster talent (6): The skill player talent is there, with Skattebo and Malik Nabers giving Dart something to work with on offense. Defensively, a front that includes Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns, Kayvon Thibodeaux and Abdul Carter is the strength of the roster.

New York’s offensive line needs a reboot, and what’s behind the defensive line needs it, too.

The Giants have the No. 5 pick.

T-4. Atlanta Falcons (fired Raheem Morris)

Total: 15

QB situation (3): Have we ruled out Michael Penix Jr. as a franchise quarterback? Probably? I guess? That’s generous, even if you get over his many seasons dating back to college that ended with a serious knee injury. And he’ll miss the start of next season with a knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably gone. Atlanta doesn’t have a first-round pick, so the options don’t look excellent at the moment.

Franchise stability (6): If we’re going by purely reputation, the Falcons have the best among the teams with head-coaching openings. They’ve just failed to get out of the mediocre zone since the 2017 season and Matt Ryan era. More decent news: A first-year general manager will be replacing Terry Fontenot, so this coach will be tied to whomever that guy is.

Roster talent (6): Eight wins is still eight wins, a sign this team wasn’t lacking in talent to a huge degree. Running back Bijan Robinson is whom the offense will revolve around. But among the questions is tight end Kyle Pitts, who finally appeared to figure it out and led the team with 928 receiving yards. He’s a free agent if they don’t franchise-tag him.

Leading tackler and linebacker Kaden Elliss, plus backup running back Tyler Allgeier, are free agents as well.

This team won four games to end the year, some against very good playoff squads.

T-4. Tennessee Titans (fired Brian Callahan)

Total: 15

QB situation (7): Rookie first overall pick Cam Ward took a beating playing for a team that had no clear No. 1 receiver. He and the Raiders’ Geno Smith tied for the NFL lead with 55 sacks taken, but at least the touchdown-to-pick ratio (15 to seven) wasn’t terrible. Ward’s arm talent gave Titans fans something to look forward to at least, but consecutive three-win seasons speak to the roster talent issues in Tennessee.

Franchise stability (4): It looks a little worse now that former head coach Mike Vrabel, who left in 2023, is doing so well so quickly with the New England Patriots. Maybe that is just about optics and timing, where he saw the end of the Ryan Tannehill era, and quarterback prospects Will Levis and Malik Willis didn’t pan out.

Some more weird optics: Owner Amy Adams Strunk clarified this week that GM Mike Borgonzi will run the 53-man roster and coaching staff, while president of football operations Chad Brinker will do the other stuff. Better late than never to clarify job descriptions, I suppose.

Roster talent (4): There’s no No. 1 receiver but plenty of No. 2 or No. 3 options. The Titans have running back Tony Pollard under contract and a defense bolstered by tackle Jeffery Simmons. Holding the No. 4 pick, Tennessee could use a difference-making wideout, a defensive back or linebacker.

The Titans have the cash to spend big in free agency as well. Shoring up the offensive line will need to be done with that cash.

T-6. Miami Dolphins (Mike McDaniel fired)

Total: 14

QB situation (4): Tua Tagovailoa is under contract for three more years and eating up $56.4 million next season. His contract is hard to dump before the 2026 season with so much guaranteed money. Does any coaching candidate think they can piece together a quality first season on the job with the 27-year-old who struggled with a bottom-third QBR and concussion issues this past season?

Franchise stability (5): The Dolphins hired former Packers executive Jon-Eric Sullivan to run the team, which before McDaniel was on a run of blah coaching hires, including Brian Flores (2019-21) and Adam Gase (2016-18).

Roster talent (5): Pro Football Focus had Miami’s offensive line ranked 30th and defensive line ranked 31st this past year. Problem: They are last on this list of teams needing a new coach in projected cap space entering the offseason with the NFL’s fourth-fewest dollars to spend. Cutting receiver Tyreek Hill, who is accounting for $52 million on the cap sheet next season and ended 2025 with an ACL injury, would open up more than $23 million in space.

T-6. Cleveland Browns (fired Kevin Stefanski)

Total: 14

QB situation (4): Deshaun Watson began practicing on the field toward the end of the year and makes $80.7 million coming off a foot injury. He has played 19 whole games since 2022, and we are unsure if he is worth a quarter of that price tag, even if we skip over the sexual assault allegations that we absolutely cannot skip over.

Rookies Dillon Gabriel (937 yards, seven touchdowns, two picks, 80.8 passer rating) and Shedeur Sanders (1,400 yards, seven touchdowns, 10 picks, 68.1 passer rating) might have burned two 2024 draft picks to answer the backup quarterback question. Sanders did look like he had a leap toward the end of the year, and the Browns at least have options in-house.

Franchise stability (3): Did you read the section above? The only good news here is that the Browns live in a division of mediocrity, with the Steelers and Ravens underachieving until the end and the Cincinnati Bengals getting six wins despite the past offseason financial efforts to keep their quarterback-receiver talent intact.

Roster talent (6): Myles Garrett is still awesome! There are some talented pieces elsewhere, with rookie linebacker Carson Schwesinger piling up 156 tackles in a season.

Offensively, running back Quinshon Judkins had a strong rookie year — it also came with a domestic assault allegation that led to no charges — as did tight end Harold Fannin Jr. But nearly the entire starting offensive line is entering free agency, and the receiver group need major upgrading.

Defensive tackle Mason Graham, last year’s No. 5 pick, had some meh basic numbers but still projects to be a talented interior force.

Cleveland owns the No. 6 pick and a late-first via the Jaguars.

8. Arizona Cardinals (fired Jonathan Gannon)

Total: 13

QB situation (4): Give this a bump if you feel somewhere in your heart that Kyler Murray could return and a new coach could optimize him. That seems out of touch with reality, where a bridge has probably been burnt and at this point in his career, he is what he is.

Owning the No. 3 pick gives the Cardinals a shot to draft a quarterback if one of the Raiders or Jets gets the ick and, best-case, only one quarterback is off the board. That seems unlikely. Reality appears that Arizona would be taking the third quarterback off the board in a draft where even the top two options are shrug-worthy.

Jacoby Brissett is under contract and could be a bridge quarterback, whether or not Arizona drafts the future option.

Franchise stability (4): Ossenfort’s press conference explaining the firing of Gannon became a test to see if he could defend his drafting and roster-building duties that were, of course, undercut by the injury bug. He enters his fourth year with a roster that hasn’t seen drastic talent improvement in three years on the job.

Roster talent (5): In Ossenfort’s defense, the injury-hit youngsters could get healthy and back on track. That is where there’s a good chance the roster talent isn’t as bad as the other teams on this list. There are plenty of in-house options who will have an opportunity to take starting jobs at positions like cornerback, linebacker and along the defensive line.

Trey Benson at running back, wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. has shown enough flashes if you put his draft position aside and Michael Wilson shocked the league with a huge Year 3 leap. Josh Sweat made the big spending worth it at edge.

Draft to bulk up the offensive line, attack the WR market in free agency to be sure about the depth in that group and you can sell us on a competitive team returning.

But a coach taking this gig must understand he’s potentially living without a franchise quarterback for a year.

9. Las Vegas Raiders (fired Pete Carroll)

Total: 11

QB situation (5*): Big asterisk here. The QB situation could swing a couple different ways. Starting quarterback Geno Smith is under contract, and the numbers weren’t dreadful. But Las Vegas has the No. 1 pick, and you’d think that is used on a quarterback so long as the evaluators led by (certainly not minority owner Tom Brady) general manager John Spytek like the options of college QBs Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore.

If not, that is an unfortunate spot to be in.

Franchise stability (3): Aside from Jon Gruden’s 22-31 run from 2018-21, owner Mark Davis and the Raiders have not had a head coach last longer than three seasons since — scrolling, scrolling, scrolling — Jon Gruden in 1998-2001.

Roster talent (3): Is Maxx Crosby on this team next year? It would appear that the team ticked him off by shutting him down against his will to secure the No. 1 pick in the draft. Hopefully, that answers our question about whether they like a quarterback in this draft class.

There is some fun talent like tight end Brock Bowers (680 receiving yards, seven touchdowns) and rookie running back Ashton Jeanty (975 rushing yards, 10 total touchdowns).

How would you grade the Patriots’ performance in the playoff opener?","The New England Patriots were able to exorcise some playoff demons. After going one-and-done in each of their last two appearances, they finally earned a victory again. Beating the visiting Los Angeles Chargers with a final score of 16-3, they won their first postseason game since the 2018 season and are now on their way to a divisional round meeting with the Houston Texans.

Before our attention turns to that game, let’s tie up some loose ends from the contest that was — a process that will give us some clarity of where the team needs to improve moving forward.

Patriots position grades from NFL wild card playoffs

Quarterback: Appearing in his first playoff game at 23 and with 29 career starts under his belt, Drake Maye looked a bit more jittery than usual. Whether it was the moment or the opposing defense, he started relatively slowly and had some plays he likely would want back — including an interception and a pair of fumbles while trying to make something out of nothing. Those were some uncharacteristically negative plays for the MVP candidate, but he also showed why he is deserving of that label. Maye made hay of some openings to finish with 69 rushing yards while his touchdown pass to Hunter Henry was as good as it gets. | Grade: B+

Running back: Rhamondre Stevenson continues to be a weapon for the Patriots, becoming just the third player in franchise history on Sunday to finish a postseason game with more than 50 yards both as a receiver and a runner. The veteran accumulated a combined 128 yards on 13 touches, despite New England’s blocking not always being up to par. Fellow running back TreVeyon Henderson was less actively featured, but still added 36 yards on 10 combined carries and catches and had a key blitz pickup on Maye’s touchdown pass to Henry. | Grade: A

Wide receiver: The Chargers dared the Patriots to beat man coverage on critical downs, and it proved to be a problem. Part of it was receivers getting open on a consistent basis, part of it was drops by both Stefon Diggs and DeMario Douglas. Against the Texans next Sunday, both will have to improve. It wasn’t all bad for the wideouts, though. Kayshon Boutte once again showcased his big-play abilities en route to a 66-yard outing, while Kyle Williams had a big blog on Rhamondre Stevenson’s 48-yard catch and run that helped set up the first field goal of the day. Efton Chism was quiet, but did catch a 20-yard pass on that same field goal drive. | Grade: C+

Tight end: Hunter Henry continues to be one of the Patriots’ most reliable performers, and he managed to haul in three passes for 64 yards and a touchdown against his former team. He also continued to look good as a run blocker, something that cannot be fully said about Austin Hooper. While New England’s second tight end had some tough moments and saw a would-be touchdown sail over his head, FB/TE-hybrid Jack Westover caught his first career pass for a gain of 8 yards | Grade: B+

Offensive line: Together for the first time since early November, the Patriots’ starting looked rusty at times. While Garrett Bradbury and Mike Onwenu fared mostly well at center and right guard, and right tackle Morgan Moses was stout in pass protection against a very good edge group, the left side was an issue. Tackle Will Campbell was driven back on multiple occasions, especially early on in the game, and failed to keep Odafe Oweh off of Drake Maye on his lost fumble in the early third quarter; guard Jared Wilson had several uneven moments as well in his debut after missing back-to-back games with a concussion. Both did get better as the game went on, and one would be remiss to mention that they are still rookies, but the Patriots need them to do better — and fast given what awaits. | Grade: C

Defensive line: It took the Patriots’ defensive line a while to get going, but once it did it was game over for the Chargers. Led by seven pressures each from K’Lavon Chaisson and Cory Durden, the group disrupted Justin Herbert on 56.8% of his dropbacks and sacked him six times. On one of those takedowns, Chaisson forced a fumble that was recovered by teammate Christian Elliss; on another, Milton Williams put the nail in the coffin in the late fourth quarter. Scramble lane integrity was a bit uneven, but the outing against both the pass and the non-scramble run definitively what the team had in mind when it opened the checkbook to bring players like Williams, Chaisson and Harold Landry to town in the offseason. | Grade: A-

Linebacker: With Robert Spillane returning from a four-game absence and immediately playing 100% of snaps again, the Patriots linebacker group finally had all hands on deck again. It looked the part. Spillane, Christian Ellis and, to a lesser degree Jack Gibbens and Jahlani Tavai, were integral to New England’s pressure-heavy game plan and efforts to make Los Angeles’ offense one-dimensional. The group’s ability to come down from the second level to shut down gaps against the run and finish tackles in open space was crucial. | Grade: A

Cornerback: Before he departed with a head injury in the early fourth quarter, Christian Gonzalez played like he had a score to settle with those who opted not to vote him to the All-Pro team this year. He was outstanding, erasing whoever he was going up against. Fellow starters Carlton Davis and Marcus Jones also played a very good game, with the former bouncing back from an uneven performance in the regular season finale and the latter making some of the low-key biggest plays of the game. All in all, the group managed to severely limit the impact a good L.A. wide receiver room could have had on the game. | Grade: A

Safety: Even though he likely would have had the 10-yard catch back he gave up against tight end Oronde Gadsden on a fourth-quarter fourth down, Craig Woodson played one of the better games of his rookie season on Sunday. He finished with a team-leading nine tackles and also had a tackle for loss, while fellow starter Jaylinn Hawkins swarmed all over the secondary to help prevent the Chargers from hitting anything deep. The safety group has not always played on the same level as the cornerbacks this year, but on Sunday there was no such drop-off. | Grade: A

Special teams: Mike Vrabel praised the Patriots for a “very clean game from a special teams perspective” on Sunday night, and there is nothing more to add. Led by Andy Borregales’ three field goals, which proved to be the extent of the scoring for most of the game, New England’s kicking game operation constantly seemed like the more consistent of the two. | Grade: A

Drake Maye summed up the Patriots’ outing versus the Chargers well during his postgame presser, when he said that “[t]hey had a great defense, a great quarterback. We were the better team tonight. We made plays when we needed to.” Ultimately, that is what matters — and will continue to do so with a big challenge coming up.

Rams head coach Sean McVay later revealed Stafford sustained a sprain to his finger but would be available for the divisional round game against the Chicago Bears. Stafford, meanwhile, told Jim Gray on the ""Let's Go!"" podcast that he doesn't have any concerns about his finger injury ahead of the critical playoff match.

“Hand is good. I'm not worried about it at all,"" he said. ""I was just throwing a ball over the middle to Puka [Nacua] and caught somebody's forearm. Just bent it way back.

This is great news for the Rams, as even a slightly injured Stafford could have forced McVay to adjust the game plan a bit. Stafford might be overselling his pain tolerance for the injury, but his confidence is a good sign that he'll be business as usual against the Bears.

At the very least, he'll have his full cadre of pass-catchers to utilize once more.

The shocking loss, in which the NFL’s most expensive defense forced three turnovers against Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud but ultimately fell by a 24-point margin, preceded the announcement that Mike Tomlin would be stepping down as Pittsburgh’s head coach after 19 seasons. The team made it official with a statement from team president Art Rooney II on Tuesday afternoon.

In addition to plenty of shakeups in the league’s coaching carousel — currently sitting with nine head coaching vacancies — it was a record-setting wild-card round. This round marked the first time in NFL history that four-plus games were decided by four or fewer points in a single postseason round, per Opta Stats; it’s also the first time there have been six-plus fourth-quarter lead changes in a single playoff round in NFL history, Dante Koplowitz-Fleming of NFL research noted.

The Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers opened things up with a surprising thriller; after LA entered the week as historic road favorites, its 34-31 win over Carolina came down to the wire as MVP favorite Matthew Stafford threw a 19-yard, go-ahead touchdown to tight end Colby Parkinson in the final minute of the game. The Panthers got bad news on top of the loss, as starting left tackle Ikem Ekwonu reportedly suffered a ruptured patellar tendon, which could affect his availability next season.

That was followed by another Saturday thriller, as Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears mounted yet another comeback win — this time, over their NFC North rival, the Green Bay Packers — to advance to the divisional round. The Packers were off to a 21-3 lead in the first half before the Bears dropped 25 points in the fourth quarter to take the win.

On Sunday, the magic continued with the Josh Allen-led Buffalo Bills defeating Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars, ending Liam Coen’s Cinderella-esque first season as a head coach. After Allen managed a rushing touchdown after the two-minute warning (right after the best tush push ever, perhaps?), a perfectly timed interception from Bills safety Cole Bishop put Allen in position to kneel it out and snag the team’s first road playoff win in 33 years.

The San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles followed that up with another game that came down to the wire, as the Niners dethroned Philly with a late fourth-quarter touchdown drive (and some trickery from wideout Jauan Jennings). Despite the thrilling win, the Niners will have to deal with yet another brutal blow on the injury front, as All-Pro tight end George Kittle suffered a torn Achilles injury, ending his season.

Despite holding Drake Maye to just one touchdown, the Los Angeles Chargers couldn’t muster up enough offense to take down the New England Patriots. Los Angeles failed to score a touchdown during the contest, losing 16-3 and inviting questions over whether the Chargers’ coaching staff needs to be shaken up over the offseason.

More on the Seattle Seahawks","RENTON, Wash. (AP) — Ahead of the Seattle Seahawks’ first home playoff game in five years, and their first in front of fans since 2017, their top two coordinators each spent the end of last week interviewing for jobs elsewhere.

What national voices are saying about Sam Darnold

Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons and Miami Dolphins for their head coaching vacancies, while defensive coordinator Aden Durde did the same with the Falcons and Cleveland Browns. But Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald wasn’t worried about his assistants’ focus on their jobs ahead of Seattle’s matchup with the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday.

The Seahawks had a bye as the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and Kubiak and Durde did their interviews on days the team was off.

“It worked out well that they had the two days off and they could kind of shift their focus,” Macdonald said. “Once it’s over, then that’s over and we’re able to move forward. So really fortunate we had the bye.”

Last week’s practices, he said, consisted mostly of self-scouting and working ahead on potential playoff opponents. Now, Seattle has turned its focus to San Francisco, which ended Philadelphia’s bid for a Super Bowl repeat with a 23-19 victory on Sunday.

“I think just watching it live, it was just an incredibly resilient win,” Macdonald said of the 49ers. “I mean, the team has a lot of character. They’re really tough. You know, but really it’s nothing new with these guys. It’s what you know. But it’s a heck of a win. Tough place to go and play and get a win.”

Arroyo and Bryant could return

Both tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee) and safety Coby Bryant (knee) are expected to practice this week. Arroyo, who missed the final four games of the regular season and landed on injured reserve, returned to practice last week and could play Saturday.

“Elijah is looking good,” Macdonald said. “He’s a possibility about coming back for this game.”

Bryant missed the Seahawks’ last two games with a knee injury. Left tackle Charles Cross, who signed a four-year contract extension last week, is expected to be back in the starting lineup. Cross missed the last three games with a hamstring injury.

That's the reality for the 49ers in what has been an injury-riddled season for almost everyone involved. George Kittle is the latest to suffer a major injury, which will sideline him for the remainder of the postseason and beyond.

The 32-year-old star tight end suffered a torn Achilles during the Niners' wild-card weekend win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Kittle now joins a list that already includes Nick Bosa, Fred Warner and Brandon Aiyuk, among others.

While his team sets their sights on the divisional round, Kittle is now staring down a long road of rehab before getting back on the field again.

San Francisco has been tested time and time again this season. Now they'll have to deal with losing the heart and soul leader of the group.

Here's a look at how long Kittle could be sidelined.

What happened to George Kittle?

Kittle suffered a torn Achilles during the second quarter of the 49ers' wild-card weekend win over the Eagles.

The star tight end addressed the injury on Jan. 12 in an Instagram post.

""Football sucks sometimes,"" Kittle wrote. ""But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. Cheers, all my love.""

There wasn't much doubt about the injury for Kittle, who saw his season promptly come to an end after a 6-yard catch.

""The trainers knew before the cart came out,"" head coach Kyle Shanahan said after the game. ""They got word to me in the headset.""

Kittle has been no stranger to injuries this season, having already missed time with hamstring issues and an ankle ailment.

From a contractual standpoint, the star tight end just inked a new four-year, $76.4 million extension in April 2025 to extend his stay in the Bay Area through the 2029 season.

George Kittle injury updates

Kittle suffered a torn Achilles and is out for the remainder of the season.

It was quickly confirmed after the star was carted off the field, bypassing the typical ""questionable"" designation that most players earn.

Kittle's exit came after his only catch of the game, which resulted in a 6-yard gain. The 49ers were trailing 13-7.

How long is George Kittle out?

Kittle is out for the remainder of the 49ers' postseason and figures to miss a large portion, if not all, of the 2026 season as well.

A torn Achilles typically carries a recovery timeline of about 9-to-12 months, which would put Kittle's return in mid-Oct. at the earliest if he had surgery immediately after the injury. Given that Kittle would've missed offseason activities, training camp and the preseason, it's unlikely he would be thrown right back into action without any ramping up.

The timeline isn't favorable to Kittle for the 2026 season, meaning his next game might not come until the 2027 season, when he'll be 34.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/12/USAT/88151069007-george-kittle-011226.jpg?crop=2177,1224,x1788,y574&width=2177&height=1224&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-13 15:04:00.639325

Kittle, who has been named a first-team All-Pro twice, missed several games this season with a hamstring injury he suffered in the Week 1 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. He didn’t return until the 49ers’ Week 7 game against the Falcons on Oct. 19.

49ers All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams said he was in “disbelief” after Kittle was injured. “He’s like Superman around here.”

Fullback Kyle Juszczyk was emotional about Kittle’s injury in a postgame interview with CBS Sports, his voice cracking at times.

“It’s tough, man. It sucks, but I know he definitely would be happy with the win,” Juszczyk said. “Like he said to me at halftime, he’s not dead. He’s going to be all right.

The matchup is thanks to the San Francisco 49ers beating the Philadelphia Eagles 23-19 over the weekend. The 49ers are heading to Lumen Field to face the Seattle Seahawks.

The Rams took down the Carolina Panthers 34-31 after a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown passes from Stafford. Chicago just had another insane 4th quarter comeback of its own after being down 21-6.

After going into halftime with a 21-3 deficit, the Bears allowed the Green Bay Packers to score six points and put up 28 of their own in the second half for a 31-27 win.

Sunday's game will be the first time the Rams and Bears have played since last season. Chicago got a 24-18 win over Los Angeles in that game.

He's as tough as it gets, and we'll be good to go.""

Playing with this injury could be a big-time risk for Stafford and the Rams. If the veteran quarterback does play, there's a chance it would inhibit his ability to throw the football and have him at less than 100%.

There is also the added factor of playing in the cold environment at Soldier Field. Since Chicago is the higher seed, it will host the game.

Throughout Stafford's career, he is 1-9 in games with cold temperatures. The quarterback has thrown 14 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in those conditions. For reference, it's going to be just under 10 degrees in Chicago at game time on Sunday.

49ers at Seahawks Like the Bills, the 49ers are playing on six days rest against an opponent who got the week off.
The Seahawks absolutely dominated the 49ers' offensive line in the game that decided the No.
But the injuries to Trapilo and Edwards have me less confident the Bears will find a way to win the game.","Survive and advance is the name of the game in the NFL playoffs, and while six teams pulled it off on Super Wild Card Weekend, survive is a relative term for key players on the teams that advanced. Whether it was ACL or Achilles tears, concussions or even just a star QB playing through a finger injury, no team made it out of the wild-card round unscathed.

The Rams lost starting corner Ahkello Witherspoon for the rest of the playoffs, but the main focus was around Matthew Stafford's finger injury, which seemed to affect the MVP candidate for a portion of the win over the Panthers. Postgame X-rays on the finger were negative, and considering he finished the game, I'm not expecting him to miss any time.

The Bears pulled out the win against the rival Packers but lost left tackle Ozzy Trapilo and linebacker T.J. Edwards to season-ending injuries. The former solidified the blindside protection for Caleb Williams after taking over the role, so Trapilo's injury has a chance to be one of the more impactful from the wild-card round. Edwards is a key component in the middle of the defense as well.

The Bills relied on Josh Allen's heroics to gut out a win over the Jaguars but lost Gabe Davis to a torn ACL and Jordan Poyer to a hamstring injury that will likely keep him out against Denver. Dalton Kincaid was also in a boot after the game but the situation was labeled precautionary; we'll see how much that's true as practice reports come out throughout the week.

The 49ers cannot catch a break with injuries, losing star tight end George Kittle to a torn Achilles in the win over the Eagles. Kittle is the most complete tight end in the league, and while the team managed to survive his stint on IR earlier in the season, this latest injury plus the absences on defense could be what finally ends their run against a rested Seattle team.

The Patriots were up next, shutting down the Chargers offense en route to a low-scoring win, but star corner Christian Gonzalez picked up a head injury during the game. His placement in the concussion protocol means his status for the matchup with the Texans is in question.

The Texans closed out the weekend with a dominant win over the Steelers but lost their own star on the offensive side of the ball to a concussion as well. Nico Collins has one less day of recovery to get ready to face New England after playing on Monday, and the calculus of the matchup changes if one or both of Collins and Gonzalez can't go.

With all the injuries, the biggest winners of the wild-card round may be the teams that didn't play. The Seahawks and Broncos didn't lose any key players over the weekend, and each could have a player return from IR as Denver linebacker Drew Sanders and Seattle tight end Elijah Arroyo seem to be tracking toward playing this weekend. Other key players who could be back for wild-card winners include Bills defensive tackle Ed Oliver, Rams guard Kevin Dotson and 49ers receiver Ricky Pearsall.

I'll have my spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to access all my picks as they're made throughout the week and hopefully take advantage of some good line value. For now, let's dive into our betting power ratings and then take a look at what the spread should be for every divisional-round game.

Divisional round power ratings

The Broncos and Seahawks get a half-point bump for the rest advantage they enjoyed by not playing last week, but I'm also bumping up the Rams with the expectation Stafford is fine and Dotson's potential return matters more than the loss of Witherspoon.

I moved the Patriots up a full point due in large part to a defense that got back Milton Williams, Robert Spillane and Harold Landry over the last two weeks. Playcaller Zak Kuhr also had a fantastic game in the win over the Chargers, and that ability to keep the offense guessing could give New England as good a defensive unit as the other teams left on the AFC side of the bracket but with a higher offensive ceiling.

I was thoroughly impressed by the Bills' defensive effort as well, and we'll see how much of that is repeatable this week and how much was chalked up to abysmal decision-making by Trevor Lawrence. I'm keeping them where I had them in my ratings, as I felt I was already being pretty aggressive with the best-case scenario for Allen's health.

The Texans don't get a bump either, even though they dominated the box score, and that's because of both the Collins injury and how careless C.J. Stroud was with the ball in the win. It ended up not mattering, but you can't outplay a team by that much and only hold a 7-6 halftime lead, counting on your defense to score to win a game.

I knocked the 49ers down due to the Kittle injury and to not fully buying into the play of the defense after how easy the Eagles' playcalling made it for them. I probably could've done the same with the Bears but decided as the low man on the table I'd just keep them where I have them.

Let's take a quick look at each game's spread projection

Bills at Broncos

I understand why the Bills opened as favorites once again, as so much gets attributed to the quarterback position, but once again I feel like the completeness of the Denver roster plus home-field advantage should make them clear favorites in this game. My spread projection is Broncos -3.5.

Last week, we saw late movement push the Jaguars to 2-point favorites by game day, and after seeing where this spread opened I felt like we were in line for the same movement. That may be happening early, as I see the Broncos as slight favorites on the money line at some books as of Tuesday morning. The rest advantage may play a huge factor here as well.

49ers at Seahawks

Like the Bills, the 49ers are playing on six days rest against an opponent who got the week off. However, San Francisco also lost a major part of their team with Kittle's torn Achilles. My projections make this Seahawks -7.5, so I agree with the market move that has pushed it up from an opener of 7 at many books.

The Seahawks absolutely dominated the 49ers' offensive line in the game that decided the No. 1 seed in Week 18, but San Francisco didn't have left tackle Trent Williams that day, and he may be the most valuable player in football (even if the award always goes to a quarterback). His presence gives the line a fighting chance, but we'll see what impact the Kittle injury has on the rest of the offense and whether the defense can replicate its effort from last week.

Texans at Patriots

This line opened at Patriots -2.5 at most books but is likely to quickly settle at 3. My projected spread would be a decent bit higher, as I have the Patriots as 2.5 points better on a neutral field and 5-point favorites in Foxborough.

The outdoor environment seemed to affect Stroud in the win over the Steelers, with just one successful offensive drive that resulted in points until the fourth quarter when the Houston defense had let the air out of Pittsburgh. This should be a tougher test for the Texans against a Patriots offense that isn't as likely to be turned into mush by Houston's excellent defensive unit.

Rams at Bears

This is actually a pretty significant line considering the Bears have had a quality home-field advantage in recent years, but my gap between the teams would actually make it Rams -4 based on ratings.

I wanted to love the Bears this week due to their ability to generate turnovers on defense, which we've seen Matthew Stafford struggle with in the Rams' losses down the stretch. But the injuries to Trapilo and Edwards have me less confident the Bears will find a way to win the game.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/13/83ac7ecd-297f-4d84-baf1-32683c883008/thumbnail/1200x675/d3afa37923030ebf5b5940d7fd235ba5/george-kittle-49ers-injury.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 18:02:02.606232

Position-by-position breakdowns

Quarterbacks

I think it’d be a mistake for Oregon’s Dante Moore to declare. The game against Indiana showed he needs more playing experience. Plus, is that really the way you want to end your college career? He will undoubtedly be well compensated for playing another season of college football. I hope the people advising him are focusing on what gives him the best chance to have a long and successful pro career and not what’s best to ‘game’ the draft and take advantage of a weak class.

Should Moore remain at Oregon, Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza is going to be the #1 overall pick. He deserves a lot of respect for his 2025 season. However, I don’t personally believe he deserves a first round grade, let alone going first overall.

Physically he is good not great — both in terms of arm talent and improv. He doesn’t operate under center and benefits a lot from a scheme that is about as well coached as you’ll ever see in college football. The abundance of back-shoulder throws won’t be readily there at the next level and he will need to challenge more into tight windows over the middle and deliver downfield. His footwork also needs cleaning up after his initial read isn’t open.

Before the Oregon game he only ranked 13th for EPA in college football — which speaks to the Indiana environment meshing with his talent and consistency. I think the challenge for the Raiders, if they select him, will be to create a dynamic and brilliant offensive scheme. Mendoza is not a physical marvel waiting to take the league by storm (although his accuracy, poise and the way he’s elevated Indiana this year all should be noted).

Vegas need an inspired offensive-minded Head Coach to lead from the front and set out a clearly defined system. If they do this, Mendoza can thrive within structure and they’ll make the most out of the positive aspects he delivers — including his obvious dedication to his craft. He is not a rare franchise saviour who can revolutionise a franchise with individual brilliance though.

If Trinidad Chambliss (Ole Miss) fails in his court case to gain another year of eligibility, I think he could be a fascinating prospect. He made plays out of structure for Ole Miss that were very interesting.

There isn’t a quarterback in this class I would draft in round one. If I were a team needing to select a quarterback, I would be pitching to the owner why we had to wait and would offer veteran solutions for the short term. Some owners won’t want to hear that, of course.

I think there’s a chance Ty Simpson (Alabama) will find a home in the top-40 — potentially to a team like Minnesota who should be dipping back into the market. That feels like a good scheme fit. I would also be interested in Garrett Nussmeier (LSU) and Taylen Green (Arkansas) if they stick on the board. They are two players with obvious plus talent who for different reasons did not have the finish to 2025 they would’ve hoped for. There could be value in taking a shot on both with a low-risk pick later on.

Running backs

The position is led by Notre Dame’s Jeremiyah Love — a potential top-five pick with the potential to be the next dynamic runner in the NFL to go along with the James Cook, Jahmyr Gibbs, De’Von Achane type backs.

The more I’ve watched of the class though I just don’t think there’s a ton of value to be had early on. I really enjoyed watching Emmett Johnson (Nebraska) and Mike Washington Jr (Arkansas) but I think you have to cap their value at round three and believe they could be available later than that.

Johnson doesn’t have a majorly explosive looking lower half. His speed is good but he doesn’t have a second gear when he breaks free. He’s not a short-yardage power back. He’s agile and quick and makes plays in the passing game but he’s a 7.5/10 talent in college and probably a 5.5/10 at the next level.

Washington Jr collected yards after contact during his best spell of 2025 but his impact was limited by how often Arkansas had to play from behind. He dodges and weaves through tackles but doesn’t possess game-changing long-speed. He reminds me of Knile Davis, a third round pick from the same school in 2013.

Nicholas Singleton (Penn State) has bags of physical potential but his final year in college was a massive disappointment. You might be able to find a diamond here if you believe he has a lot more to offer. I think he does.

If you’re in the market for a really good running back next year, there’s one solution if you’re not in position to get Love early in round one. Call the Dolphins about Achane. I don’t think people realise just how good he is. A lot of people scoffed at a second round price tag at the trade deadline. With hindsight — I think a good team should’ve pulled the trigger:

Wide receivers

I think USC’s Makai Lemon will be the first receiver drafted and he should probably send Jaxon Smith-Njigba a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape when it happens. Lemon has a very similar frame and playing style. With JSN’s excellent year fresh in the minds of GM’s, don’t expect Lemon to last into the 20’s.

He’s savvy with his routes and can get open in both the short-game and downfield. He adjusts to the ball in the air superbly and his ball-tracking is top tier. He shows strong and consistent hands paired with excellent focus and technique. He’s not electric or sudden but he’s shifty and finds ways to get open. I really like him.

Jordyn Tyson (Arizona State) won’t be too far behind, provided he passes all medical checks. His injury history will be a concern (14 missed games out of 38 for ASU). However, he’s such a natural receiver that there’s every chance he will also find a home within the top-20.

Tyson wins a lot of contested catches and can jump up to go and get the ball. He did a bit of everything in college — slot, outside, screens. He shows good hands, he turned awkward and off-target throws into completions and he has a subtle separation talent to make up for a lack of blazing quickness. His ball-tracking is good and it’s easy to imagine him making plays in the league.

Carnell Tate (Ohio State) saw his season tail off at the end but he too should go reasonably quickly. He has great body control, he catches the ball away from his body, he can hang in the air to make catches and his ball-tracking is also excellent. He lines up almost exclusively outside and his speed is a question mark.

Lemon, Tyson and Tate all have a very reasonable chance to become solid NFL starters.

After that there’s some depth but I sense we might end up seeing players pushed way above their grading. I’m struggling with the first round buzz Washington’s Denzel Boston is getting. To me he feels like a useful bigger target on slants and in the red zone but someone who will struggle to separate at the next level and doesn’t have the vertical leaping ability to win-out.

Zachariah Branch (Georgia) is a screen/pass into the flat specialist used basically as a ‘kick-returner’ on offense, getting the ball into his hands and trying to get him to run through traffic. He has an explosive lower half and he can sprint away from defenders in space but he wasn’t used as a conventional receiver and his tendency to body catch highlights this. Again, it’s hard to see some of the round one buzz here.

KC Concepcion (Texas A&M) could go in round one due to his ability to separate and make big plays — but that’s not certain. I’m hoping Evan Stewart returns to Oregon after missing the 2025 season with a serious injury.

After a strong top of the draft a year ago, this is the opposite. Oregon’s Kenyon Sadiq is regularly assumed to be a very high pick but what is this based on? Testing. He’s expected to be one of the big winners at the combine. His performance on the field for Oregon was nothing to write home about. Did you feel his presence against Texas Tech or Indiana? He only had four games this year with +50 yards.

He’s talking about potentially going back to school. I think he should. A lot more development is needed here and I’d have a hard time taking him early believing his production is suddenly going to explode at the next level. I’d describe his blocking as ‘OK’. He’s a major upside project.

Eli Stowers (Vanderbilt) feels like someone who is more likely to come in and contribute quickly but he will need to test well to show off his upside to warrant going in round two. I’m glad the Seahawks took the opportunity to draft Elijah Arroyo a year ago and believe in time he will prove to be an inspired pick. There are no truly exciting solutions as part of this draft class.

Offensive line

Spencer Fano (Utah) and Francis Mauigoa (Miami) should both go very early. They are highly aggressive, tone-setting, consistent arse kickers. Both might have to kick inside to guard, however.

The more I watched of Caleb Lomu (Utah) I think he might go quite early too. There’s such a dearth of well sized, athletic left tackles in this draft and Lomu could be elevated based on upside. He could go in the top-20.

I’ve really battled with Kadyn Proctor (Alabama) and I studied a bunch of his tape again recently. I think I like him more than I did prior to that work. I still have real reservations about his size/weight and how that’d need to be controlled. However — he ticks a few boxes. His zone-blocking is surprisingly effective. He does a great job moving into space and finding blocks at the second level. He can smother and dominate when blocking square-on. He bullies opponents 1v1 in a wrestling match. He’s shown evidence of passing off defenders to handle stunts. He’s a finisher and a people mover. He also has rare speed/mobility for his frame — although that works best moving forwards and not protecting the edge at tackle.

There is a level of uniqueness to Proctor you don’t see with many players and in a draft like this, I’d probably roll the dice. If you have the luxury of drafting him to kick inside to guard, even better. I think he could be really good there. I’m not sure I’d trust him defending the edge against speed at the next level.

I think Brian Parker (Duke) might go earlier than people realise. He’s an excellent zone blocker and moves people off the ball. He’s extremely physical. He shows good technique with the ability to get his hands inside to control blocks. He’s very mobile and capable of progressing to the second level. His success rate landing on second-level blocks is impressive and he uses forceful hands to jolt defenders off balance with violence.

There are examples on tape of him springing big run plays due to his key blocking Duke seemed to funnel their run game to his side. I think he has a bright future and is worthy of top-45 talk.

Gennings Dunker (Iowa) and Emmanuel Pregnon (Oregon) also provide quality zone-blocking tape and finishing ability. Dunker, like Parker, will project to move inside from tackle. I wonder if we could see a major run on offensive linemen simply because there are players here with some starting ability and you can’t say that in other areas of this class.

Later round options that have caught my eye include Beau Stephens (Iowa) and Pat Coogan (Indiana). Stephens is another really good zone-blocker. He sinks his hips well to anchor, is adept at getting on the move and reaching up to the second level. He has the brawling mentality you expect from an Iowa lineman. There are examples on tape of him turning defenders and finishing his blocks to the turf. He has a willingness to combo block but some technical tweaks are needed to execute at a higher level. I’d prefer to see a better initial punch into the chest of opponents. Coogan excelled against Oregon and while his upside is limited — he’s going to give everything on every down. There’s evidence of good zone-blocking on tape.

I studied newly declared Monroe Freeling (Georgia) today before writing this piece. He’s a pure pass-pro tackle and not a great run blocker. His height (6-7) means he struggles with leverage and he has a high centre of gravity. He gets beat through the chest because he can’t sink and anchor well enough. He can also get out over his toes when he gets on the move — lunging at blocks. There’s enough athleticism to seal off the edge with his footwork and his foot-speed on the kick-step is a positive. He showed he can contain Texas’ Colin Simmons with his kick-step and peppering hands. Yet his technique needs major work — he too often lunges at EDGE defenders with his arms over-extended meaning he’ll be so easy to counter off. He also loses all balance and it hinders his base.

He’s a project with upside but there’s a lot of work needed and he’s not helping you set a tone up front. I think he could go in round two because teams are always looking for athletic tackles.

EDGE

I’m really struggling to understand the first round buzz with some of these players. David Bailey (Texas Tech) has taken the form of ‘first round lock’ in the media but I just found his tape underwhelming. Cashius Howell (Texas A&M) is going to get blasted against the run at the next level. Romello Height (Texas Tech) is a rotational rusher and R Mason Thomas (Oklahoma) plays with a lot of intensity and motor but as with many defensive ends/EDGE rushers in this class, he just doesn’t have the measurables.

I have Joshua Josephs (Tennessee) currently graded as my top EDGE after reviewing tape. He looks the part with great arm length and a long, lean frame. He shows evidence of speed-to-power. He works nicely to disengage and his arm/over can be effective to win 1v1. He seems to prefer to sprint into contact rather than the preferred bend/straighten which isn’t ideal but Josephs offers a physical playing style and the motor never stops. His run discipline is evident on tape. I think he’s someone who could realistically start and play some early downs without necessarily being a star player.

This isn’t a class where I’d be looking for solutions if I wanted to add an impact rusher. I think you all know by now what I would do if that was a desired off-season aim.

Defensive end

Keldric Faulk (Auburn) is one of several players with enticing physical tools who didn’t have a great 2025 season — yet within this class he could/should be a top-15 pick because those teams at the top will need to take someone. After that, I think Ohio State’s Kenyatta Jackson (if he turns pro) has some intriguing upside, perhaps enough to tempt a team to take him in the top-40.

I’ve been pretty consistent since September in saying I think Rueben Bain Jr (Miami) has been overrated by the media and fans on Twitter. Short-armed players with his frame and playing style don’t go early in round one.

He has 30 inch arms at 270lbs with a stocky 6-3 frame — that’s difficult to place in a NFL context. Is he an inside/out rusher? Not many players with his body type succeed. His game is based on power and while he does show occasional bend for his size he just doesn’t seem all that twitchy. He had a four game stretch where he missed 21.3% of his tackles in 2025 and he just reminds me of those AJ Epenesa, Boogie Basham, Myles Murphy types who go earlier than they should. He has this tendency at Miami to be impactful one week and then have a couple of games where you barely notice he’s playing. The limitations in this class could mean he still finds a home in round one but it’s not the banker many would have you believe.

I’m also not sure why his older team-mate, Akheem Mesidor, who has an injury history, is being projected in round one. I thought his tape was pretty average personally.

There’s not a lot of excitement to be had here. This isn’t a position in the draft I’d be chasing.

Defensive tackle

Ohio State’s Kayden McDonald is one of the best six players in the draft. His run-defense and ability to control double-teams, anchor down, disengage and just generally be a load in the middle of the defense are not typical. On top of that, he has great size (325lbs) and carries his weight well. He’s also far more athletic than people give him credit for — there’s untapped pass-rush ability here. I think he’s potentially another Derrick Brown.

Peter Woods (Clemson) had a very disappointing season but is expected to run a 4.8 at +300lbs so teams may feel obliged to take him early, knowing his 2024 tape was so much better than what we saw in 2025. Caleb Banks (Florida) had injury problems all year but there simply aren’t many humans with his incredible size, length and ability to disrupt. If he passes medical checks he will go early.

Domonique Orange (Iowa State) is a big nose tackle type with plus athleticism and disruptive qualities. I think he’d be a very solid day two pick. Darrell Jackson Jr (Florida State) is another player who just jumps off the screen thanks to his size, motor, aggression and length. He plays with genuine violence to throw off blocks with disdain. His one-arm bull rush is interesting and effective. At the very least he can provide some early-down run defense value. In my notes I wrote ‘has an AFC North vibe to him’.

I get why A’Mauri Washington (Oregon) is talked up as a first round type due to his athletic upside for his size. He does things a lot of players can’t do — albeit in flashes. His bull-rush is thunderous when it starts rumbling. He has reps on tape where he side-steps O-liners to dodge blocks like he’s 250lbs. Yet he had too many games in 2025 where you barely noticed he was playing or you even thought, ‘is that the guy everyone is putting in round one?’ He needs a lot of work.

I’m not buying the sudden ‘Lee Hunter (Texas Tech) in round one’ talk either. His frame is unappealing and apologies for the crude comparison — he’s built like an orange. I’m not convinced he’ll test well. He does have surprising shiftiness and an ability to dodge blocks to penetrate. He can also sift down the line to get a feel for the blocks then slip through gaps. His arm/over is competent but he’s not a bully vs the run and doesn’t take the game to the opponent with violent hands.

Linebacker

Ohio State’s Arvell Reese is going to be a very high pick as a hybrid EDGE/LB who could develop into another Abdul Carter type player. He plays with a thunderous ferocity, getting under the pads of bigger linemen and somehow stacking/disengaging. He delivers a jolting punch which has to be seen to be believed at his size. He displaces linemen to throw them off balance which again, at his size, is remarkable.

He’s a tremendous run defender because of his ability to disengage and/or keep his frame clean. There’s evidence on tape of throwing off offensive tackles to explode into the backfield. As a linebacker he plays with fantastic range and he looks like a sudden athlete. He’s very willing to fill gaps and put a hat on a hat. He’s light on his feet and will read/react to make plays. His pursuit speed is excellent. That said, he had quiet games in the BIG-10 Championship and Ohio State’s playoff exit to Miami.

CJ Allen (Georgia) has grown on me. He’s a classic downhill linebacker who can explode to attack the LOS and expose gap opportunities with his quickness. His closing speed when running forward is excellent. He reads the eyes of the QB and remains patient when playing read/react. He has good stalking speed when he runs to the sideline.

He likes to keep everything in front of him and doesn’t look that comfortable going backwards. He’s not the best at reacting to play-action and he could be exposed when forced into coverage situations. His tackles pack a punch and he’ll help set a stone. His lateral movements (sidesteps) are solid but not the most sudden or free. He doesn’t miss many tackles. There’s a little bit of stiffness/tightness with his movements.

I think he has the makings of a solid starter.

I’m not sure why Sonny Styles (Ohio State) is suddenly being projected as a top-20 lock everywhere. Is it because of testing? The former safety is a long, lean linebacker but he doesn’t have a typical build for the position. You can see his former DB background in the way he drops with ease. Yet he lacks take-on power when attacking the LOS, he doesn’t always fly to the ball carrier and he can overcommit and get washed out. There’s some over-eagerness at times that means he runs into blocks and it costs him. You can see tight ends having success in the blocking game against him too.

I like linebackers with speed, range and mobility but to me Styles feels like a project who warrants far more restraint in terms of taking a shot than the top-20. For me he’s a day-two player.

One player I loved watching is Kyle Louis (Pittsburgh). He’s undersized and I’m not sure he’s going to test well enough to compensate for that — however, he gives absolutely everything in every game and he’s said to be an absolute work-horse off the field in terms of preparation and dedication. Keep an eye on him during the Senior Bowl.

Cornerback

Clemson’s Avieon Terrell covers well running across the field and he’s sticky downfield with strong recover ability. For me he has the most potential to be a plus starter — although his lack of size looks an issue at times. I did like the way he played the run and his brother has obviously had success in the league. There’s a natural classiness to his play which speaks to those bloodlines. He looks like a NFL player on tape.

Jermod McCoy (Tennessee) has a lot of snaps where he’s face-guarding but he’s well built and can stick in coverage downfield. He’s a ball of clay to develop into a rounded CB1. There are injury checks to take place after he missed 2025 but he sticks in the hip-pocket in man and can trace steps downfield with ease. He looks the part but against the top opponents (Jeremiah Smith & Ryan Williams) he did give up some plays.

Mansoor Delane (LSU) is intelligent, makes plays on the ball and shows a degree of natural talent and flair for the position. The concern is his long-speed and testing — and whether limitations here could be an issue at the next level.

Safety

Ohio state’s Caleb Downs is one of the best players in the draft, possibly the best. Testing expectations are not sky-high and with his low positional value he might last a bit longer on draft day than he should (see: Kyle Hamilton). He is probably the safest bet in the class to hit on a good starter.

Oregon’s Dillon Thieneman is being slept on — he is expected to test brilliantly and he has good size too. His range as a deep-cover safety is impressive and he can be a chess piece at the next level. Keep an eye on Arizona’s Genesis Smith too.

Overall assessment

There’s still time for things to change but right now I think it’s pretty clear what this class is (or isn’t). There’s a distinct lack of obvious blue-chippers at the top of round one. You are unlikely to find players from #15 onwards with first round grades, at least in my view. You will badly struggle to get value in round two.

I think we’ll see teams resort to attacking the trenches positions, receiver and cornerback early — feeling like these are the areas you might as well plunder if the grading value isn’t up to par.

I continue to think we’ll see a rich appetite for teams picking later in each round to attack the veteran trade market. The big question will be — with a weak draft class in 2026 — how reasonable are selling teams going to be to make deals? And are you going to have to dig into your 2027 resources to sweeten certain deals?

The Los Angeles Chargers' 16-3 loss to the New England Patriots marked the sixth one-and-done postseason appearance of his career -- one with Oakland, two in Chicago, three with L.A.

The question is whether Mack, who turns 35 next month, is going to give it a 13th year to find that postseason win, or hang up the pads and wait for Canton to call.

""Not trying to make that decision right now like I've almost done before,"" Mack said Monday, via the team’s official website. ""Trying to stay as present as possible, stay prayed up, make a decision based on how I'm feeling and how my family is feeling, the vibes.

""If the vibes are high, the decisions will be made. Just figuring it out day by day.""

Mack considered retirement last year before ultimately inking a one-year deal to remain in L.A. He is slated to hit free agency in March. For now, the latest playoff loss is too fresh for him to consider what the future might bring.

""You're still kind of processing it a little bit, but ultimately ... just didn't do enough to win,"" Mack said. ""Can't live with ifs and what-ifs. Turn that page and look forward to getting better in all facets of the game. The chips fall where they may without talking too far ahead. Try to stay where your feet at. One of those things where you're pissed off, but what happened was supposed to happen.""

Mack later added that he doesn't want to ""make a decision based on how you feel in the present moment, especially after a tough loss. It's about taking time and taking that step back.""

While missing five games due to injury, Mack compiled 5.5 sacks, 11 QB hits and 32 tackles. His 113 career sacks place him 29th all-time and seventh among active players.

Even as his production winds down from being a perennial All-Pro early in his career, a player with Mack's ability to affect the passer -- even on a rotational basis -- would still be coveted on the open market. If he decides to continue his career, Mack will find a landing spot in L.A. or elsewhere.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/pim1wwifvoqxevxjxonz,N,,2026-01-13 17:01:39.356103

Now that the Bills have advanced out of the wildcard round with their 27-24 victory over Jacksonville, that hope for a return is ramped up because Sean McDermott said Monday that Oliver’s 21-day practice window would be opened this week as the Bills prepare to meet the Denver Broncos in an AFC divisional game Saturday.

Of course, opening Oliver’s window to practice is not a guarantee that he’ll be ready to go for the game, but at the very least, he can start getting back into the flow and if he isn’t quite ready for Denver, should the Bills advance to the AFC Championship Game, maybe he’s ready for that game.

Defensive coordinator Bobby Babich wasn’t ready to get too excited about a potential Oliver return, saying on Monday, “We’ll see. I mean, we got to see where he’s at and those type of things. And Ed’s certainly a talented player. He’s had some time off, so we just got to see where he’s at.”

Oliver has been at the facility doing whatever he can to stay in football shape while his injury healed. He has mugged for reporters and cameramen, flashing that infectious smile of his, but he hasn’t really provided an update on his timeline, mainly because he’s not required to speak to reporters while he’s on injured reserve.

“Some of these guys, when they go on IR, they don’t come around as much because they’re more worried, their focus is on their rehab,” Babich said. “But you guys have seen it, he can’t stay away. He’s showing up at individual and all that. Then he’s on the side doing, like just little things and mimicking drills and all those things. Ed loves ball. Ed wants to play football. The way he practices shows you that he loves football. So we’ll see where he’s at.”

Deone Walker, DaQuan Jones stepped up after Ed Oliver injury

Getting Oliver back would be a boost for the Bills, both against the run and obviously as an inside pass rusher. Rookie Deone Walker has done a solid job pairing with veteran DaQuan Jones in the middle of the line, and last week against the Jaguars, Walker played 41 snaps which was the most of any Bills defensive tackle (Jones played 39).

That was the second-highest total of Walker’s season behind only the 56 snaps he played at Atlanta, the night that Jones suffered a calf injury in pregame warmup so the Bills were down to three DTs.

Going into the season, with free agent acquisition Larry Ogunjobi on suspension and DeWayne Carter on injured reserve, the expected four-man rotation was supposed to be Oliver, Jones and the two rookies, Walker and TJ Sanders. That foursome has been on the field together just once, that in the Week 1 victory over Baltimore.

Ed Oliver stats before the injury

Oliver has played in only three games. He was dominant in the victory over the Ravens, but he suffered an ankle injury the following week in practice and missed the next four games. He returned to play against the Falcons and Panthers, but midway through that Week 8 Carolina game he tore his bicep while making a tackle and he’s been on injured reserve ever since.

In the three games he played, Oliver was outstanding as he made 12 tackles including seven for lost yardage, three of those being sacks, plus 11 QB pressures, a forced fumble that helped turn the Baltimore game, and 10 stops, a Pro Football Focus stat that is defined as a tackle that caused a failed play for the offense. He did all that on just 108 total snaps.

Gabe Davis injury update

Elsewhere on the injury report, McDermott delivered the expected bad news on wide receiver Gabe Davis, a torn ACL in the same knee that he had surgically repaired last season when he was with Jacksonville, a crushing blow for the sixth-year pro, especially since he’ll be a free agent in the spring.

With Joshua Palmer on injured reserve as of last week, the Bills are down to four healthy receivers in Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman, Brandin Cooks and Tyrell Shavers, but even Shavers’ situation is murky.

He hurt his knee at Jacksonville, though he was able to return and finish the game, but McDermott said, “We’ll see where it goes from here. Still evaluating his situation.”

Bills roster options at wide receiver

Like Oliver, wide receiver Curtis Samuel, who has been on injured reserve since early November, will also have his practice window opened with the hope that he can be ready for the game to take Davis’ spot.

Another option at wide receiver would be Mecole Hardman, who could be elevated from the practice squad to be the No. 5 receivers and also replace Shakir as the primary punt returner. Of course, if Shavers can’t play, the Bills would need both Samuel and Hardman.

Jordan Poyer injury update

Additional bad news came on the Jordan Poyer front as the safety re-injured his hamstring against the Jaguars and he’s now in a week-to-week situation meaning he’s definitely out against Denver. The Bills have to make a decision on who to play because rookie Jordan Hancock struggled when he took over for Poyer. Cam Lewis would an option, but also, Damar Hamlin could figure into this equation.

Hamlin has been on injured reserve since October, but his practice window was opened last week and McDermott said, “He had a good first week overall coming not off the IR, but opening up his window, and we’ll see where that goes.”

When he left the tent, he sat down on the back of a cart with a towel over his head and his left hand cradling his forehead.

Houston ruled him out shortly after he left the game with a concussion. Further details of Collins' condition weren't initially clear. Fellow Texans wide receiver Justin Watson was also ruled out with a concussion.

The injury took place early in the fourth quarter as the Texans held a 7-6 lead. Houston's defense controlled the game from two defensive touchdowns as the Texans opened the one-point contest into a blowout.

Collins is Houston's top receiver, but played a secondary role to Christian Kirk prior to his exit. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards when he left the game, while Kirk finished with 8 receptions for 144 yards a touchdown.

Chan School of Public Health,Study shows rise in suicide rate among NFL players,Maya Brownstein,,,,,https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/study-shows-rise-in-suicide-rate-among-nfl-players/,"Weisskopf: Recent high-profile suicides among NFL players have raised serious concerns about player health, wellbeing, and safety.
Our study asks whether professional football players are different from other professional athletes when it comes to suicide.
Grashow: We were also interested in how suicide rates among NFL players may have changed over time.
There were also a number of high-profile deaths by suicide among some NFL players after 2010 that were discussed publicly.
From 2011 to 2019, however, we saw an almost threefold increase in suicide among NFL players when compared to these other professional athletes.","For more than a decade, the Football Players Health Study at Harvard University (FPHS) has been conducting research on how a career in football impacts the long-term health and wellbeing of players and their families. The latest FPHS study, published Jan. 12 in the Journal of Neurotrauma, is on suicidality among National Football League (NFL) players, especially in the context of growing awareness of and attention on neurodegenerative disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The study found that NFL players faced increased risk of suicide compared to their basketball and baseball counterparts, likely due to multiple factors including “copycat” effects from high-profile suicides, increased fears around CTE, and high rates of medical conditions whose symptoms can mimic those of CTE.

Below, the study’s lead authors—Rachel Grashow, senior research scientist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of epidemiological research initiatives for the FPHS, and Marc Weisskopf, Cecil K. and Philip Drinker Professor of Environmental Epidemiology and Physiology and director of epidemiological studies for the FPHS—talk about their findings and why they instill senses of both caution and hope.

Q: What did you examine in this study?

Weisskopf: Recent high-profile suicides among NFL players have raised serious concerns about player health, wellbeing, and safety. Our study asks whether professional football players are different from other professional athletes when it comes to suicide. We’ve known for some time that suicide rates among male professional athletes, including NFL players, are lower than that of the general male population—but since these groups differ in many ways, we decided to focus exclusively on elite athletes and compare NFL players to their Major League Baseball (MLB) and National Basketball Association (NBA) counterparts.

Grashow: We were also interested in how suicide rates among NFL players may have changed over time. In recent years, conversations around head injury and neurodegenerative disease have shaped a collective narrative around football and health. We believe 2011 was a pivotal year for that conversation, when the publication of scientific studies on brain injury, neurodegenerative disease, and football accelerated. In particular, CTE—a neuropathological condition that is determined only through autopsy, and that cannot yet be diagnosed or treated in living patients—gained attention in a series of highly publicized research articles. There were also a number of high-profile deaths by suicide among some NFL players after 2010 that were discussed publicly.

This study asked whether NFL suicide was more likely from 2011 onwards, since CTE wasn’t as widely discussed prior to that, and we know from our previous research that there is a link between CTE concerns and suicidality. One of our previous FPHS studies, which used data from our cohort of nearly 5,000 former NFL players, showed that players with CTE concerns were more likely to report frequent thoughts of self-harm or killing themselves.

Q: How did you conduct this study and what did it find?

Weisskopf: We used publicly available playing data on all professional baseball, basketball, and football players going back to 1920 that included their names and dates of birth. That information was submitted to the U.S. National Death Index, who returned a list of deceased players along with their date and cause of death. We flagged the deaths by suicide in this list to determine the suicide rate across all the years studied—1979, when the U.S. started maintaining electronic death records, through 2019—as well as broken into two eras: 1979-2010 and 2011-2019.

Grashow: Similar to other studies of suicide among professional athletes, when we pooled all the data from 1979 to 2019, we saw a comparable rate of death by suicide among NFL, MLB, and NBA players.

When we split the data at 2011, we found that prior to 2011, NFL, MLB, and NBA players also had the same rate of death by suicide. From 2011 to 2019, however, we saw an almost threefold increase in suicide among NFL players when compared to these other professional athletes.

Q: What might account for this increase?

Weisskopf: We can’t say for sure from this study, but there are many possible contributing factors. While we did not find any rule-, policy-, or equipment-based changes that could account for the increase, these and other biological or exposure-based causes can’t be ruled out. It’s also possible that deaths among NFL players that would not have been classified as suicides by medical examiners prior to 2011 may have been labeled a suicide after 2010, as a result of greater awareness of issues related to head trauma. Additionally, high profile suicides have been known to cause a “copycat” or contagion effect called the Werther effect. More research is needed to determine the individual contributions of each of these factors.

Grashow: Previous research may lend additional relevant context. Similar to prior FPHS findings linking CTE concerns with thoughts of self-harm or suicide, studies have shown that individuals who have been diagnosed or believe themselves to be at risk for neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, or Parkinson’s disease are at greater risk of suicide. Descriptions of these conditions as neurodegenerative diseases without cure—and, in the case of CTE, treatment—may be contributing to increased suicide rates, although, again, we cannot say for certain based on this study.

On a hopeful note, however, while some former players may indeed have the underlying brain changes associated with CTE, there are also other conditions commonly found in former NFL players that may result in symptoms frequently attributed to CTE, but that are treatable. A previous FPHS study showed that members of our cohort disproportionately report living with conditions that can cause cognitive symptoms—issues with memory, concentration, and impulsivity, for example—including sleep apnea, high blood pressure, low testosterone, chronic pain, depression, and opiate use. Players with these conditions and symptoms were more likely to think they had CTE. While these players may have the underlying brain pathology that characterizes CTE, some may not. We believe encouraging players to be proactive about their treatable conditions is worth emphasizing.

Q: What are the study’s key takeaways—for players, their families, and the institutions responsible for their health and safety?

Grashow: We hope our findings motivate collective action among players, families, the NFL, and other organizations who support current and former players to address what may be preventable deaths. First and foremost, the sudden onset of increased suicide risk among NFL players should motivate increased screening, surveillance, and programming for former players related to depression, thoughts of self-harm, and suicide. Further, it may be beneficial for players, families, PCPs and sports medicine physicians, and other organizations that support former players to increase screening for conditions that may mimic symptoms attributed to CTE. Treatments are available for many of these conditions, with the potential to improve quality and length of life and, in so doing, reduce feelings of despair. These investments are important and warranted regardless of whether or not the increased attention and concern about head injury and brain effects are among the contributors to the higher NFL suicide rate.

Weisskopf: There’s still a lot we don’t know about CTE, and specifically how it may relate to enhanced suicide risk. Research to identify treatments and diagnostics should be prioritized. And while this research is ongoing, we really want to emphasize that cognitive symptoms don’t automatically indicate neurodegenerative disease. Rather, cognitive symptoms should motivate thorough screenings for all treatable conditions known to commonly occur in football players, as well as, it’s worth noting, anyone at risk of repetitive head injury, including military service people and players of other contact sports. We encourage these individuals, their families, and their physicians to prioritize treating what’s treatable, and to have open conversations about risks for self-harm and suicidal ideation.",https://hsph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HarvardPublicHealth_Football_CTE_Helmet_CONCUSSIONS_f.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:02:21.238493

George Kittle tore his Achilles during a play in the first half of Sunday's game. The latest injury now makes it three of the Niners' best players who have been lost for the season -- the others are All Pro linebacker Fred Warner and star defensive lineman Nick Bosa.

There have been many other players during the season who have missed games because of injuries. Many consider, even for the National Football League, the amount of injuries dealt to the 49ers this season is a lot.

""Injuries will occur. Every team has injuries. But it's true the 49eres have had more than most,"" said Matt Maiocco, a 49ers insider for NBC Sports Bay Area.

The 49ers' injury list has also included quarterback Brock Purdy, who missed eight games with turf toe before returning a few weeks ago.

""It's a violent sport. And it's a difficult sport,"" Maiocco said. ""I don't think bodies were made to play football.""

Maiocco said players have evolved over the last few years, making the game even more intense.

""The size of these players -- the collisions are more intense than they ever have been,"" Maiocco said. ""And every year it seems the players get bigger, faster, stronger. And bones, ligaments and tendons kind of remain the same.""

When asked about all the injuries, Niners receiver Kendrick Bourne after Sunday's game jokingly referenced electro-magnetic waves created by a power station next to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara -- a conspiracy theory that has gained buzz online.

It is worth noting experts have dismissed the ""power plant theory"" as a social media myth.

Entering that game, however, there is some uncertainty about one of the Patriots’ most important players.

With that said, let’s take a look at the injury situation after rewatching the wild card win over Los Angeles.

Patriots injury analysis: Wild card round

CB Carlton Davis III: When the Patriots came out of the two-minute warning in the second quarter, Davis was not in his usual position at outside cornerback. Instead, he was in the blue medical tent and shortly thereafter departed for the locker room. Announced as questionable to return with a toe injury, he ended up missing five defensive snaps before returning to start the second half. Davis did not show any obvious signs of discomfort before his exit, so it is unclear when exactly he injured his toe.

CB Christian Gonzalez: Breaking up a Justin Herbert pass attempt intended for Quentin Johnston, Gonzalez collided with the wide receiver on his way to the ground and was slow to get up afterwards. He did remain in the game for the next snap — another incompletion to set up a punt — but headed into the medical tent afterwards. From there, the Pro Bowl defender left the field for the locker room and was later announced as questionable to return with a head injury. He never came back out and shortly before the game ended was officially downgraded to out.

What this means for the Patriots

While Carlton Davis managed to return to the game and finish without any visible limitations, Christian Gonzalez is a massive question mark. As head coach Mike Vrabel noted on Monday, the Pro Bowler is in the league’s concussion protocol, and there is no timeline yet for his return.

Arguably New England’s best player on this side of the ball, Gonzalez missing any time in the lead-up to Sunday’s game, let alone the contest itself, would be a blow to the team’s defense. While Houston’s offense is not in the upper echelon in terms of productivity and scoring potential, it features some high-end receiving talent led by wide receivers Nico Collins and Christian Kirk.

Having Gonzalez available against that pair and the rest of Houston’s defense would be a massive plus. For now, however, uncertainty reigns.

Wednesday will mark the first key date in that regard, and when it comes to finding out which other Patriots are nursing injuries or illness after the wild card round. The team will hold its first practice of the week that afternoon, with the initial injury report set to come out later in the day.

George Kittle has built a reputation as one of the most effective tight ends in the NFL, regardless of his role — whether as a pass-catcher or blocker, the San Francisco 49ers star has cemented himself as one of the best players at his position.

Part of Kittle's stardom has always been connected to his toughness, playing a position that typically isn't very forgiving. Tight ends do plenty of dirty work for an offense, and that means Kittle has had his share of injuries in the past.

Potentially the worst ailment of Kittle's career came in the 2026 playoffs, however, as he exited the 49ers' Wild Card game against the Philadelphia Eagles with an Achilles injury feared to be a tear.

Here's a breakdown of George Kittle's injury history.

George Kittle injury history

Foot sprain, October 2016, Iowa

When he was in college, Kittle injured his foot in October 2016 during his senior season as a member of the Iowa Hawkeyes.

The injury to Kittle's right foot caused him to be limited the rest of the season, including two missed games.

Hamstring injury, August 2017, 49ers

Kittle's first reported injury issue in the NFL came just before his rookie season began. In training camp before the 2017 season, he missed around a week with a hamstring injury.

The tight end, however, was ready by Week 1 and made his debut, totaling 27 yards against the Panthers.

Ankle sprain, November 2017, 49ers

Later in Kittle's rookie season, he missed one game for the 49ers due to a sprained ankle.

Kittle returned the following week and played out the remainder of his first NFL season.

Shoulder A/C Joint Separation, August 2018, 49ers

Prior to the 2018 season, Kittle dealt with another training camp ailment. He separated his right shoulder in San Francisco's preseason opener.

However, there was no structural damage for Kittle, and he was ready by Week 1 of the 2018 season.

Knee sprain, October 2019, 49ers

Kittle's first multi-game absence in the NFL came in October 2019, when he injured his knee against the Arizona Cardinals. On the first play of the game, he injured his knee and missed the next few plays before returning, catching six passes for 79 yards and a touchdown a victory.

However, the tight end then wound up missing two games with a knee sprain.

Hamstring strain, August 2020, 49ers

One of Kittle's lighter injury issues was a hamstring strain prior to the 2020 season, but the star tight end played through his tight hamstring.

MCL sprain, September 2020, 49ers

Early in the 2020 season, Kittle injured his knee. He sustained a sprained left MCL in Week 1, causing him to miss the following two 49ers matchups.

He made a return from the injury in a big way, posting 15 receptions for 183 yards and a touchdown on ""Sunday Night Football"" against the Eagles.

Foot fracture, November 2020, 49ers

While Kittle made a return from his sprained MCL in 2020, soon after, he suffered a longer-term injury. In the 49ers' Week 8 loss, the tight end fractured a bone in his foot.

Kittle was placed on IR for the first time in his career, and he missed around two months before a return to action in late December, being activated on Christmas Day.

Calf strain, September 2021, 49ers

Following the 49ers' Week 3 loss to the Packers in 2021, Kittle began dealing with a calf injury. Initially, he played through it, but the ailment proved too extensive to ignore.

Kittle was placed on IR, missing about a month for San Francisco before a return to the field in November. He posted six catches for 101 yards and a touchdown in his return.

Groin strain, September 2022, 49ers

Early in the 2022 season, Kittle missed two games with a groin strain.

It wouldn't be the last time a groin issue would hold him back, however, as a nagging groin injury followed him in 2023.

Between a training camp groin pull that resulted in a week of missed practices, plus another groin injury sustained in November of the 2023 season, Kittle dealt with issues throughout his age-30 season.

Kittle played through the groin issues, but then underwent surgery after the 2023 season.

A chain of hamstring issues began for Kittle in the 2024 season. He missed the 49ers' Week 3 game with a hamstring injury.

It was just a one-game absence for the tight end, but the injury re-appeared later in 2024.

Kittle once again sat out in Week 11 of the 2024 season due to a hamstring sprain, another one-game absence.

Around a year after he had shorter-term absences due to his hamstring, Kittle faced a longer-term recovery early in the 2025 season due to a Grade 3 torn hamstring.

After the Week 1 injury, Kittle missed five games, one of many injuries for the 49ers throughout the 2025 campaign. He was activated on Oct. 15, 2025.

Ankle sprain, December 2025, 49ers

The second injury of Kittle's 2025 season came in Week 16 against the Colts. He sustained a left ankle sprain in that matchup, in which he totaled seven receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown.

Kittle missed the 49ers' following game before returning to the field.

While Kittle has had years of nagging injuries, he's typically been able to either play through them, or return to the field after a short-term absence. When he went down against the Eagles in the first round of the 2026 NFL Playoffs, however, it was feared Kittle had a longer recovery than usual ahead of him.

Kittle was carted off the field in the Wild Card Weekend matchup, and the 49ers quickly called it an Achilles injury for their veteran tight end. With the possibility that he tore his Achilles, he was set to be out for the remainder of the playoffs and potentially part of the 2026 regular season.

After it was confirmed that Kittle tore his achilles, the tight end had a message for fans on social media.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/the_sporting_news_articles_584/e18e216adef7aa4a0c22d933f3d99871,N,,2026-01-13 16:01:29.075748

“I don’t know how long it will take, but when you’re not allowed to return to the game because of the concussion protocol, you have to wait. We’ll see how things develop throughout the week.”

González, a 23-year-old cornerback, exited in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s Wild Card game, in which the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 16–3.

The injury occurred on a play in which González broke up a pass intended for Quentin Johnston and then hit his head as the Chargers receiver fell on top of him.

The cornerback, who earned his first Pro Bowl selection this season, was a key piece of New England’s secondary in holding Los Angeles scoreless for six quarters of play.

Before heading to the locker room, González had recorded 27 coverage snaps, two passes defended, and allowed no receptions or yards to opposing receivers, making him the Patriots’ top defensive performer up to that point.

A standout at Oregon in college football, González entered the NFL as a first-round pick in the 2023 Draft and earned a starting role during his rookie season.

In his first year, when he was considered a candidate for Defensive Rookie of the Year, a shoulder injury sidelined him after four games.

Fully healthy in 2024, he reaffirmed his talent with 59 tackles, 11 passes defended, two interceptions, and one fumble recovery. His performance stood out on a Patriots team that failed to reach the playoffs.

How the NFL concussion protocol works

Concussions are one of the biggest concerns for the NFL and the sport in general. The league recognizes this, implementing several measures over the years in order to increase player safety and limit the prevalence of head injuries. There is still plenty of work to be done, but the introduction of strict guidelines such as the concussion protocol has created a more sensible environment compared to 10 or 20 years ago.

The protocol itself kicks into action when a player is either displaying or self-reporting signs of head injury. Once that happens, the team’s medical staff as well as the league’s unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants — three are assigned to each game — take further steps.

In Gonzalez’s case, this process did not start immediately. He remained in the game for one more snap, an incomplete pass that prompted the Chargers to punt. During the ensuing break for the defense, he retreated to the blue medical tent and afterwards left for the locker room for further evaluation. It was at that point, that the “questionable” label was applied.

Shortly before the game concluded, Gonzalez was then downgraded to out. That designation happened in accordance with the medical experts.

As part of their evaluation, after all, they run through a series of tests including checks of the eyes, speech, spine and cognitive abilities. In addition, the play itself will also be reviewed to determine whether or not the player in question will be cleared to return to the game or not. Gonzalez was not.

He is therefore now entering the next phase of the protocol.

What this means for the Patriots and Christian Gonzalez

After being placed in the concussion protocol on Sunday, Gonzalez will have to be cleared by medical professionals before returning to practice or game action. Both the Patriots’ own staff, led by Dr. Scott Martin, as well as an independent neurological consultant will need to green-light a comeback.

A follow-up step was taken on Monday with the goal of finding out whether the symptoms displayed after exiting the game have worsened. The results of those tests as well as a player’s personal history — Gonzalez also suffered a concussion the last time the Patriots played the Chargers, in December 2024 — will be factored into the next steps and the resulting timeline to be cleared.

The NFL’s return-to-participation protocol outlines five of them that Gonzalez will have to go through.

Phase 1: Symptom-limited activity. Gonzalez will be prescribed rest as well as limiting and/or avoiding physical and cognitive activities which increase the risk of aggravating symptoms. Limited stretching and balance training can be introduced under supervision of the athletic training staff, progressing to light aerobic exercise. Gonzalez can attend meetings and film study, if permitted by the medical staff.

Phase 2: Aerobic exercise. In this phase, Gonzalez can graduate to doing cardiovascular exercise under supervision of the Patriots’ medical staff. This includes riding on a stationary bike or a treadmill, as well as some stretching and balance training.

Phase 3: Football-specific exercise. This phase includes cardiovascular exercises and sport-specific activities. Gonzalez may also do some strength training, all under supervision.

Phase 4: Non-contact training drills. Building on Phases 2 and 3, Gonzalez will be allowed to continue cardiovascular, strength and balance training while also introducing specific exercise and non-contact football activities.

Phase 5: Full football activity/clearance. At this point, Gonzalez will be fully cleared to resume all football activities including full contact. If both the team’s physician and the independent neurological consultant are in agreement, he will be allowed to participate in the next game or practice.

Despite that clear structure, there is no set timeline when it comes to a player returning from a concussion. As a result, every option from returning to practice as early as Wednesday to missing Sunday’s divisional round game against the Houston Texans, and possibly even more time, is on the table.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/09/gettyimages-2233655751.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C2.1428670818589%2C100%2C78.525154502636&w=1200,N,,2026-01-13 12:02:18.497275

Gonzalez jumped the route and nearly came away with an interception, but as both players went to the ground, Johnston landed on Gonzalez’s helmet, with the back of Gonzalez’s head appearing to strike the turf.

Speaking to reporters, Vrabel emphasized that the process is routine in such situations: “How long that lasts, I don’t know,” Vrabel said. “But when they don’t let you go back in the game that would put you in the protocol.

We appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. He’s handled that all really well.” Gonzalez will have the week to progress through protocol, though Vrabel said there is no clear timeline.

Gonzalez, a first-round pick (17th overall) in the 2023 NFL Draft, has been one of the Patriot’s most consistent defensive performers this season. In 15 starts, including the playoffs, he recorded 69 tackles and led the team with 12 passes defended, earning his first Pro Bowl selection. However, injuries have been a recurring theme in Gonzalez’s career — he missed most of his rookie season due to a torn labrum, sat out one game last year with a concussion, and missed the first three games of the current season with a hamstring injury sustained during training camp.

The Patriots will face the winner of Monday night’s wild-card matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans, with the divisional-round game set for Sunday at Gillette Stadium.

Kraft meant even more to the Packers' offense, as he caught 32 passes for 489 yards and six touchdowns in the season's first eight games.
It's not hard to see him picking up where he left off in 2026 provided everything continues smoothly with his ACL rehab.
As the proverbial saying goes, the game had slowed down for Kraft in his third year.
Watching those struggles, as well as how the season ended this past weekend in the wild-card round, was tough on the ultra-competitive Kraft.","GREEN BAY – Tucker Kraft wasn't being boastful, only truthful.

Speaking in the locker room Monday for the first time since losing his season to a torn ACL on Nov. 2 vs. Carolina, Kraft explained in straightforward fashion what he missed out on personally due to his injury.

""I was on the cusp of putting together one of the greatest seasons by a Packer tight end,"" he said. ""That was something I was looking forward to, just leaving my legacy on this game and playing as hard as I could every snap for this team, because the end of the day, the guys in this room, they mean so much to me.""

Kraft meant even more to the Packers' offense, as he caught 32 passes for 489 yards and six touchdowns in the season's first eight games. At the time he went down, he led the team in every category.

As for the history he was on pace to make, double his totals to 64 catches for 978 yards and 12 TDs over a full season and all those marks would've broken the franchise records for tight ends set by Jermichael Finley (61 catches in 2012) and Paul Coffman (814 yards, 11 TDs in 1983).

It's not hard to see him picking up where he left off in 2026 provided everything continues smoothly with his ACL rehab. Kraft isn't giving himself a timeline, but the good news is there were no complications with his surgery, despite some minor damage to the meniscus and LCL.

At this early stage he's thinking he'll start training camp on the physically unable to perform list (PUP), just as he did when recovering from a torn pectoral muscle two offseasons ago. He'll look to be ""bulletproof"" by Week 1, which will be 10 months post-surgery.

What's fun to ponder is if his last full game before getting hurt was just a preview of the rest of Kraft's career.

In a big road win at Pittsburgh, which featured receiver Christian Watson's return from his torn ACL, Kraft had his best game as a pro – seven catches, 143 yards, two TDs, and running with abandon every time he got his hands on the ball.

It was his second 100-yard game of the season (also Week 2 vs. Washington, 6-124-1). As the proverbial saying goes, the game had slowed down for Kraft in his third year. He was beating man coverage more regularly, and he was looking even more dangerous after the catch.

His role was growing, for good reason, and he wants to remain as big a part of the offense as he was when his season came to a screeching halt.

""I wasn't feeling that stress or anxiety, mainly just excitement,"" he said of his 2025 season. ""I was hungry for every snap, every opportunity I could get. That's going to be the same thing going forward. I don't know entirely what my future holds in this offense, but … as many snaps as I can get, whether that's 40 or 65. I don't ever want to come out of this game again.

""Moving forward, I do feel like as a tight end, I'm a full package and that I can be anything for this team. Just put the ball in my hands.""

This past season, a surge of explosive production from Watson once he progressed to a full workload helped the offense get back on track after an initial lull following Kraft's injury.

Watching those struggles, as well as how the season ended this past weekend in the wild-card round, was tough on the ultra-competitive Kraft. He had the joy of a newborn daughter at home, but he felt this Packers team ""had all the pieces"" before injuries befell him, Micah Parsons, Devonte Wyatt and others.

Now that the missing-out part is over, he's focused on rejoining the team and being ready when needed.

""When I wasn't able to be out there for the last month and a half, two months this season, it was really hard on me … just knowing that, if I would have been out there and contributing, maybe things would have gone different,"" he said.

Head coach Sean McDermott provided an early look at the team's injury report.

Wide receiver suffers torn ACL

WR Gabe Davis will miss the rest of the postseason with a torn left ACL, McDermott stated. It's the same knee Davis injured last season in Jacksonville that caused him to miss extensive time in 2024 and half of the 2025 season.

Davis played seven total games this year with Buffalo, recording 14 catches for 143 yards and a touchdown.

With WR Joshua Palmer placed on IR prior to the Wild Card game, the Bills have four receivers on the active roster: Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks, Keon Coleman and Tyrell Shavers.

Shavers had a knee injury pop up during Sunday's game in Jacksonville but was later cleared to return.

""We'll see where it goes from here, still evaluating his situation,"" McDermott said.

Two players have 21-day window opened

DT Ed Oliver (biceps) and WR Curtis Samuel will have their 21-day practice windows opened this week as the pair make their way back from injured reserve.

Both players are expected to be on the field when the Bills begin their practice week, though their game status is still to be determined.

Oliver has been on IR since Week 9 with a torn bicep. McDermott shared on Dec. 31 that Oliver also had a meniscus cleanup procedure.

Samuel has appeared in six games, catching seven passes for 81 yards and a touchdown; he has been IR since Nov. 28.

One defensive player ruled out at Broncos

S Jordan Poyer has been ruled out for Saturday's game at Denver with a hamstring injury.

""He's week to week,"" McDermott said.

TE Dalton Kincaid was in walking boot after the Jaguars game, but McDermott shared that it was precautionary.

Claire shared Kittle’s post on her Instagram story and wrote, “My real life super hero.”

Kittle suffered the injury with 5:58 left in the second quarter after making a catch and being tackled near the sideline.

The 49er seemed to get his right ankle twisted as he was being taken out of bounds and Kittle quickly grabbed for his ankle.

Matthew Stafford, Los Angeles Rams

Stafford is dealing with a finger sprain on his throwing hand, but he will be good-to-go against the Chicago Bears in the divisional round. That said, factoring in potential grip issues with the expected single-digit weather in Chicago, we may see more struggles than we’re used to.

Ricky Pearsall, San Francisco 49ers

Pearsall is once again dealing with the PCL injury that has hampered him multiple times this year. It’s currently unclear if he’ll return to play this season.

Gabe Davis, Buffalo Bills

Davis had rejoined the Bills and had been earning some work, but suffered a torn ACL in the Wild Card Round and will be out for the remainder of the playoffs.

But first, let’s rewind and look at the biggest questions facing the Patriots after beating the Chargers.
Will Christian Gonzalez play next weekend?
Players dealing with head injuries don’t always follow the same recovery timeline, so there’s risk in speculating what a concussion means for the talented cornerback’s availability in the divisional round.
For the first time in 18 games this season, the Patriots recorded a pressure rate over 50 percent in their win over the Chargers.","FOXBORO, Mass. — Coach Mike Vrabel was given a chance to dunk on the naysayers Monday, those who insist on bringing up the New England Patriots’ weak regular-season schedule and dismiss what they’ve accomplished because of who they’ve played.

His team was one day removed from the franchise’s first playoff win in seven years and was asked what it means that the Patriots beat a Los Angeles Chargers team that went 11-6 this season when considering all the talk about the schedule.

“It means we get to keep playing,” Vrabel said. “That’s what that means. It means we’re not on vacation.”

The Patriots will face the Houston Texans on Sunday in the divisional round. A big test awaits.

But first, let’s rewind and look at the biggest questions facing the Patriots after beating the Chargers.

Will Christian Gonzalez play next weekend?

No question matters more to the Patriots, which makes this answer unsatisfying: Maybe.

Gonzalez suffered a head injury Sunday night and entered the concussion protocol, Vrabel confirmed Monday. Players dealing with head injuries don’t always follow the same recovery timeline, so there’s risk in speculating what a concussion means for the talented cornerback’s availability in the divisional round.

It does, however, mean that Gonzalez is a long shot to practice on Wednesday and should be considered questionable for the game. (For comparison, left guard Jared Wilson suffered a concussion in Week 16 and missed two games while in the protocol, while tight end Austin Hooper suffered a concussion in Week 10 and missed one game as a result.)

For as good as Milton Williams is, Gonzalez is probably the Patriots’ most important player on defense. When the Pats have their No. 1 corner, it allows them to play the man-to-man defense Vrabel prefers.

Without Gonzalez, the Pats would turn to Charles Woods, who has been fine for them in a fill-in role this season. But he still would be a meaningful drop-off from the Pro Bowl-level play of Gonzalez.

“How long that lasts, I don’t know,” Vrabel said of Gonzalez being in the concussion protocol. “So wherever that goes, that goes, but we appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. … Hopefully, we’ll get him back.”

Can Rhamondre Stevenson keep it going?

There were a lot of reasons to throw cold water on the New England running game — Stevenson, especially — one month ago.

Through the first 13 weeks of the season, he ranked 51st among running backs in yards after contact (2.82). Since then, though, he ranks first (7.34).

It’s been a dramatic turnaround for Stevenson, who has returned to playing like one of the game’s top running backs over the last month. Since the team’s Week 14 bye, Stevenson ranks second among running backs in expected points added and first in success rate.

If he can keep up his hot play, that would go a long way toward helping the offense bounce back next weekend. Still, despite his 128 all-purpose yards, it’s noteworthy that Stevenson only got 10 carries Sunday night.

“We’ll evaluate that and kind of see where it is,” Vrabel said when asked whether Stevenson should have gotten the ball more. “Again, we were able to stay balanced. Some of those checkdowns, I felt like, were part of the idea. Those guys were going to take some of the (deep) stuff away.”

What should we make of the pass rush?

For the first time in 18 games this season, the Patriots recorded a pressure rate over 50 percent in their win over the Chargers.

They did it by blitzing at a 43 percent clip, their second-highest mark of the season, per Tru Media. Still, the 56 percent pressure rate the Pats recorded Sunday is astounding.

So many people deserve credit for that. Milton Williams was great, everything the Patriots envisioned when they made him the team’s highest-paid player last offseason. Cory Durden was quietly excellent, matching Williams’ seven pressures for the team high. He has been an under-the-radar important player for the Pats. And K’Lavon Chaisson had a pair of sacks.

As the Pats begin prep for next week, expecting similar results is probably wishful thinking. The Chargers had the NFL’s worst offensive line this season. A more realistic target for next week would be a pressure rate of 40, which the Patriots did seven times during the regular season.

Are there concerns about the rookie O-linemen?

While Vrabel admitted there were some tough moments for rookie left tackle Will Campbell and rookie left guard Jared Wilson in pass protection on Sunday, he later came to their defense.

That’s because on one play where they were beaten, they set in a certain way because quarterback Drake Maye was supposed to throw it quickly, but did not get rid of the ball. The pressure got to him.

Wilson allowed two sacks in the game, and Campbell allowed one. But Campbell was excellent in run blocking and finished as the offense’s highest-graded player, according to Pro Football Focus.

“(They) had some good plays, had some plays they’d like to have back,” Vrabel said of the left side of the offensive line. “We just put 65, 70 plays out there. There’s going to be some good ones, there’s going to be some bad ones, and hopefully there’s not too many of them that get you beat.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/12163850/GettyImages-2243464343-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-13 12:02:31.825903

As the team left the locker room after losing to the 49ers in the Wild Card round, Landon Dickerson spoke to reporters about the pain he was playing through all season.

Dickerson didn’t detail all the issues he was dealing with, but said it was “a lot” and ultimately was “shitty” to have to endure.

He underwent knee surgery during training camp, returned in Week 1 only to leave the Cowboys game early with a back injury. Dickerson was then ruled out of the Eagles Week 5 game with an ankle injury, and in Week 14, suffered an ankle injury that sidelined him for portion of the game — he was able to return, but ultimately was just the latest in his long list of ailments.

The 27-year-old guard kept suiting up each week because he didn’t want to let his teammates down. Dickerson also revealed that he’s not sure if he’ll require offseason surgery, and in one of the more depressing quotes to come out of the post-game, admitted he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to return to full health.

E.J. Smith of PHLY Sports reported that when asked if he’ll make a full recovery, Dickerson said, “If I had that answer, I’d feel a lot better.”

Given his injury history coming out of college, and the long seasons he’s endured in Philly, being able to keep him healthy is going to be a factor moving forward.

There are more questions about the offensive line this offseason than the Eagles have had to deal with in a long time — Can Landon Dickerson and Cam Jurgens get healthy? Is Lane Johnson coming back, and can he get healthy? Is Tyler Steen still the guy at right guard? Can the group return to the top of the league?

Collins, a former third-round pick from Michigan, has been C.J. Stroud's go-to target over the years. The Michigan product has racked up 289 receptions for 4,347 yards with 24 touchdowns over the past five seasons.

During the second half of the Texans-Steelers game, Collins tried catching a pass from Stroud over the middle of the field. The plat resulted in his head crashing straight down into the turf at Acrisure Stadium.

Unsurprisingly, Collins was evaluated for a concussion. ESPN's camera crew eventually showed him leaving the field on a medical cart. As you'd imagine, that left fans awfully concerned about his health.

""Nico Collins is not okay. He took a huge hit and is definitely concussed,"" a fan wrote on social media. ""He apparently couldn’t get to the right locker room. Pray.""

Stafford injured his finger in the first half of the Rams’ 34-31 victory over the Panthers last Saturday when he banged his hand into the arm of a Carolina defender while throwing a pass.

The MVP candidate was able to play through the injury in the wild-card round, leading the Rams’ dramatic comeback for the Super Bowl champion’s sixth career playoff victory.

Coach Sean McVay said Monday that Stafford will be available when Los Angeles (13-5) faces Chicago in the divisional round on Sunday.

“He’s as tough as it gets, but he’s feeling good,” McVay said. “He was able to push through it, and he’ll be good to go.”

McVay also said cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon will miss the rest of the Rams’ season after reinjuring his shoulder blade. The nine-year veteran will be placed on injured reserve.

The Rams got more encouraging news about Kevin Dotson, with McVay saying the right guard has “a good chance” to return this weekend from his sprained ankle.

Dotson, a key part of the Rams’ rushing attack, sprained his ankle last month when it was stepped on by Seattle linebacker Derick Hall, who received a one-game suspension for his actions.

Witherspoon began the season as a starter for the Rams, but he has played only seven games in a secondary that has been repeatedly exposed as the defense’s weakest link, with or without his presence.

Witherspoon broke his shoulder blade in Week 2 at Tennessee, although the injury initially was reported by the Rams as a broken collarbone. He missed 2 1/2 months before returning for the final four regular-season games as a reserve.

He played just 12 snaps at Carolina before getting hurt again, and McVay confirmed that Witherspoon’s ninth NFL season is over. Witherspoon had one interception and eight tackles for the Rams this season.

Cobie Durant moved into Witherspoon’s starting spot after Week 2, and he kept the spot after Witherspoon’s return. Durant had an early interception in the Rams’ win at Carolina.

For the second straight year, wide receiver Gabe Davis suffered a major left knee injury, this time a torn ACL, coach Sean McDermott said Monday.

Davis returned to the Bills this season after he played 10 games with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2024 before suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee. He was able to return to the field with Buffalo in Week 11, playing in six regular-season games and Sunday's wild-card win at Jacksonville.

Buffalo also will be without starting safety Jordan Poyer on Saturday after a hamstring injury kept him out of the second half against the Jaguars. Rookie Jordan Hancock played in his place, but the Bills have rotated players at the spot because of injuries.

""It was good to get [Hancock] the reps he got and did some really good things out there, especially for a young player that hasn't played a ton, in terms of consistently back there,"" McDermott said. ""He's been in certain packages for us, but he did a good job.""

Elsewhere, McDermott said the Bills will open the practice windows of defensive tackle Ed Oliver and wide receiver Curtis Samuel.

Oliver has been on injured reserve since Oct. 28 and had surgery for a torn left biceps. He also dealt with an ankle injury early in the season. In three games, he had three sacks and a forced fumble.

""Ed's certainly a talented player,"" defensive coordinator Bobby Babich said. ""He's had some time off, so we just got to see where he's at.""

Samuel's potential return comes as the Bills navigate losses at receiver, including Davis and Joshua Palmer (ankle), who was put on season-ending injured reserve Saturday.

When asked if he felt good with the group they have or if the Bills would be looking outside at receiver, McDermott said, ""Yeah, I feel good with the group we have.""

When it comes to the health of their franchise quarterback, Josh Allen did not miss a snap but took a bit of a beating during the win in Jacksonville. He made two visits to the medical tent, including being cleared for a possible concussion, after coming into the game with a right foot injury.

McDermott said Allen is ""certainly sore. And as you know, he's going to do whatever it takes to play.""

Allen has not missed a start since his rookie season.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0112%2Fr1599880_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 01:14:16.874881

Collins was injured after quarterback C.J. Stroud threw a pass to him on a slant route early in the fourth quarter with Houston leading 7-6. Collins fell on his face, dropped the ball and immediately put both of his hands to his face in apparent pain.

Houston's training staff took Collins to the blue medical tent, and the three-time 1,000-yard receiver was carted to the locker room shortly after and later ruled out.

Texans coach DeMeco Ryans didn't have an update on Collins after the game, saying only, ""We'll see how the week goes.""

Collins also sustained a concussion earlier this season, in the Texans' loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7. He returned in a loss to the Denver Broncos in Week 9.

The Texans have a short week, next playing Sunday in the divisional round at the New England Patriots.

Collins had three receptions on seven targets for 21 yards against the Steelers. He led the Texans in the regular season in receiving yards with 1,117 and was tied for the lead in receiving touchdowns with six.

The Texans also lost wide receiver Justin Watson to a concussion in the second half. Safety Jaylen Reed, who was activated from injured reserve early Monday after a forearm injury, left briefly in the first quarter because of a knee injury.

Full game recap:

Patriots coach Mike Vrabel talked to his team about being prepared to bleed as New England entered its first playoff game since the 2021 season.

Then, shortly after Milton Williams sacked the Chargers' Justin Herbert on Sunday night to secure the Patriots' first playoff victory in seven years, Williams celebrated with a head-butt of Vrabel.

It knocked the first-year coach backward and bloodied his lip.

“The big dogs come out in January. I think Milt took that to heart,” Vrabel said. “He came over and got me pretty good. But that’s what happens.”

>> Who will Patriots play next? New England awaits winner of Monday Night Football game on WMUR-TV

Drake Maye threw a touchdown pass to Hunter Henry in the fourth quarter, and New England's defense roughed up Herbert as the Patriots beat Los Angeles 16-3 in an AFC wild-card playoff game.

Andy Borregales kicked three field goals for the Patriots (15-3), who hadn't won in the postseason since their Super Bowl victory to cap the 2018 season. They’ll host the winner of Monday night’s game between Pittsburgh and Houston in the divisional round.

In his playoff debut, Maye completed 17 of 29 passes for 268 yards and ran for a team-high 66 yards.

“We made plays when we had to do it,” Maye said.

He also threw an interception and lost a fumble, but the Chargers (11-7) couldn't capitalize on those turnovers.

New England held Los Angeles to 207 yards of offense and sacked Herbert six times, with one of those resulting in a lost fumble that set up the Patriots' TD.

“It's on us, what we do. I've been saying that all season,” Williams said. “We can control the game. If we do what we need to do up front, we're going to win.”

This is the second straight season in which the Chargers have lost in the wild-card round. Herbert finished 19 of 31 for 159 yards and was his team's leading rusher with 57 yards as he fell to 0-3 in the playoffs.

Herbert was just over a month removed from surgery to repair a broken bone in his nonthrowing hand.

“There was no issue,” Herbert said. “I just have to do a better job holding on to the ball.”

Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said his quarterback wasn't 100 percent.

“He’s a warrior. He just gives it everything he has, all the time,” Harbaugh said, acknowledging that Herbert was limited by his hand injury. “It’s an issue, but he doesn’t flinch, like a warrior would.”

The last time the Chargers failed to score a TD in the playoffs was their 21-12 AFC championship game loss to the Patriots during the 2007 season.

The Patriots drove into the red zone on their first possession of the third quarter, but the drive ended when Maye was strip-sacked by Odafe Oweh and De'Shawn Hand recovered for the Chargers.

After Los Angeles punted, Maye connected on a pass to Kayshon Boutte that went for 42 yards to set the Patriots up on the Chargers 27. But New England settled for a 39-yard field goal that stretched their lead to 9-3.

Early in the fourth quarter, Maye used a 16-yard pass to Boutte and a 13-yard burst by Rhamondre Stevenson to set up his precise 28-yard TD toss to Henry that put the Patriots in front 16-3.

The Chargers picked up back-to-back first downs to open their ensuing drive. But when Herbert dropped back to pass on the next play, linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson strip-sacked him and fell on loose ball.

Los Angeles had one final possession, but it ended with Herbert getting sacked by Williams on fourth down.

“It’s playoff football. It’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get nasty. But you’ve got to keep going,” Williams said.

The opening quarter had lots of action, but it took until early in the second quarter for the Patriots to end a scoreless stalemate.

With New England pinned inside its own 10 after a Chargers punt, Maye had a pass intended for Austin Hooper tipped by Teair Tart and intercepted by Daiyan Henley.

Los Angeles started with the ball on the Patriots 10 but was stopped on fourth-and-2 when Herbert misfired a pass to Keenan Allen.

The Patriots took over and got some breathing room via a 48-yard catch-and-run by Stevenson.

Thirteen plays and a fourth-down conversion later, the drive ended with Borregales' 23-yard field goal.

Daily best bets & picks

George Kittle, TE, San Francisco 49ers

It seems like the 49ers can’t go a single week without a key player being lost to injury this year. Not only will they not have George Kittle for the remainder of the playoffs, but they will almost surely lose him for the upcoming season as well. Kittle tore his Achilles shortly before halftime in Philadelphia and was ruled out shortly after that. San Francisco has to travel to Seattle to face its divisional rival this week, but the offense will be missing yet another weapon. Receiver Ricky Pearsall also missed the game against Philly. San Francisco had Kittle, Pearsall, and Jauan Jennings to start the year with hope that Brandon Aiyuk would come back around the middle of the season. Jennings could be the only one of that quartet available to take on the Seahawks this week. Without Kittle, Jake Tonges will be asked to step up once again.

Josh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills

Tyrell Shavers, WR, Buffalo Bills

Gabe Davis, WR, Buffalo Bills

The Bills won in Jacksonville Sunday, but it didn’t come without a cost. Josh Allen came into the game with an existing foot injury, then he was checked for a concussion and dealt with a knee issue during the game. The knee injury looked especially scary since his knee locked up and was bent during a tackle attempt at the goalline. There doesn’t seem to be much concern about Allen missing the game against the Broncos, but he is clearly not 100% right now.

Also of concern is the depth in the receiver room. Gabe Davis is likely done for the playoffs with a knee injury, but the swelling hasn’t gone down enough yet to give a proper diagnosis. Tyrell Shavers was also dealing with a leg injury during the game on Sunday. Buffalo could head into Denver with Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks and Keon Coleman as their main options. That’s not the best matchup against a talented Denver defense.

Matthew Stafford, QB, Los Angeles Rams

The Rams were in a fight against the Panthers and pulled out a victory on the road on Saturday. However, Matthew Stafford had an X-ray on his throwing hand. While he is “good to go” according to coach Sean McVay, Stafford did suffer a sprained index finger. It will be interesting to see how the week unfolds and if there are any lingering issues with that finger for Stafford as the Rams prepare for Chicago this week.

As we wrap up one of the most exciting first rounds in recent memory, the Steelers once again find themselves hosting a pivotal game. After narrowly surviving DK Metcalf’s suspension, Pittsburgh now looks to keep the AFC’s best defense from forcing Aaron Rodgers into retirement. C.J. Stroud, who has now made the playoffs in each of his first three seasons, will try to direct his team to another first-round victory instead of succumbing to the Steel City voodoo.

Below, I’ll break down where we can find some scoring opportunities in this low-total game, along with everything else you need to know for this NFL DFS showdown slate.

Wild Card Weekend MNF Showdown: Texans @ Steelers

Total: 38.5; Spread: HOU -3

Weather: Cold, but nothing else of note

Injury News/Notes

Houston: Jawhar Jordan out; Trent Brown returning; Jaylen Reed questionable to return from IR (he may play a meaningful amount of safety snaps)

Pittsburgh: Metcalf returning

Game Breakdown

Note: Lack of a mention does not imply a bad matchup. If a star player has a neutral matchup, I won’t bore you with two paragraphs about how they could do a bit above or below average. This is intended to point out spots that are particularly high-upside, volatile or concerning.

At the very least, he will fall right in line with the nine-month recovery timeline that was initially reported after he suffered the injury.
But realistically, probably like Week 3, Week 4, just to make sure and just getting back into football.""
The Packers are also in line to get tight end Tucker Kraft (torn ACL) and defensive lineman Devonte Wyatt (fibula, ankle) back from season-ending injuries.
Kraft implied he's in line for a Week 1 return, while Wyatt said he'll be ready for training camp.","The Green Bay Packers lost star pass rusher Micah Parsons to a torn ACL almost one month ago, and according to the prized preseason trade acquisition, the recovery process is off to an excellent start. Parsons said that the feedback he received over the first few weeks since his surgery is that he is ""flying"" through rehab, and he already has his eyes on a return to the field in the first quarter of the 2026 season.

While it may be a stretch for Parsons to return to the Packers' lineup in Week 1, early indications suggest that he may make his 2026 debut slightly ahead of schedule. At the very least, he will fall right in line with the nine-month recovery timeline that was initially reported after he suffered the injury.

""In September I want to be at a really good spot,"" Parsons said. ""So far, they say I'm fine. So whatever that means. There's a timing standpoint they want. I don't think I'll be on IR to start the season. I think, lofty, I'd be saying Week 1. But realistically, probably like Week 3, Week 4, just to make sure and just getting back into football.""

Avoiding an injured reserve stint at the beginning of the campaign would be a win for Parsons, who missed the final three weeks of the 2025 regular season in addition to the Packers' Wild Card round loss to the Chicago Bears. When all is said and done, he could miss fewer than eight total games with the serious knee injury.

The Packers are also in line to get tight end Tucker Kraft (torn ACL) and defensive lineman Devonte Wyatt (fibula, ankle) back from season-ending injuries. Kraft implied he's in line for a Week 1 return, while Wyatt said he'll be ready for training camp.

CBS Sports injury analyst Marty Jaramillo said last month that one of the biggest hurdles Parsons will face in his recovery is the strengthening required to prepare his body for the demands of high-level pass rushing. Parsons' position, and the high motor with which he plays, could set the stage for a longer than usual rehab period. The former first-round pick acknowledged that reality himself.

""Practicing hard and getting ready to sustain taking my body through what I go through -- I think it's just more of that,"" Parsons said. ""I play so free and go. I gotta learn how to simulate that in practice before they send me out there on the field.""

The long-term outlook for players who suffer torn ACLs is much brighter now than it once was, and Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley set a high bar for Parsons once he returns. Hafley said he foresees Parsons coming back ""even better"" and breaking the sack record in 2026. The same sack record that Myles Garrett broke this year with 23.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/12/536ee282-17f0-4208-a71f-efcbf45b16e9/thumbnail/1200x675/b34bf6ad89b097ee7ec5a21c7facba33/gettyimages-2248615617-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 01:14:58.481487

O-Line Consistency For the first time since 2012, the Jets started the same 5 offensive linemen in every game this season.
C Josh Myers played 100 percent of offensive snaps (1,048), while rookie RT Armand Membou and Joe Tippmann -- who moved to right guard ahead of Week 1 -- played all but 1 snap.
RB Breece Hall, who played 640 (61.07%) offensive snaps, had the most productive season of his career.
Beck played just 110 offensive snaps this season, but the seventh-year veteran matched his career-high in receiving TDs (2).","In the first season under GM Darren Mougey and HC Aaron Glenn, the Jets (3-14) fell short of their goals. The team struggled to play complementary football, and several position groups were battered by injuries.

Mougey and Glenn, however, addressed several roster needs throughout the season, and newcomers stepped up late. Ahead of Week 18, the roster included 16 players that were not with the team prior to Aug. 19, and 11 of those players were acquired after Week 1. There were also 10 players on the active roster who were originally signed to the practice squad.

Here's a look at the snap count and how playing time was distributed during the 2025 season.

O-Line Consistency

For the first time since 2012, the Jets started the same 5 offensive linemen in every game this season. C Josh Myers played 100 percent of offensive snaps (1,048), while rookie RT Armand Membou and Joe Tippmann -- who moved to right guard ahead of Week 1 -- played all but 1 snap. Olu Fashanu played 1,040 snaps (99.24%) while John Simpson played 1,016 (96.95%).

This consistency allowed the Jets to find some success up front as the team the No. 10 ranked rushing offense (123.3 yards per game) in the league.

RB Breece Hall, who played 640 (61.07%) offensive snaps, had the most productive season of his career. Hall rushed for 1,065 yards, marking the first time in his NFL career that the fourth-year player eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark. He led the team with 6 total TDs (4 rushing, 1 receiving and 1 passing), and he finished the season with 1,415 scrimmage yards, the second-highest mark of his career.

Offensive Playmakers

Outside of the O-line, the Jets struggled to find offensive consistency this season. Three quarterbacks -- Justin Fields (501/47.81%), Tyrod Taylor (251/23.95%) and Brady Cook (296/28.24%) -- started for the Green & White. Several key contributors -- including star WR Garrett Wilson (383/36.55%) and second-year RB Braelon Allen (58/5.53%) -- sustained injuries that cost them significant playing time.

Rookie TE Mason Taylor, who finished the season on injured reserve due to a neck injury, led the offense with 654 snaps (62.4%) despite missing the final four games of the season. Taylor appeared in 13 games (11 starts) and totaled a team-leading 44 receptions. The LSU product, who was a second-round pick of the Jets last April, recorded 369 receiving yards and 1 TD during his rookie campaign.

RB Breece Hall's 640 snaps were the second most of skill position players, while Fields and TE Jeremy Ruckert (494/47.14%) followed. WR John Metchie III, who was acquired during an in-season trade with the Philadelphia Eagles, did not appear in a game until Week 10, but became a significant contributor for the Green & White. He recorded 33 receptions for 274 yards and 2 TDs and played the most snaps of any Jets' receiver -- 414 (39.50%) across 9 games (7 starts).

Evolving Defense

It was a challenging year for the Jets' defense, which began working with interim defensive coordinator Chris Harris after Steve Wilks was relieved of his duties in mid-December.

The unit finished the year ranked 25th in total yards allowed per game (355.6) and 31st in points allowed per game (29.6). The Jets especially struggled to defend the run, allowing 139.5 rushing yards per game, the fourth-most in the league.

LB Jamien Sherwood, who played the second-most defensive snaps in 2024, topped the defense in 2025. Sherwood played all but 18 snaps (1,111/98.41%) and led the team with 154 total tackles, tied for the seventh-most in the league. Sherwood added 2 sacks, 8 TFL and 8 pass defenses in 2025.

The Jets' secondary underwent significant changes throughout the season. S Andre Cisco (499/44.20%) sustained a season-ending injury against Cincinnati in Week 8, and CB Sauce Gardner was traded to the Colts a few days later. Rookie CB Azareye'h Thomas (311/27.55%) stepped up, but a concussion kept him sidelined for Week 11 before a shoulder injury in December landed him on injured reserve.

It was CB Brandon Stephens who was a steady presence in the defensive backfield, playing 1,048 snaps (92.83%), while rookie S Malachi Moore played 950 (84.15%), the third-most among defensive players. Moore, a fourth-round draft selection of the Jets in 2025, started 14 games and recorded 101 total tackles, 3 TFL, 1 FF, 1 FR and 3 pass defenses.

LB Quincy Williams (784/69.44%) appeared in 13 games (12 starts) and recorded 83 total tackles, 8 TFL and a career-high 3.5 sacks.

Special Teams

Special teams were a consistent bright spot for the Green & White in 2025. The unit finished the season leading the league in average kickoff return yards (29.9) and field-goal percentage (96.6%).

On a standout unit that produced several highlight-worthy moments, FB Andrew Beck led the team with 319 snaps (67.87%) played. Beck played just 110 offensive snaps this season, but the seventh-year veteran matched his career-high in receiving TDs (2).

Sixth-year player LB Mykal Walker, who logged the second-most special teams snaps for the Green & White (306/65.11%), led the unit with 10 ST tackles. S Isaiah Oliver (300/63.83%) and CB Qwan'tez Stiggers (288/61.28%) were also consistent contributors.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/qx5zgngbghwae0cuqbn9,N,,2026-01-13 01:15:10.921193

It started in training camp when he tore the meniscus in his right knee and underwent surgery Aug. 2.
“It’s a pretty bad injury,” Hadden said.
He said he thought he had suffered a serious knee injury because he was in an enormous amount of pain.","GREEN BAY – The Green Bay Packers finished the season with 18 players on reserve injured lists.

Some say they would have been Super Bowl contenders if a few of them – Micah Parsons, Tucker Kraft, Devonte Wyatt and Elgton Jenkins, to name a few – would not have suffered season-ending injuries.

Kraft is one of them.

“If I’m betting on myself I’m going all in,” Kraft said. “One of the best players in the NFL on defense, Micah Parsons, like, yes, I do think that things would be completely different had we not lost him in the Broncos game. I’m not even going to speak of myself because we lost so many weapons.

“Elgton Jenkins, Devonte Wyatt, like excuse after excuse you could say, but like this team, we had so many weapons dialed up, loaded up, and we lost them.”

The Packers will be missing a lot of players during offseason conditioning, but some will be back for training camp.

Here’s a roundup of some of some of the injuries that were part of the 2025 season:

Right tackle Zach Tom tried to play through patellar tear, will undergo surgery soon

After he injured his right knee against the Denver Broncos, right tackle Zach Tom underwent tests and found out he had suffered a partially torn patellar tendon in his right knee. A fully torn patellar is a devastating injury and can result in a player missing an entire calendar year.

Tom said he received a platelet rich plasma injection in hopes it would help the tendon heal, but it didn’t help. He said he could have played but he was having trouble pass protecting and was at risk to suffer a fully torn patellar.

“I’m leaning toward surgery because I just want to get it over with, move on,” Tom said. “I think it’s like six months (recovery).”

Tom said he wanted to help the team as it headed into the playoffs, but when he practiced he couldn’t take on bull rushes the way he needed to when it came to pass protection. After seeing Carolina tackle Ickey Ekwonu and Chicago tackle Ozzy Trapilo tear their patellar tendons in the playoffs, he knew not playing was the right decision.

“It was probably one of the hardest decisions I had to make in my life,” Tom said. “Obviously, you want to be out there in the playoffs because that’s when you know everything’s at stake. But I just don’t think I was in position (to play).”

Defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt expects to be back for the start of training camp

In the midst of the best season of his career, Devonte Wyatt had his left ankle fallen on by teammate Warren Brinson and suffered a broken fibula and a torn ligament at Detroit. Wyatt had two screws put in his ankle and said he will take the entire offseason to recover.

The ligament tear is the worse of the injuries and will require the longest time to heal.

“It could be longer it could be shorter, it just depends on how the recovery goes,” Wyatt said. “I should be back by training camp.”

Wyatt said he felt he was on the verge of a Pro Bowl year when he got hurt and was especially pained that he couldn’t play in any of the three games against the Chicago Bears. He said getting a chance to be a starter and being able to play multiple positions on the defensive line was the biggest difference for him.

“I played a lot more this year,” he said. “It made me a lot more comfortable being on the field so long. You see what (teams) are trying to do. We had Chicago the next week, I was ready for that. That ticked me off so bad. But we’ll be back.”

Wyatt is under contract for one year at around $14 million guaranteed. He said he hadn’t talked to his agent about whether there have been negotiations on an extension, but he said his thought now is that he would play the deal out and see what happens after next season.

Cornerback Nate Hobbs vows he will return and be a factor in the Packers defense

Cornerback Nate Hobbs was almost in tears as he described his 2025 season.

It was nothing as expected after signing a four-year, $48 million free agent contract. Hobbs expected to be a starter at one of the outside corner positions, but he kept getting injured.

It started in training camp when he tore the meniscus in his right knee and underwent surgery Aug. 2. He missed the season opener and then started the next five games. He wasn’t playing at the level the Packers hoped, but was starting to get healthy when he injured his left knee against Carolina.

This injury was a sprained MCL and it sidelined him for four games. He returned to play in the first Bears game and had probably his best performance of the year. Coordinator Jeff Hafley said Hobbs added a physical presence in that game and was looking forward to him progressing.

But a week later he collided with Ravens receiver Zay Flowers in the end zone and reinjured his left knee, suffering another MCL sprain.

“I wouldn't wish this on nobody what I had to go through,” Hobbs said. “But I can honestly say now I'm getting to the point where I'm glad it happened. It's made me a better person, a better leader, a better man, and I know if I get kicked back to nothing, rock bottom, I know I could get it back, every time.

“At the end of the season, I was starting to come back alive, be myself.”

Hobbs said he knows he took a lot of criticism from the public but he said the public didn’t get to see what he can add to the Packers and he vowed they would see it next season.

“It’s just a part of it, and I understand,” Hobbs said of the criticism. ""As a fan, you give your heart and your soul to this ride, so when somebody’s not performing up to what you thought, you can be like, ‘Hey, what’s going on, man?’

“But my message to Packers nation, I don’t think you guys got to see a fair version of Nate Hobbs. I think you got to see the version of Nate Hobbs that God chose this season to teach me what he had to teach me.”

He added later, “I promise you guys I will be one of the best players on this defense.”

Cornerback Kamal Hadden will need time to overcome gruesome injury suffered against Baltimore

Cornerback Kamal Hadden was on the verge of playing a much bigger role on defense when he decided to lower his shoulder and tackle Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry.

Hadden was in the game because cornerback Carrington Valentine was not tackling well, but he was doing what he normally does as one of the team’s biggest corners. But his ankle got caught underneath him and got twisted in such a violent way that he broke both the tibia and fibula in his right leg.

Hadden is still using a knee coaster to get around and said he’s hopeful to be back next season, although it may not be in time for the season opener.

“It’s a pretty bad injury,” Hadden said. ""They said it’s a four- or five-month recovery, but I’m just taking it one day at a time, just coming in (for rehab). The main thing now is to elevate my leg and that’s what I do most of the time. Elevate and ice it in the cast and take it a day at a time.”

Hadden said he was in shock after the injury and when he looked at the way his foot was bent said it really hit him that something bad had happened. Though he has a long recovery ahead, Hadden said he would try to make that tackle again if it comes up.

“It’s sad that it happened like that, but it was a routine play,” he said. “That’s what I was coached to do, my job, and I’d do it again. It just was an unfortunate play where I just got caught up under and got rolled up on.”

Coach Matt LaFleur said Hadden was the most improved player on the roster from training camp to the season and Hadden said he felt he made strides.

“I grew and I showed my even more than I thought I could do,” Hadden said. “I just got better. And it gives me anticipation that I can go even further, the more work I put in. This injury has just helped me lock in more. I’m hurt right now, but I’ll be back 100%.”

Bo Melton said he suffered a four-week injury and will be OK

Bo Melton injured his ankle against the Minnesota Vikings and was put on injured reserve soon after.

Melton is walking around without too much of a limp and said he was told it would take him about a month to recover. If the Packers had made the Super Bowl, he might have been able to return, but he said he wasn’t expecting any delay in his return next season.

Melton was listed as a cornerback after being moved there in the offseason but he wound up playing mostly at receiver. When asked if he was going to ask to be moved back to receiver, he said he didn’t want to talk about that right now.

When he asked if there would be time for that discussion with the coaches, he said yes.

Center Sean Rhyan suffered a bone bruise in his knee, thought the injury was much worse

Center Sean Rhyan got hit on the side of his knee as he was anchored in the ground late in the playoff loss to the Bears. He said he thought he had suffered a serious knee injury because he was in an enormous amount of pain.

He said the scan he underwent showed only a bruise, although there was a lot of swelling.

“It was a full shock to my body and I just went down,” Rhyan said. “That was the first time that ever happened. That’s why I was a little bit worried. It was just one of those bad ones.

“I got a good bone bruise and a lot of swelling and inflammation. They said it might be hyperextended, too. I would have done my darnedest to be out there (next week), but I guess we’ll never know.”

Rhyan is an unrestricted free agent and he said he doesn’t know what the future will bring. But he said he wasn’t going to let it weigh on him.

“It will be what it will be,” he said. “I’m going to try to get my knee back to 100% as fast as possible so I could get back to training for next year.”","https://www.packersnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/27/PMJS/87499514007-getty-2248776082.jpg?crop=4397,2473,x3,y317&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-12 21:13:42.936532

But his first playoff game came to a premature end when he sustained a head injury, and coach Mike Vrabel said that Gonzalez is in concussion protocol ahead of a divisional round matchup against the winner of Monday night's meeting between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans.

Gonzalez exited the game after hitting his head on the turf while in coverage against Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston. The Patriots initially ruled him questionable to return, but later downgraded him to out after he went into the locker room for evaluation.

""Gonzo continues to play at a high level,"" Vrabel said in Monday's media availability. ""Those are the expectations that he has for himself and that we have for him. I would say that he would be in the protocol. How long that lasts, I don't know. But when you don't return to the game, when they won't let you go back in the game, that would put him in the protocol. So wherever that goes, that goes. But we appreciate what he's done and his willingness to line up in different places. … He's handled that all really well, and hopefully we'll get him back.""

Patriots' suddenly dominant defense becomes the biggest wild card of the NFL playoffs

Tyler Sullivan

Gonzalez told reporters in the locker room after Sunday's win that he was not allowed to speak with the media, but he also said in that interaction that he was ""fine."" His availability for the next round of the postseason will be among the most impactful storylines to follow on the New England side as he has been one of the NFL's best pass defenders since his arrival in the league in 2023.

""I did talk to him,"" Vrabel said in his weekly WEEI radio appearance. ""We'll go through whatever the steps are that would require him to pass through whatever he needs to do. Without having seen him today -- I can't sit here and speculate -- I just know that they wouldn't let him go back into the game.""

While he remains in search of his first interception of the year, Gonzalez is in the midst of a fantastic campaign with 12 pass breakups (including playoffs) and a career-high 69 tackles. He earned his first Pro Bowl selection on the heels of a 2024 season in which he landed on the All-Pro second team.

Injuries have, unfortunately, cropped up in each of Gonzalez's first three professional seasons. He suffered a torn labrum in Week 4 of his rookie year and missed the final 13 games, sat one game the following year with a concussion and missed the first three contests of the present campaign with a hamstring injury he sustained in training camp.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/12/a5690e04-1011-4c61-8438-07645401b001/thumbnail/1200x675/09d8ba1f9173fbdef46740a9438040f1/gettyimages-2255809263-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 20:00:09.461905

The injury threatens to sideline Davis for the remainder of the playoffs, according to the report, which noted that swelling in his knee made it difficult for the Bills’ medical staff to formulate an initial diagnosis.

Davis, 26, was carted to the locker room in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s 27-24 road win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the wild-card round. Buffalo advanced to face the Denver Broncos, the AFC’s top seed, in the divisional round on Saturday.

Davis’ knee buckled as he was hit while trying to catch a pass in triple coverage. He previously sustained a torn PCL and meniscus in the same knee in November 2024, during his lone season as a member of the Jaguars.

Davis signed with Buffalo in September as his recovery continued and played six games during the regular season, recording 12 catches for 129 yards and one touchdown. He had two catches for 14 yards against Jacksonville in the playoff opener.

A fourth-round draft pick in 2020, Davis spent his first four seasons with the Bills. In 80 career games (61 starts), he has 195 receptions for 3,098 yards and 30 scores.

Davis' season is over.

Davis, 26, returned to Buffalo this season after spending last season with the Jaguars. He didn't make his season debut until Week 11 but quickly took a prominent role in the receiver rotation. He started five of the Bills' final eight games and finished the regular season with 12 catches for 129 yards.

Davis caught two of three targets for 14 yards against Jacksonville on Sunday before taking a nasty hit to his knee early in the fourth quarter. He was helped to the sideline and then eventually carted off the field. He had played roughly half of Buffalo's snaps to that point.

2026 NFL playoff schedule and bracket: Dates, times, TV for every round from divisional to Super Bowl

John Breech

Nicknamed ""Big Game Gabe"" for his previous playoff performances -- including a four-touchdown game against the Kansas City Chiefs four years ago -- Davis was one of several Bills who got banged up ahead of a divisional round matchup against the Denver Broncos, and his injury puts an already struggling receiver unit in more trouble.

Bills receiver situation vs. Broncos

Buffalo has been rolling with a by committee receiver approach all season, though the members of that committee often rotate.

Khalil Shakir has been the one constant. The slot man played on 71% of Buffalo's offensive snaps against Jacksonville, the highest of any receiver. He finished with 12 catches for 82 yards; no other player had more than three catches.

Tyrell Shavers (54% snap share) and Brandin Cooks (48%) were next in line. Cooks had three catches for 58 yards, including a crucial 36-yarder on the game-winning drive. Cooks, a midseason addition, has been up and down in his short time in Buffalo, seemingly alternating big plays and drops. Shavers had one catch for 14 yards, and he also suffered a knee injury the Bills are still evaluating, McDermott said.

The only other receiver with a catch was Keon Coleman, who brought in his lone target for a 36-yard gain. Coleman, the 2024 second-round pick who was a healthy scratch at times this season, played 43% of Buffalo's offensive snaps. He was only active Sunday because Josh Palmer (ankle) was unable to play; Palmer was ultimately placed on injured reserve.

With Davis and Palmer out and Shavers dealing with an injury, Coleman's role could increase. He's a big body (6-foot-4, 215 pounds) who has flashed the ability to win 50-50 balls but struggled with consistency throughout his brief career.

The Bills also opened the practice window for Curtis Samuel, who has not played since mid-November due to neck and elbow injuries. It remains to be determined whether he will be able to play.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/12/962b88ef-bea9-4c9e-95e8-c52b61860060/thumbnail/1200x675/a7e1471f67c4b4af10412fd7eeb06473/gabe-davis-bills.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 19:00:46.523985

A torn Achilles suffered during the 49ers' win over the Eagles has ended Kittle's season. It will also presumably kick off an extended recovery and rehabilitation process over the next eight-plus months or so. Put another way: This is a really awful injury to suffer, both in the short term, in not being able to be there for your team in the playoffs, and in the long term, in how much effort and energy it will take to return to play at a healthy and high level of athletic ability.

In response to such a pitfall, Kittle responded to such a terrible moment in his NFL career the way many adults of legal-drinking age might after a long day: By apparently pounding a full bottle of hard liquor. In this case, per The Athletic's Dianna Russini, it was a bottle of Patrón tequila, seemingly special-requested by Kittle from the 49ers' owner, Jed York.

I suppose there are worse ways to cope with a horrific day at work:

I'm not sure what to say to Kittle in this moment because ""Cheers!"" is probably inappropriate ... right? That would imply Kittle had something to celebrate, which he doesn't. At any rate, good luck to the 49ers star in his long road to recovery. I'm sure he won't dwell in the dumps and (understandably) pity himself for too long. He can get it out of his system now.","https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/12/SFTW/88137653007-gty-2255766567.JPG?crop=3286,1850,x0,y170&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-12 21:13:49.796755

NFL teams have to submit a report on practice participation on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for a Saturday game. There are three levels of practice participation that can be designated: did not participate, limited participation and full participation.

A game status report is due by 4 p.m. Thursday for Saturday games.

Here is the Bills vs. Broncos injury report for the divisional round of the playoffs.

Buffalo Bills injury update for playoffs

Jordan Poyer, S, hamstring

Jordan Poyer re-aggravated a hamstring injury in the second quarter against the Jaguars and did not return. He was replaced by rookie Jordan Hancock.

Poyer missed the final two games of the regular season with a hamstring injury that occurred while recording a half-sack on Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders late in the fourth quarter in Week 16.

Poyer, 34, who began the season on the Bills practice squad and was considered back with the organization as a mentor, was second on the team in tackles in the regular season. He finished the regular season with 70 tackles, one interception and a half sack in 10 games in 2025.

Gabe Davis, WR, knee

Gabe Davis suffered a left knee injury and was carted to the locker room in the fourth quarter against the Jaguars on Sunday.

He dropped a pass over the middle, took a hard hit and was helped off the field by trainers. Davis was carted from the sideline with a towel over his head ruled out for the game with a left knee injury.

Davis left the locker room on crutches after the game posted a photo of his leg in a brace on his Instagram story with the caption ""Appreciate everybody reaching out.""

Davis had two catches for 14 yards versus Jacksonville before the injury.

Davis suffered a season-ending left knee injury last year as a member of the Jaguars.

With Davis out, the Bills will likely have Curtis Samuel or Mecole Hardman active against the Broncos.

Josh Allen, QB, foot/knee

Josh Allen was took two trips to the blue medical tent against a physical Jaguars defense in the wild-card round.

Allen was evaluated for a concussion and cleared to return in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, his right throwing hand jammed into the helmet of offensive guard O'Cyrus Torrence on a follow through. Three plays later, Allen plowed into the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown run but his left knee bent as he was knocked backward. Allen went back into the tent but returned to the bench and didn't miss any plays.

""It was more of a precautionary thing,"" Allen said in his postgame press conference. ""Just got rolled up on and they wanted to take a quick look, but we're all good.""

Allen underwent X-rays postgame on his right foot in Week 16 and Week 17 and only played one snap to extend his consecutive starts streak in Week 18 as the Bills rested multiple starters.

He originally suffered the foot injury while retreating and falling to the ground on a 22-yard sack against the Browns in Week 16. Allen limped off the field and was evaluated by athletic trainers as he sat on the bench late in the second quarter. He walked to the locker room with trainers just prior to halftime with his right cleat off and received X-rays, which were negative. Allen returned for the second half and did not miss any plays.

Allen played the entirety versus the Eagles, rushing for two touchdowns in the final 5:11 of the game, but he was sacked five times. He appeared to be favoring the foot and attempted all of his passes from the pocket for the first time in his career.

Ty Johnson, RB, ankle

Ty Johnson was inactive with an ankle injury against the Jaguars. He was spotted in a walking boot entering EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville on Sunday.

Johnson suffered the injury while getting 15 touches and scoring two touchdowns in the Week 18 win over the Jets.

Shaq Thompson, LB, neck

Shaq Thompson entered the wild-card game against the Jaguars listed as questionable but played all 56 of the Bills' defensive snaps and was a difference-maker.

Thompson intercepted Trevor Lawrence in the first quarter, which set up Matt Prater's 50-yard field goal to open the scoring. He finished with a game-high eight tackles.

Terrel Bernard, LB, elbow

Terrel Bernard has missed the last two games since exiting with a calf injury against the Eagles in Week 17.

He did not practice all week leading up to the wild-card round. The Bills' defensive captain recorded 65 taclkes, two forced fumbles and an interception in 12 games in 2025.

Bernard also missed three games this season with a dislocated elbow.

Maxwell Hairston, CB, ankle

Maxwell Hairston did not play in the wild-card win over the Jaguars.

He suffered an ankle injury in the fourth quarter of the regular season finale against the New York Jets.

The rookie first-round pick was hurt while making a tackle on wide receiver Quentin Skinner. Hairston seemed to plant awkwardly, lunged at Skinner and landed on his right knee, then was inadvertently collided with by rookie linebacker Keonta Jenkins.

Hairston walked gingerly to the blue medical tent before heading to the locker room. He did not return. Hairston was spotted wearing a walking boot on his right foot after the game.

Hairston spent the first six games of the season on injured reserve with a right knee injury he suffered during training camp.

Matt Prater, K, right quadriceps

Matt Prater's injured quadriceps held up to win the kicking battle against the Jaguars. Prater played despite entering the game as questionable. He went 2-for-2 on field goals, with makes from 50 and 47 yards, and 3-for-3 on extra points. Punter Mitch Wishnowsky handled kickoff duties to save Prater's leg. Jacksonville's Cam Little, who holds the NFL record for the two longest field goals in history and entered the game with 20 straight made field goals, missed a 54-yarder to end the first half.

Prater, 41, missed the last 2 1/2 games of the regular season after injuring, then re-aggravating his right quadriceps. He made 18 of 20 field-goal attempts and 46 of 49 extra points for 100 points in 15 games this season.

Damar Hamlin, S, pectoral

Damar Hamlin suffered pectoral injury in practice Oct. 9 and was placed on injured reserve.

Buffalo opened Hamlin's 21-day practice window on Jan. 7. He logged three limited practices but did not come off injured reserve to play against the Jaguars in the wild-card game.

Hamlin was eligible to return in Week 11, although Bills coach Sean McDermott said it's ""up in the air"" if Hamlin's injury is season-ending.

Hamlin started 14 games in 2024 but played a reserve role in 2025. He had one tackle in five regular season games.

DaQuan Jones, DT, calf

DaQuan Jones returned for the playoffs after missing Week 17 and Week 18 with a calf injury. He played 39 snaps, 70% of Buffalo's defensive snaps, and had one tackle.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Ed Oliver suffered a torn biceps injury that required and is out indefinitely. He was placed on on injured reserve on Oct. 28 and was eligible to return in Week 13.

Oliver was hurt in the second quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

He missed four games earlier this season (Weeks 2-5) with an ankle injury after he got stepped on in practice on Sept. 10.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Oliver could potentially return for the playoffs.

McDermott gave an update on Dec. 28 that Oliver suffered a minor setback in his recovery but is ""moving in a good direction.""

Curtis Samuel, WR, elbow

Curtis Samuel has been on injured reserve since Nov. 28.

He has seven receptions for 81 yards and a touchdown and nine kickoff returns for 223 yards (24.5 avg.) in six games in 2025.

Jordan Phillips, DT, ankle

Jordan Phillips was placed on injured reserve on Jan. 7.

He missed Week 16 and Week 17 with an ankle injury but played in Week 18. Phillips recorded nine tackles and one sack in 11 games in 2025.

Joshua Palmer, WR, ankle

The Bills placed Joshua Palmer on injured reserve on Jan. 10, ending his season.

Palmer finished with 22 catches for 303 receiving yards and no touchdowns in 12 games in 2025.

This was Palmer's first year of a three-year, $29 million contract.

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Jackson is out for the rest of the season.

Taylor Rapp, S, knee

Taylor Rapp was placed on injured reserve on Oct. 24.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Rapp was battling an injury since training camp and ""it got to the point where he can't be himself.""

Rapp had 26 tackles in six games this season.

Michael Hoecht, DE, Achilles

Michael Hoecht tore his right Achilles in the fourth quarter of the win against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

He suffered the non-contact injury while taking one step into his rush off the left edge with 14:25 remaining. Hoecht was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Bass underwent season-ending surgery in November.

Cameron Johnston, P, foot/ankle

Cameron Johnston suffered left foot and ankle injuries after taking a hit to his left plant leg on a punt in the fourth quarter in the Week 4 win over the Saints. The Bills placed him on injured reserve on Sept. 30 and signed punter Mitch Wishnowsky.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Dorian Strong, CB, neck

Dorian Strong played in four games with one start before suffering a neck injury and being placed on injured reserve on Oct. 4. The rookie sixth-round pick was eligible to return in Week 10.

DeWayne Carter, DT, Achilles

DeWayne Carter suffered a torn Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.

Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, recorded 14 tackles, five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits and a pass defended in 11 games last year.

Chase Lundt, OT, knee

Chase Lundt, a rookie sixth-round pick, was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 19. Lundt has appeared in two games, with three offensive snaps and five special teams snaps, in 2025.

Wande Owens, S, undisclosed

The undrafted rookie was waived Aug. 23 with an injury designation and went unclaimed on waivers.

Denver Broncos injury update for playoffs

Dre Greenlaw, LB, hamstring

Drew Greenlaw was out the final two games of the regular season with a hamstring injury. He played eight regular games and missed nine games due to injury and suspension in his first season in Denver.

Greenlaw was on injured reserve earlier this season with a quadriceps injury, missing the first six games and making his season debut in Week 7. He was also suspended for one game for running at a referee.

Greenlaw has 45 tackles, one sack, one forced fumble and one interception in eight games in 2025.

Greenlaw suffered a torn Achilles as a member of the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 58 in February 2024. He played two games for the 49ers in 2024 and signed a three-year contract with the Broncos in March.

P.J. Locke, S, leg

P.J. Locke suffered a leg injury in Week 18.

Locke has started for the Broncos in place of Brandon Jones, who is on injured reserve.

McVay said that he fully expects Stafford to be on the field Sunday when his team takes on the Bears at Soldier Field.

“He's as tough as it gets, but he's feeling good,” McVay said. “He was able to push through it, and he'll be good to go.”

Stafford is considered to be a strong contender for the MVP award after a stellar 2025 season, where he threw for 4,707 yards and 46 touchdowns for the Rams. He also threw just eight interceptions on the year, and was named a first-team All-Pro for the first time in his storied NFL career.

In Saturday’s game against the Carolina Panthers, Stafford suffered the finger injury during the first half but still put together a strong performance, throwing for 304 yards and three touchdowns as the Rams beat Carolina 34-31 to advance in the postseason.

But the All-Pro defensive end believes he can recover in time to play early next season.

Speaking to reporters for the first time since his Dec. 14 injury, Parsons said Monday that he hopes to be back for the start of the season, but added that a more realistic goal is ""probably like Week 3, Week 4.""

""I wouldn't wish this on anyone,"" Parsons said. ""I don't think people realize how much the knee is. It's the most challenging thing that I think I've ever faced as a human. When you talk about pain, can't sleep, can't move around. … I can't remember the last time I slept through the night. My body's tired. My mind's tired. I'm exhausted, man. But it's going to be worth it once I'm going to be able to move and play again.""

Parsons and tight end Tucker Kraft both discussed their recoveries from torn ACLs as the Packers packed up their lockers two days after blowing a 15-point, fourth-quarter lead in a 31-27 wild-card playoff loss at Chicago.

Kraft, who tore his right ACL on Nov. 2, compared this injury to the torn pectoral muscle that caused him to spend part of the 2024 preseason on the physically unable to perform list. Kraft returned in time to play all 17 games that season.

""By the time Week 1 rolls around, I'll be 10 months post-surgery and hopefully bulletproof by then,"" Kraft said.

The Packers were leading the Denver Broncos in the second half when Parsons hurt his left knee, knocking him out for the rest of this season. They didn't win again, losing their last five games.

It's the first major injury of Parsons' career. It ended his first season in Green Bay prematurely after the Packers acquired him in an August trade with the Dallas Cowboys.

""I'm not a very vulnerable person and during this period I've probably been the most vulnerable I've been in the last like, probably my whole life, Parsons said. ""I'm telling people how much I need them and appreciate them being there for me.

""Because to be honest, man, you can't go through this injury by yourself. … Like I can't shower by myself. I can't even get off the bed myself. So I couldn't imagine being alone. So I'm so appreciative of my family being there for me.""

The injuries to Parsons and Kraft left the Packers without two of their best players.

Parsons had 12 ½ sacks this season to earn All-Pro honors despite missing the Packers' final four games. Kraft had 32 catches for 489 yards and six touchdowns despite playing only eight games.

""I was on the cusp of putting together one of the greatest seasons by a Packer tight end, and that was something I was looking forward to, just leaving my legacy on this game and playing as hard as I could every snap for the for this team, because the end of the day, the guys in this room, they mean so much to me,"" Kraft said.

Although the Packers were winless after his injury, Parsons said ""there was no point in the season where I felt like we weren't a championship-caliber team.""

The Packers led by at least nine points after halftime in three of their five losses to end the season. Another loss came when the Packers rested their starters in the regular-season finale at Minnesota.

Parsons and Kraft both expressed support for Matt LaFleur as speculation swirled about their coach's future.

""I think Matt's an outstanding head coach,"" Kraft said. ""There's no doubt in my mind that he'll remain here as a Packer. I think a lot of that talk is pretty silly.""

Parsons said LaFleur's presence was part of the reason he wanted to come to Green Bay. Parsons said he mentioned that to LaFleur after seeing questions about the coach's job status.

""You can get spoiled with good coach and good people, and you don't realize until they're gone,"" Parsons said. ""I don't want to be at that point where we realize like, 'Damn, we let such a great coach go.' ""

Parsons said players must take accountability regarding the way the season ended.

""There's a lot of reality checks that us as players need,"" Parsons said. ""Yeah, I think as fans and people I see the same things you see. People want to look at the play-calling and people want to look that, but I'm looking at the effort of the guys. I look at the how guys are playing. Are we blocking? Are we getting blocks? Are we attacking? Those are the things us players we can control. And I think more people need to realize that.""

Could it be that EMF are weakening cellular structure and collagen strength in players who have chronic exposure to these magnetic fields?","Although the San Francisco 49ers grinded out a gutsy win against the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles over the weekend, the win did not come without cost, as the 49ers lost another key component of their team to injury, as star tight end George Kittle suffered a significant Achilles injury in the second quarter. However, even before Kittle’s injury, the buzz around the league revolved around whether or not an electrical substation positioned near the 49ers home stadium may be linked to the team’s soft tissues injuries.

Even prior to Kittle’s injury, the 49ers topped the list of the most injured team in the NFL over the past decade. Since the 2014 move to Levi’s Stadium, the 49ers have consistently ranked among the league leaders in adjusted games lost (AGL), which is a metric that quantifies the impact of injuries to starters or key players. Most notably, the team ranked dead last for AGL in 2020 and 2024 when their injury burden far exceeded league average.

Many initially wrote the injuries off as fluke. Then, questions arose about the training staff and conditioning programs. But now, a new theory may actually shine light on the 49ers injury situation.

EMF Wave Transmission And Injury Rates

Peter Cowan recently decided to investigate a theory that had been circulating around the 49ers locker room for years – that a nearby electrical substation played a role in the teams’ injury rates. During his investigation, Cowan walked around the team’s practice fields, located a little over 100 yards from Silicon Valley Power’s Mission Substation. He turned on a gaussmeter and found that readings were much higher than what may be seen if measured at an average American household. Readings could be even higher in the facilities where players lift, watch film and recover. This lead Cowan to surmise that this chronic exposure to extremely low-frequency (ELF) magnetic fields could be having a physical impact on the 49ers.

Dr. Silverman Comments

This research is pretty crazy, but it’s rooted in sound science. We know that EMF has effects on human tissues. In the medical world, we can use it to help signal bones to heal in patients with delayed and non-unions. We also know that EMF can help decease pain and inflammation. So it’s not crazy to assume that since EMF needs to be properly delivered to achieve positive results (to effect the cells correctly at the nuclear level to induce the desired change) that EMF in excess can affect cells negatively.

Could it be that EMF are weakening cellular structure and collagen strength in players who have chronic exposure to these magnetic fields? Certainly. We can’t say for fact that it is absolutely the case, but the evidence seems to suggest more testing and studies are warranted. Injuries have derailed many playoff runs for San Francisco over the last decade, and they are once again facing an uphill playoff battle with a depleted squad. We’ll certainly be following their playoff run and the additional testing that is sure to come in wake of this new theory. Not only could it provide answers to the 49ers, but it could improve our medical knowledge as a whole, and that’s a win for everyone.",https://www.anklefootmd.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-1.31.27-PM-e1768246416900.png,N,,2026-01-13 00:14:04.578268

Houston finished the regular season with a 12-5 record, holding 2nd place in the AFC South, while Pittsburgh entered the playoffs at 10-7 as the AFC North champion. The Texans have two of the players with the most sacks recorded in Danielle Hunter (15) and Will Anderson Jr. (12), while the Steelers are within the top 15 teams with the fewest points per game allowed at home (21.4) this season. However, one major question that haunts the chances is: Will both teams’ key players, like Aaron Rodgers, play in the upcoming matchup? Here’s a detailed final injury report for the upcoming clash.

Will Aaron Rodgers play against the Houston Texans?

Aaron Rodgers has been managing a wrist injury late in the 2025 regular season, an issue that placed him on the injury report heading into the AFC Wild Card round. The wrist problem did not force Rodgers to miss any games, and he continued to start and finish contests while receiving treatment during the week.

According to the latest report, Rodgers was a full participant in practice this week despite the wrist issue and is listed without a game designation ahead of the matchup against the Houston Texans. The QB finished the 2025 regular season with 3,322 passing yards, averaging 207.6 yards per game, while completing 65.7% of his throws. He threw 24 touchdowns and seven interceptions. Rodgers also contributed as a runner, totaling 61 rushing yards on 21 carries with one rushing touchdown.

Amid speculations of his future with the team, Aaron Rodgers mentioned that he will be evaluating the options post-season.

“I’m 42, and I’m on a one-year deal. You know what the situation is. Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. That’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play — not a lot of options, but … I would think maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play,” he said on December 31.

Will Derek Stingley Jr. play against the Pittsburgh Steelers?

Derek Stingley Jr. is managing a new injury concern ahead of the AFC Wild Card matchup. The Houston Texans’ top cornerback has been dealing with an oblique issue late in the season. The injury surfaced during the regular-season schedule and led to Stingley being limited in practice earlier in the week. However, this didn’t hinder his consistency, and the team has handled his workload cautiously to avoid aggravation.

Oblique injuries are particularly sensitive for defensive backs due to the rotational demands of coverage and tackling. This makes his practice participation closely monitored. According to the latest injury report, Stingley progressed from limited participation to full participation in practice later in the week and does not currently carry a game-status designation.

Derek Stingley Jr. finished the 2025 regular season with 36 total tackles, including 26 solo stops, while also breaking up 15 passes and recording four interceptions. He added a forced fumble and even scored a defensive touchdown. Stingley appeared in all 17 games for the second straight season.

Gonzalez broke on a pass intended for receiver Quentin Johnston at the 14:20 mark of the final quarter, nearly intercepting it as he dove in front of Johnston. But when Johnston worked back toward the line of scrimmage to try to catch the pass, he landed on the helmet of the diving Gonzalez.

Vrabel said in his weekly interview on sports radio WEEI on Monday that Gonzalez had not been cleared to return to the game Sunday night. When Vrabel later met with reporters, he noted that when a player is in that situation, he is officially entered into concussion protocol.

""How long that lasts, I don't know,"" Vrabel said. ""Hopefully we'll get him back.""

The Patriots will host the winner of Monday night's game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans on Sunday at Gillette Stadium (either 3 p.m. ET or 6:30 p.m. ET).

Gonzalez, who was voted a Pro Bowler this season for the first time in his three-year career, has started 15 games. He has totaled 69 tackles while recording a team-high 12 passes defended, but no interceptions. He finished fifth in Associated Press All-Pro voting at the position.

""Gonzo continues to play at a high level,"" Vrabel said. ""We appreciate what he's done and his willingness to line up different places. He's handled that all really well.""

The Patriots usually start Gonzalez opposite eight-year veteran Carlton Davis III, with Marcus Jones in the slot. Second-year pro Charles Woods is a top backup, with 2025 seventh-round draft pick Kobee Minor also on the cornerback depth chart. Third-year pro Alex Austin, who has practiced the past two weeks while remaining on injured reserve (wrist), could also potentially be part of the mix if he's added to the 53-man roster.

In Week 16, the Patriots had running back TreVeyon Henderson, receiver Kayshon Boutte and left guard Jared Wilson all enter concussion protocol due to injuries sustained in a win over the Baltimore Ravens.

Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed on Monday that Gonzalez is in the NFL's concussion protocol and it is not yet known how long until he could be cleared to play.

""I would say that he would be in the protocol. How long that lasts, I don't know. When you don't return to the game and they won't let you return to the game, that would put you in the protocol. Wherever that goes, that goes,"" Vrabel said during his Monday news conference.

New England next plays Sunday against either the Pittsburgh Steelers or Houston Texans.

Boston Herald reporter Zack Cox said after the game that Gonzalez was in the locker room and said he felt ""fine,"" but could not talk to reporters due to NFL concussion policy.

Will Christian Gonzalez be out this week?

The speed of a player exiting concussion protocol can vary. Earlier this season against the Baltimore Ravens, Patriots players TreyVeon Henderson, Kayshon Boutte and Jared Wilson all suffered concussions.

Henderson was back the next week without missing any game action. Boutte returned after missing one game, while Wilson missed multiple weeks.

Gonzalez suffered the injury early in the fourth quarter as he broke up a pass intended for Chargers wide receiver Question Johnston. After Gonzalez dove to the turf making a play on the ball, Johnston landed on the cornerback's head.

The television broadcast captured Gonzalez walking slowly up the tunnel toward the locker room, and he was ruled out a short time later.

The Pro Bowl cornerback was having a stellar performance before the injury.

The 49ers tight end was carted off towards the end of the first half in Philadelphia, before San Francisco went on to secure a famous 23-19 playoff victory against the Super Bowl champions.

It means he will not be available for the rest of the postseason, while he also faces a battle to be fit for the 2026 campaign.

And incredibly, Kittle's Achilles tear came just days after a wild conspiracy theory about the Niners' long-running injury crisis went viral online.

Over the past decade the team has been crippled by fitness issues, losing them a staggering $95million in salary cap value to players on their injured lists in 2025 alone.

According to researcher Peter Cowan, who is a board-certified quantum biology practitioner, these frequent problems are due to chronic exposure to 'low-frequency electromagnetic fields' from an electrical substation right next to their stadium and practice facility.

Cowan claims exposure to these fields can 'degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage at levels regulators call ""safe""'.

'The damage is subtle, until a routine cut or block ends in catastrophic rupture,' he added in a thread which has generated almost 10 million views on X.

The Niners have been in the top five of the Adjusted Games Lost charts - a metric that assesses how much a team is affected by injuries - for 10 of the past 11 seasons, while recording seven full Achilles or patellar ruptures in that time, according to Cowan.

The team is also said to have had over 40 major hamstring or calf tears, as well as 'high-ankle syndesmosis injuries' every season since moving to Levi's Stadium in 2014.

To support his theory, Cowan also shared readings taken with a Gaussmeter - a device for measuring magnetic fields - which showed elevated levels of exposure near San Francisco's practice field and inside team facilities.

However, there is no scientific proof that electromagnetic field exposure is directly linked to NFL injury rates.

Back in October, NFL reporter Chase Senior reported that retired 49ers guard Jon Feliciano admitted players have joked around about there being an electrical substation right next to the practice that has led to their injury woes.

Moments after his heartbreaking injury blow, Kittle requested a bottle of Patron tequila to be sent to the locker room, according to The Athletic's Dianna Russini.

The bottle was reportedly sent to him from the Niners owners' suite at Lincoln Financial Field, and within the space of four hours Russini claimed it was left empty.

It took just a few minutes for San Francisco to confirm Kittle had suffered an Achilles injury, ruling him out for the rest of the postseason and throwing his 2026 plans into turmoil too. Kyle Shanahan, the 49ers head coach, confirmed after the game that it was tear which means he will need surgery.

The incident occurred as he made a five-yard catch, his first of the night, towards the end of the first half in Philadelphia.

Here's the latest updates on George Kittle's injury.

What happened to George Kittle?

Kittle, a former Iowa football star, tore his Achilles during his team's 23-19 win over the defending Super Bowl champions, the PhiladelphiaEagles. The injury occurred around the six-minute mark of the second quarter after Kittle caught a 6-yard pass from Brock Purdy on the right sideline.

The veteran tight end tried to push off on his right leg as Eagles safety Marcus Epps approached to make the tackle when his calf appeared to pop.

Kittle remained down after the play and grabbed his right leg. The 49ers' medical staff came onto the field to tend to him. He was loaded onto the cart due to the injury and immediately taken back to the locker room.

49ers coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed to reporters after the game that Kittle had suffered a torn Achilles.

""The trainers knew before the cart came out,"" Shanahan said. ""They got word to me in the headset.""

How long is George Kittle out for?

The Achilles injury will sideline Kittle for the remainder of the playoffs.

Given that the injury occurred in January, there's a high probability the 32-year-old could miss most of the 2026-27 NFL season.

“This team has carried the character of George Kittle throughout the entire year. And since I got traded here, he's the heart and soul of this team. So, it's a tough loss,"" said 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who recorded 114 total yards and two touchdowns during Sunday's game.

Being short-handed has been par for the course for the 49ers in recent years, but especially so during the 2025 NFL season. The 49ers have 74 games missed by their Week 1 starters, which is the third-most in the NFL.

“(W)hen you lose a leader like [Kittle], you never really lose him, because his presence is still in this locker room. His energy is still here. He's the leader and heart and soul of this team,"" McCaffrey said. ""[were] Gonna play for him the rest of the way.""

How long is the recovery for a torn Achilles?

For a professional athlete, recovery time for a torn Achilles tendon is typically 9-12 months to limit the risk of re-rupture and allow the player to return as close as possible to their full skill level. The largest and thickest tendon in the body, the Achilles tendon is a collection of fibrous cords that entwine to connect calf muscles to the heel bone.

Fellow NFL players Daniel Jones and Austin Ekeler also suffered torn achilles during the 2025 season. The injury has become more common in professional basketball, as NBA stars Jayson Tatum, Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard all suffered torn Achilles during the 2024-25 NBA season.

George Kittle season stats

Kittle finishes his 2025 campaign with 58 receptions, 634 yards and seven touchdowns during 12 games during the regular season and playoffs.

The former Hawkeye dealt with a string of lower-body injuries during the regular season that left him out of action for more than a month. Despite missing time, he was still named to his seventh Pro-Powl in 2025.

Who do the 49ers play next?

San Francisco got the upset on the road against Philadelphia and will have to do it again in the divisional round of the playoffs against a familiar foe.

San Francisco is the lowest seed to win a game in the wild-card round, meaning they'll have to take on the highest remaining seed in the playoffs. That'd be the NFC West champion Seattle Seahawks. These two teams met in Week 18 with the Seahawks grinding out a 13-3 win.

The game is scheduled for Saturday, Jan. 17. The kickoff time has not been announced.

To this point, the wild-card round certainly has not disappointed, with plenty of close games.

Despite there still being another matchup on tap, there have already been multiple records set. This is the first time in NFL history that four-plus games were decided by four or fewer points in a single postseason round, per Opta Stats; it’s also the first time there have been six-plus fourth-quarter lead changes in a single playoff round in NFL history, Dante Koplowitz-Fleming of NFL research noted.

The Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers opened things up with a surprising thriller; after LA entered the week as historic road favorites, its 34-31 win over Carolina came down to the wire as MVP favorite Matthew Stafford threw a 19-yard, go-ahead touchdown to tight end Colby Parkinson in the final minute of the game. The Panthers got bad news on top of the loss, as starting left tackle Ikem Ekwonu reportedly suffered a ruptured patellar tendon, which could affect his availability next season.

That was followed by another Saturday thriller, as Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears mounted yet another comeback win — this time, over their NFC North rival, the Green Bay Packers — to advance to the divisional round. The Packers were off to a 21-3 lead in the first half before the Bears dropped 25 points in the fourth quarter to take the win.

On Sunday, the magic continued with the Josh Allen-led Buffalo Bills defeating Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars, ending Liam Coen’s Cinderella-esque first season as a head coach. After Allen managed a rushing touchdown after the two-minute warning (right after the best tush push ever, perhaps?), a perfectly timed interception from Bills safety Cole Bishop put Allen in position to kneel it out and snag the team’s first road playoff win in 33 years.

The San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles followed that up with another game that came down to the wire, as the Niners dethroned Philly with a late fourth-quarter touchdown drive (and some trickery from wideout Jauan Jennings). Despite the thrilling win, the Niners will have to deal with yet another brutal blow on the injury front, as All-Pro tight end George Kittle suffered a torn Achilles injury, ending his season.

The Bills faced injury after injury in the 2025 regular season, but found ways to win. That ""next man up"" mentality drove Buffalo to a 12-5 record, and eventually a Wild Card win over the Jaguars.

""It builds character,"" head coach Sean McDermott said. ""You go into every season and you're hoping and praying that there's no adversity. But we've all been around this long enough to know that there's going to be adversity, it's just a matter of what form it comes in and how big it is. And we've really been dealing with it quite a bit this year.""

On Sunday, the Bills were without captain and linebacker Terrel Bernard. Veteran linebacker Shaq Thompson was prepared to step into that role, having done so before during the season. Thompson led the team in tackles with eight. He also had a pass defensed and an early interception. That interception allowed Buffalo to get on the board first, putting up three points and the only score of the first quarter.

During the game, wide receiver Gabe Davis and safety Jordan Poyer sustained injuries that ruled them out. Rookie safety Jordan Hancock stepped into Poyer's role and the wide receiver depth that was contained for most of the season ended up being the driving force on offense.

The team also adjusted to finding different ways to win games throughout the season. Even with the top rushing offense in the league, the Bills couldn't solely rely on running back James Cook III to win games.

Sunday was no different. Cook had just 46 yards on 15 carries. In total, Buffalo only accumulated 79 yards on the ground with quarterback Josh Allen picking up 33. In the pass game, though, Allen finished with an 80 percent completion rate on 28-of-35 passes for 273 yards and one touchdown. Wide receiver Khalil Shakir caught all 12 passes that came his way for 82 yards.

McDermott emphasized the importance of a two-dimensional offense in his postgame press conference.

Up against the top run defense in the NFL, Allen took what the Jaguars gave him. The run game couldn't spark, but that didn't mean he couldn't find ways to win battles himself or target his receivers and tight ends to get the job done.

""We made the plays that we needed to make when we needed to make them,"" McDermott said.

Buffalo also had a series of comeback wins. Though it had the lead for a majority of the game, only giving it up just over halfway through the fourth quarter, the Bills' regular season proved that they know how to win no matter how far behind they're trailing or how close the games end up.

There were four lead changes in the fourth quarter against the Jaguars, all of which Buffalo had to overcome with trips to the end zone as it fell behind by four points each time Jacksonville went up.

""To have the wherewithal to not blink,"" Allen said. ""That's just the mantra that we've adapted to this year.""

Bills share their love for veteran cornerback

Safety Cole Bishop came up with the game-sealing interception, but it was cornerback Tre'Davious White that made that possible. White tipped the ball, allowing Bishop – who was in the right place at the right time – to get his hands underneath it.

""'Game over. Game over,'"" White recalled was running through his head when Bishop came down with the ball. ""'Get down. Get down. Don't try to run it back for a touchdown. Get down so we just go onto the next game.'""

Even though he's the one that was credited with the pick, Bishop knew it wasn't a one-man effort.

""He was making plays out there,"" Bishop said of White. ""I'm super grateful for him. And then him tipping that ball was huge … I know I'm getting a lot of the credit for that interception, but he made the play.

""It means a lot … I'm sure [White's] had a lot of doubters this past year, and being able to come make a play in the biggest game this season and the biggest moment was huge.""

White ended the game with three passes defensed and two tackles. Aside from the last play, White forced two incompletions in the third quarter, making Jacksonville settle for a field goal and allowing the Bills to stay in the lead by three.

His effort wasn't overlooked by anyone on the team, not only Bishop.

""A guy that's been under a lot of scrutiny the last couple of years,"" Allen said of White. ""To get him back and to get him back in a Bills' uniform and making plays for us when we need it the most [means a lot].""

""[White] left it all on the field. Tre White is back man … I'm so glad [White] is here. I'm glad that he's feeling good, I'm glad that he's motivated, I'm glad that he has his confidence back,"" left tackle Dion Dawkins said. ""Guys love on each other positively and [White's] playing free.""

""In [White's] fashion, there's nobody that works harder, and he's gotten himself back now to where he is,"" McDermott said of the cornerback's NFL journey. ""He's playing really good football and credit to him and the work that he's put in … He's just as good as anyone there is in terms of his determination, his heart and his really resilient nature.""

Going for the touchdown at the end of the game

On Buffalo's last possession of the game, Allen and the offense drove forward on fourth-and-inches and ultimately picked up 10 yards. One yard away from the end zone with just over a minute left, the Jaguars used their final timeout to avoid a 10-second runoff, and the Bills had a decision to make.

Going for the touchdown meant quarterback Trevor Lawrence had enough time to get Jacksonville into field goal range. Taking a knee and running down the clock, on the other hand, gave the Jaguars extra breathing room to make a goal-line stop and win the game.

""You can sit there, you can say, 'Hey, let's take a knee.' You lose some yards and you don't score there,"" Allen said. ""Now you're kicking yourself for not scoring earlier … we did what we thought was right, and it turned out to be.""

Looking back on the decision, McDermott and the players are pleased with the choice to go for the touchdown on first-and-goal, leaving Jacksonville with 59 seconds on the clock to try and either tie or win the game.

""From a game management standpoint … they have a phenomenal field goal kicker,"" McDermott said. ""We knew that it was going to be tight. We practice those situations, though, when you only can really give up x-amount of yards … Players [on defense] executed. That's what it really came down to.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/n7yfvudijwuebicffl2i,N,,2026-01-12 18:01:40.202809

Five organizations are moving on to the offseason, and we're here to help. I'm going to break down what went wrong for each of those franchises in the wild-card round, how that might have been foreseeable and what they can do to avoid that same fate next season. Fans invariably want to fire coaches and tear up the roster after a playoff loss, but I'll try to be more level-headed or realistic in projecting what might make sense or what these teams might be thinking.

Let's begin with the Chargers, one of two 7-seeds going home.

Jump to a team:

CAR | GB | JAX | LAC | PHI

Los Angeles Chargers

Lost 16-3 vs. Patriots

I'm not sure a Jim Harbaugh quarterback has ever been beaten up in a big game the way Justin Herbert was hit over and over again by the Patriots on Sunday. With an underwhelming run game, an offense that couldn't diagnose New England's coverages, a green light to scramble at the first sign of daylight and little in the way of help from his offensive line, Herbert endured 21 hits for the three points the Chargers scored in Foxborough. That number of hits was tied for Herbert's season high and are the most for any Harbaugh-coached QB in a single game going back through his time in San Francisco.

On one hand, you can argue that Herbert put the team on his back because nobody else was capable of doing so. The Chargers struggled to separate from New England's coverage for most of the night. Running back Omarion Hampton was active but played only two snaps with an ankle injury, ceding the backfield to Kimani Vidal, who was ineffective. Drops from the likes of Keenan Allen didn't help matters, and Herbert didn't have a single receiver top 32 yards. He scrambled out of duress for gains, but as a passer, Herbert went just 3-of-8 for 21 yards against pressure.

We can also make the case that the Chargers' season really ended when Joe Alt went down for the second time with what would be a season-ending ankle injury. Losing Rashawn Slater (ruptured patellar tendon) was one thing, but going for months without both starting tackles essentially consigned the Chargers' offense to mediocrity. It fell from third in the league in EPA per play with Alt on the field to 26th without him, cycling through various tackles with little success. On Sunday, the Chargers made a Patriots defense that finished the season 23rd in DVOA look like the 2003 or 2016 Pats defenses, even as New England lost Carlton Davis III and Christian Gonzalez for stretches.

There's no doubting Herbert's capacity for greatness, and I'm not going to draw massive conclusions from three disappointing playoff games. But we're about to hit another offseason where the Chargers' primary job will be to fix things around their quarterback. The Tom Telesco regime (2013-23) repeatedly invested in offensive linemen, with Slater proving to be a success, fellow first-rounder Zion Johnson disappointing and free agent addition Corey Linsley making it to a Pro Bowl before having his career derailed by a heart condition. The first-round pick spent on Quentin Johnston in 2023 has fallen somewhere between obvious success and clear bust.

GM Joe Hortiz has continued adding help, and again, the results have been mixed. Ladd McConkey was a hit in the second round of the 2024 draft, although his impact was muted by the addition of Allen in 2025. Oronde Gadsden emerged as a playmaker at tight end, but Bradley Bozeman was disappointing in his second year with the team at center, and the $9.6 million invested in Mekhi Becton didn't deliver the guard who impressed with the Eagles a year ago. The new running back room crashed out because of injuries, and it was Vidal -- even after being cut by the team at the end of camp -- who might have looked like their best back for most of the season.

Slater and Alt will be back in 2026, and between pass catchers McConkey, Johnston and Gadsden and running backs Vidal and Hampton, the Chargers will have young playmakers on cost-controlled contracts for another year. Hortiz's job will be to fix the interior of the offensive line. I wonder whether he'll look to make a big offer to center Tyler Linderbaum, a player he is familiar with from their time together with the Ravens and one who is set to hit unrestricted free agency. It's difficult to spend big money on interior linemen with Herbert and Slater already on massive deals and Alt coming due for one next year, but the relatively low cost of the Chargers' playmakers might allow for a big contract on the interior. It would be a surprise if Becton was back.

There's also the question of whether the Chargers will return offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who doesn't have many supporters among Chargers fans after Year 2 in Los Angeles. Roman and Harbaugh arrived in town excited at the idea of what Herbert would look like with a run game, but the Chargers rank 27th in success rate on designed runs over Roman's two seasons.

The clock is also ticking on the defensive side of the ball, where coordinator Jesse Minter's ascension to a head-coaching role seems inevitable. Minter and the Chargers have done a fantastic job of getting more out of players than other coaching staffs, with Elijah Molden and Morgan Fox as examples in 2024 and Donte Jackson and Tony Jefferson in 2025. The Chargers have some young talent on defense between Tuli Tuipulotu, Daiyan Henley and several standouts in the secondary, but they were also the league's eighth-oldest defense on a snap-weighted age basis when I looked in mid-December. If Minter leaves, it's unclear whether Harbaugh and Hortiz will be as capable of finding hidden gems around the league with the next coordinator.

All of this leaves the Chargers in a weird place. They're unquestionably a good team with a coach and quarterback who are deservedly held in high regard. They've also been beaten two years in a row in the wild-card round. I'm still optimistic that there's a higher ceiling with the tackles returning in 2026, but Herbert's propensity for taking hits and the potential loss of Minter might cause the defense to offset any potential gains from the offense. There's nothing wrong with being an 11-win team that doesn't make waves in the postseason, but we know Harbaugh and Herbert are capable of more.

Philadelphia Eagles

Lost 23-19 to the 49ers

If you were building a perfect example of what a frustrating 2025 Eagles loss would look like, it would be what we saw against the 49ers on Sunday. A couple of solid early scores before the offense completely shuts down in the third quarter? Check. Frustrating penalties that wipe away big plays? Check. An offense missing Lane Johnson? A missed kick by Jake Elliott that changed the late-game calculus? An excellent defense let down in spots by its weakest links on the back end? An end-of-game sequence in which the passing game sputters with drops and low-percentage throws? Check, check, check and check.

The Eagles have played variants of this game against good teams for most of the season, with a few breaks going one way or the other late to decide who wins. Things might have been different if Jalen Hurts had been able to escape the pocket and scramble for what looked to be an easy first down in the final sequence, only for 49ers midseason addition Keion White to trip him up for a loss of 1 yard. Instead of being in a first-and-goal situation with three timeouts, the Eagles were stuck in second-and-long and didn't pick up a single yard the rest of the way.

Against a 49ers team that has been battered by injuries and lost George Kittle to a season-ending torn Achilles in the first half, it was notable how the Eagles suffered when their weaker starters and depth players were brought into focus. The 49ers hit a pair of big plays in the first half when the deep safety in the middle of the field -- first Marcus Epps, then Reed Blankenship -- was simply unable to slow down a receiver and allowed significant yards after the catch in the process. Those plays amounted to 106 of San Francisco's 186 yards in the first half, setting it up for 10 points.

Blankenship simply stopped running on a trick play, with Christian McCaffrey zooming by him to catch a touchdown pass from receiver Jauan Jennings. Nakobe Dean couldn't hang in coverage on McCaffrey for the winning touchdown. Fred Johnson, playing right tackle for the injured Lane Johnson, committed a false start that pushed the Eagles backward on third down and allowed the only sack of the game for Philly's offense. When you consider what the 49ers got from guys such as Eric Kendricks, Garret Wallow and Demarcus Robinson on Sunday, the gap between the marginal players taking meaningful snaps on the two rosters and how they played was significant.

Is that on coaching? It has to be, at least in part. Kyle Shanahan and Robert Saleh did an excellent job of getting the most out of the talent they had, a job that became even more difficult for the 49ers head coach when Kittle went down early in the game and took a part of the playbook with him. The Niners were able to find answers by repeatedly targeting Adoree' Jackson and attacking the Eagles underneath, where Philly blew coverages and couldn't get close as it tried to tackle McCaffrey and Kyle Juszczyk at times.

Saleh's defense leaned into the blitz, trusting that Hurts and Philly's two star wideouts wouldn't be able to make them pay. That plan paid off, as Hurts went 6-of-11 for just 48 yards against the blitz. Even when the 49ers didn't send the house, the threat of the blitz caused the Eagles to question their looks and check into plays that weren't necessarily great fits for what the 49ers ran post-snap. And after Deommodore Lenoir blew contain on the second run of the game and allowed Saquon Barkley to run for 29 yards, the 49ers limited the Philly run game to 109 yards on 34 carries, or 3.2 yards per pop.

For the majority of this season, it has seemed like the Eagles believed they were going to win on sheer talent, that their stars would make more big plays than yours. There was nothing to fix with the run game, because this had been one of the best offensive lines in football with Lane Johnson on the field. Brown and Smith were uncoverable at their best. Hurts was a serial winner. The Eagles ran one of the most static pre-snap offenses in football and were comfortable with Hurts attacking blitzes with low-percentage throws downfield because they believed their guys were going to win.

The results spoke for themselves until they didn't, and the core of general manager Howie Roseman's Eagles teams -- the offensive and defensive lines -- wasn't up to the task. The Eagles went 8-2 with Lane Johnson and 3-5 without him, as the legendary right tackle never made it back from his midseason Lisfranc injury. Hurts posted a 64.3 QBR with Johnson on the field and a 49.7 mark without him. The Eagles were the league's fifth-worst rushing attack in terms of success rate without Johnson. His absence wasn't the only issue, as Landon Dickerson and Cam Jurgens both struggled through frustrating seasons, but the Eagles simply didn't have the same dominant O-line that they had in 2024, and they never really found a way to account or adjust for those issues.

And while Roseman hit on the midseason addition of Jaelan Phillips, who gave an inconsistent pass rush a much-needed boost of pressure, the Eagles' offseason moves didn't necessarily age well. Zack Baun wasn't the same linebacker in his second season with Philadelphia and got juked out of the play several times in the loss to the 49ers. Some of the depth guys brought in to replace the departed Josh Sweat, such as Za'Darius Smith, Joshua Uche and Azeez Ojulari, struggled to make an impact amid injuries (and an unexpected retirement for Smith). First-round pick Jihaad Campbell lost his role in the lineup once Dean returned from injury and played just one defensive snap against the Niners. The next defenders off the board were Carson Schwesinger, who is a Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate in Cleveland, and Nick Emmanwori, who has been a physical force at safety for Seattle.

But at the end of the day, this has to fall on the coaching staff, specifically the offensive brain trust of head coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. The Eagles simply didn't develop any new answers as the season went along, and while we don't know how things would have gone if Lane Johnson had actually made it back, the Eagles' offense wasn't really all that great with him in the fold, either. It certainly wasn't up to what we saw last season, when Kellen Moore was in Patullo's role and merged the offense he ran in Dallas and Los Angeles with what the Eagles ran under Sirianni.

Should the Eagles fire Sirianni? I laid out many of the pros and cons for him in November, and there's no arguing that his résumé through five seasons is essentially unprecedented in modern football. He deserves some credit for how well things went in 2022 and 2024, and some blame for the disappointing endings in 2023 and 2025. The Eagles could try to bring back former special teams coordinator John Harbaugh, but Ravens fans would have many of the same complaints about their former coach that Eagles fans have about their current leader.

I'd be surprised if the Eagles moved on from Sirianni. It's tough to see Patullo returning, and given that Moore and Shane Steichen have earned head coaching gigs from running this offense, it should be an appealing opportunity for offensive minds. It would seem aggressive to make massive personnel changes, but Roseman has never shied away from making moves before. And I wonder whether the Eagles will look to potentially trade A.J. Brown, who had his least efficient season as an Eagles player, repeatedly seemed to butt heads with the organization and turns 29 in June.

Jacksonville Jaguars

Lost 27-24 vs. Bills

After what has been an excellent debut season as a head coach in Jacksonville, I'm worried Liam Coen is going to be sick for weeks. The Jaguars let this game get away from them in a way that I would not have anticipated. On a day when Trevor Lawrence struggled with consistency and went 18-of-30 for 207 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions, the Jags simply didn't run the ball often enough.

It's one thing to get away from the run when an offense doesn't have success or is facing a team that has a solid run defense, but neither of those things were true. The Bills' rush defense -- which ranked 31st in EPA per play against designed runs -- was their obvious weakness heading into the game. And the Jaguars boomed on the ground on their first touchdown drive, as Bhayshul Tuten racked up consecutive carries of 20, 14 and 13 yards. Inexplicably, the rookie got just one carry the rest of the way.

The duo of Tuten and Travis Etienne Jr. combined for just 14 carries, which they turned into 118 yards and a 71% success rate. By EPA per designed rush by running backs, this was the 13th-most-efficient rushing performance of the season in any game by any set of backs. The Jags simply didn't get to it enough.

Raw rush totals can be misleading. Lawrence kept on a zone-read on fourth-and-short when he would have handed the ball off if Joey Bosa hadn't crashed down. Teams can run RPOs and throw their way out of run looks if they get the right movement. We saw the Panthers throw a pair of slants to Tetairoa McMillan that were tagged onto their run plays for easy completions. And if a defense is loading up with heavy boxes and daring teams to throw, running for the sake of running isn't a good idea.

But the Bills weren't doing that. The Jags didn't run into a single loaded box with Etienne or Tuten all game. Nine of those 14 carries went into light boxes, which helped their efficiency and hinted toward how the Bills were willing to approach this game on defense. Looking at Lawrence's first-and-10 dropbacks that weren't near the goal line or in the two-minute drill, there were plenty of run-friendly boxes that the Jags chose not to hit.

Given how Lawrence played Sunday, that was a missed opportunity. He came into the postseason on fire and playing the best football of his career, but as I highlighted last week, that doesn't always lead to the same success in the postseason.

Lawrence had a 15-2 touchdown-interception ratio during the final nine games of the 2022 season, then threw five picks in two playoff games, including four in the Jags' dramatic comeback win over the Chargers. After posting a 15-1 ratio over the final six games of 2025, Lawrence threw two picks in Sunday's loss, including one on the first play of the season-ending drive. He failed to convert on the aforementioned fourth-and-2 zone-read attempt, as well. Lawrence still made a handful of nice throws, especially when targeting slot receiver Parker Washington, but his 30.2 Total QBR ranked ninth among the 10 quarterbacks who have played in the wild-card round so far.

While the Jags led 24-20 with 4:03 to go after Lawrence found Etienne for a touchdown, the Josh Allen drive that followed felt almost inevitable. The Jaguars have a solid defense, but their secondary needs the pass rush to create problems. Instead, Allen went 9-of-12 for 144 yards under pressure, including a spectacular throw against an unblocked rusher to Brandin Cooks on a post route for 36 yards, which got the Bills into the red zone for the game-winning touchdown.

Even as Allen completed passes to nine different receivers and top target Khalil Shakir was mostly catching screens and hitches, the Bills were able to attack outside cornerbacks Jarrian Jones and Greg Newsome II in coverage. Jones also struggled with his tackling after the catch. Allen was 10-of-11 on out-breaking routes, repeatedly trusting his ability to throw the ball into places Jacksonville's defenders couldn't reach. And to mitigate the pass rush, Allen got the ball out in less than 2.5 seconds on nearly half of his attempts, going 16-of-17 for 173 yards and a touchdown on those throws.

This was a successful year for the Jaguars, but I'm not sure it went the way Coen and first-year general manager James Gladstone would have imagined. Gladstone swore to take big swings in his new role, and some of those swings hit. Jakobi Meyers was wildly successful after being acquired at the trade deadline, earning an extension. Slot corner Jourdan Lewis was excellent early in the season before hitting injured reserve twice. Center Robert Hainsey had a very solid year after following Coen over from Tampa Bay.

And yet some of the more high-profile moves the Jags made didn't really work out. Newsome, acquired in a midseason trade for Tyson Campbell, allowed a 107.5 passer rating in coverage. Dyami Brown, signed to a one-year, $10 million deal, racked up 227 receiving yards and was a healthy scratch late in the year. Really, much of the new regime's success came in getting more out of the players who were already in the building, including Cole Van Lanen, Devin Lloyd, Etienne, Lawrence and Arik Armstead -- all of whom played much better in 2025.

The biggest move the Jags made, of course, was trading two first-round picks for hybrid uber-prospect Travis Hunter. The early returns on that move aren't looking great. Hunter didn't play like a first-rounder at wide receiver or cornerback, although he did have 101 yards against the Rams in his final game before suffering a season-ending knee injury in practice. The Jaguars didn't seem to have a consistent usage plan for Hunter, and while the first-rounder they sent to the Browns to acquire him will fall late in the first round at No. 24, I'm not sure that trade looks all that great after one season.

Hunter still deserves time to develop, and the Jags surely would have loved to have him at cornerback against the Bills on Sunday, but their future plans for him could determine what happens this offseason. It seems likely that the Jags will move forward with Hunter playing regularly at cornerback, where they'll have an opening, especially if Newsome is allowed to hit free agency.

What about wide receiver, though? In Hunter's absence, the Jaguars got their passing game going by getting two other wideouts on the field. Meyers emerged as a standout, but so did Washington, who produced a mammoth run of games down the stretch. Underappreciated frankly by both the current and prior regimes in Jacksonville, Washington was buried on the depth chart after the additions of Hunter, Brown and Meyers.

Once Hunter was injured and Brown was taken out of the lineup, though, Washington proved that he belongs on the field. He had 145 receiving yards in the Jags' December win over the Broncos, then followed with a 115-yard day against the Colts and 87 yards against the Titans. Washington was then the Jags' leading receiver on Sunday, turning a team-high 12 targets into 107 yards and a touchdown. With one more year left on his rookie deal, Washington has earned a regular role in the lineup when Jacksonville is in three-wide sets.

The investment made in Hunter also implies that he's going to be a part of the offense, which leaves me with questions about the one player I haven't mentioned. Brian Thomas Jr. came into the year as Jacksonville's top wideout after an impressive rookie season, but amid early issues with drops, he seemed to fade out of that lead role in the offense. Meyers and Washington took over as Lawrence's top target for stretches in the second half. Thomas averaged 46.6 receiving yards per game over the final eight games of the season, and despite an early touchdown catch for Jacksonville's first score Sunday, he finished with only two receptions for 21 yards.

The new regime inherited Thomas, and he didn't appear a natural fit in Year 1 with Coen. Would the Jaguars consider trading him? The 2024 first-rounder is the most natural fit as the ""X"" receiver in Coen's offense, and I'm not sure any of the other guys are obvious replacements for him in that role. Plus, Thomas was so talented as a rookie that I'd want to try to make it work for another season.

If the Jags can recoup the first-round pick they sent away for Hunter, though, trading Thomas might be worth serious consideration. And the obvious landing spot, coincidentally enough, would be with the team that just beat them. Buffalo doesn't have that young playmaker who can win against man coverage at wide receiver, and Thomas would be a major upgrade on what already appears to be a failed experiment in Keon Coleman. The Bills will also have their first-rounder fall toward the end of the round, which would probably be a fair price for Thomas. It's an unlikely move, of course, but Jacksonville has four starters for three wideout spots, and Thomas is the player who would have the most trade value and who the Jags have seen the least out of in 2025.

A notable starter whose future is more likely to be elsewhere in 2026 is Walker Little. The prior front office signed the 2021 second-round pick to a three-year, $40.5 million deal after just a handful of starts at left tackle. Little began the year on Lawrence's blind side, but when he suffered a concussion in a November win over the Titans, the Jags installed Van Lanen at left tackle. The utility player was enough of an upgrade that the Jags signed him to a three-year, $51 million deal and kept him at left tackle when Little returned. (Little moved to right guard to take over for the injured Patrick Mekari.)

Van Lanen missed Sunday's loss with a knee injury, with Little back to his old spot and committing two false starts. The commitment to Van Lanen suggests that the Jags see him as a left tackle candidate in 2026. With Little's $11 million base salary guaranteed next season, it would hardly be a surprise if the Jaguars traded him to clear out a starting spot and get some cash to put toward free agent additions this offseason.

Green Bay Packers

Lost 31-27 vs. Bears

Sunday's loss brought an end to a five-week collapse for the Packers, who walked off the field after Keisean Nixon's interception sealed a win over the Bears in early December with hopes of winning the NFC North. That dramatic victory was their last of the season, as the Packers lost their final five games, including the wild-card matchup Saturday. Along the way, they lost Micah Parsons to a knee injury, lost (then regained) Jordan Love to a concussion and blew two different games with a 95% or better win expectancy in the fourth quarter to the Bears. The first pushed the NFC North back to Chicago, and the second might have ended Matt LaFleur's run as Green Bay's head coach.

There has been smoke around the coach's future in Green Bay over the past few weeks, and there are plans to talk after the season about extending the contracts of LaFleur and general manager Brian Gutekunst, both of whom are entering the final year of their respective pacts. I'd argue that they're two of the best at their respective roles. I'm just not sure Packers fans would agree with that sentiment at the moment.

At halftime of Saturday night's game, of course, LaFleur looked like he might earn a new deal in the locker room. It seemed like the Packers had outprepared, outschemed and outplayed the Bears, who were flailing on fourth downs and struggling to live up to the moment. Chicago coach Ben Johnson wasn't able to get his ground game going, had dialed up just one play-action pass for Caleb Williams and couldn't rely at all on his defense to slow down the Packers. Love and the Green Bay offense scored touchdowns on their first three drives, and while Brandon McManus missed a 55-yard field goal to end the half, the Packers were up 21-3 and getting the ball to start the third quarter. One missed kick wasn't going to matter, right?

Well, three missed kicks mattered, as McManus missed another field goal and an extra point, costing the Packers seven points in a game they lost by four. He was a savior for the Packers last season when he produced an outlier season in terms of accuracy, but the Packers brought McManus back for 2025 with underwhelming results; he had the fifth-worst field goals made over expectation (per NFL Next Gen Stats) of any kicker, even before his postseason disappointment. Would he have had a better chance of making those kicks at home?

The Bears found their rhythm on offense, as they scored on five of their six possessions in the second half, racking up 333 net yards and 28 points. The Packers, decidedly, did not. The offense went to sleep for its first four possessions in the second half, as Green Bay amassed 29 yards and one first down across a four-drive stretch.

Much of that owed to a rushing attack that simply stopped. Josh Jacobs was solid early in this game, but the 2024 free agent addition and the offensive line could not conspire to threaten the line of scrimmage for most of the contest. Jacobs finished with 19 carries for 55 yards, but his final 14 totes produced just 16 yards and one first down. Jacobs was stopped on a second-and-3, a third-and-1 and two carries from the 1-yard line. And pressed into action as a kickoff returner, he fumbled, with the Packers fortunate to fall on the football. Jacobs was returning from a knee injury, but if he wasn't 100 percent, it was on LaFleur to find other solutions, either by using other backs or leaning into the pass on early downs.

Jeff Hafley has earned head coaching consideration for his work with the Packers' defense over the past two years, but this also wasn't his best showing. The Packers were able to get off the field on fourth down against the Bears in the first half, but frankly, that was more a product of Chicago's clumsiness than great defensive play. Bears center Drew Dalman fired a snap wide of Williams to throw off the timing on one failed fourth-down play, while Dalman and right guard Jonah Jackson failed to block defensive tackle Karl Brooks on another, allowing the Packers lineman to run totally unbothered up the A-gap at Williams for a drive-ending pressure. Williams finished the first half 8-of-17 for 78 yards with an interception, and it seemed like Hafley might finish the night with a head coaching offer or two.

After the break, Hafley's defense wasn't able to consistently slow down the Bears. The Packers weren't able to create post-snap problems for Williams and the passing game. There's nothing wrong with rotation safeties and trying to show a different post-snap look, but it led to snaps in which the Packers weren't in position to succeed. On the first third down of the third quarter, the Packers showed a two-high look before the snap and then blitzed safety Xavier McKinney from 11 yards off the line of scrimmage. McKinney never got close to Williams, and the Packers were outnumbered on a flood combination to that side of the field, producing an easy 19-yard completion to tight end Colston Loveland.

Loveland picked up another big play on the same drive when the Packers spun their safeties before the snap and nobody ran with his crossing route. The rookie tight end was a mismatch when the Packers did get somebody on him -- Loveland was simply too athletic for Quay Walker -- but the Packers made their own mistakes. On a critical third-and-4 before the winning touchdown, the Packers responded to an empty formation by dropping their defensive backs past the sticks and asking edge rusher Kingsley Enagbare to get into the flat to cover running back D'Andre Swift. Williams went right to Swift for an easy 23-yard gain. One play later, the Bears had the lead.

That final play saw the Bears take advantage of the position that has been the weak spot on the Packers' roster since the start of the season. Carrington Valentine was supposed to be booted out of the starting lineup by the arrival of free agent slot corner Nate Hobbs, but Hobbs was ineffective and injured for most of his debut season in Green Bay. Valentine has allowed a 121.2 passer rating in his stead, and he came up lacking on the last snap of the Packers' season.

For all the complaints about Ben Johnson's playcalling being too cute, this was an example of the details selling the right lie to the right player. The Bears lined up with trips to the left and an unbalanced line, giving them an extra blocker to the side of the field in tackle Darnell Wright. The look screamed some sort of screen, and early in the game, the Bears had thrown a screen on third-and-8 out of that same bunch for a first down.

This time, though, the Bears were taking a shot downfield. Williams fired his hips toward the tunnel screen without ever really throwing the ball, but that was enough. Valentine drove on the screen, and by the time he turned around, the ball was already coming out. DJ Moore had dropped a spectacular throw from Williams earlier in the drive, but this time, the wide-open veteran brought in a fade for the winning touchdown.

Injuries and absences mattered. Linebacker Edgerrin Cooper leaving in the third quarter because of an ankle injury cost the Packers arguably their best remaining player on the defense. Isaiah McDuffie filled in and wasn't able to tackle Bears running back Kyle Monangai on a critical checkdown that turned into a 22-yard completion and set up a touchdown. Linebacker Nick Niemann, who hadn't played a single defensive snap all season, was isolated in coverage against Loveland on the 2-point try that made it a three-point game.

And the Packers sorely missed Parsons, the player for whom Gutekunst sent two first-round picks to acquire. They pressured Williams on 25% of his dropbacks, but the Packers had just two quick pressures on 48 opportunities, meaning that most of the times they bothered Williams came late in the play. Parsons averaged more than two quick pressures per game on his own this season. Could those pressures have helped swing this game toward Green Bay?

The Packers did have a chance to win the game after the Moore touchdown, but sloppy game management from LaFleur limited what they could do. It's always easier to evaluate timeout usage after the fact, when we know how the game ends, but it's impossible to suggest that LaFleur got anything close to full value for the three he had in the second half.

Green Bay used its first on offense with 3:02 left, a stopped clock and a three-point lead to avoid a delay of game penalty. That's fine, but the Packers promptly went back to the line after the timeout and took a delay of game penalty, costing them 5 yards. After an incompletion on third down, LaFleur had the impossible choice between kicking a field goal to go up six (often seen as a net negative by win expectancy models, because it incentivizes the other team to go for a touchdown) or attempt a fourth-and-15. He got neither, and the Bears scored a touchdown anyway.

LaFleur had to use his second timeout on defense with 2:08 to go, this time because the Packers couldn't get the right players on the field. The timeout stopped the clock for the Bears and gave them the ability to open up the playbook to call a run just before the two-minute warning, which they took advantage of to pick up 5 yards.

The Packers were left with one timeout for their final drive, which they used after a short competition to Romeo Doubs. They were then forced to run 10 seconds off the clock after an injury to center Sean Rhyan. In the end, they never even got an opportunity to run a play within the red zone before time expired, coming closest when Love nearly squeezed a pass between three Tampa 2 defenders to Christian Watson inside the 5-yard line.

It's a frustrating loss at the end of a frustrating losing streak. It's the third straight year the Packers have entered the postseason as the 7-seed, and LaFleur has a grand total of one playoff win over the past five seasons. Should what Packers fans saw from their coach Saturday serve as proof that Green Bay needs to go in a different direction?

I would say no. LaFleur has gone 76-40-1 as a head coach despite fielding what were often underwhelming defenses over that stretch, an issue I would blame more on Joe Barry than him. There have been a couple of rough losses in the postseason, and I'm not sure I'll ever understand LaFleur kicking a field goal down eight late against the Bucs with the greatest red zone offense in league history in the 2020 playoffs, but there's a real value in having a coach who gets you to the playoffs just about every year. LaFleur's work with Malik Willis and building a functional offense around a quarterback who looked unplayable in Tennessee is a testament to his offensive mind.

The story seems the same for the Packers because it is the same. They're a good team stuck in a tough division. They're the youngest team in the league on an annual basis, as Gutekunst strips the oldest players from the roster and loads up on draft picks. The difference was supposed to be Parsons, the true superstar who would elevate the rest of the defense, help mask the weaknesses at cornerback and come up with big plays when the Packers needed them most. And for three-plus months, Parsons lived up to expectations. There's no good time to tear an ACL, but Parsons doing so one month before the playoffs was always going to have a dramatic impact on Green Bay's ceiling. I wouldn't fire LaFleur or Gutekunst because their most important addition tore an ACL.

Instead, I suspect it will be an offseason of retooling. This offseason might be the end of the line in Green Bay for 30-year-old lineman Elgton Jenkins, who has a $24.8 million cap hit next season. Hobbs and 28-year-old guard Aaron Banks, who was in and out of the lineup because of injuries, could be one-and-done in Green Bay, although I'd be surprised if Banks was released. Doubs, who had a fantastic catch in a key moment, is likely to leave in free agency, which will help the Packers recoup some of the draft capital they lost as part of the Parsons deal via compensatory picks. The Packers were also 26th in special teams win probability during the regular season, which might create problems for coordinator Rich Bisaccia.

Outside of the very top teams in football, a lot of organizations would and should look enviously at what the Packers have built. I think we need to see what that looks like in the postseason with a healthy Parsons before making any sort of snap judgments about whether Green Bay is better off with another head coach.

Carolina Panthers

Lost 34-31 vs. Rams

There are no moral victories in the playoffs, but for the Panthers, this might have been the closest thing to one. They were massive underdogs at home even after beating the Rams in Carolina this season, and expectations of repeating that feat in the rematch were low. When the Panthers quickly went down 14-0 after a failed fourth-down conversion and a Bryce Young interception handed the Rams a pair of short fields, a blowout victory for Los Angeles appeared to be on the horizon.

Instead, the Panthers came all the way back to take the lead with 2:39 to go before the defense allowed the game-winning touchdown drive to Matthew Stafford. The veteran quarterback reportedly told receiver Davante Adams he was going to ""snatch [the Panthers'] hearts"" on the final drive. A cold line, no doubt, but one you save for the Super Bowl when you know the NFL Films microphones are on the sideline, right? Stafford had to pull out his best material late in the wild-card round, both on and off the field, to get the Rams to the next round.

I'm weirdly more optimistic about the Panthers after their playoff loss than I was after their win over the Rams in Week 13, because the factors that led to that win were unsustainable. The Panthers converted all three of their fourth-down tries, including two for long touchdown passes. With a Mike Jackson pick-six leading the way, the Panthers posted a plus-three turnover margin in the win; the last time that happened was in the Matt Rhule era with Baker Mayfield at quarterback, more than three years ago. Those plays matter and are meaningful, but I'm not sure they're particularly sustainable as a formula for beating the Rams.

And in those same spots Sunday, the Panthers' timing wasn't quite as impeccable. They went 0-for-3 on fourth down. Young threw an early pick to the Rams on a play in which Panthers receiver Jalen Coker, who otherwise had a breakout game, seemed to be on the wrong page after some pre-snap adjustments and stopped his route. Carolina rookie Trevor Etienne muffed a punt to give the Rams another short field, and while the Panthers got another Jackson interception and blocked a punt in the fourth quarter, the turnover margin for this game went down in Los Angeles' favor.

Instead, this Panthers performance shined through the full 60 minutes, as they went toe-to-toe with the Rams on a down-by-down basis. They struggled early on defense, with Rams receiver Puka Nacua moving around the formation and flummoxing Carolina's zone coverage looks, but defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero and his cornerbacks held up against Nacua and Adams and forced Stafford into what seemed like an endless run of contested throws to either sideline. They rode their luck a bit when Nacua dropped a would-be touchdown just before halftime, but the Panthers were able to limit explosive rushing plays and didn't allow a single drive over 50 yards before the fourth quarter.

And on a day when Chuba Hubbard and Rico Dowdle combined for 55 yards on 18 carries and the Panthers trailed by 14 points midway through the first quarter, so much of the game fell on Young's shoulders. His offensive line was a mess. Guard Robert Hunt tried to return early from a pectoral injury and clearly wasn't his usual self. The Panthers lost left tackle Ikem Ekwonu to a ruptured patellar tendon early in the game, and replacement Yosh Nijman allowed four of the 14 quick pressures generated by the Rams (per NFL Next Gen Stats), which tied for the fifth-most quick pressures in any game all season.

Under the circumstances, I thought Young was excellent. The raw numbers aren't going to wow anyone, with the 2023 No. 1 draft pick completing 52.5% of his passes and averaging 6.6 yards per attempt, but his 74.4 Total QBR attests to how well he played given the pressure rate. He was repeatedly able to buy time and create out of structure, looking almost Tony Romo-esque as he spun his way out of interior pressure and got out of the pocket to find receivers.

When Young wasn't pressured, he went 17-of-24 for 223 yards with a touchdown and a pick. He threw with anticipation to set up two chunk plays to Coker, who finished with nine catches for 134 yards and the touchdown that gave the Panthers their fourth-quarter lead. Young is never going to have the strongest arm, so he needs to anticipate voids before they come open, throw accurate passes to create YAC and create out of structure. He did all three Saturday.

I'm not suggesting that Young's fifth-year option was on the line in this game, because the indications were already that the Panthers were going to pick up Young's $26.5 million guarantee for 2027. If Young had suffered through a disastrous game (think Sam Darnold's final start with the Vikings), though, that pickup might have come through gritted teeth. This was Young's most important start in a Panthers uniform, and he came through impressively.

This is the first offseason in many years in which the Panthers won't have to make fixing the offense their primary focus. Acquiring a quarterback was problem No. 1, and they've spent the past two offseasons desperately trying to get the right players around Young. Some of those moves haven't hit, but enough have left the offense in solid shape. Coker and presumptive Offensive Rookie of the Year Tetairoa McMillan are the two young wideouts the Panthers have been hoping to find. They'll also have Jonathon Brooks as the second back alongside Hubbard to replace Dowdle next season.

There's still work to be done, of course. Ekwonu is likely out six to 12 months, and the Panthers are on the hook for his $17.6 million fifth-year option in 2026. Nijman, a pending free agent, was a turnstile when forced into the lineup at left tackle, so the Panthers probably need a short-term stopgap there if Ekwonu is not ready to go. Adding a tight end might also be on the docket if the Panthers weren't impressed by Ja'Tavion Sanders' second season.

But really, this should be an offseason finally devoted toward adding defense. The Panthers signed Tershawn Wharton and Tre'von Moehrig in free agency, but when they used a second-round pick on edge Nic Scourton, it marked the first time Carolina had used a first- or second-round pick on a defensive player since selecting Jaycee Horn in 2021.

The Panthers like their young talent on defense, but this would be about finding more significant solutions for some of their veterans on short-term, low-cost contracts. Ironically, two are former Rams in safety Nick Scott and linebacker Christian Rozeboom, both of whom were targeted by L.A. in coverage Sunday. No Carolina defender managed more than five sacks, so finding a veteran (or a first-round pick) on the edge who can create more pass pressure alongside Scourton and Princely Umanmielen would be a welcome addition.

It's important to be realistic about where the Panthers are and what they've shown. This team finished 25th in DVOA and ESPN's Football Power Index. It was 8-9 against one of the league's easier schedules, the same performance that led the Falcons to fire Raheem Morris after two seasons in Atlanta. And after no-showing in a win-and-in game against the Buccaneers last week, the Panthers needed Morris and his Falcons to beat the Saints (something they weren't able to do in their two meetings) to back into the postseason.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0112%2Fr1599517_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:01:45.667313

Bentancur injury exposes under-investment Tottenham have been left even weaker in the middle of the pitch by the news that Bentancur will require surgery on a hamstring injury.","Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur is expected to be out for around three months with a hamstring injury sustained in their Premier League game against Bournemouth last Wednesday.

Bentancur, 28, was forced off in the latter stages of Tottenham’s 3-2 defeat by Bournemouth. Head coach Thomas Frank confirmed at full time the midfielder had sustained a hamstring injury and that initial assessments had indicated it appeared significant.

Spurs are expected to look to the transfer market to supplement their midfield in the wake of Bentancur’s diagnosis, sources briefed on the situation say.

Bentancur has made 28 appearances in all competitions this season, starting 17 of his side’s 21 Premier League matches. He signed a new long-term contract with the club in October.

The Uruguay international joins a Spurs long-term injury list that already includes James Maddison, Mohammed Kudus and Dejan Kulusevski. Richarlison was also forced off during Saturday’s FA Cup defeat to Aston Villa with a suspected hamstring injury, while Lucas Bergvall missed the match due to a problem picked up against Bournemouth. Striker Dominic Solanke, meanwhile, returned following four months out with an ankle injury.

Spurs are 14th in the Premier League and return to action against West Ham United on Saturday.

Bentancur injury exposes under-investment

Tottenham have been left even weaker in the middle of the pitch by the news that Bentancur will require surgery on a hamstring injury.

The Uruguayan has been one of Spurs’ most important players so far this season, starting the season partnering Joao Palhinha in the middle and, more recently, Archie Gray.

Even though Tottenham have rarely dazzled in the middle of the pitch, Bentancur has still been busily trying to hold everything together. Spurs’ reliance on Bentancur has been a sign of the under-investment in the midfield in recent years.

Now that Bentancur is out for the next few months, Palhinha and Gray will have to be the starting pair, at least until Pape Matar Sarr comes back from international duty — Senegal play their Africa Cup of Nations semi-final against Egypt on Wednesday. And Tottenham will surely need another experienced addition in the middle of the pitch.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/10/01045310/GettyImages-2237209439-scaled-e1759308834680.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-12 13:17:29.376051

Yet Kittle, perhaps knowing the worst, clapped for his 49ers’ teammates even as he was carted off the field late in the first half of Sunday’s wild-card playoff game at Philadelphia.

“I think everyone’s just hurting for Kittle,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said.

Kittle missed the celebration after Brock Purdy threw a go-ahead 6-yard touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey late in the fourth quarter and the 49ers eliminated the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles with a 23-19 wild-card victory Sunday.

The 49ers head to top-seeded Seattle without Kittle next weekend for an NFC divisional playoff game.

Kittle was pushed out of bounds on a 6-yard reception and grabbed the back of his lower right leg. He was ruled out for the rest of the game.

Kittle is a key part of both the run and pass game for the 49ers, but played in just 11 games this season because of injuries. He missed five games with a hamstring injury and missed a Week 17 game with an ankle injury.

The catch against the Eagles was Kittle’s first of the game.

“This team has carried the character of George Kittle throughout the entire year,” McCaffrey said. “Since I got traded here, he’s the heart and soul of the entire team. It’s a tough loss. When he’s not playing, it means a lot. When you lose a leader like that, you never really lose him because his presence is still in the locker room.

“His energy is still here.”

Kittle had 57 catches for 628 yards receiving and seven touchdowns this season.

He honored Grateful Dead founding member and big 49ers fan Bob Weir with “DEAD FOREVER” on tape around his left ankle. Weir’s death was announced Saturday. He was 78.

Shanahan also all but ruled out All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner’s return against the Seahawks. Warner dislocated and broke his right ankle in a loss at Tampa Bay on Oct. 12.

Warner was a first-team All-Pro in three straight seasons and four of the last five, making the Pro Bowl in each of those four seasons.

“This team has carried the character of George Kittle throughout the entire year.
Ironically, Kittle suffered a hamstring injury in that game that ultimately cost him six weeks.
And while that setback proved San Francisco could win without him, going 4-2 after the injury, his absence moving forward might just provide fuel.
Gonna play for him the rest of the way,” said McCaffrey, who was traded from the Carolina Panthers to San Francisco midway through the 2022 season.","PHILADELPHIA − Being short-handed has been par for the course for the San Francisco 49ers in recent years, but especially so during the 2025 NFL season.

Nick Bosa. Gone. Fred Warner. Gone. Brandon Aiyuk. Gone … probably long gone. And that doesn’t even account for guys like quarterback Brock Purdy, who have been in and out of the lineup.

But when perennial Pro Bowl tight tend George Kittle suffered an Achilles injury before halftime in Sunday’s wild-card game against the Philadelphia Eagles − with the Niners trailing 13-7 at the time − it was worth wondering if “next man up” sounded more trite and empty than it typically does.

“This team has carried the character of George Kittle throughout the entire year. And since I got traded here, he’s the heart and soul of this team. So, it’s a tough loss,” said All-Pro Christian McCaffrey, whose pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns sparked San Francisco’s 23-19 upset of the defending champions.

“He’s somebody that, even going through something he had to go through – and us finding a way to finish – he’s the first guy in the locker room, smiling, pumping music, happy for his teammates.”

After Kittle collapsed near the sideline following a 6-yard catch, Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams – he and Kittle have long been the tone-setters for this squad – stood next to his fallen teammate as the cart came for him.

“Just in disbelief. You know, George is like a Superman around here,” said Williams. “Just wanted to say a quick prayer for him. Just hoping for the best, just really wanted him to know I was there for him.

“I think if we didn’t have experience with that, it would have been easy for everybody to fold, and nobody would’ve blamed us.”

Experience with injuries is putting it lightly, San Fran's Week 1 starters missing 74 games in sum. Kittle's loss exacerbates the misfortune even as the Niners advance, hoping to win their first Lombardi Trophy in 31 years.

“We just lost George, that hurts – it could be a real easy excuse for us to say, ‘Alright, that’s finally the last straw that’s gonna keep us from doing this thing,’” said All-Pro fullback Kyle Juszczyk, perhaps Kittle’s closest friend on the team.

“But you just can’t have that mentality. You just never know when you’re gonna get this opportunity in the divisional round of the playoffs. There’s only so many teams left in this league, and we’re one of them.”

The 49ers will travel to Seattle next weekend to face the top-seeded Seahawks, whom they beat 17-13 at Lumen Field on Sept. 7. Ironically, Kittle suffered a hamstring injury in that game that ultimately cost him six weeks. And while that setback proved San Francisco could win without him, going 4-2 after the injury, his absence moving forward might just provide fuel.

“(W)hen you lose a leader like that, you never really lose him, because his presence is still in this locker room. His energy is still here. He’s the leader and heart and soul of this team. Praying for him. Love him. Gonna play for him the rest of the way,” said McCaffrey, who was traded from the Carolina Panthers to San Francisco midway through the 2022 season.

He was also asked how the team processes such a gut punch.

“I think you digest it after the game. It’s a weird deal when your brother goes down. Plays are called, and you’ve got to go out there and execute,"" answered ""CMC.""

""The way I see it, George wouldn’t want you to (dwell) over anything. He’d want you to get back in there and continue to play.”

Which the 49ers, scars and all, will undoubtedly keep doing.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/12/USAT/88137478007-2255766565.jpg?crop=2666,1500,x593,y292&width=2666&height=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-12 12:01:50.473999

Besides broadcasting on national television, the NFL has been streaming games on platforms like Amazon Prime, which uses AI and openly promotes this practice during game broadcasts. They first started streaming games in 2023 and have a contract until 2033; they also have rights to streaming Thursday Night Football.

A promotional article written by Tyler Greenawalt for Amazon says that “real-time analytics powered by custom Amazon AI models bring expert-level insights to Night Football.”

They have 10 AI-powered “Prime insights.” There are things like “Prime Targets,” which highlights open receivers with a green orb and “Path to Victory,” which is when AI predicts remaining possession scenarios for teams that are losing.

While these insights add to the viewer’s experience and overall knowledge of the game, sometimes what the broadcaster says can be outshined by what AI has on the screen. With the “Path to Victory” insight, a broadcaster cannot exactly predict when a stop will happen. They can maybe predict how many possessions will happen after, but that’s probably it.

I’m honestly scared that people will start to look towards AI for insights instead of journalists or actual experts. It’s like seeing the horror of kids in grade school or high school rely on AI to write 10-page papers for them. Lots of people these days love to replace learning with convenience.

While I’ve explicitly shared what I don’t like, I am fascinated in how the NFL uses AI with injuries.

They developed a tool called “The Digital Athlete,” which is a tool that’s used to predict an injury. It does this by taking video and data from training, practice and games, and Greenwalt says it uses “AWS technology to run millions of simulations of NFL games and specific scenarios.” With that, it’s able to tell teams when players are at the highest risk of injury.

Like any injury in any sport, you can be out for just a few weeks or for the rest of the season. Each team in the NFL plays up to 17 games per season — they play once per week. The injury prediction technology is so interesting because you can see how a player can tweak how they play the game to avoid injury. But the NFL is a game of big dudes running into each other constantly, so if AI predicts one injury, a player can still get a completely different injury.

With AI being more and more embedded in our lives, I’m not surprised that the NFL is using it. I think AI is interesting in what it can do, but people’s dependence on it also frustrates me.

I personally feel like the NFL’s use of AI is only going to grow and grow. It comes in handy when predicting injuries, but if fans begin choosing AI-generated insights over human analysis, the NFL may start to lose its authenticity.

Kittle had to be carted off the field after suffering a right leg injury and the 49ers ruled him out for the rest of the day with an Achilles injury a short time later. It looked like Kittle ruptured the tendon and that would leave him out for any remaining games the 49ers play in the postseason as well.

That will all be sorted out soon enough, but, for now, the 49ers know they’ll need to try to mount a comeback without one of Purdy’s top targets. The Niners were able to pick up a field goal on the drive when Kittle went down in the second quarter and they forced an Eagles punt on the ensuing drive, but their final possession of the first half ended when quarterback Brock Purdy fumbled before getting out of bounds on a scramble.

Since these are the 2025 Eagles, that punt came after a little bit of drama involving A.J. Brown on the sideline. Head coach Nick Sirianni and the wide receiver exchanged words after Brown was unable to reel in a pass from Jalen Hurts on third down, but cooler heads appeared to prevail before the team went into the locker room.

That left the score 13-10 Eagles at the half. The Eagles will get the ball to start the third quarter.

Purdy is 10-of-15 for 168 yards and a touchdown to wide receiver Demarcus Robinson. Christian McCaffrey has three catches for 22 yards, but has only managed 13 yards on eight carries.

He sustained the injury after making his first catch of the game and was seen clutching his ankle right after it.

,,2026-01-12 08:57:12+00:00,The Athletic,Conor Bradley's knee injury is cruel – and Liverpool's defence is stretched without him,Gregg Evans,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6961343/2026/01/11/conor-bradley-knee-injury-liverpool-defence/,"Conor Bradley knew from the start of this season that the spotlight would be on him.
As Bradley bulldozed into tackles and offered a combination of defensive solidity and effective attacking play, it became clear that his presence in this Liverpool team was crucial.
From a very young age, those who worked closely with Bradley said that he was “going to be different”.
This is his seventh injury setback in three and a half years with Liverpool’s first team, and the third of this campaign, but it is also the most serious by far.
There will be brighter chapters ahead but it might take a while for Bradley to come to terms with that.","Conor Bradley knew from the start of this season that the spotlight would be on him.

He anticipated the additional scrutiny after Trent Alexander-Arnold left for Real Madrid, understanding that if his performances at right-back did not match up, criticism could follow.

But Bradley, from Aghyaran in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, is made of stern stuff. When he was fit and firing, Bradley showed that, for all of Alexander-Arnold’s brilliance, there was no real need to worry about the England international’s exit. As Bradley bulldozed into tackles and offered a combination of defensive solidity and effective attacking play, it became clear that his presence in this Liverpool team was crucial.

From a very young age, those who worked closely with Bradley said that he was “going to be different”. Since joining Liverpool, he has been toughened up to handle the demands of playing for one of the world’s biggest clubs.

What academies don’t teach you, though, is how to stay strong when an injury ends your season and adds a cloud of uncertainty to a possible World Cup adventure. Football clubs can be supportive places during difficult times, but surely nobody within Liverpool’s Kirby training ground, and perhaps even Bradley’s inner circle, could find the words and actions to make him feel any better after sustaining a serious knee injury that requires surgery.

This is his seventh injury setback in three and a half years with Liverpool’s first team, and the third of this campaign, but it is also the most serious by far. If there’s anyone in top-level football who needs a pick-me-up — and not the Gabriel Martinelli type — it’s Bradley.

His season is over. The 22-year-old’s chance to establish himself as the first-choice right-back is on hold, and if he’s unfortunate, the World Cup this summer could be a stretch. At the very least, he will not be able to help Northern Ireland in their play-off semi-final against Italy in March. His international manager, Michael O’Neill, will be equally as frustrated while he faces up to the prospect of lining up without his most influential player.

Liverpool head coach Arne Slot had already admitted that he feared the worst when Bradley was forced off late into the 0-0 draw with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. As his right-back departed on a stretcher, Slot was seen wincing. His facial expressions seemed to reflect the concerns swirling around his head, especially as troubles down the right side of his team resurface.

However, it’s Bradley you have to feel sorry for, and he will need some time to process how the outcome could have been even more disheartening.

Importantly, he has not ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament but there is significant damage to the bone and the ligaments in his left knee. When the news is so fresh and the pain still raw, the timescale is less relevant, but five or six months is much better than nine to 12 months, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. You could forgive him for failing to compartmentalise and recognise that it could have been so much worse, given he won’t play for Liverpool again this season.

Perhaps the setbacks he has previously faced will help, even if the timing feels particularly bruising. Bradley missed four months at the start of the 2023-24 season due to a stress fracture in his back and, since then, he’s suffered ankle, hamstring and other muscle problems — but nothing as crushing as this.

With Alexander-Arnold out of the picture, Bradley was making big strides, particularly in recent weeks after returning to the squad to help tighten up the defence and offer some much-needed balance.

The right flank has been a constant source of frustration for Liverpool this season, with defenders Joe Gomez and Jeremie Frimpong missing at different times and Mohamed Salah out of form in attack.

Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones have both filled in at right-back but it was clear when Bradley returned before Christmas that he was best suited in the position. Bradley’s presence in defence also allowed Frimpong to play further forward, a valuable alternative in the absence of Salah, who scored in Egypt’s 3-2 win against Ivory Coast in their Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final on Saturday.

Slot may have to adjust things again when the Premier League resumes next weekend. He will also have little choice but to use Salah almost as soon as he returns, despite Frimpong’s pace and energy bringing a new dynamic to Liverpool’s attacks.

Frimpong used his recent spell on the sidelines to pack on extra muscle, increase speed and focus on yoga and pilates to help reduce the risk of further injuries. He will offer support to Bradley, as will other team-mates, but it won’t do much to lift the mood, as this setback has started the year off on a sour note.

The psychological challenge — regaining confidence, overcoming frustration, and staying mentally strong — will be as demanding as the physical rehabilitation ahead, especially because the narrative of his career over the past 18 months has been a relentless battle with injuries.

There will be brighter chapters ahead but it might take a while for Bradley to come to terms with that.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/11111227/GettyImages-2254684847-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-12 06:14:01.181720

Yet Kittle, perhaps knowing the worst, clapped for his 49ers' teammates even as he was carted off the field late in the first half of Sunday’s wild-card playoff game at Philadelphia.

“I think everyone’s just hurting for Kittle,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said.

Kittle missed the celebration after Brock Purdy threw a go-ahead 6-yard touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey late in the fourth quarter and the 49ers eliminated the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles with a 23-19 wild-card victory Sunday.

The 49ers head to top-seeded Seattle without Kittle next weekend for an NFC divisional playoff game.

Kittle was pushed out of bounds on a 6-yard reception and grabbed the back of his lower right leg. He was ruled out for the rest of the game.

Kittle is a key part of both the run and pass game for the 49ers, but played in just 11 games this season because of injuries. He missed five games with a hamstring injury and missed a Week 17 game with an ankle injury.

The catch against the Eagles was Kittle's first of the game.

“This team has carried the character of George Kittle throughout the entire year,” McCaffrey said. “Since I got traded here, he's the heart and soul of the entire team. It's a tough loss. When he's not playing, it means a lot. When you lose a leader like that, you never really lose him because his presence is still in the locker room.

""His energy is still here.""

Kittle had 57 catches for 628 yards receiving and seven touchdowns this season.

He honored Grateful Dead founding member and big 49ers fan Bob Weir with “DEAD FOREVER” on tape around his left ankle. Weir's death was announced Saturday. He was 78.

Shanahan also all but ruled out All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner's return against the Seahawks. Warner dislocated and broke his right ankle in a loss at Tampa Bay on Oct. 12.

Warner was a first-team All-Pro in three straight seasons and four of the last five, making the Pro Bowl in each of those four seasons.

Shanahan simply said the chances were “not very high” Warner could make an improbable comeback.

Now that the playoffs have arrived, that trend sadly seems to be continuing.

In the first half of Sunday’s NFC Wild Card game against the Philadelphia Eagles, star tight end George Kittle went down after making a catch along the sideline, and remained on the field for an extended period of time. He was then taken off the field at Lincoln Financial Field on a cart.

Here is the star tight end leaving the field on a cart:

Speculation grew on social media that Kittle had perhaps suffered a torn Achilles’, however, that is just speculation at this point:

The injury came on Kittle’s first catch of the contest. After taking the cart off the field, Kittle was seen hopping on one foot into the San Francisco locker room.

Shortly thereafter, 49ers owner Jed York, along with Claire Kittle, walked into the locker room appearing “visibly somber” according to Dianna Russini:

San Francisco quickly ruled Kittle out for the rest of the game:

Update: Reports emerged later that Kittle had indeed suffered a torn Achilles:

Kittle was one of the many 49ers who dealt with injuries during the 2025 season. The tight end played in 11 games this season, missing significant time after injuring his hamstring in San Francisco’s season-opening win over the Seattle Seahawks.

San Francisco 49ers star tight end George Kittle suffered a torn Achilles in the second quarter of the Wild Card Round matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles, head coach Kyle Shanahan said after the team's 23-19 win.

Kittle was carted off the field after being tackled following a catch in the second quarter. He immediately grabbed at his right ankle, and replay showed him give way to Zach Baun's tackle without a fight to get off his leg.

Kittle was trying to encourage his teammates as he was being carted off, clapping in their direction. But it’s hard not to feel for the 32-year-old, who many consider the best tight end in the sport.

It’s a massive loss for the 49ers, as they try to take down the Eagles on the road to advance in the NFL Playoffs. The 49ers could’ve had the No. 1 seed, home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, and a bye week, but they fell to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 18 to lose the NFC West title and those perks.

The last time the 49ers traveled to Philadelphia for a playoff contest was the 2022 NFC Championship Game, which proved brutal in the injury department as well for them.

Quarterback Brock Purdy tore his UCL in his throwing elbow, and after backup Josh Johnson also got hurt, the 49ers were left lifeless at the position in what was a beatdown as the Eagles went to the Super Bowl.

While it wasn’t Purdy, Kittle is a key piece of this entire team, let alone the offense. He provides valuable leadership whether he’s on the field or not, and injuries have kept him out during the regular season as well.

Kittle dealt with a hamstring injury that forced him to miss five of the first six games of the 49ers’ regular season games. They also had him miss Week 17 due to an ankle ailment suffered in Week 16 against the Indianapolis Colts.

The 49ers may have advanced to the Divisional Round, but Kittle won't be available to play moving forward.

But the ball deflected off the receiver's chest, leaving him vulnerable to a violent collision from safety Andrew Wingard and linebacker Foyesade Oluokun, who struck him simultaneously high and low.

Before the knee cartilage and ligament tear, Davis admitted he was already playing through discomfort from an injury he incurred against the Miami Dolphins in the final regular-season game of the 2023 campaign.

""My whole thing was I just never truly got to get healthy,"" he shared with reporters in September.

The Philadelphia Eagles will not go back-to-back after suffering a 23-19 loss to the injury-ravaged San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field on Monday morning.

It was an emotional win for the 49ers, who lost star tight end George Kittle to a torn Achilles earlier in the game and were already down a number of key players.

In fact, to further underline just how cursed this season has seemed for the 49ers, Over the Cap calculated the injuries for all 32 NFL teams by adding up how much salary cap space each had on injured lists.

San Francisco, as expected, came out on top with more than $95 million ($A142m) lost to players on IR, PUP and NFI, with Kittle joining that list.

Defensive end Nick Bosa and linebacker Fred Warner headline that list, while wide receiver Ricky Pearsall also missed Monday’s game. Philadelphia, meanwhile, was down starting right tackle Lane Johnson.

In rare fortunate news, the 49ers were bolstered by the inclusion of left tackle Trent Williams.

With Williams back in the line-up, San Francisco’s usually potent offence – which was held to just three points in Week 18 by the stout Seattle defence – immediately got an explosive play through the air to Demarcus Robinson and the veteran receiver popped up again for the go-ahead touchdown.

Entering Monday’s game there was little doubting San Francisco’s ability to move the ball, even against a stiff Philadelphia defence.

It was the other side of the ball, however, that was expected to be the problem and it didn’t take long for the Eagles to respond as a 29-yard run from Saquon Barkley helped set up Dallas Goedert for the jet sweep touchdown.

Kicker Jake Elliott’s tough season, however, continued as he missed the extra point to leave the score at 7-6 in San Francisco’s favour.

Goedert then later scored his second touchdown of the game to extend Philadelphia’s lead to 13-7 before San Francisco closed the gap with an Eddie Pineiro field goal before halftime.

While the Eagles were still in a relatively comfortable position it was far from a relaxed scene on the sideline as A.J. Brown clashed with head coach Nick Sirianni on the sideline.

The heated moment came after Brown dropped a pass on third-and-9 late in the second quarter, with Sirianni running over and yelling at his star receiver.

Eagles chief security officer Dom Disandro was forced to sep in and hold Brown back from Sirianni.

It was far from the first time Brown has voiced his frustrations publicly this season, with the star receiver previously sounding off about his usage both to reporters and on social media.

Both teams then traded field goals to open the second half before San Francisco got back in the end zone in creative fashion, with a trick play seeing Skyy Moore hand it off to Jauan Jennings on the jet sweep, who then found running back Christian McCaffrey.

That put the 49ers up 17-16 and while the Eagles regained the lead with another Elliott field goal, San Francisco continued to be far more efficient in converting on red-zone opportunities as Purdy scrambled and found McCaffrey open for his second touchdown of the game.

It ended up being the difference as the 49ers survived to set up a date with the Seahawks in the divisional round. Seattle already beat San Francisco 13-3 in Week 18.

JOSH ALLEN MAKES HISTORY IN THRILLING BILLS WIN

Earlier, NFL playoffs delivered after another thriller that went down to the wire, with the latest installment seeing the Buffalo Bills defeat the Jacksonville Jaguars 27-24.

With it, the Bills snapped a 33-year streak which had seen them fail to win a playoff game each season they did not win the AFC East.

While this is a much more flawed Buffalo team than the ones that have fallen short in the post-season in past years, the AFC also feels far more open with Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson out of the picture.

The Bills, meanwhile, still have one of the best quarterbacks in the league in Josh Allen and while he finished Monday’s game battered and bruised, he did more than enough to see Buffalo home with three touchdowns and 264 yards.

He also became the first player in NFL history to complete at least 80 per cent of his passes (minimum five attempts) and rush for multiple touchdowns in a playoff game.

The margins will be that much thinner for Buffalo with an underwhelming wide receiver room and depleted defence, but as long as No.17 is on the field this team will always have a chance.

On the other hand, it was a heartbreaking finish to a season that promised so much in Jacksonville but there is an overwhelming sense that the only way is up considering the development Trevor Lawrence showed in his first full year under new coach Liam Coen.

Buffalo’s glaring flaw during the regular season was its run defence, with the 2006 Indianapolis Colts being the only team to allow over five yards a carry and go on to make the Super Bowl.

The Bills finished the season conceding 5.1 yards per tote, and the leaky run defence was exposed on Jacksonville’s first scoring drive of the game as rookie running back Bhayshul Tuten had three-straight big runs to set up the Jaguars in the red zone.

Lawrence, having thrown an earlier pick to gift Buffalo the go-ahead field goal, then found second-year receiver Brian Thomas Jr. for the touchdown as Jacksonville overcame a shaky start to take a 7-3 lead.

Momentum had well and truly shifted in favour of the AFC South champions as Bills running back Ray Davis then fumbled on the kick-off return, immediately positioning the Jaguars in scoring territory.

But a key fourth down stop on a successful coach’s challenge from Sean McDermott saw Buffalo escape without giving up any points, and then – as he has done his entire career – Allen put the Bills on his back as he first found Keon Coleman for a 36-yard gain before then ploughing through defenders for the touchdown.

Allen got his leg folded up and made his second trip to the blue medical tent as a process, having previously been cleared for a concussion, while he also hurt a finger on his throwing hand when it hit the helmet of offensive lineman O’Cyrus Torrence.

The Jaguars got into field goal range for kicker Cam Little after a circus catch from Parker Washington, and while he had the distance his attempt sailed left of the posts.

Both teams added field goals in the third quarter with the game crying out for a hero to emerge and after Allen took his first sack of the day, Wishnowsky followed up a Buffalo 3-and-out with his worst punt of the day.

It set up Jacksonville to regain the lead and Lawrence ripped a touchdown to the underrated Washington, who has stepped up in a big way with the injury to rookie sensation Travis Hunter as one of the more dependable weapons in the passing game.

But as has been the case all wild card weekend, this was another game that seemed destined to go right up to the final play as Allen found standout tight end Dalton Kincaid open for the touchdown off a screen pump fake.

Jacksonville later retook the lead as Travis Etienne broke a tackle after a pop pass from Lawrence, with Washington again coming up clutch in the lead-up with a big catch.

It would end up coming down to the final seconds, however, as a battered Allen hurled the ball over 40 yards with defenders in his face to find Brandin Cooks for a chunk gain.

A few more completions and a Allen tush-push on 4th-and-1 set Buffalo up one yard out and Jacksonville, with no timeouts left, left the Bills score to set up a thrilling finish.

Instead, it was an anti-climatic ending as Lawrence’s first pass of the drive to Jakobi Meyers went high and was batted up, with Cole Bishop on the spot to pick it off and seal the win.

The Birds were eliminated from the playoffs in a Wild Card loss at home to the San Francisco 49ers. Final score: 23 to 19.

19 points.

The most expensive offense in the NFL by far managed to muster just 19 measly points against the worst defense in the playoffs.

It’s not exactly like Vic Fangio’s defense played their A-game in this one but they more than carried their weight for most of the season. They at least produced two takeaways in the form of Quinyon Mitchell interceptions, allowing the Eagles to be +2 in turnover differential.

And yet a terrible, uninspiring, moribund, bland offensive performance doomed the Eagles in.

This performance wasn’t merely offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo’s fault. There were a lot of penalties and lack of execution (example: a Saquon Barkley third down drop). But it’s pretty difficult to argue that Patullo is part of the solution moving forward.

If you’re blaming Patullo, which is more than fair, you also have to blame Nick Sirianni. This was the head coach’s right-hand man since coming to Philly and clearly his pick for OC this year.

Sirianni also notably opted for a field goal on 4th-and-3 from the 49ers’ 15-yard line in the fourth quarter of this game instead of trying to go for a touchdown. They would be the last points the Eagles scored this season.

If there’s a silver lining to this loss, it’s that we don’t have to watch this entirely too frustrating 2025 Eagles offense again.

But the Eagles should’ve won this game. They were 5.5-point home favorites. They rested their starters in Week 18 to manufacture a bye week.

No good excuses for this season-ending loss.

And now an offseason with many questions to be answered.

Read on for a recap and stay tuned for BGN’s postgame coverage.

FIRST QUARTER

The Eagles won the coin toss and elected to defer. The 49ers took over at their own 24-yard line. Brock Purdy’s first pass attempt went for a 58-yard Demarcus Robinson catch-and-run with Quinyon Mitchell trailing that quieted the Philly crowd. The 49ers moved to 1st-and-goal at the 5-yard line. Two plays later, Purdy hit Robinson again with Mitchell trailing in the end zone for a touchdown. Rough series for Q, who was just named first-team All-Pro. Five plays, 74 yards, touchdown. First thought: Uh, what the hell, defense? Second thought: Not the first time we’ve seen the opposition have success on a first drive before Vic Fangio’s group tightened up after that. EAGLES 0, 49ers 7.

The Eagles took over at their own 37-yard line. The Eagles went with Saquon Barkley run for two yards and then a second for 29 yards into plus territory. Fred Johnson got banged up to force Matt Pryor into the game but just for one snap. The Eagles moved into the red zone with a Jalen Hurts completion to A.J. Brown. Facing 3rd-and-3, a Barkley carry picked up a first down at the 7-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-goal at the 1-yard line, the Eagles went with a handoff to Dallas Goedert (!) for the touchdown. Awesome opening drive for the offense to answer the 49ers’ score by going 63 yards in 10 plays for the score. But then Jake Elliott missed the extra point in windy conditions. EAGLES 6, 49ers 7.

The 49eres took over at their own 26-yard line. Mitchell bounced back from his very bad first drive with a pass breakup. Facing 3rd-and-6, Purdy’s pass was completed short of the sticks. Three-and-out.

The Eagles took over at their own 32-yard line after a mere 35-yard punt. Facing 3rd-and-7 after two Barkley runs, Hurts hit Darius Cooper (!) over the middle for a first down. Facing 3rd-and-2, a Barkley run resulted in no gain. Facing 4th-and-2, Nick Sirianni kept the offense on the field and Hurts’ pass for DeVonta Smith was broken up with the 49ers’ cornerback jumping the route. Nearly picked off. Liked the decision to go for it. Would’ve preferred trying to sneak twice starting on 3rd-and-2. Also looked like Hurts made the wrong read to hand off to Barkley instead of keeping on third down.

The 49ers took over at their own 48-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-9 after Cooper DeJean broke up a pass, Purdy took off running but was forced out of bounds by a hustling Moro Ojomo for just two yards. Second straight three-and-out for the 49ers offense.

The Eagles took at their own 6-yard line after Britain Covey let a punt take a 49ers bounce to pin the Eagles back. Hurts completed a pass to Brown for seven yards to end the first quarter.

SECOND QUARTER

Facing 3rd-and-10 after picking up two first downs, Jahan Dotson false started. Facing 3rd-and-15, Hurts hit DeVonta just short of the marker. Facing 4th-and-1 from their own 44-yard line, Sirianni kept the offense and went Tush Push for the first down! Love the aggression there. The Eagles moved into 49ers territory with a fake screen right and Hurts looking back left to get the ball to Barkley for 20 yards. Really nice design! The Eagles then started to feed Tank Bigsby (the team clearly saw my tweet) and he picked up 20 yards on three straight carries. Facing 3rd-and-5 at the 12-yard line, the Eagles went with a Barkley run to set up fourth down. Facing 4th-and-2, Hurts hit Dallas Goedert for a touchdown! But the score was called back for Cam Jurgens illegally being downfield … but then the refs announced no penalty. Jurgens was actively engaged with the defender and thus not illegally downfield. Legitimately excellent drive. Elliott barely made the extra point. EAGLES 13, 49ERS 7.

The 49ers took over at their own 23-yard line. George Kittle got carted off the field after a short reception. Purdy hit Jauan Jennings over the middle for another explosive play, this one for 45 yards with Cooper DeJean trailing (first Q and now Coop?!). Facing 3rd-and-1, Jordan Davis (who previously had a stop on second down) tackled Christian McCaffrey for a loss. Facing 4th-and-2, Kyle Shanahan kept the offense on the field … but took the 49ers’ second timeout. Facing 4th-and-2 for real, the 49ers quickly put their field goal unit on the team and Eddy Piniero made a 36-yard field goal in the wind. The Eagles will gladly live with the 49ers taking three in that spot. EAGLES 13, 49ERS 10.

The Eagles took over at their own 35-yard line with 2:50 on the clock and three timeouts to work with. Hurts took a deep shot to A.J. Brown, who was open, but missed him. Facing 3rd-and-4, Fred Johnson false started. Facing 3rd-and-9, Hurts had DeVonta Smith running wide open on a crossing route for a first down but Hurts went downfield to Brown again and the receiver couldn’t make the contested catch. Missed opportunities. Punt.

The 49ers took over at their own 23-yard line with 1:51 on the clock and one timeout to work with. Facing 3rd-and-11 after Jalen Carter sacked Purdy, the 49ers had a free play with the Eagles jumping early but the 49ers declined it with a Purdy first down completion to Robinson against Adoree’ Jackson’s soft coverage anyway. Not ready to run a play, the 49ers had to burn their final timeout with the clock already stopped at 1:02. Facing 3rd-and-10, Purdy hit tight end Jake Tonges for a first down. Facing 3rd-and-5 with 0:08 on the clock after the 49ers oddly didn’t spike the ball to stop the clock earlier, the 49ers intentionally ran Purdy to try to get him out of bounds for a long field goal attempt. The Eagles almost failed to get him out … but after review, it was determined Quinyon Mitchell forced a Purdy fumble that ended the first half and prevented a 49ers field goal attempt. Phew! Got lucky the 49ers really botched that there.

THIRD QUARTER

The Eagles took over at their own 30-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-3 after two Barkley runs, Hurts hit Barkley in the flat for a would-be first down but the running back didn’t look the ball in and started to glance downfield before securing the catch. Killer mistake. Three-and-out.

Braden Mann’s punt went 58 yards to be fair caught at the 5-yard line. The 49ers picked up two first downs to move to their own 33-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-1, the 49ers went QB sneak for the first down. Purdy was then intercepted by Q, who jumped the route! A much-needed momentum boost.

The Eagles took over at their own 48-yard line. The Eagles picked up a first down on a designed run for Jalen Hurts … that was called back due to holding on Cam Jurgens. Looked like a weak flag. For some dumb reason, the Eagles decided to run the ball on 2nd-and-18 and ran for a loss. Facing 3rd-and-19, Hurts checked down to Goedert for five yards. 3 plays, -9 yards after the takeaway by the defense. Another big missed opportunity.

The 49ers took over at their own 20-yard line after Mann’s punt bounced into the end zone for a touchback. Facing 3rd-and-9, Vic Fangio brought the blitz and Purdy got hit as he threw while also seemingly not being on the same page as CMC for an incompletion. Big stop by Fangio’s squad. Vintage 2025 Eagles: weak offense, strong defense.

The Eagles took over at the plus 46-yard line with after a mere 25-yard punt by the 49ers. The Eagles picked up a first down (what a miracle). Facing 3rd-and-3, Barkley took a draw into open space for a very easy first down run. Facing 3rd-and-13 after Barkley ran for a loss (MAYBE STOP RUNNING ON SECOND-AND-LONG?), Hurts took a designed run for four yards. Could’ve been good to do that on second down instead! Elliott came in for the 41-yard field goal attempt … and made it. 10 plays to gain just 23 yards, lol. EAGLES 16, 49ERS 10.

The 49ers took over at their own 33-yard line and only needed one play to move into plus territory. Facing 3rd-and-1 at the plus 31-yard line, the 49ers went QB sneak to get a first down and end the third quarter.

FOURTH QUARTER

The 49ers went with some trickeration to begin the fourth quarter with Jennings throwing a touchdown pass to a wide open CMC to give the 49ers the lead. Good call by Shanahan. EAGLES 16, 49ers 17.

The Eagles took over at their own 35-yard line. Hurts to Barkley resulted in a first down by a Cooper holding penalty (looked tacky to me) set the offense back instead. Then Goedert dropped a pass. Facing 2nd-and-20, the Eagles went with a RUN for seven yards. Facing 3rd-and-13, Hurts bailed a clean pocket, rolled right, and threw the ball away. Awful possession! 3 plays, -3 yards.

The 49ers took over at their own 31-yard line. The 49ers picked up one first down but then Purdy threw another interception to Q!

The Eagles took over at their own 38-yard line. Hurts ran for a first down and the 49ers got called for unnecessary roughness to add 15 more yards (BS penalty to me since Hurts slid into the defender but, hey, they often call that, so, smart play by Hurts). The Eagles moved just outside of the red zone by pounding the rock with Barkley. Facing 3rd-and-9 after the refs didn’t call what could’ve been pass interference on the 49ers, Hurts hit Will Shipley for six yards. Sirianni should’ve kept the offense on the field to go for it but he settled for a 33-yard field goal make. Not sure you can merely trust this offense to get in scoring position again. EAGLES 19, 49ERS 17.

The 49ers took over at their own 34-yard line with 7:55 left in the game. The 49ers moved into field goal range. The 49ers moved into the red zone with a Purdy sack wiped out by a Reed Blankenship holding penalty. The 49ers moved into first-and-goal at the 10-yard line. Facing 3rd-and-goal at the 4-yard line after a DeJean PBU, Purdy JUST stepped up to avoid Nolan Smith (who was clearly held by Trent Williams) and then hit CMC for the touchdown. 10-play, 66-yard TD drive by the 49ers. SF missed the extra point. EAGLES 19, 49ERS 23.

The Eagles took over at their own 35-yard line with 2:54 on the clock and all three timeouts to work with. Facing 3rd-and-5, Hurts hit Brown but the wide receiver dropped the ball. Ouch. Facing 4th-and-5 from their own 40-yard line, Hurts hit Goedert for a first down as the clock rolled down to the two-minute warning. Phew. Clutch completion. Another Hurts completion to DeVonta resulted in another first down. And then again for another. Facing 3rd-and-11, Hurts’ pass to DeVonta was a tad high (still catchable) and incompletion. Facing 4th-and-11, Sirianni called a timeout that left the Eagles with just two in the event the Eagles turned the ball over on downs. Facing 4th-and-11 for real, Hurts’ throw over the middle to Goedert in traffic was broken up and incomplete. Season.

Given the time of Kittle's injury, the likely expectation is that he will work towards being available for the 49ers' first regular season game of the 2026 season.
The injury occurred after Kittle caught a six-yard pass with about six minutes to play before halftime.
Cameras showed Kittle not putting any weight on his right leg after getting out of the cart and into the 49ers' locker room.
He caught eight passes for 88 yards and a score the previous week in a win over the Titans.","George Kittle was carted off the field during the second quarter of the San Francisco 49ers' NFC wild card playoff game win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Kittle was quickly ruled out for the remainder of the game, and after the contest it was confirmed that he had torn his right Achilles after a catch.

While an Achilles tear can sometimes take up to a year to recover from, future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers returned to the practice field less than four months after sustaining the injury during the first week of the 2023 regular season. Given the time of Kittle's injury, the likely expectation is that he will work towards being available for the 49ers' first regular season game of the 2026 season.

The injury occurred after Kittle caught a six-yard pass with about six minutes to play before halftime. Cameras showed Kittle not putting any weight on his right leg after getting out of the cart and into the 49ers' locker room.

He clapped as he was being carted off the field, perhaps in an effort to motivate his teammates. The Eagles had a 13-10 lead at the time of Kittle's injury. Despite his absence, the 49ers posted a 23-19 upset win over the defending Super Bowl champions. San Francisco will now face the division rival Seattle Seahawks next weekend in the NFC divisional round.

Kittle had just one reception prior to leaving Sunday's game. San Francisco's offense was led in the first half by wideout Demarcus Robinson, who caught three passes for 66 yards that included a two-yard touchdown pass. Wideout Jauan Jennings came up with a 45-yard catch that set up a field goal.

Robinson finished the night with a game-high 111 yards receiving. The 49ers received a big second half from Pro Bowl running back Christian McCaffrey, who scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter that included the game-winning score with just under three minutes left.

While the 49ers found a win to beat the Eagles, Kittle's absence will be a critical loss moving forward for a 49ers team that has been no stranger this season when it comes to significant injuries. San Francisco went into the playoffs without linebacker Fred Warner, pass rushers Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams, and wideouts Ricky Pearsall and Brandon Aiyuk. Now, they'll have to press on without one of the best tight ends of this era.

Despite missing six games this season due to injuries, Kittle continued to play at a high level while being named to his seventh Pro Bowl. He caught 45 passes during his final seven regular-season games that included seven catches for 115 yards and a score during the 49ers' Week 16 win over the Colts.

The Eagles and 49ers will kick off at 4:30 p.m. at the Linc in South Philly.

Who is predicted to win the Eagles-49ers?

The Eagles are 6-point betting favorites vs. the Niners in the wild-card round.

Storylines to watch in Eagles-49ers

The chess match between 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan and Eagles defense coordinator Vic Fangio will be one of the most intriguing storylines to watch in Sunday's game in South Philly. Shanahan and Fangio are considered some of the best offensive and defensive play callers in the sport, and the matchup could decide who moves on to the divisional round. The two have a mutual respect for each other. Shanahan has previously tried to get Fangio to be his defensive coordinator in San Francisco, but it hasn't worked out.

Can the Eagles and Saquon Barkley get the running game going vs. the 49ers? It's been a much different season for Barkley compared to his first season in Philadelphia, but the matchup on paper against the Niners could lead to success for the Eagles. The 49ers' defense is decimated with injuries, and they just got gashed on the ground by the Seattle Seahawks in the regular season finale.

Speaking of injuries, the Niners and Eagles both have some big-name players with injuries heading into the wild-card round. The Niners will be without defensive stars Fred Warner and Nick Bosa vs. the Eagles. Warner's backup, Tatum Bethune, suffered a season-ending injury last weekend. Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams is active against the Eagles, while wide receiver Ricky Pearsall is out. Linebacker Nakobe Dean will return for the Eagles, but All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson is out against San Francisco, which means Fred Johnson will start.

Eagles-49ers postseason history

The Eagles and 49ers have only met two times in the playoffs. The last meeting happened in the NFC championship game in the 2022 season, where the Eagles defeated the Niners 31-7 before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII. In that game, the 49ers were decimated at quarterback as Brock Purdy and Josh Johnson suffered injuries.

But the bigger concern is the status of quarterback Josh Allen.

Allen headed to the blue medical tent after a third-down run late in the first quarter. With Buffalo facing a third down just outside the red zone, Joe Brady dialed up a run for Buffalo’s quarterback to move the chains. But at the end of the play two Jacksonville defenders — Travon Walker and Josh Hines-Allen — landed awkwardly on Allen’s head and neck area.

You can see the play here:

Allen exited the medical tent and picked up a tablet to start reviewing plays, so it is expected that Allen will remain in the game. According to Tracy Wolfson on CBS Sports, Allen was cleared after an evaluation for a concussion.

However, the Bills quarterback has been dealing with a foot injury in recent weeks, and while he was cleared to play Sunday against Jacksonville, Allen has been playing through the condition these past few games.

He was the first culture-resetting addition following the departure of Kyrie Irving and Terry Rozier that summer.

Williams spent four seasons in Boston, emerging as a valuable member of the bench rotation. He was part of the Celtics team that made it to the NBA Finals in 2022 under Ime Udoka. However, the versatile forward was ultimately traded to the Dallas Mavericks in a three-team trade.

Unfortunately for Williams, his time in Dallas was short-lived, and he was jettisoned to the Charlotte Hornets within months. Then, last season, in Williams’ first full campaign with the Hornets, disaster struck. The Tennessee product tore both his ACL and meniscus while facing the Milwaukee Bucks.

On Saturday, January 10, Williams finally made his return to the court. Head coach Charles Lee gave him 13 minutes of playing time off the bench. Williams ended the night with 9 points and 8 rebounds, although he struggled from the floor, hitting 3-of-10 from the field.

Charlotte ended the night with a win, defeating the Utah Jazz 150-95. As such, Williams’ shooting struggles were easily brushed under the rug. Furthermore, after nearly 14 months on the sidelines, he can be forgiven if he’s a little out of rhythm.

Not many teams have overcome the amount of important injuries that the 49ers have this season. In the first half Sunday they lost tight end George Kittle in the first half to what appeared to be an Achilles injury. And the 49ers won anyway, upsetting the Eagles 23-19 in the NFC wild-card round in a victory that ended Philadelphia’s quest for a second straight Super Bowl title.

The 49ers went 12-5 and had a shot at the No. 1 seed in the NFC all the way until the final game of the season despite several injuries through the season. When they lost Kittle in Sunday’s game, they had at least been through that situation before. Receiver Jauan Jennings threw a touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey in a key turning point at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and McCaffrey caught another touchdown in the final three minutes to give the 49ers a late lead. The Eagles drove to the 49ers’ 20-yard line but that’s when San Francisco’s defense tightened up, and on a fourth-and-11 Jalen Hurts threw into triple coverage over the middle and it was batted down incomplete.

The Eagles’ season ends in a massive disappointment, but it couldn’t have been too surprising based on how inconsistent they had been. Their offense never found its footing during the regular season and Sunday was more of the same, with a lack of execution and hardly any big plays. The dominant team that won a Super Bowl last season rarely showed up this season, and that carried over to the playoffs.

The 49ers deserve credit though. There haven’t been many teams better at overcoming adversity.

Here are some of the top moments in 49ers Super Bowl history:

Dominant Victories

Super Bowl XXIV (1989): The 49ers, led by Joe Montana, absolutely crushed the Denver Broncos with a final score of 55-10. This remains the biggest blowout in Super Bowl history. ""55-10 The biggest blowout in Super Bowl history. When Joe Montana and the Niners TORCHED the Broncos in Super Bowl 24.""

The 1989 49ers are often cited as one of the greatest teams in NFL history, with a stacked roster and a dominant playoff run. ""The 1989 San Francisco 49ers were one of the most dominant teams in NFL history.""

Heartbreaking Losses

Super Bowl LIV (2020): The 49ers had a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter but ultimately collapsed, losing to the Kansas City Chiefs. ""I totally forgot the Niners had a 10 point lead and got a pick with 12 minutes left in the game. That should've been enough to close the game out.""

This game was particularly painful for 49ers fans, as they had a high chance of winning according to ESPN's win probability chart. ""According to ESPN's win probability chart, the 49ers had a ~95% chance to win after that Mahomes pick in the 4th.""

Memorable Playoff Moments

NFC Championship 2014: Richard Sherman's iconic postgame interview after the Seahawks beat the 49ers remains a legendary moment. ""When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that’s the result you gon’ get.""

Sherman's raw emotion and direct call-out of Michael Crabtree added a dramatic flair to the intense rivalry between the two teams. ""Sherman was elite on the field, but man he was unhinged... he made up all sorts of beef just to hype himself up.""

Current Aspirations

2025 Season: The 49ers are openly thinking about the Super Bowl, with players like Fred Warner expressing their determination. ""You’re dang right I think about it — are you kidding me?""

The team has faced significant injuries but is still in contention for a top seed, showing their resilience. ""The fact that Purdy was missing and we have all these injuries and are still in contention for the 1 seed (I think?) is crazy.""

Fun Facts

17-Game Season Impact: There's speculation that the extended season might be contributing to the increased number of injuries. ""I want to say it's either the 17 game season finally having cumulative impact or there aren't actually more injuries.""

NFC West Trend: Every NFC West team that has been the #1 seed since 1999 has made it to the Super Bowl. ""Every NFC West team to be the #1-seed ended up making the Super Bowl since the 1999 Rams.""

Niners tight end George Kittle suffered an Achilles injury in the second quarter of Sunday's wild-card game against the Eagles, was carted off the field and was quickly ruled out by San Francisco.

The seven-time Pro Bowler was being tackled by safety Marcus Epps toward the sideline when his calf appeared to pop as he planted it in the ground. He went down and received medical attention before being helped onto a cart.

Quarterback Brock Purdy and other teammates tapped him on the helmet as Kittle headed into the locker room, reminiscent of the last time these two teams met in the postseason and Purdy suffered an early elbow injury.

In the '23 NFC title game, Purdy went down on the team's first drive, taking the wind out of the 49ers' sails before an eventual 31-7 loss.

This time around, calamity struck on the team's fourth possession, though the injury occurred on Kittle's first catch of the day.

At the time of his departure, the 49ers were trailing, 13-7. They went on to finish the drive with a field goal.

Such a gut-sinking injury to one of the team's biggest star is unfortunately familiar to the Niners both in years past facing the Eagles and in the narrative of their 2025 season.

The sixth-seeded 49ers reached the postseason despite dealing with myriad injuries on both sides of the ball. Purdy missed eight games due to a turf toe injury, and his pass-catching corps seemed to be a revolving door of walking wounded. Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, the defense's two most vital players, played a combined nine games, with Bosa out for the season and Warner banking on a deep playoff run for a chance at returning.

""The trainers knew before the cart came out and got word to me in the headset,"" Shanahan told reporters. ""Yes, a torn Achilles.""

Despite the injury, the 49ers went on to a 23-19 win to end Philadelphia's season and advance to a divisional round matchup against the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks in a rematch of the regular-season finale for both teams. Like they've done all season, the 49ers persevered through injury to pick up the win.

Kittle's season, meanwhile, is done. And he'll face a long road to recovery at 32 years old.

Kittle left the field on the back of a cart shortly after sustaining his injury in the second quarter. The 49ers ruled him out shortly after he left the field and announced that he'd injured his Achilles tendon. Philadelphia held a 13-7 lead at the time of Kittle's injury midway through the second quarter.

The injury occurred when Kittle planted his right leg while being tackled after making a catch.

Kittle remained down on his back with his right leg in the air. Trainers tended to Kittle on the field before he eventually took a seat on the back of a cart. Kittle sat upright and waved to fans as he was driven off the field.

The 49ers finished 12-5 and made it to the playoffs despite injuries to several key players, including season-ending injuries to All-Pro defenders Nick Bosa (torn ACL) and Fred Warner (fractured ankle). Kittle missed six regular-season games with a torn hamstring, but returned to finish another strong season that earned him his seventh Pro Bowl berth.

In what has become somewhat of a rivalry in recent years, the 49ers beat the Eagles in a 42-19 rout in Week 13 of the 2023 NFL season, one year after Philadelphia defeated San Francisco in the NFC Championship Game when quarterback Brock Purdy left early in the contest with an elbow injury.

San Francisco officially listed wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle injuries) as inactive, while left tackle Trent Williams will play.

NBC Sport's Bay Area's Matt Maiocco listed his five 49ers to watch in today's pivotal playoff clash against the Eagles.

Star tight end George Kittle was carted off the field in the second quarter of a wild-card game against the Philadelphia Eagles with an apparent lower leg injury. He was later ruled out by the team with an Achilles injury.

Head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed after the 49ers beat the Eagles 23-19 that Kittle tore his Achilles tendon and will be out for the remainder of the playoffs.

Kittle stayed on the ground, seemingly in pain, after recording his lone catch of the contest. He waved and clapped to the crowd as he received a round of applause while heading off the field in the cart.

Kittle has been one of the best tight ends in the league since entering in 2017, posting four 1,000-yard seasons while earning seven Pro Bowl nods and two first-team All-Pro honours.

This season, the 32-year-old was one of the many injured 49ers, playing in just 11 games. He still managed to record 57 grabs for 628 yards and seven touchdowns.

George Kittle had to be carted off the field after he suffered an Achilles injury after making a catch and being tackled along the sideline with 5:58 left in the second quarter of Sunday’s wild-card clash against the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field.

The former All-Pro caught a short first-down pass for six yards from Brock Purdy near the right sideline. He never quite had his footing as he was tackled by Eagles safety Marcus Epps.

Kittle, one of the most dynamic pass-catching tight ends in the league, immediately grabbed the back of his right ankle, which appeared to get twisted as he was driven out of bounds.

It was his first catch of the game.

49ers owner Jed York and Kittle’s wife, Claire, walked into the team’s locker room and appeared visibly somber in the wake of the crushing injury, The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reported.

The seven-time Pro Bowler played just 11 games this season, as he was limited by injuries, including missing five contests with a hamstring injury.

When on the field, Kittle remained very productive with 57 catches for 628 yards and seven touchdowns.

The Eagles led the 49ers at the time of the injury, 13-7. Philadelphia took a 13-10 lead into the half.

The 49ers are looking to return to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2024, when they lost to the Chiefs.

Here's what to know about Kittle's injury.

George Kittle injury update

Kittle has been ruled out for the remainder of Sunday's game because of an Achilles injury, the 49ers announced. They did not immediately provide any additional information on the 32-year-old tight end's prognosis.

Kittle recorded one catch for six yards before leaving Sunday's game because of the injury.

Who is George Kittle's backup?

Luke Farrell is listed as the 49ers' top backup to Kittle. The 6-5, 250-pound tight end is best known for his blocking abilities and played about 36% of San Francisco's offensive snaps during the 2025 NFL season.

Farrell recorded 11 catches for 85 yards and caught the first two touchdowns of his career. The fifth-year veteran spent the first four seasons of his career with the Jacksonville Jaguars before signing with the 49ers in free agency.

49ers TE depth chart

The 49ers have three tight ends on their 53-man roster. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

George Kittle

Luke Farrell

Jake Tonges

While Farrell will be the immediate replacement for Kittle, Tonges should see plenty of action as well. The California product only played five fewer snaps than Farrell this season and served as the team's primary pass-catching tight end when Kittle was out of the lineup earlier in the season.

Tonges logged 34 catches for 293 yards and five touchdowns in 2025. His production came after failing to log a single reception across his first three NFL seasons.

Ickey Ekwonu sustained a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee during Saturday’s wild-card round loss to the Los Angeles Rams, according to head coach Dave Canales on Sunday. Ekwonu was injured during the second series of the 34-31 defeat at Bank of America Stadium.

“Timeline-wise, all of those times vary and all that, but it is significant,” Canales said Sunday. “It’s going require surgery, so prayers and thoughts for Ickey. Just battled for us, and worked on some things along the season. Just a guy that I love, a guy that I trust out there, and so we’ll all be with him the whole way. And with him a speedy recovery as he comes back.”

Ekwonu, the team’s first-round pick in 2022, is set to play on the fifth and final year of his rookie contract in 2026. He has been eligible for a contract extension since the conclusion of the 2024 season, but the team picked up his fifth-year option last offseason instead.

Ekwonu was replaced by veteran Yosh Nijman against the Rams. Nijman had previously filled in for Ekwonu for two starts at left tackle during the regular season. Nijman is a pending unrestricted free agent in March.

“Yosh stepped in there and allowed us to play some good ball,” Canales said.

With Ekwonu likely to undergo a long rehabilitation process, the Panthers will need to figure out if they want to keep Nijman as experienced insurance or look for a help at left tackle elsewhere.

Starting center Cade Mays and versatile veterans Austin Corbett and Brady Christensen are also set to become free agents in 2026. Christensen has been on the shelf since the midway point of the season with an Achilles injury.

According to Over the Cap, the Panthers are projected to have the third-highest offensive line payroll in the NFL in 2026. That $86.6 million total is without Mays, Nijman, Corbett and Christensen factored into the math.

Buffalo edge down field and bring up 3rd and 4. Still loads of time left with three timeouts. This is the game now. Allen slants it to Khalil Shakir who fights to the line through a defender and is short. 4th and inches. Everything is riding on this. The tush push gets the inches, then they RUMBLE in for the score. WHAT?! They had no business pushing the QB that far, there was 10 yards to go and they just carry him forward and IN! Or is he? The call on the field is touchdown but they come back and say Allen is short. Isn’t that a better outcome though? They can get the score on the goal line and use more clock. Drama!

He eats it up, the throw is perfect even so. Nails. 20 yards to go to retake the lead and win this nail-biter?

Parker Washington is having a day. Lawrence finds his man again for a 31-yard gain and Liam Coen throws the ball back to Washington on the next play with a design run. Jacksonville are in the red zone now and grab another 1st down with a wildcat snap to Travis Etienne.

Bills 20-17 Jaguars 7:10, 4th quarter

Buffalo force a quick 3rd down as the blitz gets to Trevor Lawrence and bats down the pass. Eight yards remain to move those sticks. Lawrence drops back deep and rolls … the throw is off but Christian Benford is burned for defensive holding. That could be costly, needless hold.

Bills 20-17 Jaguars 8:38, 4th quarter

Gabe Davis has been carted to the locker room. The Bills receiver had his head bowed with a towel covering him up. An injury to his left knee, the same knee he has hurt before.

TOUCHDOWN! Bills 20-17 Jaguars 8:56, 4th quarter

J Allen to D Kincain for 15 yards

Another lead change! After Allen converts the 4th down, the QB fakes a screen pass then pings one at his tight end Dalton Kincaid. The big man has a few steps and just makes it into the left corner of the end zone before being smashed out on to the sidelines. Perfect timing on the throw to find Kincaid in space before reaching the waiting defender.

Bills 13-17 Jaguars 9:56, 4th quarter

Buffalo go play action. It works a treat. The linebackers all crunch down and Dawson Knox is wide open to make a 24-yard grab. Next Gabe Davis does Gabe Davis things and lets a catch bounce off his chest anticipating contact. Davis was unfortunately right about the viciousness of it as he has to be helped off the field. With about 30 to go a short pass brings up 3rd and 6. Allen takes off on the scramble … but he slides and they give the 1st down. Looks dodgy and the Jags challenge.

Bills 13-17 Jaguars 12:09, 4th quarter

Jacksonville are heating up on defense as pressure forces Josh Allen to throw it away on 2nd down. With four to get Allen lays one to Dalton Kincaid on the sideline. 1st down.

TOUCHDOWN! Bills 13-17 Jaguars 12:55, 4th quarter

T Lawrence to P Washington for six yards

Another brilliant throw from Trevor Lawrence gets exactly what it deserves. Parker Washington streaks from left to right across the middle of the end zone and the throw is perfectly placed ahead for Washington to run on to. The defender was right on him but he hangs on while flying through the air. He’s got six catches for 76 yards and the go-ahead score.

Bills 13-10 Jaguars 14:04, 4th quarter

Trevor Lawrence gets sneaky on 3rd down and targets a backup cornerback who is in the game for Jordan Poyer. Poyer will not return with a hamstring injury and his replacement Jodran Hancock is burned for 18 yards. Buffalo bring up another 3rd down. Buffalo send the house and Lawrence gets it out again targeting Hancock. Parker Washington picks up 14 yards on the catch. Inside the red zone now as the 3rd quarter ends. This is tense.

SACK! Bills 13-10 Jaguars 3:58, 3rd quarter

Josh Allen is pulled down and loses 11 yards. All of his guys are covered up. Josh Hines-Allen brings him down for the Jags’ first sack. Spooky. The punt is shanked putting Trevor Lawrence on his own 38-yard line. Decent starting position to take the lead.

Bills 10-7 Jaguars 12:48, 3rd quarter

“The team that attack better will win this game,” says Tony Romo on commentary. Wise words as 3rd down comes up for Buffalo. Khalil Shakir takes the short pass. He looks like coming up well short until a spin move shakes a defender and he makes it over the line to gain. A great throw again to Shakir on play action moves Buffalo to midfield. Allen takes a big shot as he throws it. No fear.

Buffalo Bills 10-7 Jacksonville Jaguars, half-time

What do we think then? Not the high-octane affairs of yesterday (yet). Very delicately poised though. Maybe Liam Coen needs to get Bhayshul Tuten back in the game. He has not had a touch since four rushes for 51 yards put the Jaguars on the goal line for their only points. Buffalo’s run stopping looked pretty shoddy.

It’s NO GOOD! Bills 10-7 Jaguars 0:00, 2nd quarter

It’s all happening! A huge 34-yard gain from Lawrence to Parker Washington puts them in range but they don’t get down the field in time and the snap is too late!? No, they just get it off and the defense is not set properly. The penalty allows a field goal chance with one second on the clock. Cam Little misses to the left on the 54-yard try. Another deflating moment for Jacksonville.

Share

Bills 10-7 Jaguars 0:32, 2nd quarter

Oh Trevor! Nice moves. He spins away from what have been a safety and goes full gazelle mode up field to bite off 18 yards. Long field goal record holder Cam Little doesn’t need as much room as most.

Bills 10-7 Jaguars 1:05, 2nd quarter

A long pass to Brandin Cooks is overturned for an incompletion putting the Bills on 3rd and 7 at midfield. The short pass has no chance. What to do on 4th and 4? A timeout for the Jags adds to the thinking time … the musing on Allen’s throwing hand continues. Give it a rest lads. They are going for it or so they would like the Jags to believe. Delay of the game and punt. Lawrence has a minute to drive with two timeouts. What a punt that was though right into the corner to the two-yard line!

The Jaguars flipped their record from 3-14 last season to 13-4 in head coach Liam Coen’s first year. Buffalo is in an unfamiliar position as it finished second in the AFC East and will be on the road in the wild-card round for the first time since Josh Allen’s second NFL season.

The AFC East has a new champion this year in New England, which won the division title for the first time since 2019 … which means Buffalo will need to win multiple road games to get over the hump and make it to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 1990s.

Allen had another big year with 39 total touchdowns (25 passing, 14 rushing) and 3,668 yards through the air. Buffalo fell to Kansas City in a thriller last postseason and won’t have an easy road this year.

Jacksonville won its first AFC South title since 2022 this season, finishing with the second-most wins in the conference. The Jaguars won the second-most games in franchise history and earned the franchise’s first double-digit win campaign since they won 10 games in 2017 and made it to the AFC championship game. Coen may have unlocked something in Trevor Lawrence that could carry the Jaguars through the postseason.

Allen headed to the medical tent after running up the middle for two yards on a third-and-6. The 2024 NFL MVP was thrown to the ground at the end of the play but was able to leave the field under his own power.

The Bills did not immediately provide an update on Allen's status. He was seen standing on Buffalo's sideline shortly after being checked out by the team's medical staff.

CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson reported Allen was checked for a concussion by the independent neurologist on staff for Sunday's game. He cleared the NFL's concussion protocol and will be eligible to return when the Bills next get the ball.

Mitchell Trubisky is the Bills' backup quarterback and would be called upon to enter the game if Allen can't go for any reason.

They have the 19th pick of the 2026 draft after winning the NFC South to draw a first-place schedule in the upcoming season.
Ekwonu's rookie deal ran through the 2025 season, but Carolina picked up his fifth-year option.
That means he is under contract through the 2026 season with an upcoming cap value of more than $17.5 million fully guaranteed.
""Just a guy that I love, a guy that I really trust out there,"" Canales said of Ekwonu.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Coach Dave Canales said the Carolina Panthers will have to adjust their offseason draft and free agency planning after learning starting left tackle Ickey Ekwonu suffered a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee in the first quarter of Saturday's 34-31 playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams.

The typical recovery time for the injury is six to 12 months, which means the sixth pick of the 2022 draft will miss the entire offseason program and potentially all of the 2026 season.

""Timeline wise, all those times vary, but it's significant,"" Canales said Sunday as the team was cut loose for the offseason following Carolina's first playoff appearance since 2017. ""It's going to require surgery. Prayers and thoughts for Ickey.""

Canales was with the Seattle Seahawks in 2016 when tight end Jimmy Graham returned from the same injury in just under nine months. That timeline has been described as ""extraordinary"" for an injury that has been known to dramatically shorten careers.

Canales said the Panthers (8-10), who haven't selected an offensive lineman in the past two drafts, will have to take Ekwonu's injury into consideration as they move forward.

They have the 19th pick of the 2026 draft after winning the NFC South to draw a first-place schedule in the upcoming season.

""It is something we have to consider, knowing we're going to go through a full offseason -- what's the timeline, how does that affect training camp, roster numbers and all of that,'' Canales said.

Ekwonu's rookie deal ran through the 2025 season, but Carolina picked up his fifth-year option. That means he is under contract through the 2026 season with an upcoming cap value of more than $17.5 million fully guaranteed.

But the injury could impact Carolina's long-term commitment to Ekwonu.

Carolina has five other linemen who are free agents. They are guard/center Austin Corbett, backup tackle Yosh Nijman, center/guard Cade Mays, backup tackle/guard Brady Christensen and backup lineman Jake Curhan.

""Just a guy that I love, a guy that I really trust out there,"" Canales said of Ekwonu. ""We'll all be with him the whole way. We wish him a speedy recovery as he comes back.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0111%2Fr1599226_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 16:00:31.554467

Coach Kyle Shanahan said Williams was able to practice on a limited basis for a second straight day Friday, while Pearsall missed all three days of practice for San Francisco this week.

Pearsall leads San Francisco with eight catches on throws at least 20 yards downfield.
Quarterback Brock Purdy didn't attempt a single deep pass last week with Pearsall out with injuries to his knee and ankle.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall will both officially be questionable for the San Francisco 49ers for their wild-card playoff game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.

Coach Kyle Shanahan said Williams was able to practice on a limited basis for a second straight day Friday, while Pearsall missed all three days of practice for San Francisco this week.

Williams said he was confident he would be able to return for the first time since injuring his hamstring on the first snap in Week 17, but it will be a game-time decision.

The 49ers listed four other players on the active roster as questionable, including starting cornerback Renardo Green, who was limited Friday after hurting his ankle at practice. Linebackers Dee Winters (ankle) and Luke Gifford (quadriceps), and defensive lineman Keion White were also questionable.

Winters didn't practice all week, Gifford missed practice both Thursday and Friday, and White returned to practice Friday on a limited basis after sitting out the previous two days.

Jacob Cowing, who had his practice window open this week, is officially listed as questionable but is not expected to be activated from injured reserve from a hamstring injury.

The Eagles listed three players as questionable for the game, including star right tackle Lane Johnson, who has missed the last seven games with a foot injury. Linebacker Azeez Ojulari (hamstring) and guard Brett Toth (concussion) were also questionable for the Eagles.

The status of Williams and Pearsall will be important for the 49ers, who struggled on offense without them in a 13-3 loss last week to Seattle.

The Niners have averaged just 2.8 yards per carry running to the left side since Williams got hurt on the opening snap of the win against Chicago on Dec. 28.

It would be unstoppable for some stretches during a game and inept for others. Now that the Eagles are in the playoffs, can they put together a complete game on offense when they face the San Francisco 49ers in an NFL Wild Card Playoff Game?

The Eagles could get a significant boost if right tackle Lane Johnson returns after missing seven games with a foot injury. If he does return, that should help protect quarterback Jalen Hurts and create running room for Saquon Barkley.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

At least the Eagles defense should give them a chance. The defense has been among the NFL's stingiest over the second half of the season. From Weeks 10-17, the Eagles have allowed an average of 14.5 points per game, the best in the NFL during that stretch.

But 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who had 2,126 yards from scrimmage this season, along with tight end George Kittle could be a handful.

The Delaware News Journal is providing live coverage of the wild card playoff game. Follow along here for the lastest updates, news and analysis:

Eagles downgrade O-lineman to out; Lane Johnson questionable

The Eagles downgraded backup center/guard Brett Toth from questionable to out on Jan. 10. Toth suffered a concussion against the Commanders on Jan. 4. Toth practiced on a limited basis on Jan. 8, and fully on Jan. 9. But apparently, he didn't get cleared by an independent neurologist in order to be eligible to play.

Toth is the primary backup for center Cam Jurgens and left guard Landon Dickerson. Without Toth, it's likely that rookie Drew Kendall will be the backup center and Matt Pryor the backup at left guard.

Eagles vs. 49ers prediction

Eagles 30, 49ers 17: Here comes the referendum on offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. If the Eagles can't outscore a 49ers' defense reeling from injuries, well, it's hard to see Patullo coming back next season. And really, the Eagles should have all of the advantages on offense: They're rested, healthy, at home, and seemingly ready to unleash QB Jalen Hurts and RB Saquon Barkley. Still, it's the Eagles' defense that will make the difference − again. − Martin Frank

The MVP candidate did not miss a snap, and refused to leave the game with his team's season hanging in the balance.

X-rays on Stafford's finger were negative and there was no dislocation after the hit, which appeared to happen after crunching his hand on Panthers defensive end D.J. Wonnum's arm, NFL Media reports. Given the prognosis, it's unlikely Stafford will miss any time with the Rams' divisional round playoff opponent looming next weekend.

""I got a finger bent back,"" Stafford said after the game. ""They saw it on the TV, on the sideline or whatever. I didn't, obviously, know exactly what had happened. It wasn't pleasant. It wasn't great. We'll see what it is. Was obviously able to finish the game and throw it decent. You know, once the ball's snapped, the adrenaline's pretty good. So we'll hopefully, you know, just keep it going,""

After the injury, Stafford misfired on 10 of his next 12 pass attempts including an interception. He rebounded in the fourth quarter with a pair of touchdown drives, capped by scoring tosses to Kyren Williams and Colby Parkinson. The 19-yard completion to Parkinson gave the Rams a 34-31 lead with 38 seconds to play, capping a seven-play, 71-yard drive after the Panthers just regained the advantage.

Stafford finished with 304 yards passing, three touchdowns and the lone turnover as the Rams moved on to the divisional round of the postseason.

49ers LT Trent Williams hopeful to play

San Francisco 49ers left tackle Trent Williams was a limited participant during practice on Thursday and Friday, after sitting out on Wednesday with a hamstring injury he suffered in Week 17.

Williams usually rests on the first day of practice during a game week, but head coach Kyle Shanahan clarified that wasn't the case, saying the All-Pro was still hurt. Williams said Friday he's confident he can play on Sunday.

“Honestly, I’m kind of pushing the limits on how much [time] is required for it,” Williams said Friday. “So it will probably be in the back of my mind for a little bit. But once I get out there and get the juices flowing and the adrenaline going, I don’t think it should be a big problem.”

Receiver Ricky Pearsall did not practice Friday, but was spotted on a side field this week. Shanahan said Wednesday that Pearsall aggravated the PCL injury that has limited him this season during Week 17.

Lane Johnson (foot) has been listed as questionable for the Philadelphia Eagles' Sunday meeting with the San Francisco 49ers. Johnson was limited in practice this week after being out since Week 11 with a Lisfranc injury.

“Lane’s a big difference maker, and I know he is working crazy to get himself back, and we will see where that is this week,” head coach Nick Sirianni said this week. “But he’s a difference maker. … He’s one of the best that’s ever done it. I think I kind of get too much into scheme with that. But yeah, he allows you to do some different things.”

""I mean, I love Ickey, man.
That wasn't the only injury, as Hunt left the game in the first half, but returned in the second after what was announced as a pectoral injury.
""I mean, it took a lot, man, but I just attacked it every day, attacked every day,"" Hunt said.
Their core of Hunt, left guard Damien Lewis, and right tackle Taylor Moton are all under contract through 2027.","He was smiling and joking with teammates as he left the locker room on crutches with a brace on his knee, but that belied the uncertainty ahead of him.

""It was hard, man, because Ickey was excited,"" guard Robert Hunt said. ""Ickey was ready to play. Ickey had a lot of juice. Ickey was ready to play, man, and to lose that energy, it was kind of tough, but Yosh stepped in and did a really good job.

""I mean, I love Ickey, man. Ickey came in and joked, you know, he's just being Ickey, so, Icky's all right. Ickey's going to attack it the right way. Ickey's going to be OK, and Ickey's going to come back.

Ekwonu had missed the Dec. 21 Buccaneers game here with a knee issue, and quarterback Bryce Young said that Ekwonu has been battling throughout the year to stay on the field for the 15 games he played (he missed the opener while recovering from a preseason appendectomy.

""I feel for him, so much, such a warrior,"" quarterback Bryce Young said. ""Obviously he's played so much, and probably from the outside looking in you'd think he's just been in perfect health, but he's been battling every week. He's been in the training room, doing all the little things.

""He's been pushing through a lot of pain, and you know he's a warrior. He's a huge part of, of us as a team. I really feel for him, so, yeah, it's tough to see that.""

That wasn't the only injury, as Hunt left the game in the first half, but returned in the second after what was announced as a pectoral injury.

""Literally a couple of plays in my right pec pops,"" Hunt said afterward. ""But I don't think it's off of the bone, so if it wasn't off the bone, I was going to play.""

As alarming as that thing a football player just said was, he came back and played the second half, and that was impressive considering what he went through.

He went on injured reserve after Week 2 with a torn biceps, but was activated this week to play in a playoff setting.

""I mean, it took a lot, man, but I just attacked it every day, attacked every day,"" Hunt said. ""I never had a question that I wasn't going to play. I mean I'm just a guy that's optimistic.""

The Panthers have general reason to be optimistic.

Their core of Hunt, left guard Damien Lewis, and right tackle Taylor Moton are all under contract through 2027.

But they have five unrestricted free agents that make up the bulk of the depth they leaned on this year (Saturday was the 12th different combination of starters in 18 games this year).

Centers Cade Mays and Austin Corbett, guard Jake Curhan, Nijman (who replaced Ekwonu Saturday and started on both sides this year) and injured swing man Brady Christensen are all free agents come March.

So as much as this is their identity and personality, there are still a lot of questions heading into the offseason.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/tronu68f9o5nyumfzbwb,N,,2026-01-11 12:59:34.844925

After the Panthers took a late fourth-quarter lead on a beautiful pass from QB Bryce Young to the back corner of the end zone where WR Jalen Coker made a great catching while being tackled, the Rams marched down the field and answered with a touchdown of their own that took the lead for good in the final minute.

Back in Week 18, the Panthers had a win-and-in game against their division rival Buccaneers to win the NFC South and secure a home playoff game. Carolina ended up losing that game in Tampa, 16-14, in an ugly game played in the rain. Young outplayed Bucs QB Baker Mayfield, but the Panthers had just 19 total rushing yards and turned it over three times and never got any consistent momentum on offense.

However, due to the mechanics of a three-way tie for the NFC South lead between the Panthers, Buccaneers, and Falcons, Carolina won the division and hosted Los Angeles on Saturday. It didn’t go the way the Panthers hoped, but it was their first playoff game since 2017 and builds some momentum for Young and Panthers HC Dave Canales.

NFL Delivers Punishment to a Carolina Panthers Defender Before the Rams Game

Ahead of the Rams game, the Panthers got the news that one of their players was hit with a fine by the league for his actions against Tampa Bay. Panthers CB Mike Jackson was fined $11,593 for a taunting penalty he received late in the first quarter of that game.

Against the Buccaneers, Jackson had seven tackles. He was sensational for Carolina against the Rams, finishing the wildcard game with three tackles, four passes defensed, and a third-quarter interception that set up the Panthers’ first go-ahead touchdown. Los Angeles continually attacked him on the outside — as they’d rather target him than former All-Pro CB Jaycee Horn — but he stepped up time and time again with big stops and huge plays when his team needed him most.

Carolina Panthers QB Bryce Young Had a Fantastic Postseason Debut

The game didn’t go his way, but Young was sensational in his first postseason action. He’d had an up and down third season in Carolina, having some huge moments — including the fourth quarter of the Panthers’ Week 13 win over the Rams — but also had some struggles, particularly in high-volume passing game scripts.

Against the Rams in the wildcard round, Young went 21 of 40 for 264 yards, with one touchdown and one interception. He also ran three times for 24 yards and a second-quarter touchdown to give Carolina some momentum going into halftime.

The completion percentage and yards per attempt numbers might not jump off the page, but it felt like every time the Panthers needed a big play, Young stepped up. He made big plays downfield when his team needed him, though he and his team ultimately came up just short.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2253835929-e1768096956751.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-11 11:59:29.782249

On top of that, though, he will serve as the next man up at all positions other than center on Saturday, as the Packers have ruled out right tackle Zach Tom, who has been dealing with back and knee injuries.

Tom’s last game played was Week 15 against the Denver Broncos, when he played fewer than half of the team’s snaps before going down with a knee issue. At the start of the week, head coach Matt LaFleur said that the expectation was that Tom was going to play this round of the playoffs, but Tom went from a limited participant on both Tuesday and Wednesday to a non-participant on Thursday’s practice, a move that was described as a “rest day” by the staff. Obviously, though, something changed throughout the course of the week.

Add this to your list of Packers’ offensive line bad luck in the postseason, be it David Bakhtiari’s injury in a practice on New Year’s Eve in 2021, last year, when Elgton Jenkins, who is currently on the injured reserve, went down against the Philadelphia Eagles or when Green Bay had the bright idea to start Billy Turner at left tackle, after never playing there previously for the Packers, in a playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers.

Tom is expected to be replaced by Jordan Morgan, who has served as his injury replacement over the past couple of weeks. Behind him, it will be Kinnard, who is expected to serve as the backup at both tackle and guard positions.

Beyond Tom, the Packers ruled receiver Dontayvion Wicks out on Friday after a full two-week stint in the NFL’s concussion protocol. To make up for Dontayvion Wicks being out and Savion Williams and Bo Melton being placed on the injured reserve, the Packers have brought up two former practice squad receivers, Jakobie Keeney-James and Isaiah Neyor.

Up to a pool of 54 gameday players to make up their 48-man active gameday roster, the Packers also make four healthy scratches on Saturday: QB Desmond Ridder, WR Jakobie Keeney-James, DE Collin Oliver and CB Jaylin Simpson. QB Malik Willis, DT Warren Brinson, LB Nick Niemann and S Javon Bullard will all play after being listed as questionable going into the weekend.

Meanwhile, Jacksonville's Cam Little has made 20 straight field goals entering the playoffs, including an NFL-record 68-yarder on Nov. 2 and a 67-yarder, the second longest in league history, last week.

Is Matt Prater playing today?

Prater is expected to play in the wild-card game against the Jaguars on Sunday. His was officially questionable on the final injury report. Prater sat out Wednesday's walkthrough, participated in full at Thursday's practice and rested on Friday.

The Bills signed veteran Matthew Wright to the practice squad Tuesday but did not elevate him.

Prater will be the only kicker available. Buffalo could utilize punter Mitch Wishnowsky on kickoffs and choose to attempt 2-point conversions after touchdowns.

Bills running back Ray Davis is the team's unofficial emergency kicker. He made an extra point in the preseason and attempted an onside kick for Buffalo in Week 10. Davis was named first-team All-Pro as a kickoff returner on Saturday.

Prater re-aggravated his right quadriceps injury that kept him out of the previous two games in the season finale.

He made all three of his extra point attempts in the first half but did not play in the second half of the Bills' 35-8 win over the New York Jets. Buffalo went for 2-point conversion attempts on each of its second-half touchdowns and punter Mitch Wishnowsky handled kickoff duties.

""Kind of work with two plans, one where he’s able to go come Sunday and one where he’s perhaps not able to go,"" McDermott said on Monday.

Prater has made 18 of 20 field-goal attempts and 46 of 49 extra points for 100 points in 15 games this season. The 19-year veteran holds the NFL record with 82 field goals of at least 50 yards. He held the league record for longest made field goal, 64 yards, from 2013-2021.

Wright kicked in four games this season for the Titans, Commanders and Texans, going 5-for-5 on field goals and 4 of 4 on extra points. He's made 60 of 68 field goal attempts and 45 of 47 extra points in 33 career appearances.

The Bills signed veteran Michael Badgley with Prater out Weeks 16 and 17, but released him on Dec. 29 after he continued to be plagued with extra point struggles. Badgley played two games with the Bills, missing an extra point in his first game and having an extra point blocked in his second game. The latter complicated the Bills' comeback attempt and ability to tie or take the lead in the final seconds of a 13-12 loss to the Eagles.

Tyler Bass, the Bills’ starting kicker from 2020-24, has been on injured reserve all season with hip and groin injuries. He underwent season-ending surgery in November.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/06/PROC/88050259007-getty-images-2239451212.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y5&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-11 09:57:42.245683

“I know we’ve spent all week saying there was nothing that was going to keep Lane Johnson off the field,” NFL Network’s Mike Garofolo said on Saturday, January 10. “Well .. there is some concern he could miss this game. He was limited in practice all week and he looked good in spurts. But that’s a tough injury. That’s a painful injury. I would say that he’s a legitimate game-time decision.”

Johnson, a 6-time NFL All-Pro right offensive tackle, missed the final 7 games of the regular season with a Lisfranc injury in his foot.

The Eagles, the No. 3 seed in the NFC Playoffs, open their Super Bowl title defense at home against the No. 6 seed San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, January 11, at 4:30 p.m. EST on Fox.

For Philadelphia, much of their success seems to be tied to Johnson, a likely future Pro Football Hall of Famer, being in the lineup.

From The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jeff McLane on Tuesday, January 5: “Eagles RT Lane Johnson is expected to practice on Wednesday for the first time since he suffered a Lisfranc foot injury vs. the Lions on Nov. 16, per NFL sources. Johnson has made progress in his recovery, but still has to test his right foot before the team makes a decision on his availability for Sunday’s wild card game vs. the 49ers … The Eagles went 3-4 in the 7 games he sat out because of the foot injury, and are now 18-28 in games he hasn’t played during his 13-year career. Johnson has missed just one playoff game — a wild card loss to the Seahawks in 2020 — out of possible 15 in his career. In 2023, he held off adductor surgery until after the Eagles’ run to the Super Bowl.”

Matt Johnson writes: ""This should be a game where Ben Johnson feeds the football to D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai 30-plus times and mixes in some play-action deep shots for Caleb Williams. Now, Green Bay can make it a game early with Jordan Love exploiting a Bears defense that allowed 27.3 PPG and 5.9 yards per play from Weeks 8-17. However, Love will also throw an interception in this game, and the inability of the Packers defense to generate a stop leads to Chicago winning by two scores at Soldier Field.""
