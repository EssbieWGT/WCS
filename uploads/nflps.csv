This is after the Broncos took down Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round on Saturday, 33-30. The thrilling contest required an extra period to determine a winner. In the end, the Broncos prevailed to book their spot in the next round against either the New England Patriots or the Houston Texans.

Nix turned in a strong performance in the win. The 25-year-old quarterback registered 26-of-46 completed passes for 279 yards, three touchdowns and one interception, adding 29 yards on the ground on 12 carries.

Nix was involved in a contentious incident late in overtime. It turned out to be a pivotal moment in the contest, which ultimately led to a game-winning field goal by the Broncos.

With 6:09 left in overtime, Nix threw an incomplete pass to wide receiver Courtland Sutton. As he released the pass, Bills defensive end Joey Bosa came in with a late tackle, resulting in a roughing the passer penalty against the Buffalo star.

According to the NFL rulebook, “any physical acts against a player who is in a passing posture (i.e. before, during, or after attempting a pass) which, in the game official’s judgment, are unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls.”

Bosa is now bracing for a punishment decision from the NFL for his personal foul on Nix. The league will review this incident to determine if the foul was excessive enough to warrant a fine. Per league rules, a roughing the passer penalty can be subjected to a fine of $17,389 for a first offense and $23,186 for a second.

Bosa has already been fined for a roughing the passer penalty earlier this season. The five-time Pro Bowler was fined $17,389 for a foul on Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Baker Mayfield in Week 11.

The Broncos opted to decline the 15-yard penalty on Bosa’s roughing the passer infraction. There were two fouls on the play. Bills cornerback Taron Johnson was flagged for defensive pass interference against Sutton. Denver accepted that penalty, resulting in an automatic first down.

The Broncos ended the drive with a 23-yard, game-winning field goal by Wil Lutz.

It’s the end of the line for Bosa and the Bills, who have now been eliminated from the playoffs. Nix and the Broncos, on the other hand, will host the conference championship game at Empower Field at Mile High on Sunday.

However, a former NFL defensive star gave the Patriots an ominous reminder.

New England could face a Broncos squad led by Jarrett Stidham for the AFC title if Mike Vrabel’s team defeats the Houston Texans on Sunday. Yet the Patriots know better than most teams not to count out a second-string quarterback.

Gerald McCoy brought up an unpleasant memory Sunday on NFL Network’s “NFL GameDay” when noting that Nick Foles led the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl LII win over Tom Brady’s Patriots in place of Carson Wentz.

“I got two words for you: Nick Foles,” McCoy said. “This is the best of the best. This is the NFL. You don’t go into somebody’s house thinking, ‘Oh, he’s the backup quarterback.'”

Of course, the Patriots have other business to handle before thinking about the Broncos. They won’t get a chance to play the AFC’s vulnerable No. 1 seed unless they snap the Texans’ 10-game winning streak on Sunday.

McCoy advised the Patriots to stay focused on the AFC Divisional Round rather than dream of a Super Bowl trip. If they advance, they shouldn’t take the Broncos lightly without Nix.

“They need to worry about tonight,” McCoy said. “Forget next week. Don’t worry about next week … But if you go into next week thinking it’s going to be sweet, you got another thing coming. Because this is the best of the best, and Sean Payton will have them ready.”",https://s47719.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/Bo-Nix-e1763390084811.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 15:59:46.524353

Bo Nix Injury Update: National Football League (NFL) player Bo Nix has reportedly broke his right ankle late in overtime of the Denver Broncos' divisional-round victory over Buffalo on Saturday and will have surgery that will sideline him for the rest of the playoffs.

According to Payton, Nix got hurt on a designed quarterback run that resulted in a loss of two yards. He was seen limping back to the huddle, but it never looked like a serious injury during the game.

Taking to X, Denver Broncos coach Sean Payton announced that the team's 25-year-old quarterback would be having surgery to repair a fractured bone in his ankle after sustaining an injury during the game against the Buffalo Bills on Saturday.

Let's learn how dangerous these injuries can turn and how long does it take for an individual to recover completely after undergoing a surgery.

According to The American Sports Journal, ankle injuries such as ankle bone fractures, especially in high-impact sports like American football, can take serious turn that can only be managed with proper rehab (one that includes surgical interventions). When the joint is unstable or weight-bearing bones are involved the affect of such injuries can be at their worst. Dr Robert Downey, says ""In quarterbacks, ankle injuries can be especially concerning because they affect mobility, balance, throwing mechanics and long-term joint health"".

How Dangerous Is a Broken Ankle?

As the NFL player is set to miss the rest of the matches, let's take a close look what such injuries look like and how worse they can turn.

As per Dr. Norman Waldrop, an orthopedic surgeon who is associated with the NFL, a broken ankle can range from a simple hairline fracture to a complex break involving multiple bones and ligaments.

Experts suggest that some of the health issues that a sport person is expected to suffer after such injuries are:

An acute pain and stiffness near the affected area.

Unable to move properly

Post-traumatic arthritis

Prone to future injuries

Understand that if not treated properly, ankle fractures can significantly shorten athletic careers.

How Long Does Recovery Takes?

As per experts, recovery from such injuries takes between 0-6 weeks to 6-9 months, depending solely on the intensity of the injury or the type of injury.

As per NFL officials Nix will undergo surgery and will only join the team after undergoing proper rehab for recovery.",https://st1.thehealthsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01hwtjhpw1g7yt5meam5.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 14:59:04.036782

Denver Broncos coach Sean Payton announced that the team’s 25-year-old quarterback would be having surgery to repair a fractured bone in his ankle after sustaining an injury during the game against the Buffalo Bills on Saturday, Jan. 17, according to the team’s official X account.

The athlete suffered the injury on a first-and-10 play from the Bills’ 36-yard line with just over six minutes left in overtime, per ESPN. After being tackled by Buffalo safety Cole Bishop, Nix could be seen walking with a slight limp as he made his way toward the team huddle.

During the following kneel-down play, however, Nix’s right ankle seemed to twist awkwardly, after which the athlete's limp became more apparent as he moved to the sideline before Will Lutz led the team to victory with his game-winning field goal. The second-year quarterback will be sidelined for the rest of the season.

""There will be a lot of emotions, and then the refocus takes place,” Payton told reporters during a postgame press conference. “We celebrate the season for him.”

Dr. Norman Waldrop, an orthopedic surgeon who previously operated on Joe Burrow’s turf toe earlier in the season, will allegedly perform the procedure on Nix’s ankle on Jan. 20, according to NFL insider Ian Rapoport.

Jarrett Stidham will replace Nix as the starting quarterback for the remainder of the playoffs.

Seahawks: Charbonnet injured a knee in the second quarter and did not return.
Seahawks: Are one victory away from the fourth Super Bowl appearance in franchise history and first in 11 years.","SEATTLE (AP) — Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor and Doug Baldwin hyped up the famed “12th Man” crowd in Seattle, providing a throwback to the Seahawks’ fearsome “Legion of Boom” teams from the 2010s.

Then, in their first playoff game in front of home fans in nearly a decade, the Seahawks found a new level of dominance.

Rashid Shaheed returned the returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown, Kenneth Walker III rushed for three scores and Seattle forced three turnovers in a never-in-doubt 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday night that sent the top-seeded Seahawks to the NFC championship game.

“One of our most complete games, for sure,” defensive lineman Leonard Williams said. “(Shaheed) starting the game off like that set the tone.”

Sam Darnold threw a touchdown pass and got his first career playoff win in his first season with the Seahawks (15-3), who will host either the Chicago Bears or the Los Angeles Rams next Sunday with a trip to the Super Bowl at stake.

The Seahawks led 7-0 13 seconds into the game thanks to Shaheed, who fielded the opening kick and took it 95 yards to the end zone. It was the fourth kickoff return for a touchdown to open a playoff game since 2000 and the longest postseason kick return in franchise history.

“I was so hyped,” defensive lineman Byron Murphy II said. “I wasn’t expecting that, but when he did it, I knew the game was over then. I already knew.”

Darnold, who had been listed as questionable because of an oblique injury, guided the Seahawks on two more scoring drives before San Francisco got on the board with the first of its two field goals. As he has all season, Darnold impressed his teammates with his toughness.

“He told us he was going to do whatever it takes to get back and play for us,” offensive lineman Grey Zabel said. “That was a gutsy performance by him, not feeling his best. He continues to just be a leader in the huddle, on the field, on the sidelines.”

After he flopped in his playoff debut last season with the Minnesota Vikings by taking nine sacks in a 27-9 loss to the Rams, Darnold completed 12 of 17 passes for 124 yards and connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown in the star receiver’s playoff debut.

Seattle hadn’t played in the postseason since the 2020 season, when it lost at home to the Rams with no fans in the stands because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 49ers (13-6) were never competitive in the second-most lopsided playoff loss in franchise history. San Francisco lost 49-3 to the New York Giants in the divisional round in the 1986 season.

The Niners were missing three injured All-Pros: tight end George Kittle, linebacker Fred Warner and defensive end Nick Bosa. Star left tackle Trent Williams, who played through a hamstring injury, was proud of his team for getting as far in the playoffs as it did.

“When you’re playing with guys you’re signing off the practice squad,” Williams said, “guys (you are) taking off the street — you got to temper expectations a bit.”

Brock Purdy completed 15 of 27 passes for 140 yards with an interception and a lost fumble against the Seahawks’ “Dark Side” defense. Seattle also recovered a fumble by tight end Jake Tonges.

“Everything’s working for us, to be honest,” safety Nick Emmanwori said. “Everything’s working. We fly to the ball, we’ve got (a) great scheme, great coaches, great players. I (think) it’s hard for teams to find a way to score on us or beat us straight up.”

Walker waltzes to career night

Walker’s three rushing touchdowns tied him with Shaun Alexander for the most in a playoff game in franchise history. Two of the scores came after halftime, and he celebrated one by chucking the ball into the crowd.

“I’d do it more,” Walker said, “but I’d get fined for it.”

Walker finished with 116 yards rushing, his most since his rookie year in 2022, and he picked up the slack after Zach Charbonnet was injured during the game. The Seahawks ran for 175 yards, their third most this season.

“You can see it, how they’re breathing, they’re tired, they’re slow to get up,” Walker said. “You can see it’s demoralizing to them.”

Pursuit of Purdy

The Seahawks’ front seven made life difficult for Purdy, chasing him across the field while sacking him twice. With the Niners thin at receiver, Purdy scrambled five times for 37 yards and frequently threw on the run.

“It’s no secret in terms of their style of play,” Purdy said. “Trying to make a quarterback check it down and play deep to short. Then within that, have a good pass rush. That’s a good defense, man.”

Injuries

49ers: RB Christian McCaffrey (stinger) was injured in the second quarter and returned in the third quarter before exiting the game for good. Tonges injured a foot and did not return.

Seahawks: Charbonnet injured a knee in the second quarter and did not return. LT Charles Cross injured a foot in the third quarter and did not return.

Up next

49ers: Heal and reload for next season.

Seahawks: Are one victory away from the fourth Super Bowl appearance in franchise history and first in 11 years.

Unfortunately, Nix is out for the season, and the Broncos are stuck playing their biggest game in over 10 years without their franchise guy. If it’s time to live in fantasy land, how about Tom Brady returning for one last Super Bowl run?

Find out whether Brady could even return on such short notice to add some more silverware.

Details on Tom Brady’s Availability

Pump the brakes on Brady because it ain’t happening. In fact, the legendary quarterback isn’t even allowed to play for the Broncos even if he wanted to. He owns a minority stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, and this prevents Brady from signing with Denver.

So, it’s going to be Jarrett Stidham for Denver. Stidham will replace Nix, the 14th-ranked quarterback in the league according to PFSN’s QB Impact Metric.

Stidham has started four games in six years in the NFL. He has just eight touchdowns and eight interceptions in his limited action. Now, he’s got a chance to lead his team to the Super Bowl.

Head coach Sean Payton is ready to rock with Stidham. It’s so hard to learn an offense and playbook in a short period of time. The AFC Championship isn’t the time to be playing around at the quarterback position. Payton trusts his guy and will do everything he can to get him ready.

There are only scraps left in the quarterback market. There is no one on the market who would be instilling more hope in Broncos fans than just rocking with Stidham.

In November, he told reporters he believes “that chapter is closed.” Colin Kaepernick, 38, last played in 2016 and spent nearly nine years waiting for a call that never came. Jake Fromm, 27, was released by Detroit last April and remains unsigned. Taylor Heinicke, 32, was released by the Chargers in August and hasn’t found a roster since.

The rest of the free agent quarterback market is equally uninspiring. Tim Boyle signed with Tennessee last March, was waived in August after a disastrous preseason outing, and remains unsigned.

Dorian Thompson-Robinson bounced from Cleveland to Philadelphia to the UFL’s Orlando Storm. Clayton Tune was cut by both Arizona and Green Bay this season.

Bryce Perkins won UFL MVP last spring, got a brief Panthers audition in August, was waived within a week, and ended up in the Canadian Football League.

The Texans and Patriots will be gearing up for their matchup tomorrow with one eye looking at the opportunity to take on the Broncos, led by Stidham. Both of these defenses will relish the chance to make the Super Bowl, with the Broncos’ offense weakened.

Luckily for these teams, Brady can’t come back to try to get his eighth Super Bowl. If you’re doubting that Brady could do it, come on. He did it with the Buccaneers on the wrong side of 40; if there’s anyone who could, it’s the seven-time Super Bowl champion.

But it’s all for nothing, and fans can gear up for Brady on Championship Sunday, but only for him to be on the microphone calling the NFC Championship game.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/17232749/can-broncos-sign-legendary-qb-01-18-26-1-1024x722.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 14:00:31.549433

Seahawks 41, 49ers 6

'The Seahawks had the best offseason of any team.' Overreaction?

No, not an overreaction. The Seahawks went into the 2025 offseason intent on and expecting to sign Geno Smith to a contract extension. When it became apparent to them that Smith wasn't interested in extending his deal at their numbers, they traded him to the Raiders and signed Sam Darnold. Say what you will about Darnold, but the 2025 Seahawks went 14-3 -- same record as Darnold's 2024Vikings -- and now he has a home game Jan. 25 in the NFC Championship Game.

Seahawks GM John Schneider went about his offseason the same way he would have had he landed his first choice at quarterback. He signed DeMarcus Lawrence. He signed Cooper Kupp because he's a better blocker at this point than Tyler Lockett. He drafted Nick Emmanwori in the second round. Schneider freaking loves the second round. Even as someone who likes to see players get as much money as they can and wishes the top QBs would push harder to move the market upward for others, I still have to appreciate a philosophy like Seattle's approach: ""Do we have to pay our quarterback $50-plus million per year if he still hasn't shown he's that guy?""

A Seahawks employee told me after the team's wild Week 16 victory over the Rams, ""We're trying to win championships here,"" and the Seahawks obviously are living that. Seattle has lost three games all season, and the margins were four, three and two points. Two of those losses were to division rivals, one of which they eliminated Saturday. Is Darnold the second coming of Joe Montana? No. Of John Elway? No. Of Patrick Mahomes? No. But the Seahawks decided, at some point, that they intend to be the example of how to win a championship without paying great quarterback money toa pretty good quarterback because there's a championship-caliber roster around him.

Kudos to the Seahawks for treating the QB portion of their offseason the way they would have treated any other portion of it. They didn't get the player they wanted, but they knew they could still win with this quarterback because of everything else they do well. Hiring Mike Macdonald as head coach was a last offseason move, not a this offseason move, but it was still one that impacted their approach to this offseason. And here they still are. -- Graziano

The lingering question: Will the 49ers be NFC favorites with a healthy team next season?

It's too early to say, of course. But spin it forward for me. The Seahawks will likely be the favorite, barring some catastrophic injury between now and then. The Rams could be up there, as well, especially if they finish the NFC playoffs strong ... but Matthew Stafford's career longevity is always going to be a question that hurts them in the futures markets. Meanwhile, the 49ers still have most of their main players under contract.

Trent Williams' contract is expiring, and the offensive line clearly needs help across the board. Wide receiver is a little thin with theBrandon Aiyuk situation unclear and Jauan Jenningsapproaching free agency. But that young defense, which was hammered by injuries this season, will returnNick Bosa and Fred Warner. AndYetur Gross-Matos and Jordan Elliott are the only two expiring contracts there. This group will benefit from postseason experience next season and will presumably add to the pass rush.

Of course, the 49ers will see if they get through the offseason without losing defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, who was key to their surprising success despite all the injuries. Saleh has interviewed with the Titans and Ravens already and is a deservedly hot name on the head coaching circuit. If he gets a job, San Francisco will be forced back on the defensive coordinator carousel.

It's also worth noting that the 49ers, who had a very easy schedule entering this season, will play a third-place schedule next season despite their postseason appearance. With only a few moves in offseason housekeeping and a regression to the mean in injury luck, the Niners should be considered a deep NFC playoff team once again. -- Solak

Broncos 33, Bills 30

'The Broncos are done without Bo Nix.' Overreaction?

No, not an overreaction. The Broncos barely won Saturday's game. Buffalo had to turn the ball over five times -- including once in overtime -- or else Nix might not have broken his ankle in the first place. And certainly, without Nix's clutch play in the fourth quarter and overtime, Denver wouldn't have won and advanced to a home AFC Championship Game.

But now? You want me to believe the Broncos are going to beat Houston or New England with Jarrett Stidham at quarterback? And even if they do, does anyone believe they can then win the Super Bowl? I'm sorry, Jarrett, but it just doesn't feel to me like this Broncos team is good enough to pull a 2017 Eagles and win this thing without their starting quarterback.

The Broncos have a good defense, yes. We know this about them. But they weren't super awesome Saturday against a Bills team that moved the ball extremely well between turnovers, and they haven't been elite in the way that defenses such as Seattle and Houston have been -- at least not over the second half of this season. The Broncos do run the ball better than most think, but c'mon. We all watched this game. The Bills handed the Broncos 10 points at the tail end of the first half, then three more at the start of the second, and Buffalo still had a fourth-quarter lead that Nix found a way to overcome. Nix isn't a perfect player, but what he can do with his legs and what he can do in the clutch are separating factors that Stidham just doesn't offer.

The Broncos defense is going to have to play the game of a lifetime next week -- even if it's against Houston's inconsistent offense -- if it wants to lug this team into the Super Bowl. And even if it collects a bunch of turnovers and sneaks into the big game, Denver is then going to have to beat a team that has had two weeks off and likely still has its starting quarterback.

It's a shame. It would have been fun to see what Sean Payton and this Broncos team could have done. Payton could have been the first coach to win the Super Bowl with two different teams. But in the wake of the Nix injury news, all of that is a lot harder to imagine. -- Graziano

The lingering question: Why do the Bills keep losing in the postseason?

I have no idea. What is there to say? The Bills turned the football over five times, and no team that turns the ball over five times deserves to be in the game at all. Josh Allen's end-of-half fumble to let the Broncos go up 20-10 was an inexcusable mistake. He was stripped to start the second half to give Denver an even bigger lead. He threw a pick immediately off a key defensive takeaway.

It felt like Allen was digging the hole, and then as always, Allen was the one to pull the Bills back out. But there were too many misses. Allen failed to connect with Khalil Shakir on a third-and-8 screen in the red zone that could have allowed him to score, and he missed an open Dawson Knox at the end of regulation on a throw that could have walked the game off. Allen was simultaneously one of the biggest reasons the Bills were still in that game, while also being one of the biggest reasons they fell short.

The Bills have now made it to seven consecutive postseasons with Allen at the helm, which means they've suffered seven postseason losses. There's really no unifying factor on the field, though. Wide receiver talent was a big deal in this game; Allen was 0-for-9 throwing 20-plus yards downfield, and downfield production is often a receiver stat. The pass rush has been an issue and was again in this game; Nix was pressured on 20% of his dropbacks, and the Bills needed to send blitzes to get home. Defensive back depth was also a big deal; two of Nix's three touchdowns came targeting backup defensive backs.

Still, when you've lost seven playoff games, there are some obvious unifying factors -- coach Sean McDermott, GM Brandon Beane and Allen. The Bills' triumvirate has been in place for the better part of a decade and has yet to get over the hump. Whether fair or unfair, the buck stops at the top, and the fact that the Bills have failed to make a Super Bowl in Allen's tenure despite seven postseason appearances is an enormous failure.

If the Bills make changes, I'd totally get it. If they don't, I'd totally get it, too. They've been so close so many times. What a devastating loss.-- Solak

,,2026-01-18 16:43:25+00:00,The Denver Post,What's next for Broncos after Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury? - The Denver Post,Luca Evans,,,,,https://www.denverpost.com/2026/01/17/broncos-bo-nix-ankle-injury-whats-next/,"Bo Nix popped, again, back onto the soles of his feet.
“My ankle doesn’t feel right,” Nix said to Payton, a Broncos source told The Denver Post.
But they thought, in the moment, it could've been just a high-ankle sprain, as the Broncos source told The Post.
Nix, Payton said, had fractured a bone in his right ankle.
Nix told Payton -- as he's repeated to reporters multiple times -- that God had a plan for him.","Bo Nix popped, again, back onto the soles of his feet. The same way he’d done through a sophomore season of brutal hits and blistering comebacks at Auburn, always down and never out. The same he’d done for 63 straight games since transferring to Oregon in 2022, the move that put him on a collision course toward changing the fate of football in Denver.

And here, with the Broncos’ greatest win in the last decade all but wrapped up, Nix went to the sideline and told Sean Payton the five haunting words that might derail this dream in Denver.

“My ankle doesn’t feel right,” Nix said to Payton, a Broncos source told The Denver Post.

Keeler: If Broncos’ Jarett Stidham can be steady as Marvin Mims, Denver will be OK

A first-and-10 designed run for Nix had come up empty the previous play, as Bills safety Cole Bishop zipped through Denver's formation to wrap up the Broncos quarterback by the ankles for a loss of two. Nix came up limping ever so slightly, as the broadcast showed. His face, though, looked a little worse for wear. Broncos coaches knew he was hurt from that statement alone. But they thought, in the moment, it could've been just a high-ankle sprain, as the Broncos source told The Post.

""The kid's tough as nails,"" the source said. ""So -- this kid's a warrior. He's a competitor.""

Nix took a few-step drop on second down from Buffalo's 38-yard-line, reared back, and dropped in a perfect ball to Marvin Mims that drew a pass-interference flag on Bills corner Tre'Davious White. Game over. Season over for Buffalo.

Season over for Denver, maybe, too.

Two plays later, Nix took a knee to ice an eventual game-winning field goal from kicker Wil Lutz. A minute later, orange jerseys spilled out across the grass at Empower Field, reveling in a 33-30 overtime win over Buffalo that had landed squarely on the shoulders of their 25-year-old quarterback. Defensive tackle Malcolm Roach raised his fists to the heavens. Cornerback Pat Surtain II spread his arms and pattered around the green like a self-controlled airplane. None of them had any idea as to what was wrong with Nix until Payton, in street clothes, strode back to the postgame podium for the second time Saturday night after the madness cleared.

Nix, Payton said, had fractured a bone in his right ankle. He'd be out for the year.

Renck: Super Bo or bust? Nix breaks ankle. Jarrett Stidham, you got next

""I would've tried to kept it -- so I could talk to the team first,"" Payton told reporters. ""But the odds of something like this being kept quiet until Monday at 9:00 (a.m.) are impossible. And so, I felt like, in essence -- I'm talking to the team now.

""So, look, they'll be disappointed,"" Payton continued. ""There'll be a lot of emotions, and then the refocus takes place.""

But how do these No. 1-seeded Broncos refocus, just two games from hoisting a Lombardi Trophy, without the young arm and leader this entire organization has been built around?

In December, talking with The Denver Post about Payton's approach to roster-building, backup quarterback Sam Ehlinger said, ""it's all about Bo."" Offensive-line pieces such as Garett Bolles and Quinn Meinerz have been developed and extended in front of him. Defensive pieces such as Talanoa Hufanga and Dre Greenlaw were brought in to increase Denver's overall strength at playing complementary football. And Nix's level of responsibility and trust in Payton's offense has only grown throughout 2025 -- particularly as starting running back J.K. Dobbins went down in November.

In the locker room Saturday night -- before the Nix injury news, tight end Adam Trautman's eyes popped as The Post recounted Nix's final statistics against the Bills. Denver's second-year quarterback threw the ball 46 times (for 279 yards, three touchdowns and a pick). He ran the ball 12 times (for 29 yards). All in all, the Broncos ran a total of 68 plays from the line of scrimmage in their win against Buffalo.

Nix either threw the ball or ran the ball himself on 85% of them.

""Oh, wow,"" Trautman said, angling his head in slight disbelief. ""Gosh.""

""I think it's great,"" Trautman said, after a question on Payton's belief in Nix. ""And Bo's earned the trust. Because we've been in situations like this ... we've been in these positions all year.""

They were in that same position again on Saturday, staring directly down the barrel of a 14-3 season ending unceremoniously in the AFC divisional round. Denver assembled with four minutes to play in regulation, down 27-23 after a true seesaw of a playoff game, its offense having once again sputtered to a halt in a season of fits and starts.

Nobody flinched, as Trautman recalled, because of the man in the middle.

""It's like, 'Alright. We got Bo. Let's see what happens,'"" Trautman said. ""You're not like, 'Oh, we gotta be careful!'

""It's like, 'Nah, let's go.'""

Nix didn't say anything specific, as Trautman remembered. It was just feel. The earned confidence of a quarterback who'd orchestrated a league-high seven game-winning drives in the regular season, and who left tackle Garett Bolles said has ""ice in his veins."" Nix hit Courtland Sutton for 11 yards to start the drive, and Sutton again for 25 on a third-and-11 three plays later, and dropped a beauty into Marvin Mims Jr.'s outstretched arms to cap off yet another go-ahead fourth-quarter drive.

""Threw a freakin' dime to Marv,"" tight end Evan Engram said, postgame.

Renck: Super Bo or bust? Nix breaks ankle. Jarrett Stidham, you got next

Less than an hour later, though, Nix was sitting in a hallway in Empower Field with his family, mulling the news. Payton, the man who'd handpicked him out of Oregon, came over. Nix told Payton -- as he's repeated to reporters multiple times -- that God had a plan for him.

""I said, 'I didn't realize that,'"" Payton joked. ""I said, 'If I hadn't known that, I wouldn't have drafted you.'""

Payton, too, told Nix that this Broncos team has lost key players all year. They played Sunday without Dobbins, starting center Luke Wattenberg and safety Brandon Jones. And the head coach told his quarterback that they'd ""rise up for the next challenge.""

The man whom Payton will count on, in that case, is 29-year-old backup Jarrett Stidham. And there's a strong sense of belief throughout the staff and organization in Stidham, who put on a show in preseason and began his career playing behind Tom Brady in New England. Payton, for one, put on a confident face at Saturday's second postgame presser.

""I said this at the beginning of the season -- I feel like I've got a No. 2 that's capable of starting for a handful, a number of teams,"" Payton said. ""And I know he feels the same way. So watch out. Just watch.""

Payton, too, has talked about ""painting the picture"" for the quarterback multiple times in building this Broncos roster. That didn't apply to just Nix. That's this QB room in general, with Stidham and veteran Sam Ehlinger under the watchful eye of rising Denver assistant Davis Webb.

But Nix was the soul of this Broncos team, with an earned confidence in moments like Saturday's. And Denver will have to find a way to carry the faith without him.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TDP-L-BRONCOS-BILLSA03_2120x.jpg?w=1024&h=632,N,,2026-01-18 14:00:39.456725

The Broncos lost last year at Buffalo but Nix led Denver to the AFC’s top seed this season.","DENVER (AP) — The Denver Broncos wrangled their biggest win in a decade from Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills but suffered an enormous loss in the process.

About an hour after second-year quarterback Bo Nix led the Broncos to a 33-30 win on Wil Lutz’s 23-yard field goal in overtime Saturday, Denver coach Sean Payton returned to the postgame lectern to deliver the stunning news.

He said Nix broke his right ankle a few plays before Lutz’s kick sent the top-seeded Broncos (15-3) to the AFC championship game against either New England or Houston.

Nix will have season-ending surgery Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama.

“We celebrate the season for him,” Payton said. “And listen, the city’s ready and we’ll be ready for the next challenge.”

Backup QB Jarrett Stidham takes over for Nix. He took just one snap this season, a kneel-down in a blowout win over Dallas in Week 8.

“Stiddy’s ready,” Payton declared. “He’s ready. I said this at the beginning of the season I’ve got a 2 that’s capable of starting for a number of teams. And I know he feels the same way. So, watch out.”

Stidham has appeared in 20 games in six NFL seasons, starting four and winning one.

Nix got hurt on a keeper where he lost 2 yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was limping after the play, but there was no indication that he suffered such a serious injury.

On the next play, Nix threw a deep pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that drew a 30-yard pass interference flag and got the Broncos well into field-goal range. Nix then took a knee to center the ball for Lutz’s game-ending field goal.

Nix tied Russell Wilson’s NFL record with two dozen victories in his first two seasons. Saturday’s victory was his first in the playoffs. The Broncos lost last year at Buffalo but Nix led Denver to the AFC’s top seed this season.

“He’s a tough cookie,” Payton said. “And this team all year has lost key players and will rise up for the next challenge.”

Before word of Nix’s injury broke, Denver was jubilant over the Broncos’ first playoff victory in a decade.

Denver’s game-winning drive came after nickel back Ja’Quan McMillian intercepted Allen’s deep pass in overtime. McMillian’s pick was Denver’s fifth takeaway of the game after they were minus-3 in turnover differential during the season.

McMillian wrested the ball away from Brandin Cooks at the Broncos 20-yard line when a field goal would have won the game for Buffalo (13-6).

“He actually had the ball coming down and I had my hand on the ball,” McMillian said. “I was able to take it from him. I fell on top of him, just held the ball up, showed the fans some love.”

Cooks said he thought it was a catch.

“I feel that way,” he said. “But at the end of the day, you don’t, you know, no matter, ultimately this is where we’re sitting now.”

Referee Carl Cheffers said in a pool report, “The receiver has to complete the process of a catch. He was going to the ground as part of the process of the catch and he lost possession of the ball when he hit the ground. The defender gained possession of it at that point. The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender was awarded the ball.”

Cooks said he just has to make sure next time not to leave it in the “officials’ hands.”

Or McMillian’s.

Nix said nothing about being hurt during a postgame interview with CBS, and he sounded as if he was looking forward to the next game.

“It’s great to have home-field advantage in a situation like this. It’s exciting. This is why you play the game, this is why you compete. You get to playoff football, and good things happen,” Nix said.

Former Broncos kicker Matt Prater nailed a 50-yard field goal with 5 seconds left in regulation, knotting it up at 30-all. That came after Nix’s 26-yard touchdown throw to Mims with 55 seconds left had given Denver a 30-27 lead.

Allen, who hadn’t turned the ball over in his previous six playoff appearances, threw two interceptions and lost two fumbles.

“I felt like I let my teammates down,” a teary-eyed Allen said.

The Bills failed once again to reach the Super Bowl with Allen under center even though Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson weren’t standing in his way this time as that trio of franchise quarterbacks all missed the postseason party.

Coming off the first road playoff win of his career, Allen’s first three turnovers helped Denver built a 23-10 lead before he threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Keon Coleman and a 14-yarder to Dalton Kincaid to give Buffalo a 24-23 lead early in the fourth quarter.

Quick strikes

The Broncos scored 10 points in the final 22 seconds of the first half to take a 20-10 lead into the locker room, and they got their third takeaway just two plays into the second half on Nik Bonitto’s strip-sack of Allen that was recovered by Malcolm Roach at the Bills 17, leading to a field goal.

Denver avenged a 31-7 loss at Buffalo in the playoffs last year.

“We weren’t ready last year,” Payton said. “But we were ready today.”

“I feel like I’ve got a two that’s capable of starting for an ample number of teams,” Payton told reporters after announcing Bo Nix’s season-ending ankle fracture. “So watch out. Watch. Just watch.”

The Broncos won’t sign a free agent quarterback off the street before the AFC Championship Game. They shouldn’t. The Philip Rivers experiment that Indianapolis ran this season — and its 0-3 record — provides a cautionary tale in real time.

Why Denver’s Best Option Is Already in the Building

Rivers came out of a five-year retirement at 44 years old to rescue the Colts’ playoff hopes after Daniel Jones tore his Achilles in Week 14. He knew Shane Steichen’s system intimately. Fourteen of his former teammates still played in Indianapolis. The training staff, the equipment room, and the terminology were all familiar. Rivers completed 63.0% of his passes and posted respectable numbers across three starts.

However, the Colts lost all three games.

Learning an NFL offense in a week is effectively impossible. Payton runs one of the league’s most nuanced systems, demanding precise timing and route adjustments that take months to internalize. Stidham has spent three seasons absorbing it. He’s been in the quarterback room with Nix daily, breaking down film, running the scout team, and preparing as if his number might be called.

“There is no gray area with Sean,” Stidham said earlier this season. That’s precisely why he’s the right choice now. He understands what Payton wants before Payton says it.

Also, the free agent quarterbacks offer no viable alternative. Scan the list of unsigned quarterbacks, and the names make it clear that this isn’t the path Denver wants to go down.

Ryan Tannehill, 37, hasn’t taken an NFL snap since 2023. In November, he told reporters he believes “that chapter is closed.” Colin Kaepernick, 38, last played in 2016 and spent nearly nine years waiting for a call that never came. Jake Fromm, 27, was released by Detroit last April and remains unsigned. Taylor Heinicke, 32, was released by the Chargers in August and hasn’t found a roster since.

Some fans may immediately wonder about Tom Brady (even though he’s 48 years old), but his ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders prevents him from making another NFL comeback.

The rest of the free agent quarterback market is equally uninspiring. Tim Boyle signed with Tennessee last March, was waived in August after a disastrous preseason outing, and remains unsigned. Dorian Thompson-Robinson bounced from Cleveland to Philadelphia to the UFL’s Orlando Storm. Clayton Tune was cut by both Arizona and Green Bay this season. Bryce Perkins won UFL MVP last spring, got a brief Panthers audition in August, was waived within a week, and ended up in the Canadian Football League.

These aren’t hidden gems waiting for an opportunity. They’re players who couldn’t crack 53-man rosters across the league — some of them multiple times in the same calendar year.

Even if Denver could pluck a veteran off the street, that quarterback would face either the Patriots or Texans defense with roughly eight days of preparation in an offense built on pre-snap reads and option routes. The calculus doesn’t work.

Stidham’s track record isn’t extensive, but it exists. His first NFL start with the Raiders in 2022 produced 365 yards and three touchdowns against San Francisco. His two starts closing the 2023 season for Denver — after Russell Wilson was benched — yielded 496 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. He’s 1-3 as a starter, but that record includes games with nothing to play for on bad teams.

This is different. This roster went 14-3 and earned the AFC’s top seed. It’s also worth noting that he led the league in preseason passer rating last August.

Denver’s Defense Is the Actual Insurance Policy

The conversation around Nix’s injury has fixated on who throws the football. The more relevant question: Does it matter as much as everyone assumes?

Denver’s defense forced four turnovers against Josh Allen on Saturday night. Pat Surtain II has established himself as the league’s best cornerback. Nik Bonitto and the pass rush generated consistent pressure throughout the Bills game. Vance Joseph’s unit has carried this team through tight contests all season — the Broncos went 12-2 in one-score games, a mark that speaks to defensive reliability in crucial moments.

Stidham doesn’t need to be Bo Nix. He needs to protect the football, convert third downs at a reasonable clip, and let Wil Lutz stay busy. The Broncos beat Buffalo 33-30 in a game where Nix threw an interception and completed just 56.5% of his passes. The offense wasn’t dominant, the defense was.

Payton won Super Bowl XLIV with a game-managing Drew Brees performance: 32-of-39 passing, 288 yards, no turnovers. He understands how to win with a formula that doesn’t require the quarterback to be spectacular. The 2015 Broncos won Super Bowl 50 with a defense that suffocated opponents while Peyton Manning threw nine touchdowns and 17 interceptions during the regular season. Denver has the best defense in the league, according to PFSN’s Defense Impact metric.

Stidham’s job description is simple: Don’t lose the game. The defense can win it.

The Broncos re-signed Stidham to a two-year, $12 million deal last March specifically because Payton valued his preparation and system knowledge. This wasn’t a flyer on a cheap backup. Denver invested in continuity, betting that if Nix ever went down, they’d have someone who could step in without a learning curve.

Now, we’ll see if that bet pays off. Either way, the decision was made nine months ago. Signing someone off the street now would be an admission that the original plan failed, and it would almost certainly produce worse results than trusting the player they’ve developed.

“This team all year has lost key players and we’ll rise up for the next challenge,” Payton said Saturday. This isn’t just coach-speak. This is a deep roster with a system designed to function regardless of individual personnel.

The AFC Championship Game will be won or lost on whether Denver’s defense can replicate its performance against Allen, whether the offensive line can keep Stidham clean, and whether Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims Jr., and Evan Engram can create separation. Stidham’s arm talent is adequate. His decision-making has been sound when given opportunities. His ceiling is lower than Nix’s, but his floor isn’t as far down as a random free agent operating from a playsheet of maybe 30 calls.

The Broncos aren’t looking for a savior. They have a backup quarterback, an elite defense, and a coach who has won a Super Bowl. That combination has worked before.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/17221948/top-free-agent-qbs-right-01-18-26-1024x714.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 11:59:26.296007

The 25-year-old sustained the injury on one of the final plays in overtime, head coach Sean Payton told reporters.

With Nix sidelined, Jarrett Stidham will start in the AFC Championship. It marks just the fifth start in Stidham’s career.

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that they're ""really optimistic"" quarterback Sam Darnold is going to play in Saturday’s divisional-round playoff game versus the San Francisco 49ers, despite an oblique injury that came about in practice Thursday.

Darnold is still listed as ""questionable"" for the highly anticipated rematch between NFC West rivals. Backup Drew Lock has taken the reps this week to prepare should he be needed against the 49ers.

Rams guard Kevin Dotson did not have an injury designation after being a full participant in practice on Friday and head coach Sean McVay told reporters that the six-year veteran will start on Sunday night versus the Bears.

Dotson, 29, did not play in the Rams’ final two regular-season games and last weekend’s wild-card playoff matchup with the Panthers due to an ankle injury.

Chicago Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze is listed as “questionable” with a foot injury for Sunday’s divisional-round playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams.

Odunze caught two passes for 44 yards in a comeback, wild-card win over the Green Bay Packers last week.

In 12 regular-season games, he reeled in 44 passes for 661 yards and 6 touchdowns.

Notably, the Bears didn’t list injury designations for fellow WR DJ Moore, DB C.J. Gardner-Johnson and LT Braxton Jones.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold has been added to the injury report with an oblique issue that makes him “questionable” for Saturday’s divisional-round playoff game versus the San Francisco 49ers, but he told reporters Thursday that he still expects to play.

He was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers this weekend at Seattle's Lumen Field.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was listed as a full participant in practice on Thursday despite dealing with multiple injuries this week. The Bills will be looking to advance to their second consecutive AFC title game with a win in Denver on Saturday.

Gonzalez entered concussion protocol on Sunday night as the Patriots defeated the Chargers during wild-card weekend. He was a limited participant in Wednesday night’s practice and now the team gets a positive update with the corner shedding a red non-contact jersey as a full participant on Thursday.

Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins remains in concussion protocol and missed Thursday’s media session, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander.

Collins is unlikely to play in Sunday’s divisional round game against the New England Patriots because of the steps needed to clear concussion protocol.

Collins suffered the concussion in Monday’s wild-card 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards in the game before going down.

If Collins cannot go, expect Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins, and Dalton Schultz to see an increase in targets. Jaylin Noel, Xavier Hutchinson and Cade Stover could also see an increased role.

OUT: S Jordan Poyer (hamstring), CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle)

Questionable: WR Curtis Samuel (elbow), S Damar Hamlin (pec), DT Ed Oliver (biceps)

Samuel and Hamlin are expected to take part fully in practice on Thursday. Oliver, running back Ty Johnson and linebacker Terrel Bernard will be limited.

Today, we find out who they'll be playing, starting in the AFC.

The New England Patriots kick things off with a home game against the Houston Texans. New England got past the Los Angeles Chargers in the wild-card round with a 16-3 win, their first playoff victory since the Tom Brady era.

A day later, Houston pummeled the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-6 despite quarterback C.J. Stroud's three turnovers. The Texans defense stepped up once again to keep them in contention in the AFC.

Houston managed that win despite missing top wide receiver Nico Collins for most of the game. He exited the game early in the second half after landing hard on his head attempting to catch a pass over the middle of the field.

He was subsequently put into the league's concussion protocol. Here's the latest on whether or not he'll play today against the Patriots:

Is Nico Collins playing today?

Collins will not take the field against the Patriots today. Houston ruled him out in their final injury report for the week. He's not the only wideout Houston will have to do without. Justin Watson is also out due to concussion protocol.

With Collins sidelined, Stroud will likely have to lean on veteran Christian Kirk - who had a breakout game against Pittsburgh - as well as rookie Jayden Higgins.

If Houston wins their first divisional playoff game in franchise history, Collins could be available for the AFC championship game. He could clear the concussion protocol in time for that.

What is the NFL's concussion protocol?

The NFL breaks its concussion protocol down into five distinct steps. The process is designed to break up the recovery process from a head injury, ensuring a player's safety.

Here are the five steps of the protocol, according to the NFL:

Symptom-limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football-specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

He was ruled out for the rest of the postseason.

The injury paves the way for backup Jarrett Stidham to get the start in the AFC championship game. Given his status as a backup, and the surprising nature in which he'll make his first playoff start, some NFL fans may be unaware of Stidham's football journey.

Here's everything you need to know about Stidham, including his stats, college and journey to the Broncos.

Where did Jarrett Stidham go to college?

Stidham initially played at Baylor, where he showed promise during his freshman season. After seeing time early in his college career, Stidham eventually took over as Baylor's starter after Seth Russell went down with an injury. Stidham finished his freshman year with 12 touchdowns against two interceptions in 10 games.

Stidham wasn't guaranteed the starting role the next season with Russell back. As a result, Stidham decided to transfer. After spending a semester at a community college, Stidham landed at Auburn. He started for the team as both a junior and senior, and combined to throw for 5,952 yards, 36 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in his two seasons with the team. Auburn went 10-4 and 8-5 in Stidham's two seasons as a starter.

Jarrett Stidham NFL Draft

Following two strong years at Auburn, Stidham heard his name called in the 2019 NFL Draft. The quarterback was selected by the New England Patriots in the fourth round and was the seventh quarterback off the board.

Given Stidham's status as a rookie and the fact that Patriots starter Tom Brady was about to enter his age-42 season, there were some who believed Stidham was drafted to be Brady's replacement once he left the team or retired.

Jarrett Stidham NFL stats

Being Brady's backup meant Stidham didn't see much time as a rookie. He appeared in three games, throwing just four passes in mop-up duty. One of those passes, however, was intercepted and returned for a touchdown.

Brady left the Patriots after the season, but Stidham was not named the team's starter. Instead, the Patriots signed Cam Newton, who started 15 games. Stidham spent portions of the 2020 NFL season as the team's third-string quarterback, behind veteran Brian Hoyer. While Stidham eventually worked his way up the depth chart and appeared in five games, he did not register a start in 2020.

The Patriots selected Mac Jones in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft. Stidham missed time with an injury and did not appear in a game once he returned to action.

That offseason, Stidham was traded to the Las Vegas Raiders, reuniting with former Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who was hired as the Raiders' head coach that offseason. Stidham served as Derek Carr's backup, but was named the starter late in the season. He made his first two NFL starts, throwing four touchdowns against three interceptions in two losses.

Stidham left the Raiders in the offseason to join the Broncos on a two-year, $10 million deal. He served as a backup throughout most of the 2023 NFL season, though he started two games down the stretch after Russell Wilson was benched. Stidham threw two touchdowns and one interception in those games, going 1-1 to close out the season.

Advertisement

The Broncos selected Bo Nix in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, pushing Stidham back into a reserve role. Since 2024, Stidham has appeared in just four games, though has not thrown a single pass.

Over his six-year NFL career, Stidham has appeared in 20 games, including four starts. He's completed 60.6 percent of his passes while throwing for 1,422 yards. Stidham has eight touchdowns against eight interceptions in the NFL.

His four NFL starts are the fewest of any player to start in the AFC championship game.

Stidham's AFC championship start will mark his first of the season. It's the first time since 1972 that a quarterback's first start of the year came in the AFC championship game.

Only six quarterbacks since 1950 have made their first start of the season in the playoffs. Only one of those players, former head coach Frank Reich, came away from his start with a win.

Jarrett Stidham career earnings

Stidham has made roughly $25 million since being drafted in 2019. His rookie deal with the Patriots totaled roughly $3 million over four seasons. Once he hit free agency in 2023, Stidham earned a two-year, $10 million deal from the Broncos.

That contract ran out last offseason, but the team brought Stidham back on another two-year deal. This one was worth $12 million. Stidham made just under $2 million in 2025 and is set to make close to $6 million in 2026.

Broncos QB depth chart

With Stidham set to take over, Sam Ehlinger is expected to serve as the team's backup quarterback behind Stidham. Ehlinger was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in the sixth round of the 2021 NFL Draft. He spent three years with the team before joining the Broncos on a one-year deal in 2025.

With that in mind, let's take a look at several wild options (Players are listed based on when they threw their last NFL pass).
Ryan Tannehill Age: 37 Last NFL pass: 2023 season As crazy as it sounds, this might actually be Denver's most intriguing option.
Remember, this is just a one week commitment, and if you happen to win the AFC title game, then it turns into a three-week commitment.
Back in 2012, his Falcons blew a 17-0 lead to the 49ers in the NFC title game.","The Denver Broncos are headed to the AFC Championship game for the first time in 10 years after beating the Bills on Saturday, but right now, they aren't exactly celebrating and that's because they don't really have a quarterback. Following Denver's 33-30 victory over the Bills on Saturday, Sean Payton announced that Bo Nix would be out for the rest of the season after fracturing a bone in his ankle.

With Nix out, the Broncos will be turning the starting QB job over to Jarrett Stidham, but Payton can't be feeling very comfortable about that, especially when you consider that Stidham hasn't thrown a regular-season pass in two years! If you're scoring at home, Stidham's last NFL pass came on Jan. 7, 2024, which means he'll have gone 749 days without throwing an NFL pass by the time the AFC title game rolls around. Sam Ehlinger is the only other quarterback on the Broncos' roster, so as things currently stand now, he would be Stidham's backup. Ehlinger, a sixth-round pick out of Texas in 2021, is 0-3 in three career starts; Stidham is 1-3 in four career starts.

The Broncos are in a desperate situation and desperate teams do desperate things. Earlier this year, we saw the Colts sign 44-year-old Philip Rivers in hopes of saving their season after Daniel Jones went down with an injury. The Broncos could go a similar route and it would actually make some sense for them to do that. Unlike the Colts' situation, the Broncos don't need a QB who can play half the season, they just need a guy who's willing to make a three-week commitment -- at the most.

The new QB would only have to practice one week and play in one game (the AFC title game) and if Denver somehow won that, then the QB would have two more weeks of practice and one more game (Super Bowl LX). If you really think about it, it's an enticing offer that would potentially give a retired quarterback a serious shot at a Lombardi Trophy.

With that in mind, let's take a look at several wild options (Players are listed based on when they threw their last NFL pass).

Ryan Tannehill

Age: 37

Last NFL pass: 2023 season

As crazy as it sounds, this might actually be Denver's most intriguing option. Tannehill hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since Week 18 of the 2023 season, which sounds like a long time ago, but his last pass actually came on the same day that Stidham threw his last regular-season pass. The best part for the Broncos is that Tannehill does have some playoff experience: He led the Titans to the AFC title game in 2019 and then one year later, he helped lead Tennessee to the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC.

Tannehill was coached in Tennessee by Mike Vrabel, who might end up being Denver's opponent this year if his Patriots can beat the Texans on Sunday. Tannehill also has some mobility, which is something Payton would probably prefer to have.

Back in November, Tannehill said he probably wouldn't be returning to the NFL, but it's certainly possible that he would change his mind if the Broncos called.

""I think that chapter is closed,"" Tannehill said when asked if his career was over, via The Escapist. ""I think last year, that was where I was at, if the right opportunity came up and was right for our family. Staying in shape and staying ready. I had plenty of calls, but nothing ever felt like the right opportunity that I was looking for. That was last NFL season. At this point, I think that ship has sailed for me.""

Matt Ryan

Age: 40

Last NFL pass: 2022 season

Ryan just got a new job last week as the Falcons' new president of football, so it's unlikely that he would want to step away so soon, but this would give him a chance to finally win that elusive Lombardi Trophy, which might be enough to woo him away for a week or two. Remember, this is just a one week commitment, and if you happen to win the AFC title game, then it turns into a three-week commitment.

Ryan has been part of some of the most painful postseason losses in NFL history. Back in 2012, his Falcons blew a 17-0 lead to the 49ers in the NFC title game. In 2016, he finally got to the Super Bowl only to watch his team blow a 28-3 lead to the Patriots. The Broncos could end up facing the Patriots in the AFC title game, and if that happens, maybe Payton is able to sell Ryan on a possible return to get some revenge.

During his introductory press conference at his new job, Ryan actually joked about making a possible comeback.

""I'm not trying to call plays. I'm not trying to run your offense. I'm not trying to pull a Philip Rivers and come back and play,"" Ryan said.

But what if there's a chance to win a Super Bowl?

Cam Newton

Age: 36

Last NFL pass: 2021 season

Newton hasn't played since 2021, but he's still only 36 years old and the interesting part is that he hasn't officially retired. After the Colts signed Rivers in December, Newton was asked on his podcast if he'd ever be willing to return to the NFL after four years out of the league.

""I'm open for business, but I want to be [with] who really want me,"" Newton said.

Basically, Newton will be more than happy to answer the phone if Payton calls. Newton, who was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, spent 10 of his 11 seasons with the Carolina Panthers. Newton also started 16 games against Payton's Saints, so the Broncos coach is certainly familiar with his work.

Newton was voted MVP in 2015, a season where he ended up leading the 15-1 Panthers to the Super Bowl. And in a crazy twist, the Panthers played the Broncos in the Super Bowl that year in a game that was played at Levi's Stadium. Newton could potentially return with the Broncos to play a Super Bowl in the same stadium 10 years later.

Drew Brees

Age: 47

Last NFL pass: 2020 season

if there's one name that Payton might toss around this week, it's Brees. The Broncos head coach spent 15 seasons in New Orleans with Brees as his quarterback, a time span that included three conference title game appearances and a Super Bowl win in 2009.

The only problem with calling Brees is that, apparently, his right arm isn't working anymore.

""Honestly, man, if my right arm was still working, I probably would've played another three years,"" Brees said back in May 2024. ""My body feels great. My body can play. My right arm can't. Unfortunately that's what kind of forced me to step away. And it was time too.""

Brees' right arm definitely couldn't handle the rigors of an entire NFL season, but could it work for three weeks or even just one game? At age 47, Brees might not be interested, but it might be worth it for Payton to make a call just to check in on his former quarterback.

Andrew Luck

Age: 36

Last NFL pass: 2018

The former Colts quarterback shocked the NFL when he decided to retire back in August 2019, and right now, he doesn't seem too interested in a comeback. Before signing Rivers in December, the Colts didn't call Luck, but if they would have, he knew what his answer was going to be.

""No, thank you. I'm right where I'm supposed to be,"" Luck told Jim Rome in December.

Luck is currently the general manager of Stanford football, and although he might not be interested in returning, Sean Payton could do his best to convince him that this is essentially a one-game deal. When you've been retired for nearly eight years, you likely don't want to take the beating that comes with playing an NFL season (or even a half season), but this is just one game, and possibly two, if the Broncos were to win the AFC title game.

Also, let's not forget, the most famous QB in Broncos' history (John Elway) went to Stanford. The current CEO and co-owner of the Broncos (Greg Penner) also has a Stanford degree. Those two could call up Luck and try to make him an offer that he couldn't refuse, you know, like maybe writing a huge check to the Stanford athletic department.

Colin Kaepernick

Age: 38

Last NFL pass: 2016

The only reason Kaepernick is on this list is because he's the one of the rare older guys who actually wants to return. As recently as August 2024, Kaepernick said he was staying in shape in hopes of getting a call from an NFL team.

""We're still training, we're still pushing, we just gotta get one of these team owners to open up,"" Kaepernick told SkyNews at the time. ""I could bring a lot to a team and help them win a championship.""

One thing Kaepernick would bring to the table is big game experience. During his six-year career with the 49ers, he led them to two NFC title games and one Super Bowl. Kaepernick currently holds the NFL record for most rushing yards by a QB in a playoff game with 181. At 38, he's likely lost a step or two, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

Free agent quarterbacks: Taylor Heinicke, Jake Fromm, C.J. Beathard.

Sam Darnold, who struggled with an oblique injury in the lead-up to the game, threw for 127 yards, no interceptions and a touchdown to help the Seahawks claim a resounding 41-6 victory.

While Darnold's presence was a major boost, it was star running back Kenneth Walker III who stole the show on the night for Seattle after registering 19 carries for 116 rushing yards and three touchdowns.

Walker also had three catches for 29 yards on the night, while wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was on hand with as many receptions for 19 yards and a touchdown.

The win means Seattle will take on the winner of Sunday's other NFC Divisional clash between the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears for a place in the Super Bowl next weekend.

The Seahawks led 7-0 just 13 seconds into Saturday's game thanks to Rashid Shaheed, who returned the opening kickoff for a 95-yard touchdown. It was the fourth kickoff return for a touchdown to open a playoff game since 2000 and the longest postseason kick return in franchise history.

After being listed as questionable for the game, Darnold guided the Seahawks on two more scoring drives before San Francisco got on the board with the first of its two field goals.

The 49ers (13-6) were never competitive in the second-most lopsided playoff loss in franchise history. San Francisco lost 49-3 to the New York Giants in the divisional round in the 1986 season.

They were missing three injured All-Pros on the night: tight end George Kittle, linebacker Fred Warner and defensive end Nick Bosa. Christian McCaffrey was also injured in the second quarter and briefly returned in the third before exiting for good.

Brock Purdy completed 15 of 27 passes for 140 yards with an interception and a lost fumble against the Seahawks' 'Dark Side' defense. Seattle also recovered a fumble by tight end Jake Tonges.

""… He was consistent, he was the same Sam that he's always been, leading the huddle, being a steady leading force for us. And he made some unbelievable throws—the one rolling out to the left that he threw to Jax in the end zone, those are unbelievable throws that he was making today.""

""I figured he was going to find a way to get out there,"" Kupp said. ""You don't know without him throwing or anything, but he was out there at the walkthrough on (Friday), he was told not to throw, and he was out there pump-faking, and everyone's like, 'Dude, just stop. Please don't do anything stupid.' So I figured with him pump-faking as much as he was, he had to be feeling OK.""

""Obviously I didn't go out for the non-padded warm-up,"" he said. ""I think that kind of stirred some questions, which was funny. I got to throw in here, and did the same thing, did my routine in here. Once I put the pads on and got that padded warm-up, I wanted to be rolling. I didn't want to waste any time getting warm on the field and coming in, having 40 minutes to get warm again and then go back out. I just wanted to get warm once and then go back out there in the pads. So that was why I did it that way.""

""It's huge,"" he said. ""I don't take it for granted whatsoever. It's just a special group. I think that's the biggest thing, and that's why it means so much. Just the way those guys are in the locker room, ever since I got here. They were tight before I got here, obviously, but just the way that they took me in as one of their own. And that's what's so special about this league in general. You make so many great relationships throughout this whole process. And that locker room and these coaches, you know, just the way that we play together. That's the reason why I play this game, and they've made it really easy for me to come in here ever since I did in April to be able to help lead this team and drive the ball down the field, score touchdowns, all those things.""

While Darnold came up with some big throws, including the aforementioned throws to Kupp and Smith-Njigba in the first quarter, as well as a 16-yarder to Jake Bobo on third-and-10 to extend another drive that ended with a touchdown, he did not have to throw the ball a ton thanks to a dominant defensive effort and another big rushing performance. But when Darnold did throw, he was efficient, completing 12 of 17 attempts for 124 yards and a touchdown, giving him a 110.9 passer rating, and for the second game in a row, the Seahawks did not commit a turnover.

""Tremendous, tremendous,"" Macdonald said of Darnold's performance. ""Couple of plays early that I think to get in the swing of things. But I say 'manage' the game as a very high-powered compliment. Just throwing it on time, taking care of the ball, making the plays when we need to. I think there's going to be some explosives out there that maybe we could get to. But, shoot, I thought there's a lot of operation stuff that he did that really helped us as well.""

And even if there was some initial concern outside of the organization on Thursday when Darnold popped up on the injury report, then again on Saturday when Darnold wasn't out for pregame warmups, his teammates had no doubt not only that they'd have their quarterback, but that he would come through with a winning performance.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/uvryoflvyxekxeziwccj,N,,2026-01-18 11:02:48.535038

Could young quarterback Bo Nix deliver in a big game when his team needed him most?

Nix did, and the Broncos are on their way to the AFC Championship Game after knocking off the Bills 33-30 in overtime.

After a strong start to the game saw the young quarterback throw a pair of first-half touchdowns to take a 20-10 lead to the locker room, Nix and the Broncos were trailing by four, 27-23, late in the fourth quarter. This was the moment the NFL world had wondered about for weeks as the playoffs approached. Could the young passer step up? Could Nix silence the doubters at a moment like this, and prove he was the QB Denver needed him to be?

He delivered.

The drive began with Nix throwing a dime along the right sideline, after avoiding pressure from Joey Bosa, climbing the pocket, and connecting with Courtland Sutton along the right sideline:

As noted, it was Sutton’s first catch of the game.

Shortly thereafter, he made his second. After two plays moved the Broncos backward, Denver faced 3rd and 11 on their own 39-yard line with 3:19 left in the game. This was a pivotal moment in the contest, and for Nix.

That is when the QB ripped an absolute rocket on this dig route to Sutton:

Following an injury timeout for center Alex Forsyth, Nix and Sean Payton let the clock run down to the two-minute warning, setting Denver up for a 1st and 10 at the Buffalo 38-yard line.

A few snaps later Denver faced another third down, and once more Nix moved the chains.

Only this time, he did it with his legs:

Denver stopped the clock with just 61 seconds remaining after the run, setting the Broncos up with a 1st-and-10 situation at the Buffalo 26-yard line.

That’s when Nix dropped in a dime to Marvin Mims Jr. to give Denver the lead, with a beautiful throw:

Mims stayed down on the ground for a long time, as he slid into a camera after making the over-the-shoulder catch. It was also a brilliant call from Payton, who dialed up a double-move route for Mims working against backup cornerback Dane Jackson, who had just come into the game for that play due to an injury.

Nix was 6-of-7 on the drive, including two critical third-down conversions, just when Denver needed him most.

Josh Allen had some magic up his sleeves of course, as the Bills forced overtime with a field goal in the closing seconds of regulation. But in overtime, the Broncos punched their ticket to the AFC Championship Game.

The big play in OT was the controversial interception by Broncos defender Ja’Quan McMillan, which ended Buffalo’s first possession — after the Bills had forced a Denver punt — and gave the Broncos another chance. Nix connected with R.J. Harvey on this short throw to get the Broncos offense moving:

Then came a string of penalties on Buffalo, including at least one rather questionable pass interference penalty, that put the Broncos into position for the game-winning field goal. But that field goal would not have been possible without what Nix did on Denver’s final drive of regulation.

Of course, there is a painful subplot to this story, literally and figuratively.

Nix’s season ended tonight as the young quarterback suffered a fracture in his right ankle on Denver’s final drive in overtime. The Broncos are moving on, but they will take the field in the AFC Championship Game with Jarrett Stidham at the helm, and not Nix.

But what Nix did tonight before that injury was exactly what Broncos fans, and the rest of the NFL world were waiting to see. Which is Nix living up to the moment, when his team needed him most.

Nix broke his right ankle late in overtime of the Broncos's divisional-round victory over Buffalo and will have surgery that will sideline him for the rest of the play-offs.

Coach Sean Payton delivered the stunning news about his second-year quarterback in the aftermath of Denver's biggest win in a decade.

Backup Jarrett Stidham, who's 1-3 as a starter in six seasons, will start the AFC championship game against either Houston or New England next weekend.

""Stiddy's ready,"" Payton said after returning to the post-game lectern to discuss the injury following Denver's 33-30 victory over Josh Allen and the Bills.

Payton said Nix got hurt on a keeper where he lost 2 yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was limping after the play, but there was no indication that he suffered such a serious injury.

On the next play, Nix threw a deep pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that drew a 30-yard pass-interference flag and got the Broncos well into field-goal range. Nix then took a knee to centre the ball for Wil Lutz's game-ending 23-yard field goal.

The defeat was a heartbreaker for Buffalo, whose post-season woes continue.

Despite boasting reigning MVP Josh Allen, the Bills have yet to make a Super Bowl since 1994.

Allen, who threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns but also had four turnovers via two interceptions and two fumbles, was in tears after the match.

""It's extremely difficult,"" Allen said.

""I feel like I let my teammates down tonight. There were missed opportunities throughout the game. I hate how it ended. It's going to stick with me for a long time.""

Denver qualified as the top seed in the AFC and would have been warmly favoured to progress past next week if Nix were fit.

The Patriots and Texans, who play on Monday morning AEST, now have a real shot at a saloon passage to Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara.

Meanwhile, title favourites Seattle put an end to San Francisco's season with a comprehensive 41-6 drubbing.

Quarterback Sam Darnold carried a side injury into the match but the Seahawks did not skip a beat, scoring from the opening kick-off through Rashin Shaheed and dominating the injury-hit 49ers from pillar to post.

Running back Kenneth Walker finished with three touchdowns and 116 yards as Mike Macdonald's side dominated.

But he had three regular-season starts to get prepared for the playoffs after Carson Wentz went down.

Jeff Hostetler got two regular-season starts for the 1990 New York Giants after Phil Simms suffered a season-ending injury, and that got him ready to lead the Giants to a Super Bowl XXV win.

Kurt Warner took over for Trent Green and led the 1999 Rams to a title, but he was the starter all season.

What the Denver Broncos are about to embark upon is tough to draw a reasonable comparison to. Long after the Broncos’ fantastic 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC’s divisional round, Broncos head coach Sean Payton returned to the media room, which is highly unusual. He announced that on the second-to-last play of the game, his quarterback Bo Nix suffered a broken bone in his right ankle and is done for the rest of the season.

“They’ll be disappointed,” Payton said. “There will be a lot of emotions. Then the refocus takes place.”

Once the shock wore off, the question became: What does this mean for the Broncos as they get ready for the AFC championship game?

How does Bo Nix’s injury affect Broncos?

For starters, the injury shifted Super Bowl odds as the Broncos went from +325 to +900, according to BetMGM.

The Broncos don’t have time to worry about that. They have an AFC title game eight days after Nix’s injury. They’ll face either the Houston Texans or New England Patriots, and do so with Jarrett Stidham starting at quarterback. Stidham has some familiarity with the Patriots, having spent his first two seasons in 2019 and 2020 with them.

Stidham has not thrown a pass in either of the last two seasons. He has four starts in his NFL career, two with the Raiders in 2022 and two more with the Broncos in 2023. His teams went 1-3 in those games.

Payton has been high on Stidham, who is on his second contract with the Broncos. His first, signed in 2023, was for $10 million. The one he signed before this season was for $12 million. That’s good money for a backup, even though the Broncos haven’t had to use him.

Like Dick Vermeil, the Rams head coach who promised in 1999 after Green’s injury that “We will rally around Kurt Warner, and we will play good football,” Payton was confident and even a bit defiant about having to turn to Stidham.

“He’s ready,” Payton said. “I said this before the season, I feel like I’ve got a two that is capable of starting for a number of teams. Watch out. Just watch.”

The numbers don’t look that great. In 197 career NFL passes, Stidham has 1,422 yards, 8 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. That’s a passer rating of 78.3, which would get most NFL starters benched. But it’s not like the Broncos have much choice.

The good news is they revolve around a very good defense that finished third in the NFL in points allowed and second in yards allowed during the regular season. The Broncos will have to run it effectively on offense, and they were a middle-of-the-road running team during the season (16th in yards, 15th in yards per attempt).

And they’ll need Stidham to do his job when called upon. Stidham isn’t the runner that Nix is (just 101 yards on 37 attempts), so Payton will have to change the way he calls an offense. He, and Stidham, have a week to prepare for that.

“He’s experienced,” Payton said. “He has played in games. They’re different type players to some degree, and yet, they’re very close friends, as with Sam [Ehlinger, the Broncos’ quarterback behind Stidham]. It’s a tight room. Sam will be our two, and here we go.”

Stidham’s first NFL pass since Jan. 7, 2024 will come in a game with a Super Bowl trip on the line. The Broncos have a challenge ahead.

Big edge for Broncos’ AFC opponent

The Nix injury changes the landscape of the rest of the playoffs. Whoever wins between the Texans and Patriots will be expected to win again against a team with a seldom-used backup quarterback.

It’s never that easy in the NFL. Payton has confidence in Stidham for a reason. The Broncos aren’t reliant on their quarterback to win games, either. The Texans or Patriots will still be facing one of the NFL’s best defenses in Denver, which is tough to play at due to the high altitude. But it’s clearly an edge for the winner of Sunday’s Texans-Patriots game. And, if the Broncos advance to Super Bowl LX despite not having Nix, it will be an edge for the NFC champion there, whether it be the Seattle Seahawks, Los Angeles Rams or Chicago Bears.

One of the four teams that will be playing next weekend just lost its starting quarterback suddenly. That has an obvious effect on everyone else still vying for a title.

There is also a question about Nix for next season, though he has rebounded from a broken ankle before. Payton said that Nix had the injury in high school, and he broke his ankle during the 2021 season as well when he was at Auburn.

“I said, ‘I didn’t realize that. If I would have known that I wouldn’t have drafted you,’” Payton said, making a joke in a discouraging moment for the Broncos. “He’s a tough cookie.”

Nix returned in 2022 at Oregon after the ankle injury and threw for 3,593 yards and 25 touchdowns.

Teams deal with injuries all the time. Rarely is it a season-ending injury to a quarterback right before a conference championship game. The Broncos will be ready. And if they can overcome Nix’s injury, it will be quite a story.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RK5I0qojVgekjSbE_T81qQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04Mjk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/72dcc98b-6a5b-408c-88cd-fb957ddabb6d,N,,2026-01-18 06:58:47.871087

After a chaotic Wild Card Weekend, the divisional round has carried the baton and continued the madness as we inch closer to Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, California.

Right out of the gate, we were treated to an instant classic between the Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills, which needed overtime to determine a winner. While Denver was able to outlast Buffalo and send Josh Allen packing, the victory came at a tremendous cost as quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury during overtime. In the later game on Saturday, the Seahawks defense flexed its defensive dominance, keeping the 49ers out of the end zone in a 41-6 thumping.

There's never a dull moment in the NFL, and the storylines are continuing to pour out of these playoff showdowns. But what are we to make of them all? Below, we'll navigate the noise and determine which takeaways from Saturday's matchups are reality and which are mere overreactions.

Broncos' Super Bowl hopes are done after Bo Nix's injury

Overreaction or reality: Reality

After the high of seeing Will Lutz's game-winning field goal secure Denver's place in the AFC Championship, the Broncos hit the lowest of lows in the moments after the overtime victory. Sean Payton announced that Bo Nix suffered a broken bone in his ankle that will require surgery and end his season. The Broncos say that Nix suffered the injury on the second-to-last play of overtime.

Payton told reporters postgame that Jarrett Stidham will get the start in the AFC Championship next week, which will be held in Denver at Mile High. While the Broncos will have home-field advantage and boast one of the best defenses in the NFL, this injury effectively ends any dreams of hoisting a Lombardi Trophy.

Stidham has been with the Broncos since 2023, so he's familiar with Payton's offense, but being thrust into a conference championship is too tall a task. The 29-year-old played one snap this season, taking a knee in October. He hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since 2023. No matter if it's the Houston Texans or New England Patriots who advance to meet them in the AFC Championship, it's hard to imagine a scenario where Stidham helps orchestrate a victory outside of the defense pitching a shutout.

Josh Allen fumbles best chance at winning Super Bowl

Overreaction or reality: Reality

Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills have squandered what will likely be their best opportunity to make and win a Super Bowl. It goes beyond just losing to the Denver Broncos in the divisional round. Buffalo entered the 2025 season as the biggest favorite to win its division, but let go of the rope and saw the Patriots leapfrog them. That forced Allen and Co. to enter the postseason as a wild-card entry and go on the road, creating an even more difficult path.

Of course, this was also a postseason that did not include Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, or Lamar Jackson, three quarterbacks who have been major roadblocks to the Bills in years past. It's hard to imagine that trio not being in the playoffs over the next few years, adding even more hurdles to what is an increasingly competitive conference.

It's fair to wonder if the window has closed for Buffalo before they could even break through.

Josh Allen is solely responsible for the loss to Denver

Overreaction or reality: Overreaction

Don't get us wrong, Josh Allen is a main culprit as to why Buffalo's season is over. The defending NFL MVP didn't look the part in the loss to Denver, committing four turnovers (two fumbles and two interceptions). His back-to-back fumbles sandwiched in between halftime were egregious, and he seemed to force the ball down the field on his two interceptions, including the pick in overtime that helped set up Denver's game-winning drive.

However, the loss doesn't fall entirely on Allen's shoulders. There's a big-picture problem in Buffalo, as the organization failed to surround its franchise cornerstone with the talent to get over the edge. Allen's two interceptions were on passes to wideouts Brandin Cooks and Curtis Samuel. Cooks arrived as a free-agent signing in late November, while Samuel was activated off of IR just before this contest. That shows just how thin the Bills were at receiver, and it's worth pointing out that lack of firepower in a shootout loss like this.

Throughout the season, it felt like Buffalo was leaning too much on Allen to simply throw on the Superman cape and will them to victory, rather than giving him the tools (weapons) to put them in the best position to succeed. It made him press in this game and burned a golden opportunity at a championship.

Sean McDermott is on the hot seat

Overreaction or reality: Reality

It's a little late in the head coach hiring process with John Harbaugh (Giants) and Kevin Stefanski (Falcons) already being hired, so Sean McDermott's job could be safe for 2026. However, the Bills head coach is likely going to be sitting on one of the hottest seats in the NFL next season, and if Buffalo doesn't meet expectations again, changes could be on the horizon.

McDermott has the second-most wins (98) by a head coach to never make a Super Bowl appearance since 2000. He also has the most playoff wins (8) without a Super Bowl appearance by a head coach all-time.

While this is certainly productive to constantly being in the hunt, it's not maximizing what Buffalo has in Josh Allen during his prime years, which could make the Bills brass consider a change.

Seahawks don't need Sam Darnold to win

Overreaction or reality: Overreaction

The major story coming into this divisional round matchup was the status of Sam Darnold, who suffered an oblique injury during the week, which left him questionable. Darnold ultimately suited up and started, but he dropped back to pass just 17 times in the blowout win over San Francisco. While Darnold was efficient with those opportunities (12 completions for 124 yards and a touchdown), Seattle didn't ask him to do too much. The defense did most of the heavy lifting, suffocating the Niners to the tune of just six points scored. Meanwhile, Kenneth Walker III carried the load offensively with 19 carries for 116 yards and three touchdowns, while adding three catches for 29 yards receiving.

Frankly, the Seahawks didn't need Darnold for this game to win. However, that doesn't mean they won't need him in the NFC Championship or, potentially, Super Bowl LX. As good as this defense has played for Seattle, they're going to call on Darnold to make plays at some point over these next few weeks, so getting him to full health will be imperative.

The Bills and Broncos went to overtime, but the Broncos emerged on top after hitting a 23-yard field goal to win it in the extra frame. However, it came at a cost; Bo Nix went down with an ankle injury. The second game was more one-sided, as the Seahawks blew out the 49ers on Saturday night. Two more games are on deck, with Texans-Patriots and Rams-Bears on Sunday.

Seahawks 41, 49ers 6

'The Seahawks had the best offseason of any team.' Overreaction?

No, not an overreaction. The Seahawks went into the 2025 offseason intent on and expecting to sign Geno Smith to a contract extension. When it became apparent to them that Smith wasn't interested in extending his deal at their numbers, they traded him to the Raiders and signed Sam Darnold. Say what you will about Darnold, but the 2025 Seahawks went 14-3 -- same record as Darnold's 2024 Vikings -- and now he has a home game Jan. 25 in the NFC Championship Game.

Seahawks GM John Schneider went about his offseason the same way he would have had he landed his first choice at quarterback. He signed DeMarcus Lawrence. He signed Cooper Kupp because he's a better blocker at this point than Tyler Lockett. He drafted Nick Emmanwori in the second round. Schneider freaking loves the second round. Even as someone who likes to see players get as much money as they can and wishes the top QBs would push harder to move the market upward for others, I still have to appreciate a philosophy like Seattle's approach: ""Do we have to pay our quarterback $50-plus million per year if he still hasn't shown he's that guy?""

A Seahawks employee told me after the team's wild Week 16 victory over the Rams, ""We're trying to win championships here,"" and the Seahawks obviously are living that. Seattle has lost three games all season, and the margins were four, three and two points. Two of those losses were to division rivals, one of which they eliminated Saturday. Is Darnold the second coming of Joe Montana? No. Of John Elway? No. Of Patrick Mahomes? No. But the Seahawks decided, at some point, that they intend to be the example of how to win a championship without paying great quarterback money to a pretty good quarterback because there's a championship-caliber roster around him.

Kudos to the Seahawks for treating the QB portion of their offseason the way they would have treated any other portion of it. They didn't get the player they wanted, but they knew they could still win with this quarterback because of everything else they do well. Hiring Mike Macdonald as head coach was a last offseason move, not a this offseason move, but it was still one that impacted their approach to this offseason. And here they still are. -- Graziano

The lingering question: Will the 49ers be NFC favorites with a healthy team next season?

It's too early to say, of course. But spin it forward for me. The Seahawks will likely be the favorite, barring some catastrophic injury between now and then. The Rams could be up there, as well, especially if they finish the NFC playoffs strong ... but Matthew Stafford's career longevity is always going to be a question that hurts them in the futures markets. Meanwhile, the 49ers still have most of their main players under contract.

Trent Williams' contract is expiring, and the offensive line clearly needs help across the board. Wide receiver is a little thin with the Brandon Aiyuk situation unclear and Jauan Jennings approaching free agency. But that young defense, which was hammered by injuries this season, will return Nick Bosa and Fred Warner. And Yetur Gross-Matos and Jordan Elliott are the only two expiring contracts there. This group will benefit from postseason experience next season and will presumably add to the pass rush.

Of course, the 49ers will see if they get through the offseason without losing defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, who was key to their surprising success despite all the injuries. Saleh has interviewed with the Titans and Ravens already and is a deservedly hot name on the head coaching circuit. If he gets a job, San Francisco will be forced back on the defensive coordinator carousel.

It's also worth noting that the 49ers, who had a very easy schedule entering this season, will play a third-place schedule next season despite their postseason appearance. With only a few moves in offseason housekeeping and a regression to the mean in injury luck, the Niners should be considered a deep NFC playoff team once again. -- Solak

Broncos 33, Bills 30

'The Broncos are done without Bo Nix.' Overreaction?

No, not an overreaction. The Broncos barely won Saturday's game. Buffalo had to turn the ball over five times -- including once in overtime -- or else Nix might not have broken his ankle in the first place. And certainly, without Nix's clutch play in the fourth quarter and overtime, Denver wouldn't have won and advanced to a home AFC Championship Game.

But now? You want me to believe the Broncos are going to beat Houston or New England with Jarrett Stidham at quarterback? And even if they do, does anyone believe they can then win the Super Bowl? I'm sorry, Jarrett, but it just doesn't feel to me like this Broncos team is good enough to pull a 2017 Eagles and win this thing without their starting quarterback.

The Broncos have a good defense, yes. We know this about them. But they weren't super awesome Saturday against a Bills team that moved the ball extremely well between turnovers, and they haven't been elite in the way that defenses such as Seattle and Houston have been -- at least not over the second half of this season. The Broncos do run the ball better than most think, but c'mon. We all watched this game. The Bills handed the Broncos 10 points at the tail end of the first half, then three more at the start of the second, and Buffalo still had a fourth-quarter lead that Nix found a way to overcome. Nix isn't a perfect player, but what he can do with his legs and what he can do in the clutch are separating factors that Stidham just doesn't offer.

The Broncos defense is going to have to play the game of a lifetime next week -- even if it's against Houston's inconsistent offense -- if it wants to lug this team into the Super Bowl. And even if it collects a bunch of turnovers and sneaks into the big game, Denver is then going to have to beat a team that has had two weeks off and likely still has its starting quarterback.

It's a shame. It would have been fun to see what Sean Payton and this Broncos team could have done. Payton could have been the first coach to win the Super Bowl with two different teams. But in the wake of the Nix injury news, all of that is a lot harder to imagine. -- Graziano

The lingering question: Why do the Bills keep losing in the postseason?

I have no idea. What is there to say? The Bills turned the football over five times, and no team that turns the ball over five times deserves to be in the game at all. Josh Allen's end-of-half fumble to let the Broncos go up 20-10 was an inexcusable mistake. He was stripped to start the second half to give Denver an even bigger lead. He threw a pick immediately off a key defensive takeaway.

It felt like Allen was digging the hole, and then as always, Allen was the one to pull the Bills back out. But there were too many misses. Allen failed to connect with Khalil Shakir on a third-and-8 screen in the red zone that could have allowed him to score, and he missed an open Dawson Knox at the end of regulation on a throw that could have walked the game off. Allen was simultaneously one of the biggest reasons the Bills were still in that game, while also being one of the biggest reasons they fell short.

The Bills have now made it to seven consecutive postseasons with Allen at the helm, which means they've suffered seven postseason losses. There's really no unifying factor on the field, though. Wide receiver talent was a big deal in this game; Allen was 0-for-9 throwing 20-plus yards downfield, and downfield production is often a receiver stat. The pass rush has been an issue and was again in this game; Nix was pressured on 20% of his dropbacks, and the Bills needed to send blitzes to get home. Defensive back depth was also a big deal; two of Nix's three touchdowns came targeting backup defensive backs.

Still, when you've lost seven playoff games, there are some obvious unifying factors -- coach Sean McDermott, GM Brandon Beane and Allen. The Bills' triumvirate has been in place for the better part of a decade and has yet to get over the hump. Whether fair or unfair, the buck stops at the top, and the fact that the Bills have failed to make a Super Bowl in Allen's tenure despite seven postseason appearances is an enormous failure.

If the Bills make changes, I'd totally get it. If they don't, I'd totally get it, too. They've been so close so many times. What a devastating loss. -- Solak",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0118%2Fr1602071_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 06:59:33.526086

""Not good news, on the second-to-last play in overtime, Bo fractured a bone in his right ankle. He's schedule to have surgery Tuesday of this week, which will put him out the rest of the season,"" Payton said.

If the second-to-last play of the game is truly what Payton was referencing, then it would be the play in which the Broncos simply took a knee prior to kicking the game-winning field goal. The play right before that, Nix threw an incompletion that resulted in a 30-yard pass interference call on Buffalo, which set up the Broncos in field-goal range.

The play before that, Nix ran a keeper where he lost two yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was seen limping slightly after the play.

Nix was 26-of-46 for 279 yards and three touchdowns while also rushing for 29 yards on 12 carries in the win.

""He’s such a strong, faith-based guy,"" Payton said. ""He’s sitting in the hallway with his family and coming over and we’re all talking to him. He knows that God’s got a plan for him and he said he had (a broken ankle) in high school and then he said he had one at Auburn.

""And I said I didn’t realize that. I said if I had known that I wouldn’t have drafted you.""

Nix, the 12th overall pick out of Oregon in the 2024 NFL draft, tied Russell Wilson’s NFL record with two dozen victories in his first two seasons. Saturday’s victory was his first in the playoffs. The Broncos lost last year at Buffalo, but Nix led Denver to the AFC’s top seed this season.

""He’s a tough cookie,"" Payton said. ""And this team all year has lost key players and will rise up for the next challenge.""

Payton said Broncos backup Jarrett Stidham will start at quarterback for Denver in the AFC Championship game next week at Mile High Stadium against the winner of Sunday's Patriots-Texans divisional matchup.

The Broncos did what they had to do to earn a 33-30 overtime win over Buffalo on Saturday.","1) Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold: There was only one demon left for Darnold to conquer this year and that involved his playoff reputation. Everybody who watched him in last year's Wild Card Round saw a jittery quarterback who melted down in a blowout loss to the Rams. That wasn't the guy who walked into Lumen Field for a Divisional Round matchup with San Francisco on Saturday night. Darnold had the comfort of knowing he was playing at home with a loaded roster that had earned the top seed in the NFC. All he had to do was be himself and not let an oblique injury that popped up late in the week bother him. Darnold did his part by completing 12 of 17 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown in a 41-6 win. He let his teammates handle the rest, which they gladly did. This always felt like a game that Seattle could run away with because of all the injuries that had plagued the 49ers over the season. That's exactly what it became, which was great for Darnold. He already had made the transition from gunslinger to game manager midway through the season. Saturday's game only reiterated how important it is for him to avoid turnovers along with the feeling of having to go win the game for the Seahawks. There clearly will be a tougher challenge facing this team next week, regardless of whether it's the Bears or Rams that come to Seattle for the NFC championship. One thing that should also be obvious is that Darnold learned some valuable lessons from last year's late-season struggles.

2) Broncos head coach Sean Payton: Let's be clear here -- Payton couldn't afford to go one-and-done after the regular season the Broncos enjoyed. This team broke the Kansas City Chiefs' nine-year run as AFC West champions. It captured the top seed in the AFC postseason bracket and displayed impressive resolve in going 11-2 in one-score games. All that was supposed to be part of the magic Payton was tasked with delivering when the Broncos hired him in 2023. Losing in the Divisional Round after such a successful year would've been an epic failure, especially in a postseason as wide open as this. The Broncos did what they had to do to earn a 33-30 overtime win over Buffalo on Saturday. Payton had a smart game plan for quarterback Bo Nix to execute, and the Denver defense made several momentum-altering plays to stifle Bills quarterback Josh Allen and the Buffalo offense. Payton made it clear that he wanted to be aggressive in this contest, and you saw Nix throw deep shots time and again when Buffalo used man coverage. Payton also had to compensate for a run game that only created 70 total yards and a receiving corps plagued by injuries early in the contest. Of course, the job now becomes far more challenging for the head coach as his team moves into the AFC championship game. Nix sustained a broken ankle on the last drive in overtime, an injury that ended his season. If the Broncos are going to win the Super Bowl this season, it will be with Jarrett Stidham under center. It's obviously a huge blow but backup quarterbacks have won championships in emergency duty before. It just means Payton will have to do more amazing things than he's already done with this team.

3) Seahawks wide receiver Rashid Shaheed: The acquisition of Shaheed has turned into one of the best midseason trades of the season. His speed has provided a big-play dimension to the Seahawks offense, and his special teams contributions have been just as critical to this team's success. Any questions about whether Seattle would be rusty after enjoying a bye during the Wild Card Round were answered right after the 49ers kicked off to start the game. Shaheed returned the ball 95 yards for a touchdown and literally gave Seattle all the points it needed for the rest of the night. Now let's rewind to Week 16, when the Seahawks trailed the Rams by 16 points with a little less than 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Seattle needed some miracles to mount a comeback in that situation and Shaheed responded with a punt return for a touchdown to start that rally. These are the types of plays that help teams win championships. The Seahawks don't have to feed the ball to Shaheed -- and they've been more conservative offensively in the second half of this season -- but his presence and versatility makes a big difference for Darnold and this offense.

4) Broncos defense: There are many things that Denver does exceptionally well on defense. Forcing turnovers wasn't one of them until Buffalo came to town on Saturday. The Broncos created five takeaways in that Divisional Round win over the Bills, which is crazy when considering that same unit produced 14 turnovers all year. This was an area Payton had emphasized during the bye week and it was vital that his team seized every opportunity that came its way. The Broncos couldn't outgain the Bills, as Buffalo amassed 449 yards to Denver's 349. The Bills also converted 10 of 15 third-down situations. So when it came down to the difference in this contest, it was the way those turnovers swung the game for Denver. A fumble by Josh Allen with two seconds left in the first half turned into a Wil Lutz field goal. A strip-sack of Allen on Buffalo's first possession after halftime set up another Lutz field goal. Of course, the play of the game came when Broncos cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian outfought Bills wide receiver Brandin Cooks on a deep pass in overtime to create an interception that thwarted Buffalo's last best chance at securing a win. A Cooks catch on that play would've set up a makeable field goal for the Bills. Instead, Denver took the ball and drove down for what became Lutz's fourth and final field goal of the day. The Broncos were already a nightmare for opposing offenses when it came to categories like sacks, red zone defense and points allowed. If this unit is going to continue taking the ball away like it did on Sunday, it might be good enough to make up for the loss of Nix.

5) Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III: Walker has been finding his groove in recent weeks, which is a great sign for this team. Walker ran for 116 yards and scored three touchdowns in Seattle's win over San Francisco. It shouldn't be surprising that he had a big day against the 49ers -- the Seahawks ran for 180 yards against San Francisco in the season-finale -- but Walker's production had been inconsistent earlier this year. He's now rushed for at least 97 yards in three of his last four games. More impressively, he's averaged nearly six yards per carry over the past month. You take a player heating up like that and combine his talents with Zach Charbonnet (who sustained a knee injury on Saturday) and you can see why Darnold isn't pressing anymore. If that run game keeps grinding away, that Seahawks offense is going to continue creating more headaches for anybody who gets in its way.

1) Broncos quarterback Bo Nix: There was every reason to think Nix would be the ultimate winner on Saturday night, right until Sean Payton returned to the interview room and announced his second-year quarterback's season had ended with a broken ankle. Nix had spent an entire game proving that he was ready for the postseason stage. He finished with good numbers (279 passing yards, three touchdowns and an interception), but his best work occurred in those high-leverage moments that have become Denver's trademark this season. Nix led his team to a go-ahead score in the final minute when Buffalo had all the momentum and a reason to a think another playoff upset was in the making. He hit Courtland Sutton with a crucial 25-yard pass on a third-and-11 during that drive and connected with Marvin Mims Jr. on a 26-yard touchdown toss. It's equally important to note that Nix played well despite losing some key receivers to injuries and the Broncos running backs producing all of 41 yards. The narrative around Nix all season had been that he was a player who could be maddeningly inconsistent until it mattered most. Well, he proved he was more than ready to lead this team to the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, he'll have to watch and hope the Broncos can now reach that summit without him.

2) Bills quarterback Josh Allen: There isn't much left to say about Allen when it comes to postseason defeats. He's dealt with some heartbreakers over the course of his career, but this one should hurt a bit more because of his role. We usually talk about the Buffalo supporting cast failing Allen in critical situations when the Bills lose in the playoffs. This time around, he was a big part of the problem. The same quarterback who's been phenomenal throughout his postseason career -- he hadn't given the ball away once in his last six playoff games -- ended up with four turnovers. Allen fumbled three times and lost two of those while also throwing two interceptions. Some of those turnovers came down to a Denver defender making a great play, like the one McMIllian made in ripping the ball away from Cooks in overtime for that interception. At other times, it was Allen simply trying to do too much, when he lost the football while scrambling with two seconds left in the first half and set up a Will Lutz field goal after Denver recovered that mishap. It's fair to say the Bills would've won that game if Allen could've avoided one of those turnovers. Since he didn't, this ends up being another year where Buffalo fans are left to wonder what it will take for this team to win a championship during his tenure. It's been said many times that Allen was poised to benefit from a postseason without Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson playing. Turns out that advantage didn't take the Bills any farther than they've already been in recent years.

3) 49ers offense: Saturday's game with Seattle was never going to be a fair fight, not with all the issues the 49ers faced heading into it. For all the great work head coach Kyle Shanahan has done with a team beaten down by injuries, there was no way Seattle's defense was going to allow an upset with that kind of advantage. The Seahawks toyed with the 49ers in a season-ending win that decided the NFC West and top seed. Did we really think San Francisco had enough firepower left to deal with that unit after losing tight end George Kittle to a season-ending Achilles tear in the Wild Card Round? Give Shanahan and his team credit for beating Philadelphia last weekend. The problem with that win is it gave Seattle no reason to underestimate the 49ers coming into this one. The Seahawks allowed only 236 total yards on Saturday, which amounted to a paltry 3.9 yards per play. They also neutralized All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey, who finished with 35 rushing yards and 39 receiving yards. The 49ers deserved all the credit in the world for what they accomplished in the face of so much adversity. But it was very likely that a beatdown was coming after so many setbacks, and that's exactly what happened this weekend.

4) Bills head coach Sean McDermott: You can't write about another disappointing postseason finish for Josh Allen without talking about what it means for his head coach. These two have been tied to each other ever since Allen arrived in Buffalo in 2018. They also both face more scrutiny than anybody else in that franchise when the playoffs conclude with another soul-crushing defeat. This year was always going to be tougher challenge for McDermott's team because the Bills needed to win three playoff games on the road to reach the Super Bowl. They managed to earn one victory in Jacksonville in last weekend's Wild Card Round, but few teams can weather five turnovers and keep advancing in the postseason. McDermott now moves into an offseason where there will once again be more debates about how far he can take this team. The New England Patriots have turned into a power again in the AFC East, and they have the look of a team that isn't going to be a one-hit wonder. There also are a few high-profile former head coaches available on the open market for a team looking to make a change and bolster its chances of winning a championship. McDermott has been one of the best coaches in the league throughout his nine-year tenure in Buffalo. That doesn't mean there won't be chatter about what somebody like former Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin could do with a squad as talented as the Bills. Sure, the odds of that happening aren’t great. But we're also living in a world where Tomlin and John Harbaugh (who is now with the Giants after Baltimore fired him) are no longer with the teams they spent years coaching.

5) Bills running back James Cook: Cook might have been the star of the game if Buffalo had pulled out that win against Denver. He ran for a game-high 117 yards on 24 carries and was the best player on the field for long stretches of the first half. In fact, it felt like the Bills were taking control of the game behind Cook's effectiveness until a second-quarter fumble at Denver's 32-yard line changed the game. Buffalo led 7-3 at that point. After linebacker Alex Singleton popped the ball loose from Cook -- and safety Talanoa Hufanga recovered it -- the momentum swing was palpable. That miscue turned out to be ominous because it was the first of five Bills turnovers. Who knows how much damage Cook could've done on Saturday if Buffalo had been more careful with the football? The Broncos certainly knew a huge key to the game was stopping him. They didn't succeed entirely but that fumble proved to be just enough to make a critical difference in the outcome.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/suuio61vgzqe5qke8tgk,N,,2026-01-18 06:59:43.746660

Payton began with ""not good news,"" and then said quarterback Bo Nix had fractured his right ankle three plays before Wil Lutz kicked a 23-yard field goal in overtime that gave the Broncos a 33-30 win over the Buffalo Bills in Empower Field at Mile High on Saturday.

Payton said Nix will have surgery to repair the fracture Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama. It means Nix will miss whatever remains of the Broncos' postseason run and Jarrett Stidham will be the team's starter.

""[Nix] is a tough cookie,'' Payton said. ""I said, 'Listen I believe you're the second quarterback in his second year to take his team to the [conference] championship game and the first is [Patrick] Mahomes.' ... We'll rise up for the next challenge.""

On a first-and-10 from the Buffalo 36-yard line with 6 minutes, 4 seconds left in overtime, Nix was tackled for a loss of 2 yards on a designed run. He quickly jumped up after the tackle to get back in the huddle but did have a slight limp.

He threw a deep incompletion intended for wide receiver Marvin Mims Jr. on the next play as Buffalo cornerback Tre'Davious White was flagged for pass interference. The ball was moved to the Bills' 8-yard line after the penalty, and Nix took the next snap and kneeled to stop the play.

On the kneel-down, his right ankle twisted awkwardly and Nix grimaced as he showed a pronounced limp as he moved back to the Broncos' sideline. Nix underwent X-rays following the game, and many of the Broncos' players had left the locker room by the time Payton announced Nix's injury, ""so, in essence I'm telling them now,'' Payton said.

Nix finished Saturday's win 26-of-46 passing for 279 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. The victory was also the sixth time this season Nix has led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime.

Stidham, who was signed by the Broncos as a free agent in 2023 -- Payton's first season -- has appeared in one game this season. Stidham played four snaps, including a kneel-down to end the game, in the Broncos' 44-24 win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 8.

Stidham appeared in three games in the 2024 season, Nix's rookie year, but did not attempt a pass. His last significant playing time came in 2023, when he started the final two games of the season after Payton benched Russell Wilson.

Stidham threw two touchdowns to go with an interception in those two games combined, including a 16-9 win over the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 17 that season. Sam Ehlinger, who spent most of the season on the Broncos' practice squad before he was signed to the roster last week, will be the team's backup.

""Stiddy is ready to go,'' Payton said. ""... He's ready, he's ready. I feel like I've got a two who's capable of starting for a number of teams and I know he feels the same way. Watch out, just watch.''

Payton said he spoke to Nix briefly outside the locker room after Nix had been given the news from the Broncos' medical staff. He said Nix told him it was the third time he had suffered a fractured ankle in his football career, including once in high school and once when Nix was at Auburn.

""[He is] such a strong faith-based guy, [he's] sitting in the hallway with his family,"" Payton said.

On what he thinks the team's reaction will be, Payton added, ""They'll be disappointed, will be a lot of emotions, but then the refocus takes place. We celebrate the season for him. Listen, Stiddy is ready, we'll be ready for the next challenge. ... [Stidham] is experienced, he's played in games, they're different types of players to some degree and yet they're very close friends. It's a tight room. ... Here we go.''",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0117%2Fr1601960_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 06:59:52.931860

Just over an hour after the game ended, head coach Sean Payton announced that Nix had broken a bone in his ankle on the second-to-last play of the game.

“Not good news. On the second to last play in overtime, Bo fractured a bone in his right ankle,” Payton told reporters. “He’s scheduled to have surgery Tuesday of this week to put him out for the rest of this season. … It was the second to last play before he threw the pass to (Marvin) Mims.”

Jarrett Stidham, who appeared in one game this year and took just four snaps without attempting a pass, will replace him at QB next week.

It’s a shocking development following a thrilling game in the Mile High City. In a postseason already characterized by late-game dramatics, the Broncos emerged victorious from the first overtime game of the playoffs, beating the Bills.

It was a measure of revenge for the Broncos after the Bills eliminated them last year. Their 33-30 victory, Denver’s first playoff win at home in a decade, sends them to the AFC Championship.

The Broncos won it on an easy field goal after the Bills defense committed a pair of pass interference penalties for a total of 47 yards on the final drive of the game.

That was indicative of how Buffalo’s blunders proved costly. The Bills finished the game with 100 more yards than the Broncos, but were undone by untimely turnovers — five total as a team, including four by Josh Allen, who had committed only six turnovers through his first 14 playoff games prior to tonight.

Nix, whose only previous playoff start was the loss to the Bills last season, threw for three touchdowns. The 25-year-old appeared poised, even as Buffalo ramped up its pass rush in the second half.

Cameras showed Nix looking in pain on the sideline before the game-winning field goal but he did not appear to be walking with any major limp after the game.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256807351.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-18 06:59:58.900175

The Broncos will host their first AFC championship in a decade next weekend, after defeating the Buffalo Bills with a field goal in overtime. But they'll be playing without quarterback Bo Nix, who suffered a broken right ankle late in Denver's playoff win.

Coach Sean Payton delivered the stunning news about his second-year quarterback in the aftermath of Denver's biggest win in a decade. Backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will start next weekend.

“Stiddy’s ready,” Payton said after returning to the postgame lectern to discuss the injury following Denver's 33-30 victory.

Payton said Nix got hurt on a keeper where he lost 2 yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was limping after the play, but there was no indication that he suffered such a serious injury.

On the next play, Nix threw a deep pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that drew a 30-yard pass-interference flag and got the Broncos well into field-goal range. Nix then took a knee to center the ball for Wil Lutz's game-ending 23-yard field goal.

Payton said Nix will have surgery Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama.

“He's such a strong, faith-based guy,” Payton said. “He's sitting in the hallway with his family and coming over and we're all talking to him. He knows that God's got a plan for him and he said he had (a broken ankle) in high school and then he said he had one at Auburn.

“And I said I didn't realize that. I said if I had known that I wouldn't have drafted you,” Payton cracked.

The locker room had cleared out and reporters were waiting in an interview room for Nix when Payton returned and delivered the news.

A win in overtime

On Saturday evening, a fourth quarter nail-biter saw the teams trade the lead, with the Broncos down 27-23 with four minutes to go. Denver managed to score with less than a minute left on the clock, pulling ahead 30-27. But former Broncos kicker Matt Prater nailed a 50-yard field goal for the Bills with 5 seconds left in regulation, tying it at 30-all.

On their second possession of overtime, Broncos kicker Wil Lutz ended the game with 24-yard field goal. The Bills were flagged for pass interference twice on Denver's final drive.

Nix threw for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the course of the game.

The AFC title match up will be held at Sunday, Jan. 25 at Empower Field at Mile High, where Denver has won 14 of its last 15 games. It's the team's first time hosting an AFC championship in a decade, since the “No Fly Zone” defense that helped them win Super Bowl 50.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/CPR-Masterbrand-1500x1000-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 07:00:19.338694

Nix suffered a fracture in his right ankle late in overtime of the Broncos' 33-30 win over the Bills, and he will undergo season-ending surgery on Tuesday, according to Head Coach Sean Payton.

""He's a tough cookie,"" Payton said. ""I said [to him], 'Listen, I believe you're the second quarterback in Year 2 to take your team to a championship game. And the first is [Patrick] Mahomes.' This team, all year, has lost key players. We'll rise up for the next challenge, and we'll go from there.""

Veteran quarterback Jarrett Stidham will start the AFC Championship Game on Sunday, Jan. 25, and Sam Ehlinger will serve as the Broncos' No. 2 quarterback.

""I would say this, in fairness to what you've seen, which is very limited: He's ready,"" Payton said of Stidham. ""He's ready. I said this at the beginning of the season, I feel like I've got a [No. 2 quarterback] that's capable of starting for a number of teams, and I know he feels the same way. Watch out. Just watch. He's experienced, he's played in games. They're different type players to some degree.""

Nix, who joined John Elway as the only quarterbacks in franchise history to throw three touchdown passes in a postseason win, had started all 36 games in his two-year career.

Stidham has started four games in his career and earned a win in his last home start, which came in 2023.

""There will be a lot of emotions, and then the refocus takes place,"" Payton said of how the team can respond. ""We celebrated the season for [Nix].

Stidham has started four career games with a 1-3 record -- two with the Raiders in 2022 and two with the Broncos in 2023.","Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix suffered a fractured bone in his ankle late in the 33-30 overtime victory over the Buffalo Bills on Saturday and will have season-ending surgery. Backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will start in Nix's place in the AFC Championship game against either the New England Patriots or Houston Texans.

Broncos coach Sean Payton confirmed the injury after the game, saying it occurred on the second-to-last play of overtime.

""On the second to last play in overtime, Bo fractured a bone in his right ankle,"" Payton said. ""He's scheduled to have surgery Tuesday of this week, which will put him out for the rest of the season. [Stidham's] ready to go. Yeah it was the second to last play before he threw the pass to [Marvin] Mims.""

Payton saying the ""second to last play"" caused a bit of confusion, but if it was the play before the downfield pass attempt to Mims, that was a designed quarterback run by Nix that lost two yards. After that play, he threw a deep ball to Mims that drew a crucial pass interference penalty that gave the Broncos a first and goal. Nix then took a knee to set Wil Lutz up for the game-winning field goal.

Nix finished Saturday completing 26-of-46 passes for 279 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. He was also the Broncos' leading rusher with 29 yards on 12 carries.

Jarrett Stidham has not thrown a pass in either of the last two regular seasons for the Broncos, as Nix took all of the snaps for the Broncos at quarterback in every game in the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Now he'll be thrust into the starting role in the biggest game of the season. Denver can lean on the fact that they get to host the AFC Championship Game and the defense has played outstanding down the stretch. The Broncos forced four turnovers of Bills QB Josh Allen on Saturday night.

The Broncos were also a Super Bowl favorite heading into the weekend. However, with the news of Nix's injury, their odds have dropped down to +850 at DraftKings Sportsbook.

Stidham has started four career games with a 1-3 record -- two with the Raiders in 2022 and two with the Broncos in 2023.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/18/b725a2a6-01bd-4c99-b001-b6ec6b3b368a/thumbnail/1200x675/55ea4c5194af9bc3222631f3d23ee1e0/bo-nix-no-helmet-broncos.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 23:00:32.684964

Payton said the injury occurred on the third-to-last play in overtime on a little QB keeper at around the 36-yard line. I remember that play it was the one where Nix rushed over to the center of the hash and he was shoved, but nothing egregious. But apparently it was enough to cause the fractured bone in his ankle.

The injury seems to have occurred on the play right before the huge defensive pass interference call on a Nix pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that ultimately sealed victory for the Broncos.

You can see from the video below that he got up from that designed run a bit gingerly and had glanced down at his ankle as he went back to the huddle. He gutted out the fractured bone for two more plays to put his team in position to kick the game-winning field goal and send the Broncos to the AFC Championship Game.

That means the AFC Championship Game will be with Jarrett Stidham under center. This is horrible news for Broncos Country and what seemingly appears to be the end of a fantastic season. Stidham has played well at times, though, but he’ll need the whole team to rally around and make the plays. Can he pull off a Nick Foles type playoff run? I sure hope so!

Williams, a former third-round pick from Tulane, was on the ground for a while before making his way over to Buffalo's sideline.

Before the first quarter even came to a close, Buffalo ruled out Williams for the rest of the game with a neck injury. As you'd imagine, fans are concerned for his long-term health.

""That looked really bad,"" a Bills fan said. ""Praying for him.""

""Hope he’s alright,"" a second fan wrote.

""Frankly, think he’s lucky he’s not paralyzed. That was a brutal helmet to helmet hit,"" a social media user commented.

""Prayers up for 42,"" another fan said.

Injuries are piling up.

Broncos wide receiver Pat Bryant has already been ruled out in the first quarter with a concussion. On Buffalo's first offensive possession of the game, All-Pro cornerback Pat Surtain II suffered what appeared to be a shoulder injury.

Surtain missed time earlier this season with a partially torn pectoral muscle. Hopefully, the Broncos get him back on the field soon.

The winner of Saturday's game will face either the Houston Texans or New England Patriots in the AFC Championship.

Bo Nix Ruled Out for Playoffs Following Broncos’ Win over Bills, per Sean Payton | NFL on FOX

Nix's season certainly ended before he would have liked, but it was an impressive sophomore year in the NFL. He threw for 3,931 yards and 25 touchdowns, while leading Denver to a 14-3 record, the franchise's first-ever 14-win season. Nix was clutch all season, with seven game-winning drives. He delivered again in the postseason, leading the Broncos on a touchdown drive to take a 30-27 lead with 55 seconds left in regulation. Then, in overtime, he took them 75 yards on six plays to set up the game-winning field goal.

On the back of Nix's performance, the Broncos returned to the AFC Championship Round for the first time since they won Super Bowl 50 in 2016.

Stidham last started two games back in Weeks 17 and 18 of the 2023 season after the Broncos benched Russell Wilson. Stidham went 1-1 against the Raiders and Chargers, completing 60.6% of his passes for 496 passing yards with two touchdowns and an interception. He averaged 7.5 yards per attempt.

Stidham also started two games in the 2022 season for the Raiders.

Nix is scheduled to have surgery in Birmingham, Ala., on Tuesday.

Jarrett Stidham will be the starter for the Broncos in next week’s AFC Championship Game against either the New England Patriots or Houston Texans. Sam Ehlinger will be his backup.

“Stiddy’s ready to go,” Payton said.

The announcement was a stunning one and came after Payton had initially addressed the media following Denver’s thrilling overtime win, then returned to provide the update on his starting quarterback.

“The one thing about it is he’s such a strong, faith-based guy,” Payton said of Nix. “He knows God’s got a plan for him. … He’s a tough cookie. This team all year has lost key players. We’ll rise up for the next challenge and go from there.”

The injury happened late in Denver’s final drive, as Nix ran to the left on first-and-10 and was tackled by Bills safety Cole Bishop for a 2-yard loss. Nix then drew a pass interference penalty on a deep throw to Marvin Mims Jr. He limped off the field after kneeling the ball to set up Wil Lutz’s game-winning field goal.

Nix, consoled by his family and Payton after the game, told his coach he suffered a similar injury in high school and again at Auburn.

“I said, ‘I didn’t realize that. If I had known that, I wouldn’t have drafted you,’” Payton told Nix, a joke that belied the hurt the two were feeling in the aftermath of what proved to be a bittersweet night for the franchise.

Nix produced 308 yards offensively and threw three touchdown passes on Saturday. He led a go-ahead drive late in the fourth quarter, hitting Mims on a picture-perfect 26-yard pass in the front corner of the end zone. He followed that up by guiding the Broncos into field-goal range after Ja’Quan McMillian’s diving interception of Josh Allen during Buffalo’s first possession of overtime.

“For him, his passion, his composure, his leadership, his running ability, Bo can make a play out of anything,” Mims said in Denver’s locker room before news of Nix’s season-ending injury had reached players. “He’s been great this year.”

Nix guided the Broncos to 24 regular-season wins during his first two seasons, tied for the most in NFL history by a quarterback in his first two seasons. He helmed the Broncos to a No. 1 seed in the AFC after they tied a franchise record with 14 wins. He authored seven game-winning drives in the regular season to add to his first such postseason drive Saturday.

Now, as the Broncos prepare to play for a berth in the Super Bowl, Nix will be forced to watch from afar as he recovers from next week’s surgery. Payton said he typically would have waited until a team meeting the following morning to share the news of an injury with the magnitude of the one Nix suffered Saturday. However, the odds of the news not getting out “were impossible,” Payton said.

“In essence, I’m talking to the team now,” Payton said. “They’ll be disappointed. There will be a lot of emotions. And then the refocus takes place. We celebrate the season for him.”

Now, the Broncos will turn to Stidham, the 29-year-old veteran who has made four career starts, including two with Denver at the end of the 2023 season. He has never started a playoff game. Stidham was the Patriots’ fourth-round pick in 2019, spending one season behind Tom Brady and one season with the Las Vegas Raiders before signing with Denver in 2023 to back up Russell Wilson. Stidham then competed with Nix for the starting job in training camp ahead of the 2024 season, but Nix won.

“He’s ready,” Payton said of Stidham. “I said this at the beginning of the season: I feel like we have a (backup quarterback) who is capable of starting for a number of teams. I know who feels the same way. Watch out. Just watch.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/17214134/GettyImages-2256821679-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-17 23:01:12.556804

For the third time this season, NFL fans will be treated to a game between the NFC West's San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks.

The 49ers overcame injuries to stars on defense (edge rusher Nick Bosa and linebacker Fred Warner) as well as starters on offense (quarterback Brock Purdy and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall) during the regular season. In the regular season finale, San Francisco hosted Seattle in a battle for the No. 1 seed in the playoffs.

Seattle won that one 13-3 to cap off one of the best regular seasons in franchise history.

As they were during their previous heyday in the 2010s, this year's Seahawks team is powered by one of the best defenses in the NFL. Stars at each level of the unit play like a dominant force against both the run and the pass. On offense, wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba broke out in 2025 to become one of the top playmakers in the league.

The quarterback throwing him the ball, Sam Darnold, enjoyed one of his best seasons in the league this year. But tonight's game marks the first playoff start since Darnold endured an NFL record-tying nine sacks in a loss to the Los Angeles Rams last year during the wild-card playoffs.

Darnold popped up on the injury report late this week with an oblique issue. Here's the latest on his status:

Is Sam Darnold playing today?

Sam Darnold is officially active for today's divisional round playoff game against the 49ers. He is expected to start.

Darnold downplayed the injury when asked about it during his media availability earlier this week.

""Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said today. ""Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

He's listed as questionable on the team's injury report but appears like he will be good to go for tonight's game pending pre-game warmups, per NFL Network's Steve Wyche.

""[Team officials] said not only are they optimistic but that Darnold himself feels super confident that he will be able to get out and play,"" Wyche said.

Who is Sam Darnold's backup?

Seattle has two more quarterbacks on its active roster behind Darnold. Drew Lock is the second-string quarterback and would be expected to start if Darnold is unable to play.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/15/USAT/88202984007-usatsi-27818437.jpg?crop=7495,4216,x0,y390&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-17 21:59:42.541671

The 49ers' tight end also earned a fifth straight Pro Bowl nod in 2025 and seventh in the last eight years.","As the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks begin their NFL playoffs clash in the divisional round, one star player is conspicuously absent.

What happened to George Kittle? And when could the 49ers' tight end return?

In last week's wild-card round game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Kittle tore his right Achilles tendon after catching a pass in the second quarter. The 49ers tight end had to be carted back to the locker room and was quickly ruled out of the remainder of the game with an Achilles injury. Head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed to reporters after the game that Kittle had torn his Achilles.

San Francisco officially placed Kittle on injured reserve on Jan. 13. The 49ers' star tight end was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair the torn tendon on Jan. 14, according to Shanahan.

Here's what to know about Kittle's status moving forward:

When will George Kittle return?

Kittle's season is officially over after the 49ers placed their lead tight end on injured reserve. He will have to wait until next season for his return.

""Football sucks sometimes,"" Kittle wrote in an Instagram post. ""But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. Cheers, all my love.""

According to the Mayo Clinic, the rehab process following a surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles can last anywhere from four to six months before most patients ""return to their former level of activity."" However, ""some problems can persist for up to a year"" without more exercises to rebuild strength and stability.

How long Kittle remains out will depend on the severity of his Achilles rupture and the length of his rehab process. The timeline for his return may become clearer once Kittle is out of surgery and has started his rehab.

George Kittle stats

Kittle played in just 11 games this season in another year tainted by injuries. A Grade 3 hamstring tear kept him out of five games early in the season, and an ankle sprain later in the season caused Kittle to miss another game.

Here's Kittle's numbers from a 2025 season that featured fewer games played for the tight end than any season since 2020:

Targets: 69

Receptions: 57

Receiving yards: 628

Yards per reception: 11.0

Touchdowns: 7

Despite the relative lack of playing time in 2025, Kittle's seven touchdowns were the third-highest total of his career behind 11 (2022) and eight (2024). The 49ers' tight end also earned a fifth straight Pro Bowl nod in 2025 and seventh in the last eight years.

Tonges, who had his first career reception with a touchdown in Week 1 this year, is a fourth-year tight end who has taken on the primary tight end role in Kittle's absences this year. His 46 targets during the regular season were the most of any 49ers pass-catchers outside of Kittle, running back Christian McCaffrey and San Francisco's three leading wide receivers.

Farrell joined the 49ers as a free agent last offseason after four years in Jacksonville and recorded his first career receiving touchdown in Week 2. Willis was on the 49ers' practice squad for most of the season and re-signed to the team's active roster after Kittle's Achilles injury.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/14/USAT/88178707007-george-kittle-49-ers-imagn.jpg?crop=2605,1465,x1079,y524&width=2605&height=1465&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-17 21:59:55.462015

A conspiracy theory is floating around the NFL and surrounding the San Francisco 49ers, linking their home location, Levi's Stadium, to a number of injuries sustained by Niners players.

Just next door to Levi's Stadium, where the 49ers play their home games in Santa Clara, is their practice facility, which is where the 49ers have strapped up for practice since 1988. And, neighboring that venue sits an electrical substation.

What started as a theory has since gone viral, sparking social media debate about the safety of 49ers players and teams who visit Levi's Stadium for away games. Not to mention, Levi's Stadium will be the site of Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8.

The theory, which has yet to be scientifically proven true, is that excessive Electromagnetic Field (EMF) exposure can cause negative harm to the body.

""Low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage at levels regulators call 'safe',"" an X user, Peter Cowan, posted on Jan. 6 which has since amassed 22 million views, 5,900 reposts and 35,000 likes.

49ers injury conspiracy: NFL players react

San Francisco has suffered blows to many key players throughout the season, including Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey, Nick Bosa, Brandon Aiyuk, Trent Williams and Fred Warner. Many of their injuries were tendon and ligament tears.

George Kittle is the most recent victim to injury, after suffering a torn right Achilles against the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Wild Card Round at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Jan. 11.

49ers wide receiver Kendrick Bourne joked about the viral conspiracy theory explaining the team's injuries during a Jan. 13 scrum with reporters.

""Yeah, it's that power plant,"" Bourne said. ""Nah, I'm just playing. I don't know. It just sucks, but we do a good job of just working everyday. Injuries are a part of the game. It's unfortunate but we just have to hold it down keep that good energy and believe in ourselves, believe in the next man up.""

Although, there hasn't been an official injury tied to the EMF plant, players around the league are allegedly taking caution and reaching out to their agents about any possibility that there's truth to the conspiracy, according to the Washington Post.

Experts debunk 'nonsense' theory

Frank de Vocht, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Bristol Medical School in England, is a leading expert on how EMF affects humans.

He said in an interview with The Post that the conspiracy theory is ""nonsense"".

UC Davis radiology professor Jerrold Bushberg, who is also a 49ers fan, told Front Office Sports in an interview that there isn't any established evidence to conclude the conspiracy as accurate.

“These so-called ‘mechanisms’ have not been established,"" Bushberg said. ""Many of the experiments are contradictory. Many of the experiments have exposures that either don’t relate specifically to 50-, 60-hertz magnetic fields, or are at much, much higher levels than what would be experienced at a practice level.""

It's a topic that will likely resurface if there are any major injuries during Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara.

The top-seeded Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills are battling in the divisional round opener. Whichever team wins punches a ticket to the AFC championship game next Sunday.

Buffalo won the coin toss and deferred. On the opening kickoff, one of their players suffered a serious injury.

Linebacker Dorian Williams made the special teams tackle to take down Broncos returner Marvin Mims Jr. He remained on the ground for multiple minutes and needed assistance before walking off the field.

Williams was later seen being carted to the locker room.

Just next door to Levi's Stadium, where the 49ers play their home games in Santa Clara, is their practice facility, which is where the 49ers have strapped up for practice since 1988. And, neighboring that venue sits an electrical substation.

What started as a theory has since gone viral, sparking social media debate about the safety of 49ers players and teams who visit Levi's Stadium for away games. Not to mention, Levi's Stadium will be the site of Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8.

The theory, which has yet to be scientifically proven true, is that excessive Electromagnetic Field (EMF) exposure can cause negative harm to the body.

The Current reported for preseason this week with the two-time NWSL MVP inactive on the roster and listed on the Season-Ending Injury list.
The Malawi international missed the final match of the regular season and the top-seed Current’s 2-1 loss to No.
“It’s hard because of the nature of the injury,” Armas said.
“I know it was a little bit of a tough ending here after, honestly, an amazing historic season,” Armas said.","The return of Kansas City Current forward Temwa Chawinga is “still unclear,” head coach Chris Armas told The Athletic.

The Current reported for preseason this week with the two-time NWSL MVP inactive on the roster and listed on the Season-Ending Injury list. Chawinga suffered an adductor injury in the first half of a 1-0 defeat away to the Houston Dash on Oct. 18; it was the Current’s penultimate match of the 2025 NWSL regular season.

The Malawi international missed the final match of the regular season and the top-seed Current’s 2-1 loss to No. 8-seed NJ/NY Gotham FC in the quarterfinals of the playoffs. Chawinga finished the season as the league’s Golden Boot winner with 15 goals, was crowned MVP and named in the Best XI.

“It’s hard because of the nature of the injury,” Armas said. “With Temwa, we’ve got to be very careful, but she’s looking great and doing lots of good work on the return to play.”

Chawinga is not the only high-profile Current forward who needs more time for recovery this preseason. Michelle Cooper has also been placed on the SEI list.

Cooper had a career-best year in 2025, scoring six goals and notching three assists, while also breaking into the U.S. women’s national team for the first time and earning 10 caps under Emma Hayes.

The 23-year-old winger injured her foot in the second half of the Current’s 2-1 win over the San Diego Wave on Nov. 2, the final day of the 2025 regular season, and also missed the playoffs.

The Current players are due to start training Saturday. Kansas City will open the 2026 season at home against the Utah Royals on March 14, which will be 147 days since Chawinga first picked up an injury.

“We might start the season without them, and this is tricky. We’ll know more in the next (few) weeks,” Armas said.

NWSL competition rules state a player can be designated as SEI only after a chief medical officer or team physician has performed an in-person injury assessment and then writes a letter to the league certifying the player’s designation.

Using the SEI designation allows teams to have salary-cap relief until the return of the player, as well as sign injury-replacement players.

Players can be activated off the SEI list at any time with clearance from a physician so long as they were designated as SEI in the prior season or before the start of the regular season.

A player designated as SEI after the start of the regular season can be activated to the roster but only if the team did not take roster or salary-cap relief. This is known in the competition rules as an “unexpected recovery” and can be used with a maximum of two players per team.

“I know it was a little bit of a tough ending here after, honestly, an amazing historic season,” Armas said. “Without the speed up top and some of our best players, we will find solutions from the start of the season. Hopefully they are back as soon as possible, but it’s still unclear.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/06/24230908/USATSI_26024379.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-17 20:00:00.729970

How does an oblique injury affect QBs?","Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold was declared active 90 minutes before the team’s divisional round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday, after being listed as questionable to play Thursday.

Despite the listing, the veteran QB was not seen warming up on the field with the Seahawks as of 3:30 p.m. PT. Instead, backup quarterback Drew Lock threw to the starters during on-field pregame warmups, while emergency quarterback Jalen Milroe threw to the backups.

Darnold was first listed as questionable with an oblique injury after Thursday’s practice, when he told reporters he “felt something” in his left side while throwing during practice and was removed from the session out of caution.

Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that he was “really optimistic” Darnold would play, but the Seahawks haven’t had an official practice since Darnold’s injury. There was a light walk-through on Friday that was closed to reporters.

Macdonald declined to say whether Darnold, who was seen throwing underhand to Lock while Macdonald met the media on Friday, threw passes during the session. While he echoed Darnold’s comment that the injury designation and subsequent missed practice were measures taken out of caution, Macdonald said it’s possible the oblique injury could limit Darnold against San Francisco.

“Right now, we’re going through all the protocols out of caution, making sure we are ready to go,” Macdonald said.

Darnold, who has thrown for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdowns for the NFC’s No. 1-seeded Seahawks, hasn’t missed a game in either of the last two seasons.

“Right now, he’s confident he’s gonna be able to go do his thing 100 percent. We are, too,” Macdonald said Friday. He later added: “I don’t think we’d put him out there if he couldn’t do his job.”

Who is Seattle’s backup QB?

If Darnold doesn’t play, Lock, a 2019 second-round pick out of Missouri by the Denver Broncos, has taken first-team reps in Darnold’s place in preparation for the possibility of leading the Seahawks in their home playoff game.

Lock has thrown for 6,369 yards, 34 touchdowns and 28 interceptions in 41 games played in six NFL seasons.

His last start came with the New York Giants during the 2024 season, when he started five games and went 1-4 with 1,071 yards, six touchdowns and five interceptions on 59.1 percent passing.

He had a previous stint with the Seahawks after being traded to Seattle in March 2022 as part of the Russell Wilson deal with the Broncos. Lock was 1-1 in two starts for the Seahawks in 2023, including a 20-17 win over the Philadelphia Eagles that saw him complete 22 of 33 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown.

Who is the emergency third quarterback?

Should Darnold and Lock be unable to play, rookie Jalen Milroe can enter the game as an emergency third quarterback. He was listed by the team as its emergency quarterback 90 minutes before the game.

Since 2023, NFL teams have been allowed to dress a third QB on game days without using an active roster spot, but there are limitations.

The rule states that teams can activate that QB “during the game, if the club’s first two quarterbacks on its game day Active List are not able to participate in the game due to injury or disqualification.” Milroe cannot be activated due to a head coach’s decision based on performance or conduct. If either of the first two quarterbacks is cleared by medical staff to play after the emergency QB enters the game, he must be removed immediately.

The Seahawks drafted Milroe out of Alabama in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft. In college, Milroe tallied 6,016 passing yards, throwing 45 touchdowns and 20 interceptions. On the ground, he ran for 1,577 yards and 33 touchdowns.

How does an oblique injury affect QBs?

Dr. Jeremy Alland, a sports medicine primary care physician who served as a team physician for the Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox, wrote earlier this season about how oblique injuries can affect quarterbacks.

Addressing the topic after Cleveland Browns QB Shedeur Saunders suffered such an injury during training camp in August, Alland wrote that the oblique muscles “are crucial for core stability and rotational power. In quarterbacks, these muscles generate much of the torque needed for deep, accurate passes.”

He added: “An oblique strain typically occurs when these muscles are overstretched or overloaded, often during high-velocity rotational movements like throwing.”

The doctor mentioned three possibilities for how such an injury might occur: during a powerful throw with torso rotation, during off-balance throws or during repetitive high-intensity passing without proper recovery. He listed potential symptoms such as sharp pain in the side or lower ribs during rotation, discomfort with laughing, deep breathing or coughing.

Mild strains can take up to two to three weeks to recover from, according to Alland. If Darnold’s initial strain occurred on Thursday, then he would be attempting to play on just two days of recovery.

“Quarterbacks often require full rotational strength and pain-free mechanics before returning to play,” Alland wrote, “as incomplete healing can significantly increase re-injury risk.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/17124042/GettyImages-2254536822.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-17 19:01:50.087606

This drive has been very disjointed thanks to injuries and timeouts but Denver is still rolling.

Marvin Mims Jr. has been critical on third down as Bo Nix finds him for 15 yards before Sean Payton calls his final timeout.

Buffalo has been scraping the bottom of its safety depth chart, and now Cam Lewis has gone to the locker room with 38 seconds left and Denver still working. Lewis appeared to suffer a cramp, as trainers tended to him with hydration and stretches. But if this issue persists, the short-handed Bills are even weaker at safety.

Q2 0:38 - Bills 10, Broncos 10

After a timeout by Buffalo, Bo Nix is unable to connect with Courtland Sutton on second-and-10. Cam Lewis, who is having a strong afternoon, came flying in to break up the pass but he was injured on the play.

That could be a big problem for the Bills as injuries continue to mount in this game.

Q2 1:04 - Bills 10, Broncos 10

Bo Nix finds Marvin Mims Jr. for a short gain on third-and-3 to move the sticks.

Two plays later, Denver faces third-and-3 again at midfield. Nix takes matters into his own hands, taking off for 6 yards into Buffalo territory to extend the drive.

Bills center Connor McGovern has been cleared to return, which is great news for them. Josh Allen was pressured a lot on the Bills' last possession, and Anderson rolled a shotgun snap back to him on a play that resulted in a 0-yard sack.

Q2 1:55 - Bills 10, Broncos 10

Courtland Sutton sat down wide open but Bo Nix misses him on the run. He then connects with Evan Engram for 7 yards as this game reaches the two-minute warning. Denver will have third-and-3 after the break.

Buffalo will begin the second half with the football.

And there's a Keon Coleman drop in the end zone. The touchdown wouldn't have counted, but if Coleman catches that pass, then the Broncos would have been forced to accept O'Cyrus Torrence's false start penalty. Instead, the Broncos decline, and rather than the Bills getting another third-down situation to score a TD or gain 14 yards for a first down, they kick the field goal to tie the game at 10.

Q2 2:13 - Bills 10, Broncos 10

Josh Allen is sacked again, setting up third-and-9. He targets Keon Coleman open in the back of the end zone but the wideout drops a touchdown. Luckily for him, it would have been negated by an offensive holding penalty anyway.

Buffalo settles for a 33-yard field goal from Matt Prater and he drills it to tie the game.

Q2 4:37 - Broncos 10, Bills 7

A sack of Josh Allen on first down slows down Buffalo's momentum. A screen to Khalil Shakir then sets up third-and-10. Allen delivers though, throwing a perfect ball to Brandin Cooks for a gain of 15 yards into the red zone.

The veteran wideout has been huge for Buffalo in the playoffs.

Frank Crum is a second-year undrafted player from Wyoming. He has played sparingly in his first two years in the NFL, finding a role this season as Denver's sixth O-lineman in heavy sets. He know has Denver's first touchdown of their divisional round matchup against the Bills. Just as we all thought

Bills running back James Cook never fumbled through his first eight playoff games. That streak just ended in his ninth appearance, and not only did Cook fumble, he lost that fumble, marking the first playoff turnover of his career.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/oO9eY86CceJQ_W1Icaxgikimt_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-17 17:59:21.172416

Buffalo (+1.5) at Denver, o/u 46.0 – Saturday, 4:30 p.m. EST

The AFC side of the playoffs this season could end up being something of a referendum on just how important it is to have a truly elite quarterback. Josh Allen quite literally carried the Bills to a win over the Jaguars in the wild-card round, and with Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson sitting at home, Drake Maye might be the only signal-caller left in the field who can match him in talent. Of course, the team around him needs to help a bit too. James Cook got stifled by the Jags, and the Broncos haven't been much easier to run against, but he might be overdue for a trip to the end zone — his last TD came in Week 16. Allen still lacks a true WR1, but Khalil Shakir is at least a reliable possession option, and Dalton Kincaid can create some mismatches at tight end. If Ed Oliver is able to make it back this weekend, it would also go a long way toward shoring up the defense's biggest weakness, as three of the team's last five opponents have run for more than 150 yards against the Bills.

The Broncos hopefully used their bye to figure out a way to spark their offense. In three games since starting center Luke Wattenberg was injured, they haven't topped 20 points, though they still won two of them thanks to the defense. Since a Week 12 bye, Denver's allowed 19.8 points per game with 19 sacks, and on the year Nik Bonitto and company led the NFL in sacks, pressures and QB knockdowns. No defense gave up fewer TDs in 2025 — the Seahawks tied the Broncos with 29 allowed, but they also coughed up a couple on special teams and offense — or had a better red-zone efficiency, and only Seattle had a better third-down efficiency. If DC Vance Joseph's crew can keep Allen from steamrolling them close to the goal line, it'll give Bo Nix a chance to get them through to the organization's first AFC championship since 2015, but that's far easier said than done.

San Francisco (+7.5) at Seattle, o/u 45.0 – Saturday, 8 p.m. EST

What's that old tag line? ""Takes a licking and keeps on ticking""? The 49ers had to pull Eric Kendricks off his couch to play linebacker a few weeks ago and lost George Kittle in the wild-card round, but that didn't stop them from going on the road and upsetting the defending champs in Philly. Christian McCaffrey keeps rolling right along, catching two TD passes against the Eagles while racking up triple-digit scrimmage yards for the third time in the last four games, and his steadiness has kept the offense afloat even though Brock Purdy has managed to get picked off in four consecutive games. DC Robert Saleh keeps MacGyvering a defense with paper clips and chewing gum, but the unit's failed to produce a turnover in four of its last five games, and the run defense has been gashed pretty regularly down the stretch. Fate is always on a team's side until destiny yanks the rug out from under it, and it's probably not a great sign that the only loss the Niners have had the last two months has come against the team they're facing Saturday, but San Francisco also knows that it's playing with house money at this point. The pressure's all on the other sideline.

The NFC's No. 1 seed didn't seem worried the last time these two teams met, though. With that first-round bye on the line, the Seahawks completely shut down the Niners, winning 13-3 in Week 18. It was the fourth time in its last six games that Mike Macdonald's defense had held an opponent to 10 points or fewer, and during the team's active seven-game winning streak Seattle's allowed just 14.1 points and 263.6 yards a contest. Zach Charbonnet's gotten into the end zone four times in the team's last three games, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba wrapped up his breakout campaign with the eighth-highest receiving yards total in history. Assuming Sam Darnold's minor oblique issue is, in fact, minor, the only thing working against the Seahawks is their lack of pedigree. Darnold's first playoff game last year didn't go so well, and while Macdonald was on Baltimore's staff, the Ravens went 3-6 in the postseason and never got past the conference championship (though I guess that track record is more the Giants' problem now than the Seahawks').

SUNDAY

Houston (+3) at New England, o/u 40.5 – Sunday, 3 p.m. EST

Three teams had a claim to being a truly elite defense in 2025, and all three are still alive in the playoffs. The Texans were the only ones to have to survive the wild-card round, though, and they likely sent Aaron Rodgers into retirement with an emphatic 30-6 victory that included two defensive TDs. They might need the extra scoring again this weekend, and C.J. Stroud's top target, Nico Collins, isn't expected to clear the concussion protocol in time. During Houston's 10-game winning streak, DeMeco Ryans' defense has given up an average of 18.0 points and 274.9 yards a game, so Stroud might not need too much extra help. The third-year QB has a 9:3 TD:INT in the last six weeks, with the most surprising of those nine being the one that went to Christian Kirk last week. The veteran slot receiver was basically an afterthought in the offense the entire second half, but he erupted for 8-144-1 against Pittsburgh, seamlessly stepping in for Collins. Kirk won't be a surprise this time around, but the Texans would probably take half of that production.

The Patriots had their worst offensive performance since Week 3 in the wild-card round, but fortunately at the same time they put together their best defensive performance of the year, holding the Chargers to just a field goal and sacking poor Justin Herbert six times. Drake Maye did commit multiple turnovers for only the fourth time this season and failed to complete 60 percent of his passes for the first time since Week 10, but the MVP voting is already done so he should be fine. He did face the Texans in his first career start last year, tossing three TDs but committing three turnovers in a 41-21 loss, but both the QB and the Houston defense are in very different places now. (Fun fact: Stefon Diggs caught his last TD as a Texan in that game.) Mike Vrabel is favoring Rhamondre Stevenson again over TreVeyon Henderson, with the senior RB scoring six TDs in the last four games while piling up 461 scrimmage yards, but the pattern for this offense as a whole has been that there is no pattern beyond Maye's involvement, so bank on that at your peril.

L.A. Rams at Chicago (+3.5), o/u 48.5 – Sunday, 6:30 p.m. EST

In what is perhaps the most improbable factoid I've ever seen, Sean McVay will roll into his 15th career playoff game never having faced a time twice. Under his watch, the only NFC teams the Rams haven't met yet in the postseason are the Giants and Commanders. If the Rams don't advance here, expect both of them to get playoff berths in 2026, just so McVay can complete his list. Or he might just say to heck with it and go all the way to the Super Bowl, which would be fun too. Last weekend's win over the Panthers required a last-minute TD from Colby Parkinson, but that was mainly because the defense couldn't contain Bryce Young. Matthew Stafford led the team to 30-plus points for the fifth time in the last six games, a stretch in which the Rams averaged 36.3 points and 466.5 yards while the veteran QB posted a 17:5 TD:INT. For all the focus that goes toward Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, it's the team's stacked TE room that's been doing serious damage. Parkinson, Tyler Higbee and Terrance Ferguson combined for nine of those 17 touchdowns while playing only 12 games between them, which is some Brock Bowers-Trey McBride level production. The NFL is a copycat league, and while the trend the last few years has seen a resurgence from bell cow RBs, it's stud TEs creating mismatches that might be the next big thing through the rest of the decade.

The Bears probably looked at the Rams' little comeback last weekend and laughed, while riffing on Bane's speech but talking about how those rich playboys from L.A. merely adopted the fourth-quarter deficit. Caleb Williams led his team back from a 21-6 deficit at the start of the fourth quarter, after he put together six other fourth-quarter comebacks during the regular season — tied for the fifth-highest total in history. The list of QB with six or more in a season includes Hall of Famers like John Elway and Payton Manning (twice!) ... and Stafford, who had a record eight 4Q comebacks with the Lions in 2016 as they went 9-7. (Which, like, how is that even possible?) At some point Ben Johnson's going to have to figure out how to get his young gunslinger to flip that switch a little earlier in the game, but Williams has plenty of time to work things out. The Chicago defense sagged late in the season and has allowed more than 400 yards in three consecutive games, but so long as Williams gets the ball last, there's nothing to worry about.

How much will the Seahawks’ top-ranked defense make the quarterback’s new oblique issue a secondary concern that won’t get in Seattle’s way of advancing to the NFC championship game next week?

Those have become the key questions in the final 48 hours up to the divisional-playoff game between the top-seeded Seahawks (14-3) and sixth-seeded San Francisco 49ers (13-5) Saturday at Lumen Field (5 p.m., FOX television, channel 13 locally).

Darnold is questionable to play. The Pro Bowl quarterback who threw for over 4,000 yards this season with 25 touchdowns and an NFL-high 20 turnovers felt discomfort in his left oblique, his non-throwing side, throwing a pass in practice Thursday.

Coach Mike Macdonald on Friday echoed his QB from the day before in saying he is “really optimistic” Darnold will play.

But how will the injury affect him throwing the ball, his follow-through on passes, and taking hits and sacks?

No one — not Darnold, not his coach or the team’s medical staff — will know that exactly until it happens Saturday. The Seahawks’ coaches and training staff will have Darnold test the oblique throwing in pregame drills, but...

Macdonald was asked Friday if he expects Darnold to be limited at all by the injury, in throwing the ball or any of his other normal QB duties in the game.

“Well, yeah, that’s a possibility,” Macdonald said. “But I don’t think — I think right now, he’s confident that he’s going to be able to go do his thing 100%. We are, too.

“But these things, something could change between now and then or something could happen in-game. So we just kind of have to roll with it.

“I mean, I don’t think that we’d put him out there if he couldn’t do his job. He’s going to be able to go do his job (in order to play).”

Darnold injured his oblique on his left, non-throwing side during practice Thursday, throwing a pass without defenders. He said he felt discomfort in his side and immediately shut down practicing to get treatment for the rest of the day.

Veteran backup Drew Lock was the quarterback for the starting offense the rest of practice two days before the playoff opener.

The list of inactive players announced by each time 90 minutes before kickoff, 3:30 p.m. Saturday, will be the first indication whether Darnold, or Lock, is playing.

But it won’t be the last Darnold’s oblique issue comes up Saturday, playing (as all indications are he will) or not playing.

2nd key: Byron Murphy

George Kittle is out for San Francisco. The All-Pro tight end tore his Achilles tendon last weekend in the 49ers wild-card playoff win at Philadelphia. That makes Christian McCaffrey even more vital for the Niners — and for the Seahawks to stop. Again.

In the NFC West title game two weeks ago, Seahawks do-it-all rookie Nick Emmanwori tackled McCaffrey multiple times immediately after catches. The All-Pro rushing and receiving running back had six reception but for just 34 yards. That was his fewest yards receiving with that many catches and without a score in two seasons, since Christmas 2025 against Baltimore — whose defensive coordinator that night was...Macdonald.

Enter Byron Murphy.

On Jan. 3 the Seahawks’ dynamic, yet under-the-radar defensive tackle splitting double-teams allowed Ernest Jones, Leonard Williams and DeMarcus Lawrence to tackle McCaffrey at the line on running plays. McCaffrey’s 23 yards on eight carries was his lowest run-game production since December 2018, his second NFL season with Carolina.

With Kittle out, expect 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan to use McCaffrey in different formations, perhaps out wide, and more often in a varied passing scheme. And the Seahawks expect more than the eight carries McCaffrey got against them two weeks ago. Macdonald calls Murphy, Seattle’s first-round draft choice out of Texas in 2024, “the best in the world right now, especially at A-gap (between the guard and center) double-teams.”

If Murphy is again as brilliant, strong and quick in beating double-team blocks with his unique move of going to one knee and rising through like he’s doing a Turkish-kettle-bell get-up works as it did the last time against the 49ers, the Seahawks will be in the NFC championship game.

3rd key: 49ers vs Seattle’s run

Darnold’s injury could mean even more of a reliance on the running game than Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak’s had while calling runs on 50% of plays this regular season, when the Seahawks were among the NFL’s top-three run-heavy offenses.

Even if Darnold feels great, they will run.

Kenneth Walker, Zach Charbonnet and the Seahawks romped for a season-high 180 yards on the ground in Santa Clara Jan. 3. The 49ers played two-deep safety defense for the majority of snaps in the first half — when Seattle rushed for 115 yards, its most in an opening half in two seasons. Then San Francisco went to single-high safety looks, with a “heavier box” and second safety nearer the line of scrimmage to stop the run. Yet on Seattle’s biggest offensive play after halftime, Walker ran for 19 yards on third and 17 against two-deep defense.

Seahawks rookie guard Grey Zabel this week said he expects Niners defensive play caller Robert Saleh to run blitz more, mix fronts more, and give Seattle’s offense new looks to combat the run. If they don’t work a lot better than what the 49ers did the last time they played Seattle and got run over, it may be the same end result.

The pick

The Seahawks’ defense is elite enough to get the team to their first Super Bowl in 11 seasons. Darnold and the offense must do their part not to subvert that. That means not turning the ball over and handing points to the depleted 49ers, who again will find driving 70-plus yards for points on Seattle a monumental task.

Darnold takes care of the ball — and his aching side.

And the Seahawks advance to play the Rams in the NFC title game next week at Lumen Field.

Read on for the NFL Divisional Round Talking Points!

MVP BOLTER’S ‘SERIOUS’ OBSTACLE IN BIGGEST LITMUS TEST

In just his second season since being taken no. 3 overall by the Patriots, Drake Maye has elevated himself into the Most Valuable Player conversation, and justifiably so.

He’s thrown the deep ball accurately all season long and looked every bit the franchise quarterback the front office hoped he’d be when it swooped on the former North Carolina standout.

But after the Patriots’ defence suffocated Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers in the wildcard, Maye faces the toughest test of his young career on Monday.

That’s because the Houston Texans are the NFL’s unmatched defensive force.

The Texans finished the regular season ranked first in the league in total defence, and second in scoring defence — their 17.4 points allowed per game was just behind Seattle’s top-ranked 17.2 — led by elite pass-rushing duo Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter, and ball-hawking cornerback combo Derek Stingley Jr. and Kamari Lassiter.

In their wildcard round triumph over Aaron Rodgers’ Steelers, the Texans scored two defensive touchdowns. Powered by head coach DeMeco Ryans, this is a serious unit.

So, ball security is going to be of utmost priority for Maye, who isn’t immune to the odd fumble when there’s pressure in the pocket.

The 23-year-old will have to prove the credentials that have put him in MVP contention, and using his feet to escape the grasp of Anderson and Hunter will be one of the biggest keys.

It comes after Maye struggled to genuinely assert himself against the Chargers, going 17-29 passing for 268 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He did, however, carry it 10 times for a team-best 66 rushing yards.

Maye had the league’s best passer rating — 112.0 — in the regular season, but the Texans allowed the NFL’s second-lowest opposing passer rating of 83.2.

Asked how the Patriots can score on the Texans’ defence, renowned sportscaster Bill Simmons said on his podcast: “Drake Maye. We’ve seen the Texans get beaten by deep shots … because a lot of times they’re just rushing four, we saw (Aaron) Rodgers with opportunities to run, but he didn’t, because he’s old. Drake Maye will run. And I just think the Pats are way better than the Steelers.”

ESPN sportscaster Peter Schrager, on the other hand, wasn’t as optimistic about New England’s chances against the league’s best stoppers.

“I’ve seen the Texans’ defence up close twice this season … I am blown away by all three levels of this defence, that I am going to give you the biggest hyperbole of all — this might be like the 2000 Ravens.

“They might not need to do anything on offence, they might just win games 13-10, 16-13 … this defence is that good, they’re that fast, and I just don’t see how the Patriots score enough to beat them.

“The only way they lose to the Patriots … is that their quarterback holds them back, and their offence just isn’t good enough, and they just give the ball away.

“Because if they just protect the ball, I think you’re underestimating this defence in a serious way; I think it’s historically good.”

But it’s also going to be on New England’s defence — which finished the regular season with the fourth-best scoring defence — to make Houston signal-caller CJ Stroud uncomfortable.

Stroud fumbled five times and threw an interception in the win over Pittsburgh last week. He can be rattled, and on their home field, the Patriots’ defence will feed off the crowd.

CAN REVITALISED QB GET OVER PLAYOFF HUMP?

A penny for your thoughts Minnesota Vikings fans?

Ten months ago, you saw your franchise let QB Sam Darnold walk in free agency for nothing after he led the team to a 14-3 regular season record.

Darnold and the Vikings’ Super Bowl hopes fizzled out in the first week of the postseason. A couple of months later, Darnold was being introduced as the Seahawks’ new QB.

Of course, the reason Darnold got the chance to start in Minnesota was due to a season-ending injury to 2024 first round draft pick JJ McCarthy. Understandably, the Vikings put faith in the guy they drafted so high and let Darnold exit.

It’s a decision many Vikings fans disagreed with and seeing Darnold’s excellent form for the Seahawks this season, that hurt won’t go away until McCarthy can lead Minnesota back to the playoffs.

But, one team’s trash is another team’s treasure, and the Seahawks are reaping the rewards for adding Darnold in free agency.

Statistically, Darnold had a better 2024 season, but in both, he was able to lead his team to an impressive 14-3 mark.

It’s quite the achievement given his career was in limbo after the struggling Panthers didn’t renew his contract after the 2022 season.

In his first year as a Seahawk, Darnold threw for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdowns, establishing a terrific rapport with stud wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba.

There were a few nervous moments for Seahawks fans this week when Darnold was placed on the injury report for an oblique injury.

Despite the scare, Darnold will suit up for Seattle when this season’s NFC top seed takes on division rivals San Francisco.

Off a bye and with the 49ers losing another star player to injury in the Wild Card win over the Eagles, bookies are pretty confident the Seahawks will have too much firepower.

However, there’s still a duck that Darnold is yet to break, and it raises some concerns coming up against a 49ers side who boast plenty of playoff experience.

Darnold has yet to win a playoff game, while his counterpart Brock Purdy has won five.

Interestingly, it was the 49ers who revived Darnold’s career when they took a chance on him after an up-and-down stint in Carolina.

‘CARDS STACKED AGAINST’ BILLS AS QB URGED TO TURN INTO ‘FOOTBALL GOD’

It will be some sort of effort if the Buffalo Bills are able to go into Denver and eliminate the Broncos.

Many believe the Bills don’t have any excuses this season due to the sheer fact their playoff nemesis in recent years, the Kansas City Chiefs, aren’t around this postseason.

Other AFC powerhouses over the past few years in the Baltimore Ravens and the Cincinnati Bengals are also missing.

It leaves the playoff-hardened Bills up against several teams who haven’t had much recent success beyond the regular season.

However, while their usual foes might not be in their way of a maiden Super Bowl, it’s fair to say the Bills haven’t faced as much adversity as they have had to deal with this season.

Buffalo might be rueing the missed opportunity not to make a deal for Dolphins WR Jaylen Waddle at the trade deadline as their pass catching stocks are severely depleted.

Heading into the Denver clash on Sunday morning (AEDT), the Bills are down to just three healthy wide receivers against arguably the best defence in all of football.

We’ve seen QB Josh Allen turn into Superman and literally lift his team over the line more than once in the postseason, but given the mounting casualty ward, ESPN analyst and former Pro Bowl safety says the Bills signal maker might have to become a ‘Football God’.

“The cards are stacked against him. You’re playing against the No. 2 ranked defence with three wide receivers … You ain’t supposed to win … You’re playing against a roster that’s better than yours,” Clark exclaimed.

“This is the time where he gets to join the Montanas, the Bradys, the Mahomes’ as among the greatest that have ever played.

“It’s setting up for him to be everything that many people already believe that he could be.

“With the odds stacked against him, nobody is going to come in on Monday and say it’s his fault but if he wins, he is one step closer to immortality.”

CONCERNING RAMS REALITY IN BRUTAL WEATHER TWIST

After the incredible events that unfolded in the wildcard round, the Chicago Bears now have their sights set on a first NFC Championship Game appearance since 2011.

The Bears went in as home underdogs against the Packers last week, and they’re a four-and-a-half-point underdog this week as they prepare to host Matthew Stafford and the Rams.

But while Los Angeles will go into the game favoured, veteran quarterback Stafford historically doesn’t like playing outdoors in cold weather.

The 37-year-old, three weeks off turning 38, has only ever played home games in domed stadiums.

He played his first 12 seasons in Detroit, where the Lions play their home games in a roofed arena. He was traded to the Rams in 2021, where he’s played most games in the state-of-the-art, roofed SoFi Stadium.

But these are the numbers that really tell the story.

After last season’s divisional-round loss at the hands of Philadelphia, Stafford’s record in games where there is rain or snow slumped to 1-9.

Further, he has a 7-11 record when the temperature is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius).

Well, in less-than-ideal news for Stafford and Rams fans, the projected temperature in Chicago on Sunday night is 18 degrees Fahrenheit (-7.7 degrees Celsius), with a considerable chance of snowfall.

And in 12 career games at Chicago’s Soldier Field, Stafford has just five wins to his name, having thrown 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.

But Stafford, who also played several games at Green Bay’s freezing Lambeau Field while with the Lions, didn’t seem too disconcerted with the Chicago forecast this weekend.

“Yeah, I mean, I think each game is kind of unique, right? You can’t just bunch them all together,” Stafford said when asked about his cold-weather record.

“Played in Philly back in the day, there was six inches of snow on the ground. Played other games where it’s just cold and dry, you know? I mean, you’ve just got to go figure out what the elements are, how it’s going to affect the ball, (and) go play, you know?

“We had wind last week. What’s that like? How’s the ball moving when you throw it down the field? All those kinds of things. So, you just figure it out when you go.”

But even if the weather talk doesn’t make you question the Rams’ chances, they’ve got a defence that can be scored on.

You only have to look as far as their wildcard scare against the Carolina Panthers, who were considered big underdogs yet dropped 31 points on Sean McVay’s team, which has a strong pass-rush but a secondary that can be exploited.

Stafford’s late-game heroics proved the difference despite a sprained finger that cast doubt over his capabilities.

If Chicago’s Caleb Williams, DJ Moore, Colston Loveland and company can keep the good times rolling on offence — having scored 25 fourth-quarter points to devastate the Packers — the Bears could well be one win away from a Super Bowl berth this time next week.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/7f2fc925d301a2d2f4a6fb2610194969,N,,2026-01-17 17:59:27.150326

Seahawks coach ‘really optimistic’ QB Sam Darnold will play vs. 49ers

“Seahawks QB Sam Darnold hasn’t thrown a football since he hurt his oblique Thursday,” Schefter wrote on social media. “The Seahawks believe, but don’t know, that he will be OK to start tonight’s game vs. the 49ers. Backup QB Drew Lock took the reps the past two days and is ready if needed.”

Schefter later added that Darnold is “going to play,” but that it’s hard to know how much, if any, he will be limited.”

Can Seahawks beat 49ers if Drew Lock is QB instead of Sam Darnold?

Schefter also detailed what he knew about Darnold’s status Saturday on ESPN’s Postseason NFL Countdown, which you can watch at this link.

NFL Network’s Steve Wyche shared his own report from Seattle’s Lumen Field on Saturday morning, and while he had similar information that he relayed from a Seahawks official, Wyche’s report seemed more encouraging overall on Darnold’s status that Schefter’s initial post.

“(The Seahawks official) said first off, when Darnold sustained this injury, he said it was something he had never felt before, so they were very cautious. They basically shut him down,” Wyche said. “But they said not only are they optimistic, but that Darnold himself feels super confident that he will be able to get out and play. Now they’re going to work him out before kickoff, but again, all signs are indicating that Sam Darnold will be good to go for the Seahawks.”

Darnold, who is a Pro Bowler for the second straight season, started all 17 games for the Seahawks as they finished 14-3 to win the NFC West and take the top seed from the NFC into the playoffs.

The report said the Seahawks believe Darnold will start Saturday's NFC divisional-round game against the San Francisco 49ers (8 p.m. ET, FOX) but were not certain. Backup Drew Lock took first-team reps since Darnold's injury, per ESPN.

Darnold is listed as questionable on the official injury report. He helped the Seahawks to a 14-3 record and the No. 1 seed in the NFC.

Speaking to reporters Thursday, Darnold said there was ""close to zero percent"" chance he would not play against San Francisco.

""Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said. ""Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold finished the regular season with 25 touchdown passes, 14 interceptions and a 67.7 completion percentage while throwing for 4,048 yards. The matchup against the Niners would be his second playoff start and a chance for redemption after last year's calamitous wild-card performance as a member of the Minnesota Vikings against the Los Angeles Rams.

Yeah, no, I think the 49ers wouldn’t have progressed into doing these things if the bones, the ligaments, weren’t healed.
So the risk would more be, you know, number one, could there be another muscle injury and injury somewhere else?
It’s a structural injury; it’s not a pain tolerance issue.
It’s, it’s, it’s one of those things where you could say that, well, because the San Francisco 49ers team starts with an S and then they’re the most injured team that starts with an S. Is there actually a connection?","The story of the 2025 San Francisco 49ers is still being written. Saturday night, the 49ers will take on the Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field with an NFC Championship game berth on the line. There is no two ways around it. This season will be remembered for the injuries to impactful players like Nick Bosa, Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Fred Warner, Mykel Williams, and a laundry list of others during the season.

Is there any rhyme or reason to the injuries? Is it simply bad luck? Does the team practice too hard? Is the training staff doing their job? With no clear answer to any of these questions, a new conspiracy theory about electrical substations near the practice facility has taken on a life of its own.

I had a chance to sit down with Dr. Nirav Pandya of 95.7 The Game to discuss the injuries to the players and whether there is any data suggesting the substation is contributing to the 49ers’ injuries and recovery time.

So let’s start with the obvious one, Fred Warner, who is not gonna play but was running around in practice.

Doc, tell me how surprised you are by his timeline because his ankle was facing the other way 90 days ago, against the Tampa Bay Bucs. How is this possible? Is there a hyperbolic chamber, or is this just somebody who is built a little bit differently?

Yeah, no, that’s a great question. You know, I think for a lot of people, you get to about, you know, around three months, we know pretty predictably.

The bone’s gonna be healed if there’s a ligament injury that’s gonna be healed. But how quickly athletes can get their strength, their mobility, how quickly that comes back, that varies a lot. So for most people who aren’t rehabbing, every day can be a year-long process. For a lot of athletes, it can be up to six months, but for whatever reason, just the type of athlete he is, the way he is been attacking his rehab, he’s definitely progressed, um, to where he is doing stuff out on the football field.

I would’ve expected when you saw that injury, probably more like four to five months. But clearly his body has responded really well, has been able to progress to this level. And now the real question is, is there enough time to get him ready for potentially a game next week? ‘Cause obviously now the reports are, he is not playing this weekend.

Now, the question that I think I have, and a lot of people have, is whether there is any sort of risk for further re-injury, or possibly something down the line that would complicate his future as a 49er? Like rushing back a little bit too early. Is it something that possibly he’s pushing himself a little too hard, I guess?

Yeah, no, I think the 49ers wouldn’t have progressed into doing these things if the bones, the ligaments, weren’t healed. Right. So I think there’s a pretty low likelihood that you can re-injure what was broken or injured before. The larger question is, is there any compensation that’s still there?

Is there still some muscle weakness thing that just takes time to get, you know, better? So the risk would more be, you know, number one, could there be another muscle injury and injury somewhere else? Just ‘cause he’s compensating, ‘cause he is not running the way that he does. Or number two, which is sometimes the more subtle thing, is you can run on the practice field, you can do all those drills, but can you have a 300-pound lineman land on it?

And I think that’s the question. It’s really hard to know because there’s no way to test that. You can’t have someone land on you in practice, be like, oh, it held up. So I think the two major considerations are is the muscle strength and flexibility there that he can be the Fred Warner, who he was.

How he was running and jumping before the injury? And then is it ready to withstand the contact that you need to play 70 80 plays in the intensity of a playoff game?

I’m picking the 49ers to move on to the NC Championship game. Do you expect him to be on some sort of snap count, or is this just, if he’s ready to go, he has to be able to play all the snaps?

I think there probably will be some sort of snap count. I mean, you take it just from a basic perspective. If you haven’t done physical activity in three to four months, even if you’re just like a regular athlete, right?

You just work out and things like that, and suddenly someone’s like, okay, now we’re gonna have you from like you’ve run a quarter mile, and now you’re gonna go run a marathon in five days. You know, like I think your body’s just not gonna perform at the level that you need, and you’re at risk for injury.

And I think the bigger consideration is that. You know, if he gets to play 70, play 80, you know, is he gonna be effective? Are there other players on the team? Because they’re more conditioned, who can be out there? So I think most likely there’ll be a restriction, but you know, honestly, a lot of it’s gonna be probably how he’s looking out there and what he’s telling the team.

Obviously, George Kittle’s devastating Achilles injury is concerning based on how late in the season it occurred and his age. What is his timeline, and when can we expect his explosiveness to return?

If you look at NFL players who have an Achilles even, and we’ll talk about Aaron Rodgers and Cam Akers, et cetera, you know, most people usually land nine to 12 months after surgery. Like, you know, you’re basically sewing the tendon together, and then you’re basically trying to get back your speed and explosiveness, so that takes a long time, especially for a football player.

The good news for Kittle is that if you look at the position that actually returns to play the best, it’s tight ends. U For me, my theory is that tight ends are probably some of the best athletes, and the better athlete you are before your injury, the more likely you’re gonna be able to kind of get back.

If he does get back, and there’s a high likelihood you will see that drop in the first season, but then in the second season, you see the statistics kind of climb back up. Now the key factor is obviously age. And you know, if you’re 22 or 23 and you tear your Achilles, the quality of that tissue theoretically is gonna be better than someone a little bit older.

Also, your body’s ability to respond to this big injury is a lot better, but with some of the newer techniques, where they’re basically fixing it, using smaller incisions and using things that are a little bit stronger. You can actually start doing the rehab a lot earlier, and that’s where you’re starting to see some players push the envelope of, hey, maybe month six.

Assuming he’s got a regular, you know, standard Achilles. Probably around nine months. So I think the possibility of him playing next year, barring some sort of crazy setbacks, is pretty high.

Now, that’s the easy way to pivot into Ricky Pearsall, who is dealing with a PCL injury. This is the second one. And there is this sentiment out there that Ricky should be pushing through this injury. Is it a matter of toughness? Doc, I’m not a doctor myself, but from the information that I’ve gathered about PCL injuries, it’s about stability, and it’s about him being able to push off, and it’s about him being able to break in and out of routes.

Is that really what’s going on? Or is this something where he can’t just say, Hey, listen, I’m gonna push through this if his knee can just give out at any time because of the ligament itself?

Yeah, no, absolutely. I think that, you know, the 49ers keep saying this is a PCL injury. They’re not saying it’s knee inflammation, they’re not saying other stuff.

The PCL basically gives you stability to your knee, and if you don’t have a good PCL, imagine your shin bone just shifting back relative to your thigh bone. So you know, someone can’t will themselves to basically, oh, I’m gonna look really push through my knee being unstable. It’s hard to even wear a brace when you’re playing at that level.

Now, for a lineman, maybe they can push through it, but you have to cut, you have to pivot, you have to do agility, so if that PCL is constantly getting aggravated, it’s just hard to play. And remember, McCaffrey had that at the end of last season. And it, you know, obviously, he recovered through the offseason.

So this is absolutely, assuming this is just a PCL injury, you can’t push through it. It’s just really, really difficult because your knee’s not stable. So once again, everyone’s saying, oh, he just needs to kind of go through this and do all this other stuff.

It’s a structural injury; it’s not a pain tolerance issue.

I would be remiss in my duties without asking you. You’re a doctor, a medical doctor, someone who has degrees.

I’m just a podcaster. I’ve been completely dismissing this notion because it sounds like nonsense, and it sounds like tinfoil hat stuff. Please, please shed some light on this. And please, please, can we put to rest the whole electrical substation thing that is near the practice field?

Yeah, so a couple of things.

Number one is that there’s no real-life data that says that, you know, these kinds of electrical magnetic fields have a direct impact on. Collagen or tendon healing or et cetera in actual people, right? So maybe there’s something in a lab where you’re like exposing, you know, rats or other things to like tons of this radiation.

But in real life, there’s no study that shows this. Number two, the 49ers have practiced at that area since 1988. So they would be the most often injured team since 1988. So number two, number three. There are other athletic facilities across the world that have electrical substations near them that probably are exposed to the same amount of whatever they’re talking about. So I think that what you have to look at, when you look at 49ers injuries, you gotta look at the factors we know you’ve gotta look at prior injury, history, travel, playing on turf, you know, players playing out of position, players playing more snaps and other things who, strength conditioning, coaching, all these other things.

The electrical substation. It’s, it’s, it’s one of those things where you could say that, well, because the San Francisco 49ers team starts with an S and then they’re the most injured team that starts with an S. Is there actually a connection? Can that cause injuries, or is it just one of those things that happens to happen?

So I’m all for looking for data and studying it more and seeing if there’s an impact. But right now, it just isn’t there.

Darnold is dealing with a new oblique injury, putting his playing status in doubt.

Seattle is expected to announce the team’s inactives for today’s game at 6:30 p.m. Eastern, about one hour and thirty minutes before kickoff. What should fans be looking for in the report?

It would be a surprise if Darnold is not active, but Jalen Milroe (who has traditionally been the emergency quarterback on gamedays) also being active could be a sign that the Seahawks have some concerns about the Pro Bowl quarterback’s status.

Darnold has estimated that his chances of not playing tonight is close to 0%. Yet, the Seahawks quarterback will need to go through a series of pregame tests to prove his health.

Assuming there is no setback, Darnold is expected to play tonight against the 49ers. As a reminder, the NFL no longer has the probable injury designation, which sounds like what Darnold would have been listed as if this were an option. The bigger question is how effective Darnold will be while battling the injury.

Here’s what you need to know about Darnold’s injury.

Sam Darnold on Playing in 49ers vs. Seahawks Game: ‘We’ll Be Ready to Go’

Darnold has attempted to downplay the severity of his oblique issue, but it is less than ideal for a team’s starting quarterback to sustain an injury with Seattle just one game away from the NFC Championship. Similar to Week 18, fans can expect a heavy dose of the Seahawks’ rushing attack against the Niners.

“I feel good,” Darnold remarked on his injury during a January 15, 2026, media session, per Seahawks.com. “In routes on air, I just felt a little something in my oblique. I just didn’t want to push it. It wasn’t the day to push it, so that was it. I came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

“… It’s fun. We’ll attack it the next couple of days and be ready to go on Saturday… It is what it is. I felt it on a throw, but we’ll be ready to go.”

Seahawks HC Mike Macdonald on Sam Darnold’s Status: ‘Really Optimistic He’s Going to be Able to Play’

If for some reason Darnold is unable to play, the Seahawks are expected to turn to backup quarterback Drew Lock. Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald sounded optimistic about Darnold’s status while also leaving the door open for Lock playing if the quarterback does not feel himself.

“Really optimistic he’s going to be able to play and right now we’re going through all the protocol,” Macdonald said of Darnold during a January 16, press conference, per Seahawks.com’s Ari Horton. “One, just out of caution to make sure we’re ready to go and we’ll test it out tomorrow to kind of make the final decision.

“But again, we’re optimistic he’s going to play and if he doesn’t or at some point he doesn’t, then Drew’s ready to go and that’s why Drew’s here. He’s doing a great job. So, we’re rolling.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254546854-e1768653388290.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-17 16:01:37.790796

According to a former Bill who will be on the opposite sideline Saturday, that shouldn't be a major problem, considering Buffalo's utilization of the position.

""They got a lot of guys banged up, but they don't really throw it to the receivers anyway,"" Denver Broncos wideout Elijah Moore said, per The Denver Gazette's Chris Tomasson.

Moore notably appeared in nine games for the Bills earlier this season, logging nine catches for 112 yards without a touchdown before being released on Nov. 26. He caught on with the Broncos, who elevated him from the practice squad ahead of Denver's Divisional Round matchup against Buffalo.

Sour grapes from Moore or not, Buffalo does indeed find ways to do damage in plenty of other ways outside peppering wideouts with targets -- whether that's letting reigning MVP Josh Allen rumble, getting the ball to a diverse stable of running backs or exposing defenses through tight ends.

While short-yardage maestro Khalil Shakir has nearly double the reception total of any other Bills player with 72, he's one of only two wide receivers among Buffalo's top six reception-getters. The other WR in that collection is Keon Coleman, who has 38 catches and has been a healthy scratch for multiple games this season. Tight ends Dalton Kincaid (39 receptions) and Dawson Knox (36) and running backs James Cook (33) and Ty Johnson (24) round out the rest of the group.

Given the Bills' injury luck of late, they'll likely need to continue to use alternate sources of production against Denver's defense, which ranks third in points allowed.

Wide receiver Josh Palmer, seventh on the team in receptions this season with 22, went on injured reserve before Buffalo's wild-card win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, a game in which Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers both suffered torn ACLs. That leaves the Bills with Shakir, Coleman, Brandin Cooks (signed Nov. 25), Curtis Samuel (activated off IR on Friday) and Mecole Hardman (elevated from the practice squad) at wideout.

We'll see shortly just how often Allen looks the way of his wide receivers against Denver -- and whether or not the Bills wideouts will have any rebuttal to Moore's observation in the form of some big-time contributions.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/rx0uppyjzmtijafyk6to,N,,2026-01-17 12:01:46.520603

The Seahawks listed Darnold as questionable Thursday after he left practice earlier in the day when he felt something in his left side.
He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.
""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said.
This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017.","RENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that he is ""really optimistic"" Sam Darnold will play Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers despite a new oblique injury, echoing what the Pro Bowl quarterback said a day earlier.

But in his final comments before the Seahawks' divisional round playoff game against their NFC West rival, Macdonald left open the possibility that the injury could take a turn either before or after the 8 p.m. ET kickoff.

The Seahawks listed Darnold as questionable Thursday after he left practice earlier in the day when he felt something in his left side. He told reporters roughly two hours later that he expects to play.

""Talking about Sam, I heard what he said yesterday to you guys; I see it the same way,"" Macdonald told reporters Friday. ""We're listing him as questionable. Really optimistic he's going to be able to play. Right now we're going through all the protocol ... just out of caution to make sure we're ready to go. We'll test it out tomorrow and kind of make the final decision, but again, we're optimistic he's going to play.

""If he doesn't, or at some point he doesn't, then [Drew Lock is] ready to go, and that's why Drew's here. He's doing a great job.""

The Seahawks held a walk-through Friday, as they typically do the day before a game. Macdonald gave a nonanswer when asked whether Darnold threw during the session. While the coach was speaking to reporters on the sideline of the team's indoor practice facility, Darnold and Lock were walking through plays on the field with wide receiver Jake Bobo. Darnold was seen making only light, underhanded tosses.

Macdonald was asked whether Darnold was better physically Friday.

""He says he feels better,"" Macdonald said. ""But you talked to him. He's confident that he's going to be able to play. We feel the same way.""

Is there any thought that he could be at all limited Saturday?

""Well, yeah, it's a possibility,"" Macdonald said. ""I think right now he's confident that he's going to be able to go do his thing at 100 percent. We are too. But with these things, something could change between now and then or something could happen in-game. So we kind of just have to roll with it.""

Lock, a seventh-year veteran with a 10-18 record in 28 career starts, is Darnold's backup. Jalen Milroe, a rookie third-round pick, is Seattle's QB3. Milroe has been inactive as a healthy scratch for the past 12 games, though he has continued to suit up as the emergency third quarterback.

Darnold told reporters that he ""felt a little something"" in the oblique on his left side Thursday while throwing during a routes-on-air period and that he left practice as a precautionary measure. Seattle listed him as a limited participant that day.

""Just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said. ""Wasn't the day to push it. So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play Saturday.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Darnold said he has never dealt with an oblique injury and that he will get more treatment between now and game time, adding: ""We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.""

Aside from Darnold's questionable status, the only other Seattle players with game designations are tight end Elijah Arroyo, linebacker Chazz Surratt and tackle Josh Jones, all backups who have been ruled out. Left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant will return after missing three and two games, respectively.

Cross was limited Wednesday because of a new knee injury but returned to full participation Thursday.

""Just kind of got tangled up a little bit in practice,"" Macdonald said of Cross. ""So we're working through it. He's good to go. It's more of a precautionary thing than anything.""

Darnold, signed by the Seahawks in March after they traded Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders, is set to make the second playoff start of his eight-year NFL career. He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.

""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said. ""... We've got such great guys in that locker room, mature leaders at every position group. So everyone's just ready to go, attacking the week, per usual, and getting ready to go up against a really good 49ers team that's been rolling, and we're excited to go up against them.""

Darnold and the Seahawks beat the 49ers in Week 18 at Levi's Stadium to win the NFC West and secure the conference's top seed. With that win, Seattle finished the regular season 14-3, the same record Darnold posted last year with the Minnesota Vikings on his way to his first career Pro Bowl selection.

He made the Pro Bowl again this year after completing 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdowns while also committing an NFL-high 20 turnovers.

Darnold lost his playoff debut last January when he was sacked nine times in a wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He said the Week 18 win over the 49ers felt like a playoff game because of everything that was at stake and how loud the crowd was at Levi's Stadium.

The Seahawks will have home-field advantage in the rematch.

""Being able to use cadence is going to be huge, and then having our 12s there making noise when they're on offense is crucial,"" Darnold said. ""So it's going to be an awesome atmosphere and something we're all looking forward to.""

This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017. The Seahawks' only other home playoff game since then was at the end of the 2020 COVID-19 season, when they lost in the wild-card round to the Rams in an empty stadium.

""We know Lumen's going to be rocking,"" Darnold said. ""It's an important game. We don't get it twisted at all. We understand the implications of the game. The playoffs, it's awesome to be playing in games like this, especially in January. But yeah, we're treating this week as another week, and we're excited about it.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0116%2Fr1601609_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 16:01:40.944100

Fred Warner returned to practice in a limited capacity this week after fracturing and dislocating his ankle on Oct. 12. The four-time All-Pro linebacker logged limited sessions Tuesday and Wednesday, sparking optimism about him potentially returning to the lineup against the rival Seattle Seahawks.

It's not quite time for Warner yet, however, as he missed practice Thursday while the 49ers ruled him out for Saturday's Divisional Round game. Shanahan is confident next week will be a different story, should the 49ers advance.

""Yes, I do feel confident in that,"" Shanahan said of Warner's return before the NFC Championship Game. ""We'll see if it works out.""

To get Warner back, the 49ers must power past the Seahawks, who beat them 13-3 in a Week 18 game that determined the NFC West champion and the NFC's No. 1 seed. It'll be a daunting challenge, especially with two-time All-Pro tight end George Kittle out for the season with a torn Achilles.

“It’s great to see him in full practice,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said.","LAS VEGAS — Anthony Stolarz was in good spirits Friday afternoon.

His New York Mets had just swiped Bo Bichette away from the Toronto Blue Jays. He had also practised in full with the Maple Leafs for the first time since he was mysteriously injured in November.

Speaking after practice, Stolarz revealed only that it was a “nerve issue” that knocked him out of a Nov. 11 game against the Boston Bruins and has ultimately kept him out for the last 30 games.

He didn’t elaborate on the precise nature of the injury, which the team has not disclosed.

“I had to kind of let it settle down a little bit,” Stolarz said. “It’s not like a bruise where it goes away. It was just something that I just kind of had to let heal on its own. And, you know, it just took a little while.”

Stolarz figured he would need a few additional practices before he was ready to return to game action.

The challenge for him and the Leafs will be finding the space for those practices. The team has hardly practised of late amid an Olympic-condensed schedule, which has it, like every other team, playing every other night.

Until Friday, Stolarz had been limited to joining the group at morning skates.

“It’s great to see him in full practice,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said. “This road trip, I think, was really important, that he came on the trip and (was) around the guys and getting acclimated again and getting some practice time at the same time.”

Joseph Woll didn’t practise Friday, which meant Stolarz didn’t have to share a net with another goaltender. He could get in a full practise’s worth of shots, in other words.

Woll and Dennis Hildeby have shared the Leafs’ crease in Stolarz’s absence.

“I think they held the fort,” Berube said.

William Nylander, meanwhile, didn’t practise Friday. Berube said he was “doubtful” to play Saturday against the Jets in Winnipeg and was still being evaluated for the injury that caused him to leave Thursday’s overtime loss to the Vegas Golden Knights after only four shifts.

The Leafs’ leading scorer aggravated the undisclosed injury that kept him out for six games recently. Thursday was only his fourth game back.

Asked if Nylander’s absence would be short or long term, Berube said, “Right now I can’t answer that. With the last one, I thought it would be quicker and then obviously (it) wasn’t. We’ll just see how he feels here going forward.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/05/08121505/USATSI_25992435-scaled-e1746721071992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-17 11:03:19.439025

Ahead of the team's divisional round game at the Denver Broncos, the team activated defensive tackle Ed Oliver and wide receiver Curtis Samuel from injured reserve Friday. Oliver and Samuel had their practice windows opened this week.

Wide receiver Mecole Hardman Jr. and running Frank Gore Jr. were elevated from the practice squad. Running back Ty Johnson, who missed last week's game, is questionable with an ankle injury.

There were already previously two open spots on the roster as receivers Tyrell Shavers and Gabe Davis were placed on injured reserve with torn ACLs suffered in last weekend's win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Samuel (elbow) and Hardman give the team five receivers for Saturday's game, along with Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks and Keon Coleman.

Oliver's return brings a boost to a defensive tackle group that has dealt with a variety of injuries this season. The seven-year veteran was placed on IR on Oct. 28 with a left biceps tear that required surgery, then suffered meniscus damage while rehabbing that led to a minimally invasive procedure Dec. 29.

""It's just a long time coming,"" Oliver said of his return to practice. ""I kind of just stayed the course even when the tunnel seemed dark and the light at the end of the tunnel seemed so far away.""

In three games played this season -- he also missed time with an ankle injury early in the year -- Oliver had three sacks and a forced fumble.

""[Oliver] loves to play,"" coach Sean McDermott said Thursday. ""There's a process that leads to playing, and he's worked hard at it. Had the setback, obviously, a few weeks ago with the knee, but he's attacked it head-on, and our medical staff the same way. So, both have done a good job.""

Bills quarterback depth chart","Josh Allen showed up on the injury report with three different issues this week. He's going to show up for his 137th consecutive start on Saturday.

The Buffalo Bills quarterback was listed with knee, foot and right finger injuries, was a limited participant during Tuesday’s walk-through, then practiced fully Wednesday and Thursday. Allen carries no injury designation into Sunday’s 4:30 p.m. ET divisional round matchup against the Denver Broncos.

The foot injury dates back to Week 16 against Cleveland, when Allen underwent postgame X-rays that were negative. He aggravated the issue a week later against Philadelphia but continued to play and has not missed any meaningful time since.

The knee and finger injuries are more recent, both occurring during Buffalo’s wild-card win over Jacksonville. Allen was briefly evaluated for a concussion after a first-quarter hit, later jammed his throwing hand when it struck the helmet of guard O’Cyrus Torrence on a second-quarter follow-through, and tweaked his left knee on a 2-yard touchdown run. None of the injuries forced him to miss a snap.

Saturday will mark Allen's 137 consecutive start, made up of 122 regular season and 15 playoff games, the longest active streak among NFL quarterbacks.

The Super Bowl matchup will take shape Sunday, Jan. 25, when both conference championship games will be played.","Conference championship game berths are up for grabs in the NFL playoffs.

The postseason resumes Saturday with a pair of Divisional Round showdowns – one in the AFC and one in the NFC. And both matchups feature a No. 6-seeded wild card team visiting a No. 1 seed coming off of a first-round bye.

The two-game slate kicks off in the Mile High City as the No. 1 Denver Broncos welcome in the No. 6 Buffalo Bills. This is the second straight postseason that Buffalo and Denver have met – the Bills cruised past the Broncos 31-7 at home in last year’s Wild Card Round.

Josh Allen and the Bills are in the Divisional Round for the sixth straight year as they look to make back-to-back conference championship games. Allen engineered two separate go-ahead touchdown drives in the fourth quarter to lead the Bills past the No. 3 Jacksonville Jaguars 27-24 in the Wild Card Round.

Buffalo, in search of its first-ever Super Bowl title, now visits a Broncos team that has lost just once at home this season and is powered by an elite defense. Denver led the league in sacks with 68 – 11 more than the next-closest team – while ranking second in yards against and third in points against.

Sean Payton's Broncos are seeking the franchise’s first playoff victory since its 2015 championship season.

The action then shifts to Seattle for a NFC West clash between the No. 6 San Francisco 49ers and No. 1 Seattle Seahawks. The already injury-riddled 49ers lost star tight end George Kittle to a torn Achilles in the Wild Card Round, but they still managed to upset the defending Super Bowl champion No. 3 Philadelphia Eagles 23-19. Brock Purdy quarterbacked a go-ahead touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter before San Francisco’s defense came up with a game-sealing stop.

San Francisco now faces Seattle for the second time in three weeks and the third time this season. While the 49ers beat the Seahawks on the road in Week 1, Seattle got revenge in Week 18 with a 13-3 win to capture the division crown and the No. 1 seed. The Seahawks’ top-ranked scoring defense limited the 49ers to 173 yards of total offense and held them to a combined 2-for-11 on third and fourth downs in the second meeting.

But whether Sam Darnold will have any limitations is the biggest storyline entering the playoff matchup, and that's assuming he actually makes the start. The Seahawks quarterback is listed as questionable after appearing on the injury report this week with an oblique injury.

Seattle is looking to make the conference title game for the first time since the 2014 season, while San Francisco is on the brink of its fourth appearance in five years.

Macdonald said that Darnold feels better a day removed from pain popping up and explained that he will test things out Saturday before a final decision is made.

Macdonald didn't disclose whether Darnold threw during the team's walkthrough Friday.

The second-year Seahawks coach was asked if the oblique issue could limit the way Darnold plays.

""Well, yeah, that's a possibility,"" Macdonald said. ""I think right now he's confident that he's going to be able to go do his thing at 100%, and we are, too. But with these things, something could change between now and then or something could happen in-game. So kind of just have to roll with it.""

Macdonald clarified, however, that the Seahawks won't put Darnold out there if he's not fit to do his job.

Drew Lock is Seattle's backup. He's appeared in five games this season but attempted only three passes. A 2019 second-round pick out of Missouri, Lock has started 28 games in his career, including two for the Seahawks during the 2023 season.

Darnold told reporters he felt something in his oblique early in practice Thursday when throwing routes.

""Just didn't want to push it. It wasn't the day to push it,"" Darnold said, per Gregg Bell of The Tacoma News Tribune. ""So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab. I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold said he never had oblique issues before. He put a positive spin on the midweek hurdle that he's eager to clear ahead of the biggest game of his career.

""It's fun. We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday,"" Darnold added.

Darnold, a righty, explained at the time that he experienced the discomfort on his left side on a throw.

He was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers this weekend at Seattle's Lumen Field.

""Very low percentage,"" he said Thursday. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Darnold played all 17 games in the regular season, his first with the Seahawks after signing a three-year deal reportedly worth $100.5 million.

He picked up where he left off in Minnesota last season when he led the Vikings to a 14-3 record as a replacement for the injured J.J. McCarthy.

This time around, he became the fourth quarterback in NFL history to guide two different teams to 14-win seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Jared Goff.

Despite a league-high 20 turnovers, Darnold made the Pro Bowl. With a win over San Francisco in the regular-season finale, Seattle earned the division title and the NFC's No. 1 seed, which came with a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.

Darnold is now slated to face the resilient 49ers again. He's hoping for playoff redemption after throwing a pick, losing a fumble and being sacked nine times during the Vikings' 27-9 wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams last season.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/beCv9xn2YO20orJLfepxYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f83c21d0-e5bf-11f0-b2bf-afb15505eb98,N,,2026-01-17 06:58:22.402999

The battle for the Lombardi Trophy is as wide open as it has been in years, and nobody would be surprised by any of the remaining eight sides going on to taste glory in Santa Clara next month.

But who will emerge victorious this weekend as the number one seeds enter the fray?

We have our panel of experts to try to pick the winners, including Radio 5 Live's Rob Staton, BBC Sport journalist Paul Higham and our special guest, former NFL coach Phil McGeoghan.

You can also pick your winners below.

Rob Staton: Bills

I've just got a sense that Josh Allen might will his team to victory again. This is his big opportunity this season so can he take advantage?

Phil McGeoghan: Broncos

My wife's from Buffalo and we met when I was coaching for the Buffalo Bills, but I've spent most of my career in Bronco land. So I'm not going to say it out loud. She gets a little fired up, but that's who we're going for in this house (Broncos), but that's only in the basement. So I'm subterranean Phil. I can't wait to see what happens, but I'm going to be doing it well below ground, cheering as quietly as possible for the Denver Broncos.

Mike White: Broncos

The way this season has unfolded it seems like the door has been left wide open on the AFC side for Josh Allen and the Bills to finally end their wait not only for a return to the big game but also for their first Lombardi success.

However, I'm finding it hard to look past the Broncos, who had the advantage of the bye week, have a dominant defence, know about winning games in comeback mode and aren't banged up the way Buffalo are - especially at the wide receiver position. I'll take Denver to progress but in a close one by three points or less.

Paul Higham: Broncos

Denver won the last Super Bowl at Levi's Stadium (the venue for Super Bowl 60 next month) a decade ago, which was also their last play-off win - while it's the only stadium in the league Josh Allen has yet to play in, so there's a hint of destiny about both sides.

Allen got his first road play-off win last week, Buffalo's first since 1993, but he got beat up in Jacksonville, has a depleted bunch of receivers, and if James Cook again struggles against Denver's rush defence even Superman himself may just have too much to overcome by himself.

And ironically it could be the legs of Bo Nix that do more damage, as Buffalo gave up the most yards per carry to opposing quarterbacks this season. It'll be close but Denver went 11-2 in one-score games this season.

Rob Staton: Seahawks

You've got to give Kyle Shanahan and his team a tonne of credit for what they've achieved amid an injury crisis, but realistically this might be a game too far.

Mike White: Seahawks

This feels like a game too far for the Niners against a highly talented Seattle, who boast a stingy defence whilst San Fran are battered, bruised and without big-name, big-game players such as George Kittle, Nick Bosa and Fred Warner.

Sam Darnold has an injury designation going into this but is expected to play. Once upon a time, that would've been a boost for any of Seattle's opponents, but the post-New York Jets Darnold is a different proposition and the one-time former 49ers back-up will lead them to the NFC title game. Seahawks by 10.

Phil McGeoghan: Niners

Very interesting game. The 49ers are decimated by injuries, but the best predictor of future events is past events. They've found a way to overcome injuries for quite some time so that means culture has now taken over and it's a winning culture. You don't forget how to win.

Paul Higham: Seahawks

Sam Darnold led the league in turnovers and has an injury, so Seattle will hope to win this with their improving ground game, which averaged 140 yards a game over the last eight weeks, against San Francisco's ailing rush defence heading in the opposite direction.

The pass rush is another decider - the Niners ranked last in sacks and second-last in quarterback pressures as their pass rush unit is basically all out injured. Seattle, meanwhile, get consistent pressure and dominated two weeks ago having upped their blitz rate.

Throw in the famous Seahawks 12s and a flight back across the country for the 49ers from Philadelphia on a short week and there's just too much in the home side's favour.

Rob Staton: Patriots

The Texans' defence is legit and can win them any game, but Drake Maye's mobility and playmaking is the perfect counter. Pats get it done.

Phil McGeoghan: Patriots

The Texans have changed games, ruined games, so you must have a protection plan for the Houston Texans. They will ruin your weekend. In my mind, though, just looking at the way Drake Maye is playing at this particular point and the way that they're just kind of moving, I think it's the Patriots, right?

I am from Boston. So I think if I go home and I don't say the Patriots, I might be in the 'harbour' or something. So I will say I think it's going to be the Patriots.

Mike White: Patriots

This is likely to be a tight affair with very few points in the game. The Patriots offence matching up against that forceful Texans defence feels like the match-up to keep an eye on. And with CJ Stroud set to be without his best receiving option in Nico Collins (concussion), Houston's chances just reduced considerably.

Mike Vrabel's already a strong coach of the season candidate, and returning the Patriots back to their once-familiar surroundings of the AFC Championship game will only enhance those credentials. Pats take it by six.

Paul Higham: Texans

Houston's first road play-off win last week was a statement win for this terrifying defence, but the Pats have won a league-leading eight straight Divisional games.

Drake Maye's mobility can slow Houston down but I just can't see him doing enough to keep them off his case enough throughout the game. As long as CJ Stroud cleans things up and doesn't have another five fumbles, I'm backing the Texans to make their first AFC Championship game.

Rob Staton: Bears

There's just a bit of magic about the Bears at the moment and the Rams have not played their best football in weeks. Soldier Field will be rocking and I think Chicago make it to the NFC Championship.

Mike White: Rams

The Chicago Bears' renaissance has been nothing short of remarkable and Ben Johnson deserves a tonne of credit for it. As does Caleb Williams who's defied a lot of the (justified) rookie season critics in his second year.

That said, this is a Rams team that many have been crowning as the champions-elect for weeks and not without good reason. Whether it's offensive guru Sean McVay, the experience and MVP qualities of Matthew Stafford or the magic hands of Puka Nacua, they have all the ingredients for another Super Bowl run. The predicted Arctic conditions might be somewhat of a leveller but still taking the Rams by four.

Phil McGeoghan: Rams

I am such a fan of Sean McVay. His mind, the way it works, his gameplans, also his humour. His willingness to be open. All these things matter in football.

Because of his personality and how he is with the players, he admires his guys. He doesn't pretend Davante Adams isn't one of the best to ever do it. He doesn't pretend he's not in awe of Matthew Stafford when he makes one of his no-look throws. That stuff really builds culture.

That's why they've won Super Bowls, that's why people don't leave there unless they get promoted and get better jobs, because McVay is such a good man and he's a brilliant, brilliant offensive mind so I'm picking Sean McVay and the Rams for those reasons.

Paul Higham: Bears

Only four quarterbacks have thrown for 140-plus yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter of a play-off win in the past 20 years - and two of them collide at Soldier Field.

So this genuinely could be decided by whether Matthew Stafford or Caleb Williams, who have combined for 29 fourth-quarter touchdowns this season, has the ball last after both earned thrilling late wins last week.

Williams has been doing it all season though, and watching last week even when they were well behind it seemed inevitable the Bears would come roaring back to win. It just gives you a funny feeling that they've got something special rolling in the Windy City.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/e901/live/00933e60-f284-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png,N,,2026-01-17 07:57:48.583913

The Bears will have two players questionable for Sunday’s game, including wide receiver Rome Odunze, who practiced in full Friday but is still being impacted by a foot injury that’s been nagging him in the second half of the season.

Odunze, who sat out for more than a month with the injury, was targeted six times in Sunday’s game against the Packers, with two receptions for 44 yards, including a clutch fourth-down reception that kept the Bears alive in the game.

The Bears also said that linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin will be questionable after he was limited Friday with a back injury.

The expectation is that Michael Penix Jr., whom the Falcons drafted at No.
A recent development that could benefit Penix's progress toward that position is the hiring of Ryan as the Falcons' president of football.
Then, last season, Penix went 3-6 before sustaining a season-ending knee injury in the Falcons' Week 11 overtime loss to the Carolina Panthers.
""It's working together to figure out the right plan for Mike and his rehab,"" Ryan said.","FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — If anyone knows what it's like to be the Atlanta Falcons' franchise quarterback, it's Matt Ryan.

The Falcons drafted Ryan with the No. 3 overall pick in 2008, and he went on to be the Falcons' starter for 14 seasons. Ryan ultimately led Atlanta to six playoff appearances, including a Super Bowl run in 2016. After he retired, the Falcons inducted Ryan into their Ring of Honor because of the player he was on and off the field throughout his tenure.

The expectation is that Michael Penix Jr., whom the Falcons drafted at No. 8 overall in 2024, will become a franchise player in his own right and provide stability at quarterback. Owner Arthur Blank reiterated as much just last week.

A recent development that could benefit Penix's progress toward that position is the hiring of Ryan as the Falcons' president of football.

""I'm not hired to come in and be the quarterback coach, but I love Mike and have gotten to know him through the last couple of years here in Atlanta,"" Ryan said. ""So, anything he needs from me, I'm a part of this organization and happy to help in any way that I can.""

Ryan became a mentor of sorts for Penix last year, after then-Falcons head coach Raheem Morris made it clear Penix would be Atlanta's starting quarterback in 2025. That proclamation came after Penix started the Falcons' final three games of 2024.

Originally, Penix wasn't supposed to start at all as a rookie. Instead, Kirk Cousins was signed as a free agent that offseason to be the Falcons' starter. The plan was for Cousins to lead for at least a season or two, while Penix learned the ropes behind the veteran. However, in Week 16, the Falcons benched Cousins due to performance issues and accelerated Penix's timeline.

Penix went 1-2 in those three starts, completing 58% of his passes for an average of 245.7 yards per game. He threw three interceptions and three touchdowns.

Then, last season, Penix went 3-6 before sustaining a season-ending knee injury in the Falcons' Week 11 overtime loss to the Carolina Panthers. He underwent surgery for a partially torn ACL in late November. Blank said it went well.

""The surgeon felt 1,000% secure in the medical procedure they went through, and they really felt his knee was going to be even better than it was before,"" Blank said. ""He's on a successful rehab program. He's back in Atlanta. He's committed mentally. Physically, he feels good.""

Prior to his injury, Penix completed 60.1% of his passes for an average of 220.2 yards per game. He threw three interceptions and nine touchdowns.

""The next thing in front of Mike is the rehab process, and he's already at it,"" Ryan said. ""I was in here (Monday) morning … and he was in there getting after his rehab. So, he's in a good mental space right there and is doing exactly what he should be doing right now.""

The NFL's new league year begins on March 11. Clubs that hired a new head coach, including the Falcons, can begin offseason workout programs on April 6. Training camps start in mid-July.

A timeline for Penix's return has not been shared.

""It's working together to figure out the right plan for Mike and his rehab,"" Ryan said. ""And that's going to be our training rooms' job and our doctors' jobs and sports science and in the weight room. Everybody's responsibility to make sure that is going as planned. And that's really as simple as it gets.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/falcons/xskdomb1epdezatgicdg,N,,2026-01-17 06:58:34.090444

Darnold addressed his injury with the media on Thursday, stating that there is ""closer to zero"" chance that he isn't able to play in the Divisional Round showdown.","Saturday night's divisional round NFL playoff action features a rubber match between NFC West rivals as the San Francisco 49ers look to knock out the NFC's top-seeded Seattle Seahawks. However, Seattle has some injury concerns at the most important position entering the game.

Quarterback Sam Darnold suffered an oblique injury in practice on Thursday ahead of Saturday's game, and on Friday's injury report, he was officially listed as questionable.

Speaking to the media, Seahawks coach Mike MacDonald said he remains ""optimistic"" that Darnold will be able to suit up against San Francisco despite the injury designation. He added that the team would ""test it out"" on Saturday before making a final decision and that backup Drew Lock will be ready to go if Darnold is not able to go.

Darnold addressed his injury with the media on Thursday, stating that there is ""closer to zero"" chance that he isn't able to play in the Divisional Round showdown. MacDonald seems to share Darnold's confidence.

If he ultimately isn't able to play, it would be a major loss for Seattle. Darnold's 2025 season began at an MVP pace, and though he cooled off a bit down the stretch, he still finished fifth in the league in passing yards (4,048) and tied for ninth in passing touchdowns (25).

If Darnold isn't cleared to play, Lock will make his first career postseason start. He's certainly no stranger to starting games as he's done so 28 times in his six-year career, but he only appeared in five games this season as Darnold's backup and has just three pass attempts in 2025.

Seattle is hoping to emerge from a wide-open NFC, but its playoff hopes may rest on Darnold's ability to play in Saturday's matchup against the 49ers.","https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/16/SCOL/88220224007-usatsi-27928431.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-16 21:59:32.496535

The Seahawks listed Darnold as questionable Friday after he left practice earlier in the day when he felt something in his left side.
He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.
""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said.
This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017.","RENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that he is ""really optimistic"" Sam Darnold will play Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers despite a new oblique injury, echoing what the Pro Bowl quarterback said a day earlier.

But in his final comments of the week before the Seahawks' divisional round playoff game against their NFC West rival, Macdonald left open the possibility that the injury could take a turn either before or after the 8 p.m. ET kickoff.

The Seahawks listed Darnold as questionable Friday after he left practice earlier in the day when he felt something in his left side. He told reporters roughly two hours later that he expects to play.

""Talking about Sam, I heard what he said yesterday to you guys; I see it the same way,"" Macdonald told reporters Friday. ""We're listing him as questionable. Really optimistic he's going to be able to play. Right now we're going through all the protocol ... just out of caution to make sure we're ready to go. We'll test it out tomorrow and kind of make the final decision, but again, we're optimistic he's going to play.

""If he doesn't, or at some point he doesn't, then [Drew Lock is] ready to go, and that's why Drew's here. He's doing a great job.""

The Seahawks held a walk-through Friday, as they typically do the day before a game. Macdonald gave a nonanswer when asked whether Darnold threw during the session. While the coach was speaking to reporters on the sideline of the team's indoor practice facility, Darnold and Lock were walking through plays on the field with receiver Jake Bobo. Darnold was seen making only light, underhanded tosses.

Macdonald was asked whether Darnold was better physically Friday.

""Yeah, he says he feels better,"" Macdonald said. ""But you talked to him. He's confident that he's going to be able to play. We feel the same way.""

Is there any thought that he could be at all limited Saturday?

""Well, yeah. It's a possibility,"" Macdonald said. ""I think right now he's confident that he's going to be able to go do his thing at 100 percent. We are, too. But with these things, something could change between now and then or something could happen in-game. So we kind of just have to roll with it.""

Lock, a seventh-year veteran with a 10-18 record in 28 career starts, is Darnold's backup. Jalen Milroe, a rookie third-round pick, is Seattle's QB3. Milroe has been inactive as a healthy scratch for the past 12 games, though he has continued to suit up as the emergency third quarterback.

Darnold's injury occurred Thursday. He told reporters that he ""felt a little something"" in the oblique on his left side while throwing during a routes-on-air period, and that he left practice as a precautionary measure. Seattle listed him as a limited participant that day.

""Just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said. ""Wasn't the day to push it. So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play Saturday.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Darnold said he has never dealt with an oblique injury and that he'll get more treatment between now and game time, adding: ""We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.""

Aside from Darnold's questionable status, the only other Seattle players with game designations are tight end Elijah Arroyo, linebacker Chazz Surratt and tackle Josh Jones, all backups who have been ruled out. Left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant will return after missing three and two games, respectively.

Cross was limited Wednesday because of a new knee injury but returned to full participation Thursday.

""Just kind of got tangled up a little bit in practice,"" Macdonald said of Cross. ""So we're working through it. He's good to go. It's more of a precautionary thing than anything.""

Darnold, signed by the Seahawks in March after they traded Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders, is set to make the second playoff start of his eight-year NFL career. He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.

""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said. ""... We've got such great guys in that locker room, mature leaders at every position group. So everyone's just ready to go, attacking the week, per usual, and getting ready to go up against a really good 49ers team that's been rolling, and we're excited to go up against them.""

Darnold and the Seahawks beat the 49ers in Week 18 at Levi's Stadium to win the NFC West and secure the conference's top seed. With that win, Seattle finished the regular season 14-3, the same record Darnold posted last year with the Minnesota Vikings on his way to his first career Pro Bowl selection.

He made the Pro Bowl again this year, completing 67.7% of his attempts for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdown passes while also committing an NFL-high 20 turnovers.

Darnold lost his playoff debut last January when he was sacked nine times in a wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He said the Week 18 win over the 49ers felt like a playoff game because of everything that was at stake and how loud the crowd was at Levi's Stadium.

The Seahawks will have home-field advantage in the rematch.

""Being able to use cadence is going to be huge, and then having our 12s there making noise when they're on offense is crucial,"" Darnold said. ""So, it's going to be an awesome atmosphere and something we're all looking forward to.""

This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017. The Seahawks' only other home playoff game since then was at the end of the 2020 COVID-19 season, when they lost in the wild-card round to the Rams in an empty stadium.

""We know Lumen's going to be rocking,"" Darnold said. ""It's an important game. We don't get it twisted at all. We understand the implications of the game. The playoffs, it's awesome to be playing in games like this, especially in January. But yeah, we're treating this week as another week, and we're excited about it.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0116%2Fr1601609_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:00:14.731937

Once again, Houston has one of the top defenses in the league, especially against the pass. Edge rushers Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter lead the way up front with first-team All-Pro cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. setting the tone in the secondary.

Houston's offense endured a tumultuous start to the season under first-year coordinator Nick Caley and a rookie starting left tackle in Aireontae Ersery. But the Texans found more of a groove down the stretch of the regular season.

Their 30-6 win over Pittsburgh in the wild-card round marked their 10th win in a row, and they overcame five fumbles by quarterback C.J. Stroud. Houston earned that win despite missing leading receiver Nico Collins for most of the second half. He entered the league's concussion protocol after trying to catch a pass over the middle of the field and landing hard on his head.

Houston will face the New England Patriots in the divisional round of the playoffs. Will the Texans have their top wide receiver for that contest? Here's the latest on Collins' status:

Is Nico Collins playing against the Patriots?

Collins will not suit up against New England. The Texans ruled him out in their final injury report released Friday, Jan. 16.

He and fellow wide receiver Justin Watson will both miss the divisional round as they make their way through concussion protocol.

Houston will lean on veteran Christian Kirk again as well as rookie Jayden Higgins at the position with Collins sidelined.

What is the NFL's concussion protocol?

The NFL breaks its concussion protocol down into five distinct steps. The process is designed to break up the recovery process from a head injury, ensuring a player's safety.

Here are the five steps of the protocol, according to the NFL:","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/16/USAT/88220581007-usatsi-27930278.jpg?crop=5698,3205,x0,y431&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-16 20:00:25.756433

“He’s confident he’s going to be able to play,” Macdonald said.","Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said he’s “really optimistic” quarterback Sam Darnold will play Saturday night despite the quarterback being listed as questionable with an oblique injury ahead of their divisional-round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers at Lumen Field.

“Right now, we’re going through all the protocols out of caution, making sure we are ready to go,” Macdonald said Friday afternoon.

Darnold spoke with reporters Thursday after practice. He said he plans to play.

The Seahawks held a light, pad-less walkthrough practice Friday morning. Macdonald declined to say whether Darnold threw passes during the session. He said it’s possible that the oblique injury could limit Darnold in the game.

“But right now, he’s confident he’s gonna be able to go do his thing 100 percent. We are, too,” Macdonald said. He later added: “I don’t think we’d put him out there if he couldn’t do his job.”

Darnold said that he “felt something” in his left side while throwing during Thursday’s practice. Out of caution, Darnold left practice early to receive treatment, which he said will continue through Saturday. Backup quarterback Drew Lock took over as the first-team QB when Darnold exited. Lock would start if Darnold were deemed unable to play or suffered an in-game injury.

Macdonald said Darnold currently “feels better” than he did the day of the injury.

“He’s confident he’s going to be able to play,” Macdonald said.

As long as Darnold’s able to go, this will be his second career playoff start and first with the Seahawks. He lost his only career playoff start while playing for the Minnesota Vikings last season.

Saturday’s game will be the third meeting this season between the Seahawks and 49ers. The NFC West rivals split the season series, with both teams winning on the road. Seattle’s 13-3 win over the 49ers in Week 18 clinched Seattle’s first NFC West title since 2020 and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time since 2014.

This will be Seattle’s first playoff game with fans in attendance since the 2016 season; the Lumen Field stands were empty due to COVID-19 when Seattle lost a wild-card game to the Los Angeles Rams in January 2021.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/13205410/GettyImages-2252121049-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-16 21:59:54.123412

Collins went to the ground headfirst and, after being helped to the sideline and evaluated in the medical tent, was eventually carted to the locker room.

Wide receiver Christian Kirk stepped up for the Texans on Monday and was enjoying a good game even before Collins exited with the injury. Kirk finished with eight catches on nine targets for 144 yards. He also caught a 6-yard touchdown from Stroud in the second quarter.

Collins played in 15 games during the regular season. His 71 catches were comfortably the most by a Texans wide receiver and were only behind tight end Dalton Schultz’s 82 for the team lead. Collins led the team in receiving yards with 1,117 and receiving touchdowns with six. He showed a tendency to make plays in the biggest moments, as illustrated by his team-leading 48 receptions for first downs.

Kirk’s emergence on Monday was an encouraging sign for the Texans, but it’s something they’ll need to have with more consistency. Kirk didn’t have a single 100-yard receiving game in his 13 regular-season appearances, and he only crossed the 50-yard threshold twice. His most productive output before the wild-card game was five catches for 54 yards and a touchdown in a Week 7 win over the Buffalo Bills.

Aside from Kirk, the Texans will rely on Schultz, whose 106 targets during the regular season were behind only Collins’ 120. They’ll also need more production from wide receivers Jayden Higgins, Xavier Hutchinson and Jaylin Noel. Fellow receiver Justin Watson, who had just three catches for 30 yards this season, was also ruled out of Sunday’s game with a concussion.

The opponent doesn’t make things any easier, either. The Patriots allowed the ninth-fewest passing yards per game in the regular season and will have their top cornerback, Christian Gonzalez, who is also returning from a concussion. Establishing a running game could also help ease some of the pressure off Stroud and the passing game as they navigate things without the unit’s top playmaker.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/16154308/GettyImages-2256272719-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-16 21:59:58.294802

Seahawks coach ‘really optimistic’ QB Sam Darnold will play vs. 49ers

It was expected that Darnold’s left tackle, Charles Cross, would make his return to the field after missing the last three games of the regular season with a knee injury. But then Cross popped up on the injury report Wednesday, limited with not just the knee injury but also a new hamstring concern.

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald addressed Cross’ status when he had his final press conference before Saturday’s game at team headquarters on Friday afternoon, explaining what happened with Cross.

“Kind of got tangled up a little bit in practice, and so we’re working through it,” Macdonald said.

What’s changed since Seattle Seahawks, 49ers met in Week 18

Cross did not have a game designation – out, doubtful or questionable – when Seattle’s final injury report for Saturday’s contest was released Thursday, and Macdonald’s comments Friday were in line with that.

“He’s good to go. It’s more of a precautionary thing than anything,” the Seahawks coach said.

No doubt that’s great news for the Seahawks and their fans as the NFC’s top seed readies for the sixth-seeded 49ers in the NFC Divisional Round.

Cross, who was only limited in practice this week on Wednesday, is a crucial part of Seattle’s offense, as evidenced by the four-year, $104.4 million contract extension he was signed to earlier this month.

Saturday’s NFC Divisional Round playoff game between the Seahawks and 49ers is set for a 5 p.m. kickoff, with radio coverage on Seattle Sports beginning at 2 p.m. with the pregame show.

•••••••

• Nothing says “wow” like bad news. There was some of that last night from Pullman. For both men’s basketball teams competing at Beasley.

The home team endured what even its coach termed a bit of regression and fell, 86-65 to No. 9 Gonzaga in a West Coast Conference game. The loss dropped Washington State to 8-11 overall and 3-3 in conference play.

But the visitors may have suffered the more-long-lasting blow and it came in the days leading up to Thursday’s showdown.

Braden Huff, one of the twins of GU’s towering front line, suffered an undisclosed left knee injury at practice. An injury the Zags said could keep him off the floor from four weeks – not too bad – to eight – that stretches to March Madness, right?

No matter how you try to splice it, which may not be the right word to use, considering Huff seems to have avoided surgery, it’s not good news for an 18-1 team that holds national title aspirations.

For most of the 6,439 folks in attendance wearing their Zag shirt, the Huff news immediately rode shotgun down to Pullman, with the game forced to the backseat.

That Graham Ike, the other towering figure inside, took over, scoring 23 points, grabbing 11 rebounds and dishing out five assists helped mitigate the anxiety. For one night anyway.

• The next test for the Zags comes Saturday in Seattle. At 7 p.m. In Climate Pledge Arena. Against host Seattle University. Why, exactly? Not the game itself. Or even the venue. That’s obvious.

But the Seahawks’ home playoff game against the 49ers kicks off at 5 p.m. on Fox. Anything – anything at all, including the opera or a lecture on the efficacy of traffic control – in Seattle during that game is facing stiff competition for eyeballs, feet, butts, whatever folks take with them when they make a decision to attend a sporting event.

The University of Washington understood that. So did 12th-ranked Michigan State and the Big Ten Conference. Instead of pitting their men’s basketball game up against the first choice of most casual fans, they moved the start time up to 3 p.m., meaning a Husky follower can attend, leave whenever the Spartans take control and still be home in time to watch at least ¾ of the playoff game.

I’m guessing that’s the downside of playing in Climate Pledge. The start time was locked in with no wiggle room. UW controls Hec Ed. And the game is only on the Big Ten Network. Making the change might not have been easy but it was possible. The Redhawks’ biggest home game of the WCC season? Not so much.

• Now you know the Hawks’ start time, what about the three other playoff games? The weekend slate kicks off Saturday with the AFC’s No. 1 seed, Denver, hosting Buffalo (1:30, CBS). Whatever the Rocky Mountain weather throws at these teams tomorrow – it is supposed to be clear and cold – both teams are used to it.

The same can’t be said for Sunday’s first game, Houston at New England (noon, ABC). The Texans not only live in a temperate climate, they play indoors. Where it never snows, which is in Boston’s forecast.

And in Chicago’s? Maybe not, though showers are possible. The weather highlight? Bitter cold, with a high of 19 and a low of 3. The Rams – again, temperate city, indoor arena – have to venture outdoors in their attempt to topple the seemingly impossible-to-kill Bears (3:30 p.m., NBC).

• What else is there on TV this weekend from the sports world?

Surprisingly, a tennis Grand Slam event. Though, of course, it is the Australian Open, as summer beats down in Melbourne (4 p.m. Sunday, ESPN2). And golf, with the PGA Tour’s new year really gets going in Hawaii with the Sony Open (4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday on the Golf Channel).

As for men’s college hoops, the slate is slim. Three matchups of ranked teams on Saturday (No. 19 Florida and No. 10 Vanderbilt, 11 a.m., ESPN, No. 21 Georgia hosting No. 17 Arkansas, 1 p.m., ESPN2 and No. 11 BYU at No. 15 Texas Tech, 5, ESPN). None on Sunday.

The women’s schedule is even lighter, with only No. 12 Maryland hosting No. 3 UCLA on Sunday at 1 p.m. (NBC) as a matchup with national interest. Big Ten games don’t get more traditional than that, right?

But Stroud only fumbled twice all season and didn’t lose one until the playoff game.","What a crazy way to open the NFL postseason. The wild-card round was loaded with close calls, back-and-forth games and unforgettable drama.

Yet it was all so … predictable.

Last week, The Athletic asked a panel of NFL coaches and team executives to predict the wild-card round winners, and it delivered with a clean sweep, nailing all six games.

Breaking it down by individual ballots, we had one perfect picker on the panel in the wild-card round, and four cards went 5-1. Interestingly, all four picked a different loser, so there was no upset that universally rocked the group.

And for the panelists’ perfect insight, they were rewarded with more work because we asked them to come back and do it again for the divisional round. As a reminder, panelists were not asked to make a pick if their team was involved in the game.

No. 6 Buffalo Bills (12-5, 1-0 playoffs) at No. 1 Denver Broncos (14-3)

Kickoff: 4:30 p.m. ET Saturday, CBS

Expert picks: Broncos 7, Bills 4

Bills quarterback Josh Allen unleashed another dominant performance in a 27-24 victory against the Jaguars, completing 28-of-35 passes for 273 yards and a touchdown, to go along with 33 rushing yards and two scores. He bailed out the defense by rallying twice for fourth-quarter touchdowns to set up a playoff meeting with the Broncos for the second year in a row.

“Superman is coming out,” an executive said.

But Allen hit the injury tent twice against the Jaguars, first for a concussion evaluation and then for a potential leg injury. Allen will play and more than likely be fine, but there are concerns about the accumulation of wear and tear, as it’ll impact the Bills’ championship aspirations.

Plus, the Bills have compiled injuries later this season, and their depth has taken a hit. Can Allen continue to play to a perfect standard to carry them into another round? That’s the panel’s greatest concern.

“The Bills have too many injuries to overcome at this point,” a second exec said. “I thought the quarterback wasn’t going to make it out of the first half of that (Jaguars) game.”

The Broncos need to control the game on the ground. Their 16th-ranked rushing attack wasn’t overly electric this season, but they should have success against the Bills’ No. 28 rush defense. And if Bo Nix can have more success with designed runs than Trevor Lawrence did, it’d further test the Bills’ vulnerable front.

“That stadium is tough,” a third executive said of Empower Field at Mile High. “The Broncos defense is nasty, and the Broncos offense should be able to run the ball. It may be close, but the Broncos are a fourth-quarter team, and so are the Bills. So it should be fun.”

The Broncos have won 13 of 14, and they’re rested. Their defense ranked third in points allowed and second in yards, and their 68 sacks easily set the pace — 11 more than any other team and 20 more than any other playoff team.

Allen should be able to attack the middle of Denver’s defense, though, and the Bills can ride rushing champion James Cook to control the game. Allen was efficient in last year’s playoff blowout, and Cook tallied 120 of the Bills’ 210 rushing yards in that game.

No. 6 San Francisco 49ers (12-5, 1-0) at No. 1 Seattle Seahawks (14-3)

Kickoff: 8 p.m. ET Saturday, Fox

Expert picks: Seahawks 6, 49ers 3

Both teams have declared they wanted this rematch, and now they’ve got it.

Not too surprisingly, the panelists felt strongly about the Seahawks two weeks after they dismantled the 49ers 13-3 in San Francisco with the NFC’s top seed on the line. Niners quarterback Brock Purdy was held without a touchdown for the only time this season, while running back Christian McCaffrey’s 57 yards from scrimmage were a season-low and just the fifth time he didn’t hit the century mark.

The Niners played without left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall in that matchup, but Williams has since returned, and Pearsall appears to be close to returning, as well. Linebacker Fred Warner won’t play after dislocating his ankle in October and tight end George Kittle is out with a torn Achilles. The injuries have been a continuous story for the Niners.

“No Kittle hurts,” an executive said of the star tight end who caught five of Purdy’s 19 completions in the teams’ Week 18 matchup.

“The 49ers are just so banged up,” another executive said.

Fun fact: The Niners have won exactly two playoff games in each of their last six postseason appearances, with four of those under coach Kyle Shanahan. They’ve won back-to-back road games in two of those postseasons, so they have precedent on their side.

The Seahawks will have a full-throated home-field advantage, though, with this being their first playoff game in front of fans in nine years. (Their last home playoff game was in January 2021, following the COVID-19 season.) Their victory against the Niners in the finale wasn’t just vital for the standings, as they also erased the sour taste of losing seven of their previous eight games to their NFC West rivals.

Offensively, the Seahawks ranked third in scoring and eighth in total yards, but their 28 turnovers were the second most in the NFL and five more than any other playoff team. They led the league with 13 lost fumbles.

Quarterback Sam Darnold had the second-best season of his career and helped wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba lead the league with 1,793 receiving yards, but Darnold’s 14 interceptions were also his second most.

“Darnold will be the X-factor either way,” said a coach who picked the Seahawks. “His play determines the outcome of the game.”

While Darnold and the offense are capable of exploding at any given moment, the Seahawks will go as far as their defense will carry them. Coach Mike Macdonald, who will make his playoff debut, helped the Seahawks lead the league in points allowed for the first time since 2012-15. They also ranked third against the run, sixth in takeaways (25) and tied for seventh in sacks (47).

“Seattle’s defense is nasty, nasty,” an executive said.

The 49ers had 22 regular-season giveaways, two interceptions in their 23-19 victory against the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round and fumbled twice (recovering both), so ball security has a chance to be the major story of this game.

No. 5 Houston Texans (12-5, 1-0) at No. 2 New England Patriots (14-3, 1-0)

Kickoff: 3 p.m. ET Sunday, ABC/ESPN

Expert picks: Patriots 7, Texans 3

The Patriots have awoken from a half-decade hibernation and are set to host the hottest team in the league, which boasts a ferocious defense and just won a playoff game for the third year in a row. The Texans might have sent Aaron Rodgers into retirement in the process.

And yet, the panelists were primarily focused on one man: Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.

“The way Drake is playing — other than this past week, I don’t think Drake is going to have two in a row like that,” an executive said. “That’s a really tough place to play. I don’t know if the Texans are going to run the ball and possess it enough to keep Drake Maye off the field.”

The Texans are riding a 10-game winning streak, and they’ve scored 30 or more points in four of those games. However, quarterback C.J. Stroud and the offense haven’t been the most consistent group, and wide receiver Nico Collins is in the concussion protocol. Furthermore, they finished 22nd in rushing yards and 29th in yards per carry this season, so they don’t help Stroud on the ground.

But the defense scored five times in the regular season and twice more in the 30-6 victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the wild-card round. The Texans forced 29 regular-season turnovers, third most in the NFL.

“This is the best team the Patriots have seen,” a second executive said.

The Patriots’ .391 strength of schedule was easily the worst in the league, but they can redirect that narrative by taking down the Texans, who are 5-1 against playoff opponents since Week 8.

Both quarterbacks are coming off games with uncharacteristically poor ball security. Stroud threw an interception and fumbled five times, losing two, against the Steelers. But Stroud only fumbled twice all season and didn’t lose one until the playoff game. He also cut down on his interceptions from 12 in 2024 (on 2.3 percent of his throws) to eight this season (1.9 percent of throws).

“Stroud will take care of the football,” the second executive said.

Maye threw a pick during the Patriots’ 16-3 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers, and he also fumbled twice, losing one. That’s a little more explainable with the five sacks. But Maye also cut down on his interceptions from 10 as a rookie (3 percent of throws) to eight in 2025 (1.6 percent). He lost three fumbles during the season.

A defensive coordinator pointed toward Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels’ historical success against the Texans’ defensive scheme. The coach predicted McDaniels would neutralize the Texans’ explosive edge rushers to allow Maye to play the game on his terms.

Eventually, an executive predicted, the Patriots will generate too much offensive pressure for Houston to withstand if its own offense isn’t doing enough.

“The Texans’ running game isn’t there,” the executive said. “You want to have faith in that defense, but I don’t trust the offense to take enough pressure off them.”

No. 5 Los Angeles Rams (12-5, 1-0) at No. 2 Chicago Bears (11-6, 1-0)

Kickoff: 6:30 p.m. ET Sunday, NBC

Expert picks: Rams 9, Bears 2

If this becomes a quarterback duel, Caleb Williams will have a hard time matching Matthew Stafford’s consistency. Then again, Williams has unquestionably been at his best in the most dire circumstances because of his athleticism and extraordinary arm talent.

That’s just a tough way to live in the playoffs.

“The Rams will get a lead, then the pass rushers will start getting after Caleb, and they have the speed to chase him down,” an executive said.

Edge rushers Byron Young (12 sacks), Jared Verse (7.5) and Kobie Turner (seven) lead the way for the Rams, who ranked seventh during the season with 47 sacks.

Williams has understandably generated the most attention, but the Bears’ offensive identity is through their physicality within their running game. They were third in rushing offense with D’Andre Swift (1,087 yards, nine touchdowns) and Kyle Monangai (783 yards, five touchdowns) leading the way. The Rams have been susceptible to the run at times this season.

Stafford, an MVP candidate, has thrown multiple touchdown passes in 16 of his 18 starts this season, including the last 12. The Rams led the league in points for the first time since 2017, and a couple of panelists believe Rams coach Sean McVay has a steep advantage against Chicago’s defense.

“I don’t trust the Bears defense,” an executive said. “I don’t know that they’re ready for a big game yet.”

Turnovers could be the key in this game, too. The Bears finished a league-best plus-22 in the turnover department this season, with the Rams ranking fifth at plus-11. They both take it away, with the Bears No. 1 with 33 forced turnovers and the Rams at No. 5 with 26. And neither give it back, with the Bears also No. 1 with 11 giveaways and the Rams at No. 6 with just 15 turnovers.

A break in that pattern could be an X-factor. Another could be the Rams’ woeful special teams.

And by now, the Rams are well aware that the Bears seem to have nine lives. Williams had a league-high six fourth-quarter comebacks in the regular season, and he’s one-for-one in the playoffs. The Rams are 5-5 in one-possession games this season, including their 34-31 playoff victory against the Carolina Panthers, but they won’t be comfortable with a coin-flip finish against Williams and the cardiac Bears.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/14144418/0115_NFLInsiderPlayoffPredictions_Divisional-scaled-e1768419908652.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-16 20:00:34.368633

The two-time Pro Bowler was carted to the locker room during Monday night’s wild card at Acrisure Stadium.

The Patriots opened Jennings’ 21-day window to return as preparations for the divisional round began. The sophomore running back had been placed on injured reserve following the bye week in December due to a concussion. Gonzalez aentered the NFL’s protocol late last weekend, yet the Pro Bowl cornerback has also since gone from a red non-contact jersey on Wednesday to a full participant for consecutive sessions.

As for the veteran sack leader off the edges for the AFC’s No. 2 seed, Landry has been managing a knee injury since late in the fall and was ruled out for back-to-back games to end the regular season. He was a non-participant on Friday.

“We’re just trying to do everything we can to give him enough time to see how it feels for Sunday,” Vrabel said of the defensive captain, who started and stayed in for 26 snaps in the wild card after finishing 2025 with 8.5 sacks, 10 tackles for loss and 19 quarterback hits.

Elsewhere, corner Alex Austin, recently a full participant while working back from a wrist procedure, will go without a game status as the deadline for his activation to the 53-man roster nears with an open spot. And all-purpose nose tackle Khyiris Tonga also stands with the green light to face the Texans after missing the previous three games due to a foot injury.

“Great to have him practice, but what matters is what it’s going to be on Sunday at 3,” New England’s head coach said of Tonga. “I would say that hopefully he can pick up where he left off in his production and what he’s been able to do inside there as an interior, rotational player.”",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2255933305.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C78.543181364843&w=1200,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:18.793003

The league is coming off a truly wild Wild Card Weekend, with most games decided in the final moments, setting the stage for what's shaping up to be one of the most memorable postseason runs in recent memory. The bar is high for the divisional round -- and it has a lot to live up to.

As much as the focus is on the matchups that will determine who advances and who goes home, injuries are also looming large. Wild Card Weekend delivered plenty of drama, but it also took a toll. The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle for the remainder of the season with a torn Achilles, while Texans wide receiver Nico Collins and Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez each exited their games with concussions. Meanwhile, the Seahawks are keeping a close eye on Sam Darnold after he suffered an oblique injury during practice.

With teams wrapping up their on-field preparations for this latest round of the playoffs, let's take a look at the final injury reports to see who's in, who's out and whose status remains up in the air.

Epenesa (neck), tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee, calf) and linebacker Matt Milano (ankle) also enter the weekend without injury designations after each was limited throughout the week. On Friday, Buffalo did activate both defensive tackle Ed Oliver and receiver Curtis Samuel off of injured reserve, signaling their return. Oliver hasn't played since Week 8.

Denver is relatively healthy heading into this matchup. Just four players appeared on the final injury report, and only two have been ruled out. Most notably, linebacker Dre Greenlaw logged a full practice on Thursday and carries no injury designation.

Darnold has said he's confident he'll be able to play through it, but he is officially listed as questionable. If he's unable to go, backup Drew Lock would be thrust into the starting role for this playoff matchup.

In 15 regular season games this year, Collins caught 71 passes for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns.

Collins a big-bodied target that can beat safeties deep for long touchdowns. With Collins out, more pressure will be placed on players like Jayden Higgins and Xavier Hutchinson, but Christian Kirk is the receiver to watch. He caught eight of nine targets on Monday night for a career-high 144 yards and a touchdown. Kirk averaged just 18.2 receiving yards per game in the regular season.

These teams met in Week 18 in what was a battle for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. It ended up in a dominant display for the Seahawks' defense as they stalled the 49ers' offense en route to a 13-3 victory.

That win ensured Seattle had last week off during the wild-card weekend. Now, they're back in action for the divisional round on Jan. 17.

San Francisco upset host Philadelphia last weekend thanks to some trickery on offense and standout performances by veterans on defense. They're on the road once again for this one.

This week marks the first playoff game for Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold since last year's wild-card round when he and the Minnesota Vikings lost to the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams' defense rattled Darnold with nine sacks in that one.

Darnold will look to change that narrative in the playoffs against his former team. He's 2-1 against the 49ers since spending the 2023 NFL season in San Francisco.

But he popped up on the injury report this week with an oblique issue. Here's the latest on his status for the divisional playoffs:

Is Sam Darnold playing against the 49ers?

The Seahawks quarterback explained what happened and why he ended up on the injury report during a Jan. 15 press conference. His response indicates he'll be on the field for the Seahawks-49ers game.

""Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said today. ""Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold didn't shine against the 49ers when they faced off three weeks ago but played well enough to earn the win. He finished 20-for-26 passing for 198 yards.

One more thing going well for Darnold and the Seahawks' offense: left tackle Charles Cross was cleared from the injury report and is expected to be a full-go for the upcoming game. He'd previously been on the injury report with a knee issue.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/16/USAT/88217022007-usatsi-27926980.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-16 18:02:29.324696

Odunze caught two passes for 44 yards in a comeback, wild-card win over the Green Bay Packers last week.

In 12 regular-season games, he reeled in 44 passes for 661 yards and 6 touchdowns.

Notably, the Bears didn’t list injury designations for fellow WR DJ Moore, DB C.J. Gardner-Johnson and LT Braxton Jones.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold has been added to the injury report with an oblique issue that makes him “questionable” for Saturday’s divisional-round playoff game versus the San Francisco 49ers, but he told reporters Thursday that he still expects to play.

He was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers this weekend at Seattle's Lumen Field.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Gonzalez entered concussion protocol on Sunday night as the Patriots defeated the Chargers during wild-card weekend. He was a limited participant in Wednesday night’s practice and now the team gets a positive update with the corner shedding a red non-contact jersey as a full participant on Thursday.

Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins remains in concussion protocol and missed Thursday’s media session, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander.

Collins is unlikely to play in Sunday’s divisional round game against the New England Patriots because of the steps needed to clear concussion protocol.

Collins suffered the concussion in Monday’s wild-card 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards in the game before going down.

If Collins cannot go, expect Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins, and Dalton Schultz to see an increase in targets. Jaylin Noel, Xavier Hutchinson and Cade Stover could also see an increased role.

Samuel and Hamlin are expected to take part fully in practice on Thursday. Oliver, running back Ty Johnson and linebacker Terrel Bernard will be limited.

Quarterback Josh Allen and kicker Matt Prater, who had injury concerns coming into this week were full participants on Wednesday.

Seattle Seahawks tackle Charles Cross was downgraded to a limited participant in practice on Wednesday with a knee injury added to his previous hamstring injury. Tackle Josh Jones did not participate in practice with a knee injury. Linebacker Tryice Knight was also DNP on Wednesday.

If you want to see the difference a first-round bye makes, look no further than this matchup. Buffalo is beat up on both sides of the ball, with linebacker Terrel Bernard and questionable and safety Jordan Poyer out. Rookie cornerback Maxwell Hairston is also out. Offensively, receivers Tyrell Shavers and Gabe Davis each suffered torn ACLs last week, while No. 2 back Ty Johnson aims to return to Buffalo's backfield. The Bills activated defensive tackle Ed Oliver and receiver Curtis Samuel from injured reserve, giving the team a likely boost on both sides of the ball. Both are officially questionable to suit up.

Denver is a 1.5-point favorite here, and the total is 45.5.

SF TE George Kittle (Achilles, out)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)

SF Fred Warner (ankle, out)

SEA QB Sam Darnold (oblique, questionable)

It's always a concern when a player surprisingly pops up on the final injury report, and it's especially noteworthy when it's your starting quarterback. That's the case for Seattle's Sam Darnold, however, as he is questionable with an oblique injury. Darnold told reporters he ""felt a little something"" during practice on Thursday but that he expects to play on Saturday. Head coach Mike Macdonald told reporters Friday he expects his starting quarterback to suit up as well. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is out for the rest of the postseason with a torn Achilles, veteran linebacker Fred Warner won't be activated and second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is questionable due to a nagging knee injury.

Seattle is a 7-point favorite at home. The total is 45.5.

Houston Texans at New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET, Sunday)

HOU WR Nico Collins (concussion, out)

NE CB Christian Gonzalez (concussion, will play)

The Texans' offense has been limited at times throughout the year, but it always had one constant in star receiver Nico Collins. That unit will not have Collins in this pivotal matchup with the Patriots, however, as he's out with a concussion he suffered in last week's win over the Steelers. With Collins out, Houston's more unproven receivers like Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel will have to step up as primary targets for C.J. Stroud. Making things harder is star cornerback Christian Gonzalez has cleared concussion protocol for New England and will play.

The Patriots are 3-point favorites, and the total is 40.5 -- the lowest of this four-game slate.

Los Angeles Rams at Chicago Bears (6:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)

Although veteran WR Mack Hollins (abdomen) remains on injured reserve, the Patriots didn't rule any players on their active roster out on their final injury report. On Friday, New England listed OLB Harold Landry III (knee), and RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) as questionable for Sunday's divisional round matchup vs. the Texans.

Starting with the defense, Pro Bowl CB Christian Gonzalez was cleared to play and is off the injury report after being in concussion protocol this week. Gonzalez exited last Sunday's Wild Card win over the Chargers in the fourth quarter after he appeared to injure himself breaking up a pass earlier in the quarter. Gonzalez did not return to the game and was placed in the league's concussion protocol. During the week, the star cornerback practiced on Wednesday in a red non-contact jersey and then shed the red jersey as a full participant in the final two practices, indicating that he's trending in the right direction.

Gonzalez spent most of last week's matchup covering Chargers deep threat Quentin Johnston, breaking up both passes intended for Johnston. In all, Gonzalez didn't allow a catch on five targets vs. Los Angeles. As one of the best cornerbacks in the league, Gonzalez allows the Patriots to increase the blitz pressure because they trust their corners on islands. Last week, New England blitzed Chargers QB Justin Herbert on 45.5% of his drop-backs, pressuring him nine times. Texans QB C.J. Stroud ranks 17th in expected points added per drop-back against the blitz, so the Patriots might continue to heat up Houston's quarterback on Sunday afternoon with all their cornerbacks healthy.

Along with Gonzalez trending toward being available, the Patriots defense and short-yardage offense could get a big boost from the return of NT Khyiris Tonga. Tonga, who hasn't played since injuring his foot in Week 16, returned to practice this week. The big nose tackle is a stout run-stopper who registered 12 run stuffs this season and shows impressive power to dent the pocket as a bull rusher. Plus, the 335-pound defender has played 14 snaps on offense this season as a short-yardage blocker.

The Patriots have gotten pretty creative with Tonga on offense, moving him around to create advantageous blocking angles in the run game. One of the Texans defense's many strengths is its ability to stop the run (third in rush EPA), particularly in short-yardage situations, where Houston ranks fifth in power success rate (59.5%). Tonga could help the Patriots offense get those tough yards when they're in power situations.

The final puzzle piece on defense is the status of captain Harold Landry III, who has been managing a knee injury for the last several weeks. After resting his knee in the last two regular season games, Landry returned for the Wild Card win over the Chargers but didn't register any pressures in just 26 snaps. If the captain doesn't play, New England will likely lean on Anfernee Jennings and Elijah Ponder on the edge opposite K'Lavon Chaisson, while new addition Derrell Taylor is a candidate to be a practice squad elevation.

Moving over to the offense, the Patriots mostly have a clean bill of health. The only question mark was jumbo tight end/third tackle Thayer Munford Jr., who has been dealing with a knee injury over the last few weeks. Munford played through the injury last week, so one would expect him to play on Sunday. The jumbo package could be a big part of New England's game plan. With six offensive linemen on the field, the Patriots can load up protections to get multiple blockers on the Texans elite pass rushers. Houston ranks just 21st in pass EPA against jumbo packages, compared to first against regular personnel groupings. Therefore, one would expect the Patriots offense to test the Texans pass defense in jumbo packages.

As for the Texans, Houston ruled out star WR Nico Collins (concussion) after he exited their Wild Card win over the Steelers. Collins led the Texans with 1,117 receiving yards in the regular season, tied for ninth in the NFL, and also hauled in six touchdowns. This season, the Texans average nearly a full yard per play more with Collins on the field (5.6) versus off the field (4.8), so that's a major blow to Houston's offense. After not practicing the first two days, RT Trent Brown (ankle) is officially questionable.

New England also has the option to activate RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) and CB Alex Austin (wrist) from injured reserve, with both players practicing this week. The Patriots created an open roster spot by releasing veteran RB D'Ernest Johnson, who re-signed with the team's practice squad, which would suggest they might activate Jennings as their third running back. At cornerback, the Pats must activate Austin this week or his 21-day window to return from injured reserve will close, shutting him down for the rest of the season. Most likely, that'll come down to whether the Patriots prefer Austin over rookie DB Kobee Minor on special teams.

New England has until Saturday at 4 p.m. ET to activate Austin and Jennings from injured reserve, while the team can also use its two standard practice squad elevations for Sunday's game. We will keep you updated on all the moving parts on the roster. The Patriots will then host the Texans with kickoff at 3 p.m. ET at Gillette Stadium on Sunday.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/qez7daojcmdadpuzrmz4,N,,2026-01-16 18:02:46.231925

Warner was looking to play in the NFL Divisional Round this Saturday, but the hope was cut short Thursday, just two days before game time.

After suffering a fractured and dislocated right ankle in Week 6 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Warner looked like his season was over. But with successful surgery and an unheard-of recovery, he had a chance to play this week against division rival Seattle Seahawks on Saturday.

49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan expressed optimism that if the 49ers were to win this weekend, Warner could make one of the most historical comebacks from an injury that traditionally sets players back a full season.

When asked about the potential to play next week, Shanahan said that he was “confident in that” idea and mentioned that “we’ll see if it works out.”

Warner all week had videos at practice looking healthy and mobile, which left the door open to possibly play this weekend after his press conference Wednesday.

“I feel amazing,” Warner said in his interview with 49ersWebzone.com. Warner acknowledged that he was grateful to even be in a situation this close to coming back and that he was “grateful and blessed” for it.

Warner also expressed his gratitude for his supporters and the people that “have been in [Warner’s] corner the entire time.” Warner mentioned the “trainers, the strength staff, the plan they put together for [Warner], [and] helping push [Warner] along.”

Warner’s teammates also expressed the impact and the possible addition that he would be to the 49ers, with 12-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman Trent Williams saying how much even seeing Warner on the field provides motivation for Williams and the team.

“Just having his face in this locker room, it’s motivation,” Williams said. “The fact that Fred even has his jersey on, 100 days after what happened to him, that just uplifts the team whether Fred takes the field in these playoffs or not.”",https://brightspotcdn.byu.edu/dims4/default/d83d571/2147483647/strip/true/crop/440x440+171+0/resize/1200x1200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrigham-young-brightspot-us-east-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2Fd8%2F23fc4d264bacb329ac19993e0dea%2Ffred-warner.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 20:00:44.934468

Further complicating matters was an ankle injury to swing tackle Storm Norton, who was McGary's primary backup. The injury was initially expected to cost Norton only a portion of the season, but he never suited up for the Falcons in 2025. That left Atlanta to enter the season with veteran journeyman Elijah Wilkinson starting on Penix's blind side.

Wilkinson ended up playing every offensive snap for the Falcons in 2025, joining Ryan Neuzil as the only two players to do so. Even with a heavy reliance on two new faces in the starting lineup, Atlanta's offensive line was still a force to be reckoned with on the ground.

Let's take a closer look at how the group did.

Biggest question facing the position group in 2026:

How will Kaleb McGary bounce back from injury?

McGary's season-ending injury late in training camp was a setback for an offensive line group that has been remarkably consistent the last few years. And while Elijah Wilkinson performed well in his stead throughout the 2025 season, McGary's return should bolster the offense.

The former first-round pick is under contract for the next two seasons, and his abilities as a run blocker should be valued by whoever the Falcons' next head coach and general manager are. Given that McGary sustained his knee injury before the 2025 season started, he should be back up to full speed next fall.

His return would be a benefit to Atlanta's run game, which just featured a record-setting performance from Bijan Robinson. McGary's ability in the open field has and should continue to be an asset to the Falcons' outside zone attack, and he has improved as a pass protector since joining the team in 2019.

If McGary is back to form in 2026, the Falcons will once again have an offensive line that can set the tone for their offense.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/falcons/udnsjuodoaelvcylcwl5,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:33.795560

Can the Broncos overcome them?

The Houston Texans defense had the most complete game of any unit last season. How can the New England Patriots move the ball against them?

We’ll look at the most important matchups on both sides of the ball in the AFC’s two divisional games this weekend.

Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos (4:30 p.m. ET Saturday)

Key matchup: TE Dalton Kincaid vs. Broncos linebackers

From weeks 11 to 17 (the opposing Kansas City Chiefs rested starters in Week 18), the Broncos had a defensive drop-off, going from elite to very good. They still were a very disruptive defense in that span, leading the league in negative play rate (37.2 percent), but dropped to 10th in success rate (57.1 percent), 23rd in EPA per dropback (-0.13) and 21st in points per drive (2.25). Notably, they struggled against mobile quarterbacks. Marcus Mariota, Trevor Lawrence and Jordan Love, even though he doesn’t run as much, had success extending plays and scrambling against the Broncos.

Aside from Josh Allen’s ability to create off-script plays, there are a few ways the Bills offense matches up favorably against the Broncos defense. The Broncos defense specializes in taking away outside receivers with cornerbacks Patrick Surtain and Riley Moss, and of course, that will be an issue for the Bills, but they don’t rely on their outside receivers winning at a high rate to move the ball. The Bills rank fifth in receiving yards to tight ends and running backs.

In the playoff matchup with the Broncos last season, the Bills were able to run for 210 yards on a defense that ranked first in success rate that year. More importantly, they took advantage of the Broncos’ linebackers by targeting running backs and tight ends (seven catches for 101 yards). Dalton Kincaid has missed several games this season with injuries, but he’s improved as a player and should be a major part of the Bills’ game plan.

The Broncos have given up the ninth-most yards to tight ends this season and the eighth-highest average yards per reception to tight ends (10.7). They major in man coverage, but their linebackers don’t play man coverage at a high level. Dre Greenlaw should help, but he’s a better zone defender. Strong safety Talanoa Hufanga is elite in so many areas but weak in man coverage as well.

The Bills should have a similar game plan to last year’s playoff game and target Kincaid. We could even see running back Ty Johnson run some routes against the linebackers.

Key matchup: Bills defensive coordinator Bobby Babich vs. QB Bo Nix

Bills coach Sean McDermott and defensive coordinator Bobby Babich are doing their finest work this season with the defense. It has had injury issues upfront and is being pieced together by retread players such as 34-year-old safety Jordan Poyer and cornerback Tre’Davious White, who has a long injury history. But what they lack in athleticism, they make up for with knowledge of the system and savvy. The Bills are disguising at a high level and constantly breaking tendencies. It’s hard to get a bead on what they are doing with their pre-snap movement.

Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars’ passing game were on a tear coming into the postseason. The Bills held them to 7 points in the first half, but Poyer was hurt late in the second quarter. Poyer’s injury limited what they could do from an exotic coverage standpoint, but with more practice time with his replacement, Jordan Hancock, the Bills should be able to crank the dial up with their disguises more.

6:48 remaining in the third quarter, first-and-10

Here, the Bills initially showed two-high coverage with both safeties sitting deep.

After the snap, Hancock rotated down, making it appear the defense had rotated into a one-high coverage. Lawrence thought he would have tight end Brenton Strange open down the seam, but the Bills actually rotated a different two-high coverage than the initial look. They played inverted Cover 2 toward Strange’s side, meaning White was playing a deep half rather than staying outside.

White was able to run underneath Strange and nearly pick off the pass.

Bo Nix has struggled against disguised coverages this season. According to Pro Football Focus, when Nix faced two-high switching to one-high coverage rotations, his EPA per dropback was -0.26. Against one-high switching to two-high coverage rotations, his EPA per dropback was -0.02. To put that in perspective, Tennessee Titans quarterback Cam Ward ranked 33rd in EPA per dropback among qualifying quarterbacks, and it was -0.15. Nix’s performance dips significantly against disguised coverages, and the Bills disguise on 40 percent of snaps (league average is 33 percent).

Although the point has been made ad nauseam, it’s imperative the Broncos run the ball efficiently and keep Nix out of third-and-long situations where the Bills can get exotic. The Bills have statistically one of the worst run defenses in the league all season, but they’ve had some spike games when some of their run blitzes and line games hit home. The Jaguars did a good job using motion to displace them, and their running backs ran for 121 yards on 15 carries (8 yards per carry). They should have run the ball more.

The Broncos rank 12th in rushing success rate and explosive run rate. They are better than average at running the ball, but I’m not sure I’d trust them to dominate and completely take the ball out of Nix’s hands. If the game becomes a high-scoring one and they get into a passing script, how Nix can decipher the Bills’ disguised coverages will be key.

Houston Texans at New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET Sunday)

Key matchup: RB Rhamondre Stevenson vs. LB Henry To’oTo’o

Last week, for the Steelers-Texans game, I highlighted Pittsburgh running back Kenneth Gainwell’s matchup with Houston linebacker Henry To’oTo’o, who is a hyperaggressive player against the run but can struggle against the pass. Gainwell ended up converting six targets for four catches and 26 yards. He led the Steelers in catches and was tied for second in receiving yards. He was a big part of the Steelers’ game plan. He was open on several plays and dropped a pass, but ultimately, he had to chip the Texans’ ends on too many plays and couldn’t free release.

There aren’t many weaknesses in the Texans defense, and they have matchup advantages across the board against the New England Patriots’ pass catchers. Running back Rhamondre Stevenson had his most productive game as a receiver last week against the Los Angeles Chargers, catching three passes for 75 yards. Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels is one of the best at drawing up plays for pass-catching running backs.

The Patriots offensive line struggled to block the Chargers’ pass rush. The Texans’ pass rush is on an entirely different tier. Quarterback Drake Maye is going to have to get rid of the ball quickly. Quick passes to Stevenson or TreVeyon Henderson running routes against To’oTo’o should be an effective tool on early downs.

Key matchup: DT Milton Williams vs. Texans interior O-line

Milton Williams, one of the Patriots’ best defenders, missed all of December with a high ankle sprain. He came back for the final game of the season, and although he still hasn’t quite looked like himself, he flashed against the Chargers, sacking Justin Herbert twice.

The Chargers have arguably the worst offensive line in football, and there were quite a few plays in which Williams wasn’t disruptive. But maybe being another week removed from his injury and two games under his belt to get into game shape, we’ll see the Williams who was dominant at the beginning of the season.

The Texans don’t have an explosive run game, but they’ve become an efficient running team after making Woody Marks the lead back and getting more entrenched in first-year offensive coordinator Nick Caley’s scheme. Against the Steelers in the wild-card round, the Texans rushed for 164 yards, averaging 5.3 yards per carry. The Texans are a below-average pass-blocking team, and their offense was able to turn the corner when they started reducing the rate at which they faced third-and-long situations.

Before Williams was hurt in Week 11, the Patriots ranked eighth in defensive rushing success rate. In the six games he missed, they ranked 31st. The Patriots need Williams to be a stalwart for their run defense against a Texans offense that wants to run the ball on early downs and reduce risk.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/15212419/USATSI_25173167-scaled-e1768530292662.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:37.303706

They lost two every-down starters in that a game, major blows to their future playoff prospects. Linebacker T.J. Edwards suffered a fractured fibula and is done for the postseason. So is left tackle Ozzy Trapilo, who ruptured his patellar tendon late in the game. Both guys were moved to injured reserve earlier this week.

D’Marco Jackson is set to step in for Edwards, as he did last week, and Theo Benedet should take over for Trapilo. Veteran left tackle Braxton Jones was activated on injured reserve earlier this week and should be a backup.

Defensive back C.J. Gardner-Johnson will return after missing the wild-card game while in the concussion protocol. He has cleared it now and will return to the field in what will likely be split duty with Kyler Gordon in the slot, tough Gardner-Johnson alluded to the prospect of them playing together in the dime package.

Experts weigh in on 'crackpot' theory,Evan Webeck,,,,,https://www.mercurynews.com/2026/01/16/49ers-injuries-power-plant-theory-electromagnetic-waves/,"The low-frequency electromagnetic waves produced by a power plant neighboring Levi’s Stadium are apparently to blame for the 49ers’ injury woes, a recent viral social media thread alleges.
“There is definitely at least basic science research that suggests electromagnetic fields can potentially help healing,” Pandya said.
The theory, which claims “low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage,” has spread as far as the Niners locker room.
Wide receiver Kendrick Bourne quipped recently, “Yeah, it’s that power plant,” when he was asked about the toll of the team’s trouble staying healthy.
The city considered moving the power plant when Levi’s Stadium was constructed but opted only to reconfigure it at the same location.","The list of players who have ended up on the injured reserve in recent years is so long, so star-studded that the San Francisco 49ers faithful have had it.

They’ve resorted to online conspiracy theories.

The low-frequency electromagnetic waves produced by a power plant neighboring Levi’s Stadium are apparently to blame for the 49ers’ injury woes, a recent viral social media thread alleges. There is, in fact, some basis to the idea that electromagnetic waves can affect the human body, explained Dr. Nirav Pandya.

As a sports orthopedic surgeon at UC San Francisco, he has used them before. To help treat injuries, ranging from rotator cuff tears to bone fractures.

“There is definitely at least basic science research that suggests electromagnetic fields can potentially help healing,” Pandya said. “Unless you’re sitting in a lab and overexposing yourself, the (idea) that it would be detrimental and affect an entire team would be pretty remarkable.”

That is, however, precisely the premise of an idea that has taken hold among fans — and some players — of one of the NFL’s most injury-riddled teams.

After George Kittle became the latest 49ers star to see his season ended by injury, tearing his Achilles in their wild-card round win at Philadelphia, a post on the social media site X tying the team’s injury woes to a “massive electrical substation” next to their stadium and practice fields gained traction. It echoed a post from another user in October that was quickly shot down.

As of this writing, the post by Peter Cowan, a wellness entrepreneur with about 6,000 followers and a Substack blog, had been seen by 22 million users, garnered 35,000 likes and been reposted more than 5,800 times. He previously used the profile mostly to promote his app that hails the healing properties of sunlight.

The theory, which claims “low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage,” has spread as far as the Niners locker room. Wide receiver Kendrick Bourne quipped recently, “Yeah, it’s that power plant,” when he was asked about the toll of the team’s trouble staying healthy.

What “scares” Dr. Michael Hoff isn’t whether Cowan is right or wrong, he said, “I think crazy theories are fine. … But like, the fact that the rest of the world kind of goes, ‘Oh, maybe that’s true.’ That’s a scary thing. But that’s more about the internet.”

As the director of diagnostic medical physics in UCSF’s radiology department, Hoff called the idea “very, very crackpot” but he added, “That’s not to say something that hasn’t been proven doesn’t exist.”

Huff identified two “huge jumps” Cowan makes in his claim.

First, he questioned Cowan’s method of measurement. The earth’s magnetic field ranges from 250-650 milligauss (mG). Cowan uses a device that recorded a reading of around 8.5-9.0 mG above normal from the perimeter of the Niners practice facility, a hundred yards or so from the power plant. That amounts to a “tiny, tiny little extra amount of magnetic field,” Hoff said.

“Second of all, even if you multiplied it by a million and centered it in Levi’s Stadium, would it even damage tissue? There’s no evidence of that, either.”

According to the World Health Organization, “most scientists and clinicians agree that any health effects of low-level electromagnetic fields, if they exist at all, are likely to be very small compared to other health risks that people face in everyday life.”

Dr. Joel Moskowitz, a UC Berkeley researcher who serves on the International Commission on the Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, acknowledged that the theory laid out by Cowan is “not the most likely risk factor” to the 49ers’ injuries but wasn’t willing to write it off.

“I believe there is some credence to this theory,” he said. “Conventional wisdom is that none of this stuff can harm you, but that’s just BS in my point of view.”

While the EPA states “scientific studies have not consistently shown whether exposure to any source of EMF increases cancer risk,” Moskowitz cited a study that found increased leukemia risk in children at exposures as low as 4.0 mG and pointed to a meta-analysis of 345 studies since 1990 that found “significant adverse effects from exposure to … extremely low frequency and static electromagnetic fields.”

Most of the work, however, pertains to cancer risk. There is less evidence to back up Cowan’s claim that “the magnetic fields pouring out of the substation … trigger a multi-pathway assault on collagen,” weakening tendons and soft tissue.

Injury data does back up what we’ve seen with our own eyes: The Niners have been one of the least-healthy teams in the NFL. According to Sports Info Solutions’ analysis, only the Cardinals and Commanders were more impacted by injuries this season. Dating back to 2016, the year before Kyle Shanahan was hired as head coach, the 49ers’ 1,970 cumulative games lost on IR are the most in the NFL, according to analysis TruMedia conducted for SFGate.

However, when San Francisco made the Super Bowl in 2023-24, it was one of the league’s healthiest teams. And some of the team’s most serious losses, whether it be Fred Warner’s broken ankle or Brock Purdy’s turf toe, “have nothing to do with collagen or soft tissue,” Pandya, the orthopedic surgeon, said. “It’s football. It’s violent.”

Shanahan’s smash-mouth style on offense — and a defense focused on reacting and tackling at maximum effort — is one reason some have speculated could lead to injury. Players themselves cited turf issues at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium for a game that saw two 49ers tear their ACLs. San Francisco ranked eighth overall out of 32 teams on the NFL Players’ Association’s latest satisfaction survey, but its training room and training staff received the worst marks, both among the bottom third in the league.

The substation, which is owned and operated by Silicon Valley Power, has been there since 1986, three years before the team moved its headquarters and practice facility to the same site. The city considered moving the power plant when Levi’s Stadium was constructed but opted only to reconfigure it at the same location.

Former 49ers Jon Feliciano and Taybor Pepper have said the nearby substation had been a topic of discussion in the locker room long before Cowan’s post on Jan. 6, and Bourne made it clear that the current group has at least seen the recent discourse online. The Washington Post surveyed about two dozen NFL agents this week, roughly one-third of whom reported hearing concerns from their clients about the power plant.

With an NFC divisional playoff showdown set for Saturday in Seattle, the 49ers will be without Kittle, All-Pro defensive end Nick Bosa and in all likelihood Warner, in addition to a handful of other onetime starters. At least wide receiver Ricky Pearsall, who missed last week’s game with a nagging PCL strain, is trending toward returning against the Seahawks.

As for the unlikely explanation for why the 49ers will be so undermanned, the organization declined to weigh in. The City of Santa Clara, which owns Silicon Valley Power, did not respond to requests for comment.

“It’s just so hard to make the argument that this is the sole reason why they have more injuries,” Pandya said of the substation theory. “Particularly when there’s not even basic science data that suggests that this level of exposure could cause it.”",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BNG-L-49ERS-0112-4.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-16 17:04:13.930067

As with most linebacker ankle injuries, the concern is reduced mobility and ability to change direction.","As the NFL divisional round approaches, injuries are playing a major role in shaping each matchup. Several key starters and important depth players for the Saturday match-up are either sidelined or fighting through lingering issues. These injury reports give a clearer picture of who will be available and how each team may need to adjust its game plan.

Buffalo Bills

Maxwell Hairston – CB (Ankle) – OUT

Hairston injured his ankle late in the regular season and was unable to return to practice this week, leading to his official ruling out. The injury likely occurred in coverage when he was forced to plant and change direction, a common mechanism for ankle sprains in defensive backs. His absence removes a rotational corner and forces Buffalo to lean more heavily on younger or less experienced depth in sub-packages, which could be tested by Denver’s outside receivers.

Jordan Poyer – S (Hamstring) – OUT

Poyer’s hamstring injury has lingered, and the team opted not to push him in a short playoff week. Hamstring strains are especially problematic for safeties, as their role requires repeated sprinting, sudden stops, and lateral movement. Without Poyer, the Bills lose a key communicator and stabilizing presence in the secondary, increasing the risk of coverage busts and reducing reliability in run support.

Ty Johnson – RB (Ankle) – QUESTIONABLE

Johnson tweaked his ankle during late-season action and has been limited in practice, creating uncertainty about his availability and workload. An ankle injury can limit explosion and cutting ability, which are critical to his role as a change-of-pace back. If he is inactive or limited, Buffalo’s backfield rotation tightens, putting more pressure on the starters and reducing flexibility in pass protection and screen concepts.

Curtis Samuel – WR (Elbow) – QUESTIONABLE

Samuel has been dealing with an elbow issue that surfaced in practice and has restricted his reps. Elbow injuries can affect both catching reliability and willingness to engage in contact over the middle. If Samuel cannot go or is limited, the Bills lose a versatile weapon who is often used on jet motion, short crossers, and gadget plays, shrinking the playbook and making the offense easier to predict.

Ed Oliver – DT (Biceps) – QUESTIONABLE

Oliver suffered a biceps strain, most likely while engaging blockers in the trenches, and his participation has been limited. For an interior defensive lineman, arm strength and leverage are essential, and a compromised biceps can significantly reduce effectiveness. If Oliver is limited or out, Buffalo’s interior pass rush suffers, giving Denver’s quarterback more room to step up in the pocket.

Terrel Bernard – LB (Calf) – QUESTIONABLE

Bernard is dealing with calf tightness, an injury that often arises from overuse or sudden acceleration. Calf injuries can linger and limit range of motion, particularly in lateral pursuit. His potential absence would thin Buffalo’s linebacker rotation and weaken coverage against tight ends and running backs in the short passing game.

Damar Hamlin – S (Pectoral) – QUESTIONABLE

Hamlin injured his pectoral muscle, typically the result of contact or tackling impact, and has been limited in practice. A pectoral injury can affect tackling strength and ability to engage blockers. If he is limited or unable to go, Buffalo loses depth and physicality at safety, which could be exposed in Denver’s run game and play-action concepts.

Denver Broncos

Krull suffered a foot injury and was unable to practice, leading to his designation as out. Foot injuries for tight ends are especially challenging given the position’s dual blocking and receiving responsibilities. His absence reduces Denver’s depth in heavy packages and limits their ability to rotate tight ends to keep players fresh in the run game.

Drew Sanders – LB (Ankle) – OUT

Sanders injured his ankle, likely in traffic or while changing direction in pursuit, and has not been able to return. Ankle injuries significantly affect a linebacker’s ability to fill gaps and drop into coverage. Without Sanders, Denver loses athleticism and flexibility at the second level, which could be problematic against Buffalo’s spread formations and running back routes.

San Francisco 49ers

Ji’Ayir Brown – S (Hamstring) – OUT

Brown strained his hamstring, an injury commonly sustained during sprinting or sudden acceleration in coverage. Hamstrings are notoriously slow to heal and easily re-aggravated, making it risky to rush a player back. His absence reduces San Francisco’s flexibility in sub-packages and places more responsibility on the remaining safeties to handle deep coverage and run support.

Fred Warner – LB (Ankle) – OUT

Warner’s ankle injury is a major blow, as he is the emotional leader and on-field quarterback of the defense. The injury likely occurred in traffic or while planting to change direction, and the team has chosen not to risk further damage. Without Warner, the 49ers lose elite range, diagnostic ability, and communication in the middle of the defense, which can lead to misalignments and softer coverage against tight ends and crossing routes.

Jacob Cowing – WR (Hamstring) – QUESTIONABLE

Cowing is managing a hamstring issue that limited his practice reps throughout the week. As a speed-based receiver, any hamstring tightness directly impacts his effectiveness and ability to separate. If he cannot play, the 49ers lose a vertical and motion threat, narrowing the spacing of the offense and making coverage assignments easier for Seattle.

Luke Gifford – LB (Quadriceps) – QUESTIONABLE

Gifford is dealing with a quad injury, typically caused by overextension or direct contact. Quadriceps injuries can reduce power and burst, which are critical for special teams and rotational linebacker duties. If he is limited or inactive, San Francisco’s depth in the linebacker room becomes even thinner with Warner already out.

Ricky Pearsall – WR (Knee) – QUESTIONABLE

Pearsall has knee soreness that has restricted his workload in practice. Knee issues can affect cutting, route precision, and confidence when planting. If he cannot go or is limited, the 49ers lose another young receiver in the rotation, putting more pressure on the starters and reducing flexibility in three- and four-receiver sets.

Dee Winters – LB (Ankle) – QUESTIONABLE

Winters is nursing an ankle injury that has limited his reps. Like Sanders in Denver, ankle injuries for linebackers can be especially problematic because of the need for lateral movement and sudden direction changes. If Winters is unavailable, San Francisco’s linebacker depth is stretched dangerously thin, increasing the risk of fatigue and missed assignments.

Seattle Seahawks

Elijah Arroyo – TE (Knee) – OUT

Arroyo suffered a knee injury that has kept him out of practice, leading to his designation as out. Knee injuries often affect stability and leverage, which are essential for tight ends in blocking situations. His absence reduces Seattle’s ability to run two-tight-end sets and limits options in the short and intermediate passing game.

Josh Jones – OL (Knee) – OUT

Jones injured his knee and will miss the game, forcing Seattle to reshuffle its offensive line. Knee injuries for linemen are particularly disruptive because they affect anchor strength and lateral movement. Without Jones, Seattle may be forced to start a backup or move personnel around, increasing the risk of protection breakdowns against San Francisco’s pass rush.

Chazz Surratt – LB (Ankle) – OUT

Surratt’s ankle injury has sidelined him for the Divisional Round. As with most linebacker ankle injuries, the concern is reduced mobility and ability to change direction. His absence weakens Seattle’s depth in the middle of the defense and puts more strain on the remaining linebackers to handle both run fits and coverage responsibilities.

Sam Darnold – QB (Oblique) – QUESTIONABLE

Darnold strained his oblique muscle, an injury often caused by rotational stress during throwing. Oblique injuries can affect throwing power, accuracy, and overall comfort in the pocket. Even if he plays, Seattle may limit the game plan to shorter throws and quicker reads, which could restrict the offense and make it easier for the 49ers’ defense to anticipate play calls.

Conclusion

In the playoffs, every absence is magnified, and even one missing player can change the tone of a game. Teams with better health and depth will have a clear advantage as the competition tightens. Ultimately, how well coaches adapt to these injuries could be the difference between moving on and going home.",https://www.thebiglead.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/USATSI_27927076_168396005_lowres.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 16:01:53.168981

In their last meeting, Seattle held the Niners to three points, Shanahan's fewest in a game since Week 1, 2017, and 173 total yards, the fewest in the coach's career. Seattle has been able to slow down the 49ers' run game while playing two-deep safeties to take away deep passes.

The 49ers are 7-1 since Purdy returned from injury that cut out the middle of his campaign. The only loss came in Week 18 to the Seahawks. From Weeks 11-17, he generated a 111.5 passer rating, but has just a 73.1 passer rating over his last two tilts versus Seattle and Philadelphia.

""It's going to take an exceptional effort on our part to give ourselves a chance,"" Bears defensive coordinator Dennis Allen said, via the Chicago Sun-Times.

In the Rams' wild-card win over Carolina, Nacua and Adams combined for 15 catches, 183 receiving yards and a touchdown. Nacua posted 10 grabs for 111 yards and the score on 18 targets. Adams, in his first game back after missing three tilts with a hamstring injury, snagged just 5 of 13 targets but generated 72 yards.

Nacua is the key to the L.A. offense, leading the NFL with 129 catches in 2025 and finishing second in the league with 1,715 yards. The powerful wideout's ability to make contested catches, coupled with his run-after-catch ability, makes him a handful for any defense. The only time Nacua faced an Allen-led defense, in 2023 against the New Orleans Saints, he put up 164 yards and a TD on nine grabs.

""You come away from there thoroughly impressed,"" Allen said of Nacua. ""He runs as fast as he needs to to get the job done. He's big, he's physical. He catches everything that's remotely close to him and he's tremendous with the run after the catch. I just think he does everything that you want a receiver to be able to do.""

Nacua's fearlessness at the point of attack and sticky hands leads to some ridiculous catches. He's also a bully with the ball in his hands and is faster on the field than his 4.57-yard 40 time indicates.

""He might not be the fastest, but he's damn sure one of the toughest,"" cornerback Chauncey Gardner-Johnson said.

Chicago knows Adams' ability well from his time in Green Bay. Only Calvin Johnson Jr. has more receiving touchdowns (11) than Adams (10) against the Bears in the Super Bowl era. Adams led the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns despite missing the final three games of the season. He's a weapon in the red zone that Chicago must keep out of paydirt Sunday.

Asked previously who needs to step up if Collins can't suit up, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said: ""Whoever is open, baby.""","Three must-know storylines

Maye faces his toughest challenge yet. Drake Maye has had an MVP-caliber second season, and he rebounded from a slow start last week to finish strong in a win over the Chargers. But Maye arguably faces his toughest test of his season with the Texans' defense, which ranked top three in the regular season in points per game allowed (17.4), yards per game allowed (277.2) and takeaways (29). Houston dominated the Steelers in last week's 30-6 win. The Texans are sure to take note of Maye's struggles when the Chargers went man coverage, completing only 1 of 7 passes for 7 yards while taking three sacks, per Next Gen Stats. Houston played man slightly less than the league average in the regular season at 25.2% of the time. But when the Texans went man against the Steelers on Monday, Aaron Rodgers was only 1 for 6 passing for 4 yards and a sack. The Patriots' offensive line, with two rookies starting, will have its hands full with an elite rush unit led by Will Anderson Jr., Danielle Hunter and Sheldon Rankins. Maye has an escape hatch with his running ability, and the Texans have occasionally struggled with running quarterbacks, even while keeping Josh Allen and others in check. But Maye also has receiving threats on all three levels. Kayshon Boutte and Kyle Williams are deep threats. Stefon Diggs and Hunter Henry often patrol the intermediate part of the field. And the Patriots have a strong short passing game, with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson getting more in on the fun, in addition to what they offer in the run game. Stevenson has especially been a weapon down the stretch, but the Texans have bottled up some quality backs this season.

Stroud hoping for bounce-back effort against reenergized Patriots D. C.J. Stroud was starting his fifth career postseason game Monday against the Steelers, which is why it was surprising he appeared spooked at times during a three-turnover performance. Stroud fumbled five times (losing two) and threw his first red-zone interception since 2023 in the win, thankfully bailed out by his team's dominant defense. Stroud also had some good moments in the game, but he'll need to have a far cleaner outing against a Patriots defense that mercilessly pressured Justin Herbert last week. Since getting Milton Williams back, the Patriots' pass-rush unit has appeared significantly more impactful, and they're also deeper and healthier at linebacker. Stroud's ballhandling issues were out of character, but the least he can do is get more in sync with center Jake Andrews; three of the fumbles came on shaky snaps. What steadied Houston's offense against the Steelers was a strong game from running back Woody Marks, who ran for 112 yards and put the game away with his fourth-quarter touchdown. The Texans run-blocked effectively, with only one negative-yard run, and were able to offset the inconsistent passing game. The Patriots' run defense has been very solid, especially since the return of Williams and Jack Gibbens, who had seven tackles on only 14 defensive snaps last week. If Marks can't get loose, the onus would shift back to Stroud to make plays. Staying patient against the Patriots, who don't allow a lot of big plays, might be the key, although they've shown more willingness to blitz and play more man coverage later in the season.

Injury robs viewers of great head-to-head matchup. Two star players -- Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez and Texans wide receiver Nico Collins -- were likely slated to face off head-to-head against each other quite a bit, but separate injuries clouded their respective statuses ahead of the Divisional Round. Although Gonzalez and Collins both suffered concussions during the Wild Card Round, Gonzalez came off the injury report Friday and is good to go, while Collins won't clear concussion protocol and must sit. The Patriots' defense is simply different with Gonzalez on the field, able to play more man defense when they want to, with Gonzalez often erasing his assignment. According to NGS, Gonzalez didn't allow a reception on five targets (26 coverage snaps) against the Chargers, with two passes defended. Collins, Houston's receiving-yards leader who now has been evaluated for multiple concussions in 2025, leaves a big hole by missing the contest. However, in the one regular-season game Collins missed this season prior to resting in Week 18 (Week 8 vs. San Francisco), C.J. Stroud was terrific, completing 30 of 39 passes for 319 yards, with two TDs and one pick. It was a balanced attack, too, with seven Texans catching multiple passes and no receiver having more than 69 yards. Texans tight end Dalton Schultz has been one of Stroud's most trusted pass catchers, and WR Christian Kirk had his first 100-yard game in more than two seasons on Monday and has a good postseason track record. The Texans also have leaned on Xavier Hutchinson and rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel at times. Asked previously who needs to step up if Collins can't suit up, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said: ""Whoever is open, baby.""

Darnold said he “felt a little something” in his oblique while throwing during Thursday’s practice, but he expects to play Saturday night.

“In routes on air, just kind of felt a little something in my oblique,” Darnold said. “Just didn’t want to push it. Wasn’t the day to push it. So that was it. So just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

Darnold started all 17 regular-season games for the Seahawks while helping lead them to a franchise-best 14-3 record and the NFC’s top seed. He finished eighth in the NFL in completion rate (67.7%), fifth in passing yards (4,048), tied for ninth in touchdown passes (25) and second in yards per pass attempt (8.5). He also threw 14 interceptions, which were the third-most in the league.

Darnold said he’s never experienced oblique issues before.

“We’ll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday,” Darnold said.

When asked about his chances of not being able to play, he responded: “It’s a very low percentage. Probably closer to zero.”

Seattle’s backup quarterback is Drew Lock, who has made 28 starts over his seven-year NFL career.

Lock, a 2019 second-round draft pick by the Denver Broncos, spent his first three seasons in the Mile High City before arriving in Seattle as part of the Russell Wilson trade in March 2022.

Lock then spent the next two seasons backing up former Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith, which included two starts in 2023 when Smith was sidelined with an injury. In the latter of those two starts, Lock led a dramatic game-winning drive against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday Night Football.

Lock signed with the New York Giants in 2024 with the hope of earning their starting job, but ended up making just five starts. He returned to Seattle last April on a two-year, $5 million deal.

Lock has completed 2 of 3 passes for 15 yards this season, with all three pass attempts coming in the latter stages of a Week 3 rout of the New Orleans Saints.

“Drew’s been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,” Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said. “A lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.”

What the Bills need to do to win: Keep winning short-yardage situations. The tush push on fourth down that propelled Josh Allen 10 yards and helped secure Buffalo’s win over Jacksonville last weekend epitomised how the Bills dominated the game’s crucial moments. The Bills converted four of their five third downs with four yards or to go last Sunday, and they finished fifth in third-down rate in the regular season in the same situations. Denver were eighth this season in third-and-short defensive efficiency (50.6%). Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady will have to find ways to create leverage for Allen and the Bills in those vital moments to keep the scoreboard moving.

What the Broncos need to do to win: Copy the Jaguars (except the losing part). If James Cook, this season’s best running back, had been allowed to take off last Sunday, Jacksonville wouldn’t have kept the game so close. Cook’s meagre 46 yards on 15 carries meant the Jags almost pulled off the victory. Buffalo may struggle to establish the ground game even more against the Broncos: they lost their two best run-blocking receivers toACL tears against the Jags, Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers. Not that the Broncos’ rock-solid front needs too much help: they gave away the second-fewest rushing yards per game this season (91). If Allen is forced to throw, Sean Payton’s defense can feast. They have the most sacks and the highest rate of QB takedowns (68 at 9.7%) and allow the second-lowest pass completion rate (57.8%). Former Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib, who won a Super Bowl with Denver, is confident: “They sending Superman home,” he said this week.

Key player: Nik Bonitto, edge, Broncos. Bonitto has cemented his status as an elite pass rusher with two brilliant seasons in Denver, earning 13.5 sacks in 2024 and 14 in 2025. He has the power to hustle, harass and help show Allen the door.

Prediction: Bills over Broncos.

San Francisco 49ers v Seattle Seahawks (Saturday 8pm ET/Sunday 1am GMT)

What the 49ers need to do to win: Show no fear. San Francisco rolled into Philadelphia with a litany of injuries and proved that this team are so much more than the sum of their parts. You no longer feel that a key figure such as George Kittle landing on injured reserve with a torn achilles will slow them down. Adversity just keeps knitting them tighter together, so much so that, against the Eagles, journeyman receiver Demarcus Robinson produced his first 100+ receiving yard-game since November 2022. A large part of the 49ers’ fight comes from the ultimate underdog quarterback, Brock Purdy. His never-say-die attitude was crucial as he shook off two interceptions and backed his deep ball over a fierce Eagles secondary. If they bring the same fearless attitude to Seattle they can handle Sam Darnold, who says he will play despite being listed as questionable with an oblique injury.

What the Seahawks need to do to win: With Trent Williams back in at left tackle for the 49ers, the Seahawks will have a fight on their hands after a fairly straightforward 13-3 win over San Francisco in Week 18 of the regular season. A clear path to victory though lies behind punishing the 49ers’ weak run defense. In the Week 18 win, Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet’s combined 171 yards rushing yards were essential to keeping the Seahawks’ offense on the field as they chewed up the clock. The pressure told on Purdy, who had limited time to score while facing Seattle’s formidable defense.

Key player: Devon Witherspoon, CB, Seahawks. Witherspoon does everything brilliantly, though you may not always know it as quarterbacks often avoid throwing in his direction. Behind Witherspoon, the Legion of Boom 2.0 conceded the fewest points per game in the regular season (17.2).

Prediction: Seahawks over 49ers (all bets are off if Darnold doesn’t play though).

Houston Texans v New England Patriots (Sunday 3pm ET/8pm GMT)

What the Texans need to do to win: The Texans will expect their defense to make the Patriots suffer. Their offense is less of an asset and lost its best receiver, Nico Collins, to a concussion against Pittsburgh on Monday. Surprisingly, veteran receiver Christian Kirk stepped to lead the Texans to victory after doing next to nothing all season. Kirk made eight grabs for 144 yards and a touchdown and rapidly became Houston’s lone star on offense. In a perfect world, Collins makes it through concussion protocol – although that looks unlikely – if not Kirk needs to continue to do the heavy lifting.

What the Patriots need to do to win: Attack Houston’s offensive line. The Patriots knew they had a huge advantage over the Chargers’ wafer-thin pass protection, and they subjected Justin Herbert to six sacks, 16 pressures and 11 hits. The Patriots need to blitz CJ Stroud as much as possible to force the quarterback into mistakes. The Texans’ offensive line had the 22nd-ranked pass block grade from Pro Football Focus this season. After dominating the Chargers, defensive end Milton Williams needs to be relied on once more to make sure the Patriots punch their ticket to the AFC championship game.

Key player: Rhamondre Stevenson, RB, Patriots. Stevenson may not own the top spot in New England’s backfield for much longer but he showed how vital his versatility as a runner and receiver is in the win over the Chargers. He had 75 yards on three receptions while accounting for 30% of New England’s total offensive output. He is a workhorse whose all-round abilities will be crucial in trying to outfox Houston’s brutal defense.

Prediction: Patriots over Texans.

Los Angeles Rams v Chicago Bears (Sunday 6.30pm ET/11.30pm GMT)

What the Rams need to do to win: The Bears love a comeback, so Sean McVay needs to use every play he has secreted away while leaning on his vast array of offensive weapons. Wringing every last drop of production from Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua is the first step to blowing the Bears out of the water. Stafford targeted Nacua 18 times against the Panthers last weekend, so he should at least be aiming for more than 20 on Sunday. When the Panthers didn’t show Nacua special attention he pulled off a string of chunk plays. He was also deployed as a runner, and bulldozed through three defenders for a touchdown. The Bears will always believe they can dig out a victory so the Rams should give them no hope whatsoever by spamming Nacua’s involvement until Chicago break.

What the Bears need to do to win: Ben Johnson needs to be prepared for the Rams’ pass rush. Los Angeles have a key member of their secondary back: Quentin Lake, who freezes quarterbacks into holding the ball so that McVay’s heavy hitters, Jared Verse, Byron Young and Kobie Turner, can make a decisive sack. Johnson needs to scheme up the offense so they don’t get that chance. He should spotlight the out-of-structure playmaking of Caleb Williams – whose sack rate has dropped from 10.8% as a rookie to 4% this season – to stay one step ahead while using large doses of play action to draw the sting from blitzes. Williams needs to stay on his feet to get the ball out to his receivers who excel in yards after the catch. Rookie tight end Colston Loveland could be a huge headache for the Rams if he gets the targets.

Key player: Montez Sweat, DE, Bears. The defensive lineman is surging at just the right time for Chicago. His three hits on Jordan Love earned him the game ball in the win over the Packers. The Bears need all of that and a few sacks to mitigate the danger of Stafford’s incredible array of receiving weapons.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3866fe55361a7d1735aa82e666432a472b51ce21/69_55_4931_3945/master/4931.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=595a6c28b601ae1e5799f30d7c067420",N,,2026-01-16 13:02:39.716120

Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins remains in concussion protocol and missed Thursday’s media session, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander.

Collins is unlikely to play in Sunday’s divisional round game against the New England Patriots because of the steps needed to clear concussion protocol.

Collins suffered the concussion in Monday’s wild-card 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards in the game before going down.

If Collins cannot go, expect Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins, and Dalton Schultz to see an increase in targets. Jaylin Noel, Xavier Hutchinson and Cade Stover could also see an increased role.

Patrick Mahomes said Thursday the doctors have been holding him back a bit in his rehab because he’s been pushing hard as he recovers from the knee injury he suffered late in the season.

The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback set a hopeful timeline for when he’ll be ready to go as he addressed reporters while he continues to work on getting back to full strength.

The one-score games they won in 2024, which helped them to a Super Bowl appearance, turned out to be defeats in 2025. Too many dropped passes and other silly mistakes cost the team multiple times.

""I think just compounding mistakes,"" Mahomes said when asked what went wrong in 2025. ""You make mistakes throughout a game. For myself, I look at some of the red zone interceptions I threw in kind of bigger moments in the third and fourth quarter of games. That’s stuff that I haven’t done in the past, and so speaking for myself, just trying to be better in those moments. I think offensively we weren’t consistent enough throughout games. We had stretches in games where we played good, we had stretches in the season where we played really good.

""We’ve got to be better and that starts with me and then it kind of has to feed throughout the entire offense. So, I think like I said, guys are motivated, coaches, players, we’re all motivated to be better this next year. Like I said, it sucks watching these games. I want to be out there playing football, especially this time of year, it’s the best time of year to play football. It’ll give us the motivation, hopefully, for us to come back stronger next year.""

The relative parity in the league paved the way for tightly contested matchups in the wild card round. But ultimately six teams were sent packing and now we get to see the remaining eight, including the two top seeds, duke it out for spots in the conference championship games.

Here are the games we’ll be watching:

Saturday

Sunday

Last weekend, we learned a lot about the teams that prevailed. Here are the questions that will be answered this weekend.

Can a banged-up Josh Allen survive the Broncos’ pass rush and the altitude in Denver?

Bills quarterback Josh Allen made multiple trips to the injury tent during a physical wild card game against the Jacksonville Jaguars last weekend.

Earlier this week, Buffalo’s injury report listed Allen as “foot/knee/finger,” a testament to the many bumps and bruises he’s nursing at this point in the season. He’ll play, obviously, and continue his quest to seize the moment in a Kansas City Chiefs-less playoff field to finally get his Super Bowl glory.

But, the contact-prone (and some people might say “contact-seeking”) QB will now face a defense that excels at taking down the opposition – literally. The Broncos’ 68 sacks in the regular season were 11 more than any other team and 20 more than any team that made the playoffs.

Allen, the reigning MVP, is the better QB in this matchup, having the edge over second-year Broncos signal-caller Bo Nix, whose only prior playoff start was a loss to Allen and the Bills last season. But not only will Allen face a formidable pass rush, he’ll have to travel to Denver to do so.

The Broncos are healthy, better rested after getting the bye, and for the first time in 10 years, playing a postseason game at home where their acclimation to the mile-high altitude gives them an advantage.

Can the Texans do something they’ve never done before?

The Houston Texans are the NFL’s youngest franchise. But even still, it sticks out that in every one of their prior 23 seasons, they’ve yet to appear in a conference championship game.

Over that same time frame, the Patriots, on the other hand, have played in 12 conference championship games.

This Texans team, however, enters the divisional round on an incredible run – its 10-straight victories are the longest winning streak in the NFL right now and they’re coming off a first-ever franchise playoff road victory. Houston’s defense shone in a resounding 30-6 romp over the Pittsburgh Steelers that featured two defensive touchdowns and four sacks of Aaron Rodgers.

To make franchise history, though, they’ll have to win on the road, again, as underdogs, and potentially without Pro Bowl wide receiver Nico Collins, who is still in concussion protocol after getting injured in the wild card game.

And they’ll have to beat the possible MVP in Pats QB Drake Maye. The 23-year-old looked a little shaky in the first half of his first playoff game last weekend, but he settled down in the second half.

This New England team isn’t the same one that built a dynasty earlier in the 2000s, but taking down the Pats would still qualify as a sign that the Texans are all grown up as a team.

Can the Niners muster any offense in a rematch marred by injury?

It’s a rematch of the Week 18 showdown for the top seed in the NFC that saw the Seahawks prevail by stifling the 49ers’ offense. Seattle’s defense surrendered the fewest points in the regular season, only allowing a single field goal to San Francisco earlier this month. That victory was also part of an NFL-best 6-2 record against playoff teams.

It earned the Seahawks a week of rest while the Niners had to crisscross the country, traveling to Philadelphia for the wild card game and now back to the Pacific Northwest. After they played on Sunday last weekend, San Francisco’s head coach Kyle Shanahan implored the NFL to give his guys a full week of rest before the next round.

Instead, they’ll play Saturday – while their opponent had a bye, the Niners are stuck with a short week for the third time in the past month.

And the same offense that struggled against Seattle so recently will be even more shorthanded in this even higher-stakes matchup after losing George Kittle to a season-ending Achilles injury against the Eagles.

Of course, the injury advantage would tip back the other way if it ends up that Seahawks QB Sam Darnold, currently listed as questionable with an oblique injury, can’t play. Speaking on those reports, Darnold said “nothing to see here” and “feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

Can the Bears keep winning like this?

Last week, we wrote that if the Rams advanced, they could be the Super Bowl favorites. Advance, they did. Although the odds still give the edge to Seattle, the Rams are a very close second. Maybe they’re destined to duke it out officially against Seattle in the conference championship.

But first, they’ll serve as the proving ground for Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears to demonstrate that their high-drama overperformance is a trick that they can turn to even against formidable foes.

Against their rival Green Bay Packers, the Bears won in increasingly classic-for-them fashion. Which is to say, Ben Johnson repeatedly went for it on fourth down, which often failed in maddening fashion but worked just often enough.

On top of that, Chicago fell behind early, trailing 21-6 through three quarters, only to rally for their seventh fourth-quarter comeback of the season. Williams held on the ball for what felt like too long at times, only to rattle off the kind of under-pressure passes that showcased the rare physical tools that made him the top overall draft pick in 2024.

After last weekend, the Bears are 3-3 when trailing by 10 points or more in the final five minutes of the game. The rest of the NFL combined is 3-158. That shouldn’t be a replicable skill.

But if it is? Watch out.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26005565916878.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-16 11:04:10.106486

Darnold, the former Jets first-round draft pick and current Seahawks quarterback, popped up as a surprise name on the Seattle injury report on Thursday, two days before the Seahawks’ Saturday night home NFC divisional playoff showdown with the 49ers.

Darnold has an oblique injury and has been listed as questionable for the game.

It’s not clear when or how Darnold was injured, since Thursday was the first time such an injury was mentioned, and the Seahawks, as the No. 1 seed in the conference, had a bye last week.

Darnold wasn’t on the injury report prior to Thursday.

When speaking to reporters on Thursday, Darnold said he “felt a little something” in his oblique during practice but he expects to play Saturday night.

“[I] just kind of felt a little something in my oblique [and] just didn’t want to push it,’’ Darnold said. “It wasn’t the day to push it, so that was it. So, [I] just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

The last time Darnold played was in the Seahawks’ regular-season finale, a 13-3 win over the 49ers for the No. 1 seed at Lumen Field.

According to reports, Darnold was seen jogging on the practice field Thursday and didn’t appear to be laboring or having any trouble moving.

Seahawks backup quarterback Drew Lock got some reps with the first-team offense in practice Thursday and would start if Darnold can’t go. Rookie Jalen Milroe is the third-string quarterback and would back up Lock in that scenario.

Darnold, who completed 67.7 percent of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, led the Seahawks to a 14-3 record.

A year ago, he led the Vikings to an identical 14-3 record, throwing for 4,319 yards with 35 TDs and 12 INTs. But he flamed out in the Vikings’ one-and-done 27-9 playoff loss to the Rams, against whom he completed 25-of-40 passes with one touchdown and one interception while getting sacked nine times.

The Vikings, believing in first-round draft pick J.J. McCarthy, opted not to retain Darnold and missed the playoffs this year.

Darnold, of course, is hoping to shed the injury issue, play and atone for last season’s playoff meltdown with a win over the 49ers.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-iuo65w0x6-1768518078439.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1768500100&w=1200,N,,2026-01-16 12:03:47.246106

San Francisco 49ers star tight end George Kittle suffered a season-ending Achilles tear during 49ers’ playoff victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. He would be missing the rest of the postseason and probably some part of his 2026 campaign. It typically takes nine to twelve months for an Achilles tendon tear to repair. Just days before Kittle’s injury, a conspiracy NFL injury theory was doing cyberspace rounds. It states that the emissions of low-frequency electromagnetic fields from a substation near 49ers’ facility, has been degrading collagen, weakening tendons and causing soft tissue damage.

Achilles/patellar and hamstring/calf tears and high-ankle ligament injuries

According to a researcher Peter Cowan, a board-certified quantum biology practitioner and wellness entrepreneur, “The San Francisco 49ers are statistically the most injured team in the NFL over the past decade. Since they’ve moved to Levi’s Stadium in 2014, there have been seven to eight full Achilles/patellar ruptures, 40+ major hamstring/calf tears, and high-ankle syndesmosis [ligament] injuries every year.”

49ers players are reportedly aware of the EM fields

Cowan further re-shared Chat Sports host Chase Senior’s report on X that in early 2025, a retired 49ers guard Jon Feliciano said, “Players have joked around about there being an electrical substation right next to the practice field and how that has led to the Niners’ injury problems.” Senior further said that there have been a lot of studies how cell phones, blue tooth, wireless earbuds, etc emit a lot of EMF [electromotive force] and that it can be harmful to people.

EM field levels in the practice premises

The researcher visited the practice fields with a gauss meter [a device that measures the strength and direction of a magnetic field]. Typical background exposure is 0.5 to 3 mG. At the far edge of the practice field, the level was +8.5 mG and inside the facilities [weight room, film room, recovery areas], the level was 10 to 25 mG.

Effects of chronic ELF exposure

Degrading the collagen integrity in the players’ tendons, ligaments, and muscle-tendon junctions. The damage is subtle until a routine cut or block ends in catastrophic rupture. “The injury pattern matches the biological fingerprint of prolonged ELF [extremely low frequency] exposure documented in peer-reviewed research,” Cowan said in an X post which has generated nearabout 22 million views.

Such has been an occurrence often during Shanahan’s tenure in San Francisco.

This season alone, the 49ers lost defensive end Nick Bosa, linebacker Fred Warner and tight end George Kittle to season-ending injuries. Kittle tore his Achilles in this past Sunday’s NFC Wild Card Round win over the Philadelphia Eagles. The week prior, a theory was born.

The 49ers’ practice facility, which is next door to Levi’s Stadium, also neighbors an electrical substation. Peter Cowan, a self-proclaimed scientist, posted on X that, in his belief, the electrical substation was the reason for San Francisco’s injury outbreaks over the years.

“Chronic ELF exposure is degrading the collagen integrity in the players tendons, ligaments, and muscle-tendon junctions,” Cowan wrote as part of a thread. “The damage is subtle, until a routine cut or block ends in catastrophic rupture. The injury pattern matches the biological fingerprint of prolonged ELF exposure documented in peer-reviewed research.”

While there is no established evidence to support Cowan’s theory, per a recent report from Front Office Sports, the theory has caught on with agents around the league. The Washington Post spoke with about two dozen NFL agents. Several said that players had real concerns about it, and a couple “speculated the popularity of the theory could affect the 49ers’ ability to attract or retain free agents this offseason.”

NFL agents address 49ers injury conspiracy

“There is something there,” one agent told the Post. “Always wondered why my guys would take longer to heal [in San Francisco]. Then read this and makes sense.”

Other agents were skeptical it could impact San Francisco’s ability to do business this offseason. Trey Robinson of the AthElite agency said he conducted his own research.

“I’m not a scientist,” Robinson said. “But if there’s a way to eliminate something being an issue, we’ll take whatever steps we can to address our clients’ concerns.”

What is an undeniable fact is that the 49ers have been snakebitten by injuries. Despite that, San Francisco is one win away from the NFC Championship Game.

When Restrepo looked back at his rookie season, he said it was a learning experience.
After being inactive the first 10 weeks of the 2025 season while on the team's practice squad, Restrepo ended up playing in two games during the season.
""Work, work and more work,"" he said.
Restrepo said he got faster working with the team's strength and conditioning staff during the course of the year.","NASHVILLE – Xavier Restrepo had a legendary career at the University of Miami, where he finished as the school's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns.

It earned him All-American honors, along with plenty of other accolades.

The success didn't result in Restrepo being picked in the NFL Draft, however, and when he joined the Titans as an undrafted free agent last offseason, he had to wait a long time just to get on the field, after initially being cut.

When Restrepo looked back at his rookie season, he said it was a learning experience.

""It was very humbling,"" he said. ""But I think I learned so much through it, as far as being a pro each and every day, growing in my faith, and being ready when your time is called. And, for the most part, I think every time I stepped in the game, I was productive. I feel I took advantage of my opportunities, and that is what the NFL is about.""

But things weren't easy for Restrepo as he worked to get on the field.

And the experience has inspired him to work even harder moving forward following a season when he did plenty of soul searching, and praying.

""My faith is the only thing that kept me going,"" Restrepo said. ""My whole life story, I have always been an underdog. But it's different when you're at your dream, and your dream is so close, yet so far away. And the only thing you can rely on is your faith. Through so many prayers, and even doubt, I talked to my Lord and Savior and let Him know I was struggling with doubt and worry and this business, it's a Not For Long business. And I asked Him to give me confidence, and give me the joy of the game back, because I was losing it. I'll be honest: I was losing it.

""But me playing football again, God answered my prayers, and I am just super thankful.""

After being inactive the first 10 weeks of the 2025 season while on the team's practice squad, Restrepo ended up playing in two games during the season. Restrepo caught two passes for 26 yards in his NFL debut against the Seahawks on November 23, but the following week against the Jaguars he was carted off with an ankle injury after making one catch for 15 yards.

The lack of playing time, and final stats – three catches for 41 yards – wasn't exactly what Restrepo envisioned when he joined Tennessee, where he was initially cut out of training camp, and signed to the team's practice squad. Restrepo ended up spending the entire year on the practice squad, as he was a gameday elevation for the two games.

Earlier this month the team retained Restrepo's rights by signing him to a futures contract.

Restrepo made it clear the doubt he experienced as a rookie had nothing to do with his ability, but more with whether he'd get a chance.

As he heads into the offseason, his plan to get better – and make more a bigger impact moving forward – is hard, but simple.

""Work, work and more work,"" he said.

Restrepo said he got faster working with the team's strength and conditioning staff during the course of the year.

Restrepo was clocked at 20.1 miles per hour prior to arriving in Tennessee, but he said he ran a 21.51 after working with Zac Woodfin, director of sports performance, and John Shaw, assistant sports performance – speed training.

Restrepo, who recorded 200 receptions, 2,844 receiving yards and 21 touchdowns at Miami, said he felt like he got better as a player as well.

But there's more work that needs to be done, and Restrepo knows it.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/titans/seremrxaezic2v8chywy,N,,2026-01-15 23:58:44.968068

Mahomes said he hopes to be able to do ""some stuff"" in OTAs and ""a lot"" come training camp. The star quarterback suffered the ACL late in an eventual loss to the Los Angeles Chargers the same day the Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention and Green Bay Packers star Micah Parsons also tore his ACL. Speaking to the media Monday, Parsons also said he hoped to be back by Week 1 but ""realistically, probably like Week 3, Week 4.""

Mahomes said after suffering the injury he initially asked the Chiefs' medical staff if he could put a brace on the knee and finish the game, a request the staff denied.

Mahomes also looked back on the season as a whole as Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014 (Mahomes was a freshman at Texas Tech that year) and finished the season with a 6-11 record.

""I think just compounding mistakes,"" Mahomes said. ""You make mistakes throughout a game. For myself, I look at some of the red-zone interceptions I threw in kinda bigger moments in the third and fourth quarter of games. That's stuff that I hadn't done in the past. Speaking for myself, just trying to be better in those moments. I think offensively, we weren't consistent enough throughout games. We had stretches in games we played good, we had stretches in the season we played really good, but we gotta be better, and that starts with me and it has to feed throughout the entire offense.""

The Pro Bowl quarterback is suddenly questionable to play Saturday in Seattle’s NFC divisional playoff game against San Francisco at Lumen Field. The team listed him following practice Thursday on its official injury report for the game as having a new, oblique injury.

Darnold said he felt a pulling-like discomfort on his left, non-throwing side Thursday while throwing a pass during a no-pads practice outside. He, the team’s coaches and training personnel decided at that moment to shut him down for the rest of the practice, a move Darnold characterized as precautionary.

“Just in routes on air just kind of felt a little something in my oblique,” Darnold said following a practice he didn’t finish.

Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said veteran backup Drew Lock finished the practice with the starting offense Thursday, two days before top-seeded Seattle (14-3) hosts its rival San Francisco 49ers (13-5) in the Seahawks’ playoff opener at Lumen Field coming off a postseason bye.

“Just didn’t want to push it, wasn’t the day to push it. That was it,” Darnold said.

“So just came inside, got some rehab — and feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

This is the first time Darnold has had any issue to an oblique muscle in his side.

“It’s fun,” he said with a smile. “It’s fun. We’ll attack it in the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.”

The News Tribune asked Darnold what percentage of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers with the Seahawks two home wins from the Super Bowl.

“Very low percentage,” he said. “Probably closer to zero.”

He smiled.

Asked if he was going to be getting “around-the-clock” treatment between now and game time, Darnold said: “Yeah, we’ll be getting some treatment.

“But like I said, I feel really confident about going on Saturday.”

Kubiak, Darnold’s play caller, is keenly interested in his quarterback’s next 48 hours until kickoff against San Francisco. The team will test Darnold’s oblique with his throwing motion in pregame Saturday. The day before games are typically nothing but a walk-through of the game plan in T-shirts and ball caps. He doesn’t have to throw in that to prepare like his teammates on Friday.

“Obviously with any injury, you just want to know what the significance is,” Kubiak said.

The offensive coordinator referred all other questions and comments about Darnold’s injury to his boss, head coach Mike Macdonald. He is scheduled to next talk to the media Friday following the walk-through.

Darnold jogged from the team facility onto the practice field using a Theragun-type device on his throwing side, opposite where the oblique injury occurred early in the practice.

“Nothing to see here,” Darnold said to reporters, cheerfully.

NFL injury reports, explained

In 2016 the NFL did away with “probable” as one of the official designations on injury reports for games, which the league requires teams to submit to NFL headquarters two days before games. Since that change, any player who less than a virtual certainty to play gets listed as “questionable.” That is now the lowest designation before full go to play and a player not being on the injury report at all.

The designations for NFL injury reports are out, doubtful (75% chance he won’t play) and questionable (officially a 50% chance he won’t play). If a previously injured player is not on the injury report for a game, he’s playing.

That’s the case with Seahawks starting left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant. They’ve each missed the last three and two games, respectively, to end the regular season. But they are not on the injury report for the game Saturday. So Cross and Bryant are returning to play.

Same with linebacker Ernest Jones and cornerback Riq Woolen. Jones missed practice Tuesday and was limited Wednesday because of an unspecified illness. He was in the training room lifting weights with a mask on when practice was beginning Thursday. Yet Jones is not on the injury report, so he’s playing as usual Saturday.

Woolen was limited in practices Tuesday and Wednesday because of his own oblique issue. But Woolen is not on the injury report. He’s also full go to play.

Rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo was a full participant in practices this week coming off injured reserve. But the team added him to the game injury report later Thursday. He is out for Saturday. So is Chazz Surratt. The special-teams mainstay and former 49er is not coming off injured reserve, either. At least not yet.

Sam Darnold appeared on the Seahawks' injury report Thursday as a limited participant due to an oblique injury. This was unexpected; Darnold was off the report on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The team listed him as questionable to play in Saturday's divisional playoff game against NFC West foe San Francisco.

He later confirmed that he would indeed be suiting up against the 49ers.

""Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said today. ""Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Thursday was the final practice for the Seahawks due to the short week. They'll be at home for Saturday's game against the visiting No. 6 seed 49ers.

Seattle took care of business on the road against San Francisco the last time these two teams faced off. The Seahawks' defense held the 49ers' offense in check for a 13-3 win in Week 18.

Darnold was a steady 20 for 26 passing for 198 yards in that one. He fumbled once but it did not end in a turnover for the Seahawks.

This is the fourth time Darnold is playing his former team, but the first time in the postseason. Darnold spent the 2023 season with the 49ers on their way to an NFC title before signing with Minnesota in 2024. The Vikings and 49ers faced off in Week 2 of the 2024 season with Darnold and Minnesota earning a 23-17 win.

Saturday marks Darnold's first playoff game since the Vikings' 27-9 loss in the wild-card round of the 2024 playoffs. He struggled in that game and completed 25 of 40 passes for 245 yards, one touchdown, one interception and a fumble lost.

The Rams defense sacked him nine times in that game. He and the Seahawks will be hoping for a better result this time in the postseason.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/15/USAT/88204033007-usatsi-27893639.jpg?crop=4417,2486,x0,y225&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 20:00:19.403606

Seattle also ruled out backup offensive tackle Josh Jones (knee), rookie No. 2 tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee) and reserve linebacker/special teams stalwart Chazz Surratt (ankle). Arroyo and Surratt are working their way back from stints on injured reserve.

No other Seahawks received game status designations, which means every other player on their 53-man roster is considered healthy enough to play Saturday night.

Left tackle Charles Cross (hamstring, knee), cornerback Riq Woolen (oblique) and backup linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) were each upgraded to full participants on Thursday’s practice report after being limited on Wednesday.

Five-time Pro Bowl defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (Achilles) also was a full participant for a second straight day after opening the week as limited.

Safety Coby Bryant (knee), who has missed Seattle’s final two regular-season games, is on track to return after being a full participant all week.

49ers injury report

The 49ers ruled out four-time Pro Bowl linebacker Fred Warner, who returned to practice this week after being sidelined by an ankle injury since mid-October.

San Francisco also ruled out starting safety Ji’Ayir Brown, who injured his hamstring in this past Sunday’s wild-card playoff game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

In addition, the 49ers listed wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee), starting linebacker Dee Winters (ankle), linebacker Luke Gifford (quadriceps), and wide receiver Jacob Cowing (hamstring) are all listed as questionable. Pearsall, one of the 49ers’ top receiving threats, missed both the Week 18 loss to Seattle and the wild-card playoff win over Philadelphia.

Meanwhile, 12-time Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) doesn’t have a game status designation and was a full participant in practice the past two days. He missed the Week 18 loss to Seattle before returning to start in the wild-card round.

Saturday’s game is set for a 5 p.m. kickoff, with radio coverage on Seattle Sports beginning at 2 p.m. with the pregame show.

(AP) — Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold injured his left oblique during Thursday’s practice and was listed as questionable for Saturday’s NFC divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers, but he said he’s confident he’ll play.

Darnold said he felt something in his oblique while throwing passes to receivers with no defenders.

“Didn’t want to push it,” Darnold said. “Wasn’t the day to push it. That was it. Just came inside, got some rehab. Feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

The eighth-year quarterback said this is the first time he has dealt with an oblique issue and that he’ll be getting treatment leading up to the game. When asked about his chances of sitting out, Darnold said, “Very low percentage. Probably closer to zero.”

Darnold passed for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in his first season with the Seahawks, earning his second straight Pro Bowl selection. He led Seattle to a 14-3 record and the NFC’s top seed.

Backup Drew Lock has appeared in five games this season and attempted just three passes. Lock started five games for the New York Giants in 2024 and has 28 career NFL starts, completing 59.6% of passes with 34 touchdowns and 28 interceptions.

“Drew’s been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,” offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said. “A lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.”

Nonetheless, the Seahawks hope Lock’s services won’t be needed.

The doctor said that I could be, but I can’t predict what’s going to happen throughout the process,” Mahomes said.
Since then, he has primarily done his rehab in Kansas City under the supervision of Chiefs assistant athletic trainer Julie Frymyer, who helped Mahomes work through previous knee and ankle ailments.
Mahomes said he’s been following a rehab script set by Dr. Dan Cooper, the Dallas Cowboys team physician who performed his surgery.
Even after suffering his knee injury in December, Mahomes said he tried to talk his way back into his team’s 16-13 home loss to the Chargers.","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes says he’s targeting a Week 1 return after a knee injury ended his 2025 season.

Mahomes, speaking to reporters for the first time since he tore his ACL and LCL in a game against the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14, said Thursday that his rehab from surgery had been “going great so far.

“Obviously, I think long term, I want to be ready for Week 1. The doctor said that I could be, but I can’t predict what’s going to happen throughout the process,” Mahomes said. “But that’s my goal. And so I’ll try to prepare myself to be ready to play in that Week 1 and have no restrictions.”

Mahomes underwent surgery to repair his knee on Dec. 15. Since then, he has primarily done his rehab in Kansas City under the supervision of Chiefs assistant athletic trainer Julie Frymyer, who helped Mahomes work through previous knee and ankle ailments.

So far, Mahomes acknowledges that not every day has felt amazing. Some days, he wakes up determined to go all out during his workout. Other days, he’s just trying to get through.

On each of those days, he says, he’s been reliant on Frymyer.

“Julie has been crushing it, pushing me. And the doctor gives you goals to get to, and I just try to maximize those,” Mahomes said. “They hold me back because I always want to go a little bit further.”

Chiefs head athletic trainer Rick Burkholder said last month that a ballpark timeline for Mahomes to return was nine months.

Mahomes said he’s been following a rehab script set by Dr. Dan Cooper, the Dallas Cowboys team physician who performed his surgery. The goal is to return as quickly as possible without jeopardizing Mahomes’ long-term health.

“That’s why they give me limits to where I can push it,” Mahomes said. “Dr. Cooper, he described that to me. He said, ‘I’ll give you the limits of where you can push it to, and then it’s up to you how far you want to push it to that limit.’ And knowing me, I’m gonna push it to the exact limit every single day.”

Mahomes’ personal ambition is to do “some stuff” during May and June’s organized team activities, then “hopefully be able to do a lot” during training camp in July and August.

The next few months, meanwhile, will be different from past seasons. Mahomes typically hosts a passing camp for teammates in Texas during the NFL’s first phase of the offseason in April; because he’ll still be injured then, that voluntary program is now set to take place at the team’s facility in K.C.

Mahomes still hopes to build camaraderie with teammates during that time, whether that means being with them in the facility or going across the parking lot to attend Kansas City Royals games.

Even after suffering his knee injury in December, Mahomes said he tried to talk his way back into his team’s 16-13 home loss to the Chargers.

“When I was able to move, I asked one of the doctors if I could get a brace and just finish the game, but they wouldn’t let me,” Mahomes said. “Obviously, it kind of sunk in once the game ended, and then I was able to get the results from the MRI and stuff like that. It’s hard, but at the same time, you’ve got to flip the script fast, knowing that it’s gonna be a quick turnaround to get to the season.”

Mahomes completed 63 percent of his passes in 14 games in 2025, throwing for 3,587 yards with 22 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

He said the vision of being out there with his teammates in Game 1 next season keeps him motivated during a strenuous rehab process.

“There’s places you can’t go yet — which I want to, but I can’t go yet,” Mahomes said. “But at the same time, we’re doing it for a reason.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/15150100/GettyImages-2253282510-scaled-e1768507318677.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-15 23:00:23.027717

The injury occurred Thursday. Darnold said he ""felt a little something"" in the oblique on his left side while throwing during a routes-on-air period, and that he left practice as a precautionary measure.

""Just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said. ""Wasn't the day to push it. So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

The Seahawks listed Darnold as a limited participant.

The only other Seattle players with game designations are tight end Elijah Arroyo, linebacker Chazz Surratt and tackle Josh Jones, all backups who have been ruled out. Left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant will return after missing three and two games, respectively.

Darnold was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play Saturday.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Veteran Drew Lock is Darnold's backup. Jalen Milroe, a rookie third-round pick, is Seattle's QB3.

Darnold said he has never dealt with an oblique injury and that he'll get treatment between now and game time, adding: ""We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold, signed by the Seahawks in March after they traded Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders, is set to make the second playoff start of his eight-year NFL career. He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by coach Mike Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.

""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said. ""... We've got such great guys in that locker room, mature leaders at every position group. So everyone's just ready to go, attacking the week, per usual, and getting ready to go up against a really good 49ers team that's been rolling, and we're excited to go up against them.""

Darnold and the Seahawks beat the 49ers in Week 18 at Levi's Stadium to win the NFC West and secure the conference's top seed. With that win, Seattle finished the regular season 14-3, the same record Darnold posted last year with the Minnesota Vikings on his way to his first career Pro Bowl selection.

Darnold made the Pro Bowl again this year, completing 67.7% of his attempts for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdown passes while also leading all NFL players with 20 turnovers.

Darnold lost his playoff debut last January when he was sacked nine times in a wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He said the Week 18 win over the 49ers felt like a playoff game because of everything that was at stake and how loud the crowd was at Levi's Stadium.

The Seahawks will have home-field advantage in the rematch.

""Being able to use cadence is going to be huge, and then having our 12s there making noise when they're on offense is crucial,"" Darnold said. ""So, it's going to be an awesome atmosphere and something we're all looking forward to.""

This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017. The Seahawks' only other home playoff game since then was at the end of the 2020 COVID-19 season, when they lost in the wild-card round to the Rams in an empty stadium.

""We know Lumen's going to be rocking,"" Darnold said. ""It's an important game. We don't get it twisted at all. We understand the implications of the game. The playoffs, it's awesome to be playing in games like this, especially in January. But yeah, we're treating this week as another week and we're excited about it.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1228%2Fr1594429_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 20:00:27.982189

Shavers was injured during Sunday's wild-card round win over the Jaguars during a punt return. After being listed as questionable to return, he re-entered the game later on.

The 26-year-old out of San Diego State played all 17 regular-season games for the Bills, catching 15 passes on 23 targets for 245 yards and one touchdown. He recorded one catch for 14 yards prior to exiting the Jaguars game.

Later in the press conference, when he received yet another question about the injury and what will need to happen between now and Saturday, Darnold said, ""We'll be getting some treatment, but I feel really confident about going on Saturday… I just felt a little something and didn't want to make it worse.

The 49ers will travel to Seattle for the second round of the postseason with a trip to the NFC Championship on the line.

The biggest development of the week was the return of LB Fred Warner to the practice field. San Francisco opened Warner's 21-day practice window earlier this week after the All-Pro linebacker suffered a dislocated and broken ankle in the 49ers Week 6 loss to Tampa Bay, an injury initially expected to sideline him for the remainder of the season. Warner was a limited participant in practice and head coach Kyle Shanahan said he ""looked good"" in what he was able to do. However, Shanahan confirmed Thursday that Warner will not be activated for Saturday's game and is officially listed as OUT.

S Ji'Ayir Brown (hamstring) is also OUT after suffering his injury during the second quarter of San Francisco's Wild Card win over the Eagles in Philadelphia.

WR Ricky Pearsall (knee), LB Dee Winters (ankle), LB Luke Gifford (quadriceps), and WR Jacob Cowing (hamstring) are all listed as questionable. Pearsall, Winters, and Cowing practiced in a limited capacity throughout the week. Gifford returned to limited participation on Thursday after missing the first walkthrough and practice of the week.

The Houston Texans on the other hand, could be without Nico Collins for Sunday’s AFC Divisional Round matchup, as the Pro Bowl wide receiver missed his second straight practice due to a concussion.

Collins isn’t the only member of the Texans offense that is in danger of missing the playoff battle, as starting offensive tackle Trent Brown sat out his second consecutive session with an ankle injury.

“Houston #Texans Thursday Injury Report for the Divisional Round at the New England Patriots,” the Texans official account posted on X.

Brown had two stints with the Patriots earlier in his career, sandwiching a 2019 Pro Bowl campaign with the then-Oakland Raiders with both runs in New England.

The 32-year-old was part of the Patriots’ Super Bowl LIII-champion team before his two seasons with the Raiders.

Brown was reacquired by New England in a trade in March 2021, played three more years with the organization and signed with the Cincinnati Bengals in March 2024.

He played just three games with Cincinnati before suffering a season-ending torn patellar tendon.

Brown signed a one-year, $3 million deal with Houston last March and spent the summer on the Texans’ active/PUP list while rehabbing from his injury.

He was cut by Houston in late August but re-signed with the club’s practice squad the next day.

""Just didn't want to push it. It wasn't the day to push it,"" Darnold said, per Gregg Bell of The Tacoma News Tribune. ""So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab. I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold said he never had oblique issues before. He put a positive spin on the midweek hurdle that he's eager to clear ahead of the biggest game of his career.

""It's fun. We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday,"" Darnold said.

Darnold, a righty, explained he experienced the discomfort on his left side on a throw.

He was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers this weekend at Seattle's Lumen Field.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Darnold played all 17 games in the regular season, his first with the Seahawks after signing a three-year deal reportedly worth $100.5 million.

He picked up where he left off in Minnesota last season when he led the Vikings to a 14-3 record as a replacement for the injured J.J. McCarthy.

This time around, he became the fourth quarterback in NFL history to guide two different teams to 14-win seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Jared Goff.

Despite a league-high 20 turnovers, Darnold made the Pro Bowl. With a win over San Francisco in the regular-season finale, Seattle earned the division title and the NFC's No. 1 seed, which came with a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.

Darnold is now slated to face the resilient 49ers again. He's hoping for playoff redemption after throwing a pick, losing a fumble and being sacked nine times during the Vikings' 27-9 wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams last season.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/beCv9xn2YO20orJLfepxYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f83c21d0-e5bf-11f0-b2bf-afb15505eb98,N,,2026-01-15 20:01:11.925508

Offensive tackles Morgan Moses and Thayer Munford Jr. returned for Thursday’s practice after knee ailments kept both sidelined to begin the week.

Elsewhere in Foxborough, running back Terrell Jennings and cornerback Christian Gonzalez shed red non-contact jerseys while phasing through the NFL’s concussion protocol. Both joined a growing list of full participants that also included defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga on the heels of missing three games due to a foot issue.

Here’s the second injury report ahead of Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET divisional round at Gillette Stadium.

While head coach Mike Vrabel and the AFC East champions had a full house, the same four remained absent for the Texans. Count Collins among them. The perennial 1,000-yard receiver was carted to the locker room during Monday night’s wild card at Acrisure Stadium due to a concussion. With back-to-back missed practices logged since then, he is doubtful to be cleared in time for the No. 5 seed to visit the No. 2 seed.

As offensive bookends returned from knee injuries, a total of four Patriots went in a limited capacity on Thursday. At right tackle, Moses started and stayed in for all 64 snaps last weekend. And as an extension of the line, Munford reported as an eligible tight end on four occasions after carrying a questionable game designation.

The Patriots opened a 21-day window to return from injured reserve as Texans prep began. And Gonzalez, who was ruled out in the closing minutes of the wild card, has also graduated to full participation. The Pro Bowl corner was among a handful in all to go without restrictions on Thursday. And so was Tonga. The all-purpose nose tackle has not played a down since Week 16 and hadn’t returned to practice until sights set on the divisional round.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2254079684.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C6.4211265613046%2C100%2C78.545990303732&w=1200,N,,2026-01-15 19:01:34.449431

While Lock will have to be ready, Darnold has made it clear that he fully expects to be on the field while making his second career postseason start.","Sam Darnold has been labeled as questionable for Saturday's divisional round playoff matchup with the San Francisco 49ers. The Seattle Seahawks' starting quarterback was added to Thursday's injury report with an oblique injury.

Darnold confirmed that the injury occurred during the routes on air portion of Thursday's practice. He said he felt some discomfort on his oblique on the left side and decided not to take any risks regarding practice.

""Didn't wanna push it,"" he said after practice. ""Wasn't the day to push it. That was it. Came inside, got some rehab, and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold said that there is a ""very low percentage"" that he isn't on the field for Seattle's first playoff game.

""Probably closer to zero,"" he said with a slight smile.

Darnold, 28, has been a big key to Seattle's success this season under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Following a Pro Bowl season with the Vikings last year, Darnold was named to his second straight Pro Bowl this season after throwing for over 4,000 yards and 25 touchdowns in helping lead the 14-3 Seahawks to the NFC's No. 1 seed for the postseason.

Darnold split his two starts this season against the 49ers, throwing for less than 200 yards in both games and not throwing a touchdown pass. He didn't throw any interceptions in those games either while completing 73.5% of his passes.

If Darnold isn't able to play, the Seahawks would turn the keys of the offense over to Drew Lock, who during Thursday's practice received reps with Seattle's first-team offense. Lock, 29, is a former second-round pick who attempted just three passes during the regular season. He does have 28 career regular season starts under his belt that includes 13 starts in 2020, his second season with the Broncos.

""Drew's been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,"" Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said following Thursday's practice. ""Started a lot of football games, 28 games in the league. Lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.""
